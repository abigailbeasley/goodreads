It proved to be something of an archetype, too, with books like The Girl on the Train and The Woman in the Window cashing in on similar threats and thrills. If you’re looking for even better correlation, though, go backwards in Flynn’s own oeuvre to this one. (Please allow me a quick aside to express an unreasonable but intense dislike for that word—oeuvre. When I try to sound it out in my head, that trailing “re” throws me, like Brett Favre’s name did to the people in Something About Mary. Plus, when I try to Frenchify that opening diphthong, my internal ear hates how affected it sounds. Sorry, I guess I needed to get that off my chest.)Anyway, Sharp Objects has the same kind of feel to it as her famous bestseller. There are vivid descriptions, enough interior life written into the characters that you imagine you know them, and a screenwriter’s gift for how to set a scene. This one pulls a few surprises, too. (With some people, you come to expect the unexpected, right?) It also gives you a proper fear of Wind Gap, Missouri, where investigative journalist Camille Preaker grew up. She was working in Chicago but then returned to Wind Gap to uncover whatever she could about two girls, one murdered and the other missing. She and a police detective / love interest gathered details about the crimes which were pretty intriguing by themselves. But it was the human interest angles that gave it real life. We get a surfeit of dysfunction with this one: boozing, self-mutilation, and a rather exotic psychological syndrome.As it turns out, I had a brief encounter with Ms. Flynn’s dark side in real life about two years ago. I came away thinking her characters come by their edginess honestly. It happened when we were living in Chicago. I’d taken to looking up semi-famous residents on the internet and then jogging by their addresses, mostly just to see what their places were like, but also on the off-chance of spotting them in person. I knew where the Blackhawks’ Jonathan Toews lived, John Cusack’s building was an easy trot away, and I could locate plenty of others from business, politics, sports and the arts. Anyway, it was a cool evening in Flynn’s Lincoln Park neighborhood. I’d been by her place before—very nicely kept, tucked away behind lots of trees and a fence. In the leafless part of the year you could get a view of the house itself. That night I saw a light on and heard music, so even though I knew I probably shouldn’t, I decided to stop for a closer look. I had my hands on the iron rails of her fence, peeking in, when all of the sudden from out of nowhere something grabbed hard at my loose sleeve. It was a large, no-nonsense dog that looked to be somewhere on the Doberman - Rottweiler spectrum. Of course I pulled back right away, but he’d gotten his teeth stuck in the cloth and wasn’t about to let go. I kept yanking to no avail. My heart rate, already elevated from the run, must have doubled again. The dog, meanwhile, was growling loudly enough that Flynn came out to investigate. I wished she would have called the brute off right away, but instead she said with imposing authority, “What the hell are you doing here?”“Nothing,” I said. (Quick thinker, me.)“Well, this is private property.”“I wasn’t trying to do anything. I was just out for a run,” I said.“Seems like you’re stalking me. Do you know who I am?” I wasn’t sure if it was daggers or machetes she was staring at me. Something sharp in any case. Also she was wearing a low-cut sweater showcasing a necklace with a razor blade pendant. “Yeah,” I said, “you’re Gillian Flynn, right? The writer?” Only I messed up her name and pronounced it with a J sound.“You don’t know me well, obviously. It’s Gillian,” she said, hitting the “guh” sound hard, as in Gone Girl.“Oh, right, I should have known.” Then I thought there was a remote chance I could turn this around. “But hey, I really liked your book.”By this time Satan’s Little Helper or whatever the dog's name was had relaxed his clench so I could take back my sleeve.“OK, so you are some kind of celebrity stalker,” she said. “Pathetic. And a fool to boot. You need to get the fuck outta my yard.”With that she marched back inside. Then her dog looked over as if to say, “Take it from me, buddy, you do NOT want to get on her bad side.” I never did run by that house again. I’ll tell you what I did do, though, if you’re curious. (view spoiler)[I continued a tradition today that I started years ago with this April Fools’ Day prank post. I never did meet Gillian Flynn (though I really did run by her house once or twice). For all I know, she’s much nicer than that. At least I think she may be.

Thinking of Olive the person, to say she’s multidimensional doesn’t go far enough. IYou don’t have to love Olive Kitteridge to love Olive Kitteridge. Thinking of Olive the person, to say she’s multidimensional doesn’t go far enough. I need a new word—hyperdimensional, maybe. And she’s often at the extremes, in ways that may be positive, negative, paradoxical, or shifting. She’s the central figure in every other one of the 13 separate stories, and in the ones that focus on others she’s a secondary reference point (though hardly a fixed one). We certainly get a chance to know her many sides.Olive had taught seventh grade math at the local school in Crosby, Maine, and was well-known if not uniformly well-liked around town. People did consistently think well of her husband Henry, the friendly pharmacist and church regular, which sometimes grated on her nerves.""Never trust folks,"" Olive's mother told her years ago, after someone left a basket of cow flaps by their front door. Henry got irritated by that way of thinking. But Henry was pretty irritating himself, with his steadfast way of remaining naive, as though life were just what a Sears catalogue told you it was: everyone standing around smiling.We get a sense early on that Olive is forthright in her opinions. You could even lose the euphemism and call her blunt or abrasive:She said: ""You're the one who can't stand these Hail-Mary Catholics! Your mother taught you that! Pauline was the only real Christian in the world, as far as Pauline was concerned. And her good boy, Henry.""Then at other times she came across as kind. In one story, she met an anorexic girl who quite unexpectedly brought Olive to tears. Her empathy seemed to grow with her own later-in-life self-awareness. Sometimes, like now, Olive had a sense of just how desperately hard every person in the world was working to get what they needed. For most, it was a sense of safety, in the sea of terror that life increasingly became. People thought love would do it, and maybe it did. But […] it was never enough, was it? Olive was a fascinating character with traits that occasionally seemed at odds with one another. This, from the book, speaks to that: “She didn't like being alone. Even more, she didn't like being with people.” She was also stoic while vulnerable, unapologetic while sensitive, and perceptive about plights while blind to her own role in causing them. I could go on a lot longer identifying her quirks, but that would be very un-Strout-like of me do so. We get our impressions of each person with a wonderful economy of words. With all of Olive’s attributes I’ve mentioned, the other characters bring that many more. One thing they share is something Strout talked about afterwards:In order to imagine what it feels like to be another person I have to use my own experiences and responses to the world. I have to pay attention to what I have felt and observed, then push these responses to an extreme while keeping the story within the realm of being psychologically and emotionally true.The feeling that her characters were human and real came through on every page. And like actual people we know, their lives can’t be captured by a single tile of a mosaic. I came to really appreciate the structure of the book that had so many perspectives and viewing angles. Half an hour into the book I told my wife this seemed like a 3.5 to 4 star book—pretty good, but with a main character I thought was unidimensionally unlikeable. Half an hour later, with more tiles in place, I told her it was a 4.5 to 5 stars, and it only went up from there. It’s not a long book, but it presents its themes well. Family dynamics feature prominently. Olive and Henry’s son was an interesting result of Olive’s variability, not always a happy one. I’ve mentioned very little of the stories focusing on other people in town, but they had plenty of heft too. Grief, loneliness, love, infidelity, aging, thoughts of ending it all, and the simple challenges of everyday life—it’s all addressed with writing that’s both artful and clear.

Her collection of stories, snippets really, was short but full of creativity, and a lot of adjectives apply. Here are the ones I’ll be using (sometimes as antitheses) along with Lucifer’s definitions: Awesome - formerly, capable of producing awe; now come to mean far less due to grade inflation and overuse Claustrophobic - had Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood ever produced a child, and that child wrote a Franz Kafka knock-off about a shackled body and soul, this would be the top word on the list to describe it Clichéd - a description of work characterized by hackneyed expressions or concepts that the er has recently stopped repeating and now considers tiresome Discerning - in full agreement with the er Labyrinthine - containing one turn too many for the er to follow Laugh-out-loud funny - typically used to describe a very overt form of humor, often the kind we should be embarrassed by, like anything involving scrotums, painful falls, or stooges Masterful - having a self-perceived talent that the er hopes to reinforce through recognition of the same, but legitimate, talent in others Metaphorical - prone to a writing device whereby inherently boring topics or descriptions are jazzed up like wings drenched in hot sauce or, uh, what’s an analogy for an analogy? Nuanced - adjective to use when encountering complexity that's probably insightful but the er can only pretend to understand Outré - an intelligent sounding word when the er isn’t sure whether something’s weird for the sake of being weird or weird for a higher purpose Philosophical - as Bierce himself said, this is a quality “of many roads, leading from nowhere to nothing” Poignant - just about any emotion except joy, raised to the fourth power  Purple - (as applied to prose) label describing a writing style that in the eyes of some beholders should be attached to anything wordier than Hemingway and to other beholders that which applies only when a seemingly endless proliferation of modifiers enters injudiciously, gracelessly, and gratuitously  Sappy - prone to sweetness or sentimentalism (to be used sparingly since to serious, literary writers this is the kiss of death) Spare - a self-descriptive substitute for the word “short”, opposite in every way to “interminably elongated and ponderous” Trenchant - sarcasm trained towards proper targets (in contrast to sarcasm trained towards the er’s pet causes which would instead be described as uncouth, impertinent, or sociopathic) Wise - compared to synonyms ""smart"" and ""clever"", this is often applied prejudicially to older writers or those with an owlish countenanceThough this spare bit of writing may be short on words, it’s long on nuanced insight and pleasure. Some label this work flash fiction. Whatever it is, I think it’s masterfully written— never clichéd, never sappy. Her fragments of text were not typically LOL funny, but there were quite a few instances of knowing winks and subtle observational humor. Here’s one example:Just because you made it warm doesn't make it yours. A lesson for felines.Feline Posits: What if one makes it warm for a long time?A Response: I will still put it on the towel rack, because it is still a towel.Her writing is often described as poetic, but unlike some of her literary peers, her prose/poetry never crossed into the purple end of the spectrum. She was also adept with her similes: June was the kind of woman who not only talked to her cats, but consulted them seriously about world affairs and life changes. Mr. Pickles, she would say in that adorable voice women reserve for their cats and when they want a large favor performed. [...] Mr. Pickles, what is your opinion of the recent World Bank shake-up? The cat would look up at her, thinking for one wild moment that the tendrils of hair around her face were lizard tails.And much of her writing could be called metaphorical. She was discerning about what to include, never getting bogged down with philosophical issues (in an academic sense), but still having plenty to say in her reflections: One day, everyone stopped over-thinking. We started thinking just as much as we should, and not any more than necessary. There were no more misunderstandings whatsoever. Minor disagreements were forgotten, not turned into proof of larger things. Trivial errors of speech or judgment were just as important as items on the breakfast menu: you chose waffles and I chose eggs and it was a god damn miracle.Characters in one short piece would often show up in later pieces, not in a labyrinthine, nonlinear narrative, but because it fit their personalities. Often her little slices of life had poignant aspects; resonant and clear. Others were trenchant, sometimes claustrophobic, or perhaps a little  outré and harder to decipher. Almost all make you think, though, which leads me to believe that Gray is very clever (I might have said wise, but Lucifer advises against such usage for her youthful demographic). I’m putting this in the 4+ category. Not quite awesome awe-inspiring since not every one of her entries spoke to me, but still awfully good. [Now I need to check back with Lucifer to get his take on “awful”.]*I had originally thought to call this Steve's Book of..., then thought The Cynic's Guide to... for the anonymity, but finally settled on Lucifer's Lexicon for the alliteration and the closer correspondence to Bierce's immensely fun Devil's Dictionary....more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,not set,Jan 2018,"Mar 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6123353-am-pm

The main story takes place during a particularly dramatic window starting with his mother’s funeral, followed the next day by what he knew would be his last birthday. Cancer would see to that. The family gathered for both events. There were countless POV characters, and plenty of back-stories to fill in. One character, a half-brother their father had named Gabriel Angel (Little Angel) had a gringa mother and wasn’t raised with his siblings. Conflict was always going to be part of that story. It’s The House of Broken Angels, right?Anyway, someone had convinced Big Angel that he should keep a notebook to jot down the enjoyable things in his life. It didn’t take much space in the narrative – his entries clustered in sets of three or four and were typically only a line each – but I liked the device. He could pass this down to his family to let them know how he felt, and it tended to keep him more positive and focused on meaning. Darker family tensions came out in other ways.

(+)Big Angel’s wife and daughter were devoted and sweet. (+)When a family tie is compromised, there’s often a feeling of real hurt. (+)Generational conflicts are the younger one’s fault (well, maybe not always). This line says something about that: “They thought he was stupid, as parents often do. Well, he was stupid, as children often are.” (+)Machismo, stereotypical as it may seem, is addressed: “His father had taught him to be stoic. Pain was how a man measured his worth.” (+)The Mexican food descriptions were mouth-watering. (+)The cast of characters was so large, you’ll wish you had ancestry.com to keep track of them all. (-)Yes, the family gathering was huge, but this made the dynamics feel real, with all types represented. (+)Off to the side a bit, there was a modern-day prodigal son story. No fatted calf, though; more like KFC. (+)Another quote said, “Every man dies with secrets. Big Angel was certain a happy man was a man who died with the worst things safely hidden.” But it seemed like a lot of Big Angel’s secrets were revealed. And maybe that wasn’t so bad. (+)Emotional wounds, once the greasy, slapdash bandages are removed can be cleaned, and healing can begin. (+)“[…] rocks remember when they were mountains.” And Big Angel remembered when he was Don Corleone, James Bond, and Don Juan all rolled into one. (+)The Spanish in the book was not always basic, and you often weren’t given the context to figure it out. I even had trouble finding translations when I took the time to look. (-) The cultural education, in general, was good, though it occasionally dealt in clichés. (+)A trick someone described for dealing with a smelly situation was to stick Vicks VapoRub in your nose. A day after I read this, an article in the Trib was talking about how it’s a tradition in Latin American culture overuse the stuff. (Now see if the coincidence happens to you. These things are contagious, you know.)

It has 314,679 Goodreads ratings, 51% of which were five stars. Many fewer (5,100) have rated this earlier Verghese book. That's unfortunate. (Not the popularity of Cutting for Stone, rather the fact this fascinating memoir remains largely undiscovered). Yes, it does feature tennis, but in the same way that M*A*S*H features surgery. The principals connect through it, but you don’t have to appreciate its finer points to enjoy the story (most of which is unrelated to rackets and nets). Even so, you’d probably like the book even more if you know what a backhand is, or if you’ve heard of Arthur Ashe. The focus was squarely on the relationship between two men. One was the author, of course, an Indian doctor brought up in Ethiopia who at the time of the book was the Head of Internal Medicine at Texas Tech’s teaching hospital in El Paso. The other was one of his students, an Aussie named David. Their initial bond was a shared passion for tennis. David was the better player, and actually toured briefly as a professional. The two related to each other as foreigners, too, who had to work extra hard for their school placements. There was a symmetry to them where Verghese was the brilliant, affable teacher at the hospital and David was the talented, easy-going teacher on the court. Once their friendship was on solid footing with mutual favors and mutual respect, they began to confide in each other. Verghese talked about his marital problems and what this meant for his two young sons. David then confessed to being a recovering cocaine addict. A med student who would dare shoot up, you might ask? They’d know the devastating physical effects better than anyone, right? Well, evidently, it happens. Verghese felt that doctors, who as a rule may be more emotionally remote, more often left to their own devices to fight demons, and better able to function in denial, have their own special brand of addiction problems. Clearly, there was no shortage of conflict to drive the narrative. The most interesting parts to me, though, were Verghese’s powers of observation. A related trait that allowed him to diagnose a wide variety of illnesses from peeks and prods at the bedside made him a skilled writer with extraordinary insight into what makes people (himself included) tick. I like that he didn’t always paint himself as the hero, copping to pettiness, thin skin, and a lack of attentiveness to his wife. At one point he described himself as “willing to be fascinated equally by the genius, the fool, and the misanthrope,” then saying his wife was “more careful, cautious, level headed.” If he ever vilified her, it was too subtle for me to notice. I thought he was particularly good, too, at describing David’s behavior, without claiming that he understood the root causes. (The “show, don’t tell” lesson was not lost on him.) David, despite his charm and casual grace, was a man with baggage. His landlady and AA friend called him a helpless womanizer, which may have gone hand-in-hand with his drug problem. Promising relationships fell apart due to self-destructive behavior. One of the key questions Verghese asked himself was how responsible he should feel for David’s well-being. Could he be diverted away from his problems? Should he be given special dispensation? Is his condition simply another disease to be treated? How much is a function of will? Another aspect of Verghese’s honesty that I appreciated was how he viewed events first as they affected himself. The subsequent empathy for his friend rang truer that way.Something fans of Cutting for Stone already know is that Verghese is one heck of a good writer. That’s true at a sentence level (an MFA from the Iowa Writers Workshop after his medical degree must have seen to that) and also in the human understanding he shows. At one point, an addict named Gato offered to show him the ropes.Men like Gato made you feel that your manhood was being tested. There was nothing about his life--the hard time he did, the drug use, the manslaughter--that you envied, and yet when he flashed that arrogant grin, it was as if he dismissed everything you had done in your life as being sissy, joto. It tempted you to take some foolish risk just to prove him wrong, to show him you were one the boys.I liked his analogies too. One time he saw David with another woman.I've been meaning to tell you about her,"" he said, shaking his head, as if she were a weather pattern that had blown into his life, a phenomenon over which he had no control. Something that had just happened.He’s good with medical science as well, rarely going into detail just to show off. Here he was talking about how Emergency Medicine would be a bad specialty for David.EM was an adrenaline-driven field--the difference between cocaine and adrenaline a matter of a few carbon atoms.I’m giving this 4.5 stars and rounding down reluctantly to 4.

First of all, it’s good historical fiction—the kind where the education comes sans Kneale’s book tries and largely succeeds in being multiple things. First of all, it’s good historical fiction—the kind where the education comes sans textbook aridity. Much of the story is set in Tasmania in the 1800s where the native Aborigines were underfoot and too many British imperialists were wearing heavy boots. A character named Peevay is one of the principal narrators, offering a unique perspective as the son of an English father and a resistant, indigenous mother. The other storyline was a seafaring adventure. The captain and crew were Manxmen and as such had a different language and culture that added color to the mix. They had failed in their attempts at smuggling and had no other recourse than to take a small but paying set of passengers from England to Tasmania. Yet another goal of the book was to expose some of the day’s more egregious notions related to colonialism, evangelism, racism, and class.Somebody counted the number of narrators in this book to be 19. Only a handful were major, though, with repeated chances to tell their side of things. The first was Captain Illiam Quillian Kewley who had a plan to run brandy and tobacco from the Isle of Man to England for a quick profit. Customs officials had other ideas, of course, forcing Kewley and his crew to scramble to pay their fine. They chartered out their ship, ironically named Sincerity, to Reverend Wilson, who had convinced himself with God’s presumed guidance that the Garden of Eden was actually in Tasmania, and Dr. Potter, who wanted to collect evidence supporting his wrong-headed theories about race and ethnicity. There were some humorous moments when Wilson’s cluelessness was on full display. My astute Goodreads friend, Helle, likened him in her  to Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice. The following gives you an idea of what we mean:I began my ministry with some zeal, endeavouring to improve the lives of my flock by launching a little campaign to have the alehouse open only three days in the week instead of seven, and offering--as a nobler recompense--two extra church services. Sadly this little initiative was answered, in certain quarters, with something like hostility.Potter was vile in his own way, but at least he served as a pain in the pious Reverend’s rear end. They were joined by a third Englishman, a young botanist who was lazy and self-centered, but a possible candidate for redemption. The interplay among the passengers and the crew shed plenty of light on the vast sea of moral philosophy. Conflict was easy to come by, especially in close quarters.Peevay, his defiant mother, and their dwindling tribe faced conflict of a different sort: sickness, murder, and oppression. Their spears were no match for the firearms and bad intent directed their way. Even putatively good intentions often worked against them. Peevay’s narrative began decades before Sincerity’s arrival, but ultimately caught up. The convergence of these two storylines brought about even more folly and hypocrisy. And let’s not forget atrocities. The book definitely did not turn a blind eye to them.The multifold narration, in my view, mostly worked. As a rule, it kept the stories from growing stale. The subtle humor helped, too, where the butts of the jokes invariably had it coming. I also consider the language a strength—varied and slightly archaic. My only real criticism is that it seemed to drag in places, and a few of the characters seemed superfluous. In the end, though, the four stars I’m giving it should tell you that the pleasures and education I gained outweighed the tedium. The Booker committee evidently agreed, and in fact, saw their own scales tipping even more to that side....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2019","Feb 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14257.English_Passengers

My purpose herReading Hacks for La Dolce VitaGoodreaders, as self-selected members of this elite club, already know about “The Good Life” with books. My purpose here is to push for more of the same but with a bit of Italian panache. The list starts generically with tips for increasing the quality and quantity of your Italian reading adventures, then turns specifically towards Elena Ferrante’s celebrated Neapolitan Novels.1. Book in one hand, cannoli in the other.This takes the “dolce” part of the phrase literally. Actually, a scoop of gelato would work well, too, as long as you don’t let it drip out of the cone.2. Bite of cheese, sip of wine, page of book. Bite of cheese, sip of wine, page of book. Looking to decompress after a long day at work? Feeling a little peckish? This formula, or variations on it, can work well. For instance, you can alter the pace to make it a bite, a sip, and half a page. I would say, however, that if it’s a big chunk of cheese, three swigs of wine, and a sentence of the book, that we'd no longer consider this reading. As a side note, asiago cheese with one of those super Tuscans are hard to beat.3. For fans of Italian football, use the door-bolt wisely. Italian teams have been known for decades for their stout defending. They’re the masters of the 1-0 victory. And as soon as one side gets the 1, they bolt the door shut (Catenaccio, as they translate it) with a packed-in defense. Use this time to either read or switch to an English Premier League match.4. Got a favorite pasta sauce recipe? Try Bertolli’s instead.Even Nonna might forgive you if the half an hour of prep time you save goes towards a book series this good. I’m pushing hard to convince you this one is worth the compromise.5. The literary equivalent of a layover at the Aeroporto di Napoli doesn’t count. Full immersion into the culture and characters of Elena Ferrante’s tetralogy does. It’s important to note that Naples itself is a character, much like Guernsey is for The Book of Ebenezer Le Page or upstate New York is in those great Richard Russo novels. In fact, after an hour of reading Ferrante you may be surprised to look up and find that you’re not in a loud, dusty, sun-drenched piazza.6. Tired of stick figures? Ferrante’s are damn near Rubenesque.I’m speaking figuratively here, of course. The two central characters, Lenu (the narrator) and Lila (her brilliant friend) are remarkably well-drawn, with all the complexity and nuance that we love as we study the human animal. We’re treated to an epic sweep of changes, too, as we track the two of them from childhood to old age. Lenu was always the second smartest and most conscientious student in their early school days. Lila was the truly gifted one. She was the quickest at math, the one who could pick up languages with ease (including proper Italian, which was not their native tongue), and had a flair for art and writing. It’s fair to say she was wicked smart. By that I mean both “wicked” as in “very” (the Bostonian modifier) and “wicked” as in not always nice. It took me long time to figure out that those with a keen intellect don’t necessarily choose smooth paths for themselves or live lives worth emulating. Lila was often hard to figure. She was principled in her own way, but fiercely independent and confident in her ability to get out of the trouble she found; sometimes overconfident. Lenu was always more controlled, but could also be seduced by her friend’s phrenic brightness and behavioral darkness. Like I said, it’s all deliciously complicated.7. Dolci by themselves do not make a meal.If you wonder at times if the authors you read once wrote for Hallmark, you may be lacking conflict. This series may be just what you need. The part of Naples where the girls grew up was backward, poor, and violent. Family dynamics were often messy, friends weren’t always true, and the politics were, as a matter of course, contentious. Class warfare was de rigueur. Navigating such waters took real skill, and maybe a few lucky gusts.8. Before MeToo they had FYou. Battles between the sexes featured prominently. As a young teen, Lila once stood up to the son of a local strong-armed money-lender who was hitting on her and Lenu. Her threat – a knife to the throat – was completely credible. And the guy became smitten. (Go figure.) Lila wanted nothing to do with him, but then entered some ill-advised relationships with other young men. Lenu was not always lucky in love either. Duplicity, power struggles, bad communication – there was plenty to fuel the fires. We find, too, that the women were accomplished combatants.9. Head vs. Heart vs. Habitat. At any given time, each influence could hold sway in varying degrees. It was fascinating to read these stories with such admixtures in mind. Any attitude or act could have any combination of causes that can vary in us all. These books bring this out better than most. BTW, turning the same attribution analysis on ourselves can be a pretty interesting exercise, too.10. Embrace the unknown.As you may have heard, it’s still a mystery who the pseudonymous Elena Ferrante really is. She’s never made a personal appearance, has never allowed a photograph, and has only ever given the sketchiest of details about her life. She said she was born in Naples in 1943. That’s about all amateur sleuths have to go on. That doesn’t preclude the gathering of real estate records and matching them against royalty checks, or computer analysis of writing styles, or listing those with a similar knowledge of modern Italian politics in attempts to figure her true identity. One analysis even said she was a man, but I seriously doubt that. Ferrante herself, in a response published in Vanity Fair, disabused us of that notion, taking offense that “questions about her gender are rooted in a presumed ‘weakness’ of female writers.” I'll take weak like Ferrante any day!For this list, I’m stopping at ten. That should suffice, shouldn’t it? This isn’t a  of Spinal Tap, after all. If, after following these tips, your life isn’t technically more “dolce”, the hope is that you’ll at least think it’s more edified. It’s a good bet you’ll feel a greater savvy about people and their entanglements. (I was going to say “spaghetti-like entanglements,” but then figured that with Italian references, like grappa, there’s a tipping point.)...more",Notes are private!,0,92,1,not set,Jan 2017,"Feb 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend

I ended up liking this quite a lot. My full appreciation came iLisa Halliday is one clever writer – clever in different ways, including a sneaky one. I ended up liking this quite a lot. My full appreciation came in the short, final section of its three-part narrative where Ezra, the mature, award-winning writer was being interviewed on a radio show talking about his top ten desert island song list. He mentioned something that shed light on both the preceding parts and gave new meaning to the title. The final asymmetry would be spoiled by mentioning it. The first is not. In part one, young Alice, a junior editor in New York, has an affair with Ezra, who has just enough charm, wit, and wisdom not to seem creepy in the role of older inamorato. Halliday must have taken the “write what you know” advice to heart since she had had a relationship in her own youth with Phillip Roth. She didn’t follow this counsel throughout, though, since the second part of the book was narrated by an Iraqi-American student of economics. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Back to Alice. I thought she came off initially as kind of a ditz. For example, despite her job at a literary publishing house, she didn’t know that “Camus” ended with a cow sound. She seemed unfocused as well. Was this Alice a bit incautious plunging down the rabbit hole? Regardless, she grew on me. For one thing, I can relate to anyone who can be plied by books, baseball, and dessert. She was brighter than I had given her credit for, too, with eyes open wide enough as she peered into the looking glass. More importantly, she turned out to be one of those cherished empathy engines that great fiction can provide.Part 2 presented asymmetries of a different kind. The cultural influences in Los Angeles, where the narrator, Amar, was a doctoral student, and those in Iraq, his native land, don't exactly bring symmetry to mind. His Muslim faith put him further out of step with his American peers who were Christians or atheists. Amar was detained by immigration officials at Heathrow on his way to see his brother in Kurdistan. The story of Amar, his family, and friends (including girlfriends) was back-filled skillfully from there. A post-9/11 mindset comes into play, naturally, but other conflicts feature as well.One of the things I thought the book did particularly well was to examine certain of these asymmetries to see how their imbalances can be reconciled or at least comprehended. Greater harmony could take place at an individual level or a societal one. Here’s a quote from the book that speaks to that: And one must take into account a definite cushioning effect exercised both by the law, and by the moral sense which constitutes a self-imposed law; for a country is considered the more civilized the more the wisdom and efficiency of its laws hinder a weak man from becoming too weak or a powerful one too powerful.This line from Amar’s journalist friend gets at asymmetries in a different way, by saying how wrong we may be to judge or prescribe without understanding how complicated the issues often are: There’s an old saying, he said, about how the foreign journalist who travels to the Middle East and stays a week goes home to write a book in which he presents a pat solution to all of its problems. If he stays a month, he writes a magazine or a newspaper article filled with ‘ifs,’ ‘buts,’ and ‘on the other hands.’ If he stays a year, he writes nothing at all.Even metaphysical asymmetries can be distilled to a point where the distinctions are not great. Take this exchange between Amar, the believer, and an agnostic counterpart: But religion, our guest insisted with impressive confidence, allows you to ask only so many questions before you get to: Just because.You have to have faith. Well, I said. Your problem with religion is virtually every faithless person’s problem with religion: that it offers irreducible answers. But some questions in the end simply aren’t empirically verifiable.The whole point of faith is that irreducible answers don’t bother the faithful. The faithful take comfort and even pride in the knowledge that they have the strength to make the irreducible answers sincerely their own, as difficult as that is to do. Everyone—irreligious people included—relies on irreducible answers every day. All religion really does is to be honest about this, by giving the reliance a specific name: faith.If we define God in very abstract terms as the causal singularity explaining the universe, the bringer of the Big Bang, that’s a lot like the non-believer’s unnamed and unknowable reason we have existence rather than nothingness. Of course, believers tend to add specifics to their brand of Godliness that do more to separate than to find common ground. Halliday didn’t have as much to say about those more detailed aspects of faith.The third part where Ezra talked about his musical preferences was engaging at several levels. First of all, it made me wish I had access to BBC radio for actual broadcasts of Desert Island Discs. It seems like a great format, where a celebrity like Ezra (only real) gives reasons for his choices and then they play the songs. This imagined scene gave Halliday another chance to show Ezra as sophisticated, funny, and somewhat sympathetic (with one OTT exception involving the host). Finally, at a structural level, it allowed her to tie everything together with a very nice bow.I think what impressed me most about this debut effort was the intelligence of her insights and the respect she showed for her characters. The writing was solid, too -- literary without trying too hard, modern in a way that didn't feel contrived. It’s also fair to say that titles rarely make you think as much as this one does about the reasons they apply. I’d have said the same thing had she called the book Perspectives. I go for the broad ones like hers....more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,not set,not set,"Feb 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35297339-asymmetry

Bemused? Yes I was, but I don’t feel embarrassed to say it. I’m pretty sure that was Handler’s intent. You see the verb to which each chapter-identifying adverb applies is “love.” How can any of us, the author included, generalize in any definitive way about that? I think it’s fair to say that there are as many facets to love as there are those who give and receive it. Maybe the point is to cover some of the different ways it can be amassed or abated, misconstrued or mishandled, and then to realize the impossibility of filling in every blank.I’ve been told by the woman I love (completely and uncomplicatedly) that feelings resist analysis. She never lets me forget that math types are just hammers out to construe the whole world as nails. But what if the result of my analysis is that the book is intentionally defying analysis? Surely I’m allowed to be as meta-analytical as the book is metafictional. To elaborate, the chapters feature recurring themes, symbols, and characters, but the characters’ names seem to switch and recycle – it’s not always clear. Then about two-thirds of the way in, the “real” narrator (whoever that is) levels with us about the device and gives us some sort of map. But to me it was like seeing where Route 53 intersects Maple Avenue without knowing whether it was in Naperville or Natchez. Every little love story, as imperfect as the love was within it, would end essentially saying, “and that’s what love is.” The implied nod to the universal can’t be anything but ironic, though. The disparate and typically dysfunctional cases in point spoke more to the infinite variety of human relations. We’re not built to understand the immeasurable. How fitting, then, or so I suppose, that we’re not meant to make full sense of this book. I thought briefly of an interpretation tying in Kurt Gödel’s impossibility theorems, but I can imagine my wife saying I’ve gone too far down the math path already. The more I read, and the more I saw the device for what it was (or at least thought it was), the more I liked it. The late appreciation then had me wanting to return to page one to see how it looped back on itself. Yes, it’s confusing, abstract, unreliable, and gimmicky, but it does make its points. As the recursively modified characters long to connect, only to see their romanticized ideals dissipate, it may help to remember some astute words from the book: “You can’t mind these things, you just can’t, for to dislike what makes a person human is to dislike all humans.”It’s written well and gets at fundamental problems of how we relate, but it’s distracting at times trying to figure who’s who in these disjointed, often surreal stories. A closer reading may have made more patterns pop out, but it wasn’t clear to me that the pay-off would be worth the effort.

Please see if my observations match your own experiences. I’ll use Eric Idle’s recent book to drive the points home.Have a reason to write oneThe first, and only truly difficult step, is to become famous. I’m not talking about the clichéd 15 minutes of fame here. That may be good for couch time on Good Morning America, but not a full length book. I think the bar for celebrity renown probably needs to be set high enough to appear on Saturday Night Live. Short of that, sales would be meager. Note that I’m excluding politicians and other infamous figures in this analysis since their memoirs are of a different sort. Of course, Eric Idle is a pretty recognizable name, at least among those old enough to know Monty Python. And he did host SNL several times.Establish humble beginnings and hardships to overcomeIdle had little trouble painting a dire picture of his early life. His father beat the odds as a tail gunner in the Royal Air Force only to die in an accident hitchhiking home for Christmas in ‘45. Eric was two. Then his student years were spent in boarding school – evidently a glum affair even for a clever and popular lad. Belabor successes and justifications for themCombine wit and Oxbridge sensibilities with mod England's penchant for sketch comedy, then mix in a bit of serendipity and out pops Monty Python. It was entertaining to hear about the formative years, though the details may have gone too far at times for my taste. Even so, this was a meaty part of the book for good reason. The original show and the many offshoots that followed (Life of Brian, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Meaning of Life, Spamalot, and countless others) really did amount to a lot.Drop namesIn Idle’s case, he dropped plenty. Among them: Robert Altman, Dan Aykroyd, Hank Azaria, Jeff Beck, Ed Begley, David Bowie, Russell Brand, Mel Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Prince Charles, Chevy Chase, Eric Clapton, Robbie Coltrane, Billy Connolly, Steve Coogan, Peter Cook, Alice Cooper, Tim Curry, Judi Dench, Shelly Duvall, Bob Dylan, Queen Elizabeth, Marty Feldman, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Michael J.

To be fair, a few of the mini-bios were pretty fascinating. Idle was actually quite good friends (to a point of shared vacations) with Bowie, George Harrison, Mick Jagger, Steve Martin, Mike Nichols, Paul Simon, and Robin Williams. The details he described were often fun and affecting. I hadn’t realized that George single-handedly financed Life of Brian or that he was attacked and nearly killed at his estate in England. On the unsurprising end of the spectrum was the confirmation that Robin Williams was as manic and brilliant in real life as he was as a performer.TitillateI don’t know if a publisher’s mantra of “sex sells” was on auto-replay or if Eric felt a need to advertise his prowess as a committed heterosexual, but for whatever reason much of the first half was spent cataloging his conquests. As one advantage of being English, words of his like “shag” and “bum” seem playful to my American ears. Still, enough is enough. He confessed to serial cheating throughout his first marriage. By the time of his second, however, he’d settled into a more monogamous rhythm. He spoke very highly of wife #2’s character, but was also sure to include a photo of the Playboy cover that featured her backside in short shorts.Blow your own horn with manufactured modestyI suppose it’s only fair that someone with so many awards and accomplishments should be allowed to brag a little about them. But when he presented them repeatedly to say I’m-just-a-schlub-but-I’m-apparently-adored-by-the-entire-free-world, it became too transparent. He included many an instance where one of the dropped names was made to laugh uproariously for hours on end, or a perfect bon mot brought the house down. I chuckled often myself, but sometimes wished I could save him from his own excesses.Settle scores; conclude neatlyMost of the people mentioned were treated to generous descriptions. Given the collective talent among the names I listed, why wouldn’t they be? There were a few cases where some agent or promoter tried to bilk him and deserved to be chastised, but those instances didn’t dominate. He also had a few choice words about the sitting US president. Even Brits are entitled to their opinions about our political landscape (as long as they’re the right ones). ;-)The ending included a few lines about the ending we all face. I think I can sum it up like this:When chewing on life’s gristle, don’t grumble, give a whistle. And always look on the bright side of death.I got my copy of this at a book-signing in my hometown. It was a big event by local standards, billed as a conversation between Idle and Naperville’s own Bob Odenkirk (of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fame). It was quite an enjoyable evening. Idle, who is now 75 years old, is still razor sharp and can still deliver the laughs. I’ll remember that next time I’m chewing on life’s gristle. 3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,1,107,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2019","Jan 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39022876-always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life

It’s about life, love, and death as well as the importance of truth and how slippery (like a fish) it can be. It’s a fascinating history of Sarah Island, home of a notorious 19th century penal colony in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania). And it features as much blood, sweat, tears, pus and poo as you could ever imagine. The story begins in modern times where an “antique” dealer in Hobart, specializing in furniture he distresses himself to seem authentically old, stumbles onto an eye-catching book of fish illustrations and marginalia by a certain William Gould. The story that’s handwritten in differing inks (including blood) is Gould’s account of his life as a forger, an apprentice painter who learned from John Audubon, and a prisoner shipped to Sarah Island. The original book gets wet and soon disintegrates. The book we get instead in the 400 or so pages that followed is what the dealer could remember of the story, reproducing it from his notes. If you think this metafiction smacks of postmodernism, you’d be right. I’ll have more to say about that in a minute. Gould had a rather luckless start in life, and would never have thought to sell himself as a model of virtue. Even so, it was a false accusation that landed him in prison. Once there, he encountered a whole host of grotesque characters. Several were actually useful in that their benefits from his art meant that he got out of the worst prison duties. The dishonest commandant made a lot of money from the phony Constables Gould created. And the pompous, fleshy prison surgeon had Gould illustrate Australian fish, the taxonomy of which he hoped would gain him entry into the Royal Society of Science. An Aborigines woman there to cater to the commandant’s lecherous demands had more kindly relations with Gould. Even with our narrator’s reprieves and moments of love, life was not easy. His words describing the abject horror of prison life were indelible, more so than some might prefer. One particularly vivid example was an instrument of torture called the cockchafer. Literary scholars would have a field day discussing whether this book transcends its postmodern tendencies. As I mentioned, it does feature metafiction, but it’s not presented as artifice. Another nod to postmodernism – Gould’s unreliable narration – succeeds too. It did not feel clichéd. The book also featured an element of transmogrification, a trope I felt it came by honestly. In fact, I viewed any fish/human interchange (which was always pretty tacit) as part of the appeal. I liked how it reminded me of the friend who turned me on to this great book. He goes by the name Gregsamsa (who, despite the allusion to Kafka, I’ve never seen metamorphosize into anything bad). What really sets this book apart from its more run-of-the-mill pomo brethren, though, is how it showcases genuine human emotion. You can’t help but empathize.The language in this is another strength. Gould, as a narrator, has a distinctive voice as a man’s man and a man of his time. The sentences may be long and immoderately spiced, but for the most part are a pleasure to read. What interested me most, though, was the message itself. I shouldn’t go too far into this because readers should form their own opinions, but it seemed obvious that one of the major themes was the Truth with a capital T – its presence, its absence, and its indeterminacy. Of course, it’s almost impossible to view an issue like this through anything other than a lens of our time, but I’ll try not to be too obvious about it. Anyway, the first quote that’s relevant is by the initial narrator, the antique dealer, who said, “Swindling requires not delivering lies but confirming preconceptions.” I guess by analogy, the most convincing fake news requires playing to biases. A bit later, someone told Gould that “definitions belong to the definer, not the defined.” These are consistent with a Nietzschean world view that says there is no truth, only interpretations. Later still, Gould wondered whether the truth even mattered. It was easy to be cynical. He had seen prison records at one point that were complete fabrications meant to make officials look humane and effective. To his credit, though, Gould reasoned that the truth does matter to those who can be hurt by the lack of it.Then there was the inherent difficulty in rendering truth:I no longer even cared whether my paintings were accurate or right in the way that the Surgeon & his Linnaean books of scientifick description wished paintings of fish to be accurate or right. I just wanted to tell a story of love & it was about fish & it was about me & it was about everything. But because I could not paint everything, because I could only paint fish & my love & because I could not even do that very well, you may not think it much of a story.This leads to a somewhat related theme – the insufficiency of words to tell a story as big and true and encompassing as a man like Gould, aching to find meaning, would like. That didn’t stop him from trying:I smelt the breath of my fellows. I tasted the sour stench of their rotten lives. I was the stinking cockroach. I was the filthy lice that didn’t stop itching. I was Australia. I was dying before I was born. I was a rat eating its young. I was Mary Magdalene. I was Jesus. I was sinner. I was saint. I was flesh & flesh’s appetite & flesh’s union & death & love were all equally rank & all equally beautiful in my eyes. I cradled their broken bodies dying. I kissed their suppurating boils. I washed their skinny shanks filled with ulcers, rotting craters of pus; I was that pus & I was spirit & I was God & I was untranslatable & unknowable even to myself.The themes loom large, but there’s a subtle artistry to this book as well. It’s creatively structured, beautifully written (pus & poo notwithstanding), and good at making you think. For me it was four stars bordering on five. I couldn’t quite give it that last one because I sometimes felt slightly adrift. The sentences were loaded with commas, the characters were legion, and timelines were occasionally disordered (though trackable once you identify Gould’s then-current oppressor). It’s a big one to reel in, but well worth the effort for those who enjoy literary game fish....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,not set,not set,"Dec 03, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14236.Gould_s_Book_of_Fish

She saw that my job had me knee-deep in numbers and thought maybe I’d appreciate more words in my life for ballast. With that in mind, she arranged for me to take an online writing class. We just started Week 2 – Show, don’t tell. One of the discussion prompts was to cite examples of a writer who “shows” particularly well. Turns out, I have a ready supply of quotable passages from books I’ve been meaning (for too long) to . The set I had for this one just about ran my highlighter dry. So here were the examples I posted:Mark: A child who, out of pity, always picked the worst players for his team. An adult who called only when weepy drunk.The bathroom was a science-fair project in full bloom.Nothing had the power to hurt her except for what power she gave it. Every barrier she'd ever chafed against was no more than a Chinese finger lock that opened the instant when she stopped pulling.That's the thing about dogs. There isn't a human being in the world worthy of any dog's welcome.She reddened again. Her skin was instant litmus.Mark marveled at Weber's professional patter. ""Man! If I could talk like you, I'd be getting laid on a daily basis."" He launched into imitative psychobabble, almost convincing enough to earn him a comfortable wage somewhere on the West Coast.The two of them ended up at a restaurant back in Kearney, one of those chains drawn up in Minneapolis or Atlanta and faxed around the nation.Karin called Bonnie... She got the infectious answering machine -- I wish I was here to talk to you for real -- in that cheerful treble that sounded like the horn of a Ford Focus on mood elevators.My brain, all those split parts, trying to convince each other. Dozens of lost Scouts waving crappy flashlights in the woods at night. Where's me? I don’t know this for a fact, but my guess is that the instructor would have given him an A on any “show, don’t tell” assignment he submitted. Powers, as I’ve opined elsewhere, is a bona fide genius. He merges science, language, arts, and humanity as seamlessly as anyone out there. This particular book delves into an interesting mental disorder, and features an Oliver Sacks-type character to diagnose/treat/exploit it. The plot is a good one and his characters are well-drawn. Metaphors abound. And his bigger points are touching and wise. But rather than “telling” you to read this gem of a book, I’ll rely on the examples above to “show” you glimpses of the phrenic delights you’d be missing if you don’t....more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,not set,not set,"Oct 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19794.The_Echo_Maker

As a writer, he ticks so many boxes. Actually, for the purposes of this , let’s say instead that he rates at the graphical extremes of multiple favorable traits. I don’t know what these charts below are called. Nate Silver and the stats gurus at FiveThirtyEight use pentagons, nice colors, and real data to produce theirs. My staff of one, paid the same as a TSA employee (in day 26 of the government shutdown), uses the only polygon his software offers (the lowly triangle), and plots falsely precise looking data based purely on his own opinion. But I hope it makes the point about how well Phillips stacks up alongside some of his celebrated essay-writing peers. Literary nonfiction, the type you might find in The New Yorker or Harper's Magazine, can showcase both great writing and unexpected topics. Some of my favorite practitioners of the art (and their works I’ve read) are David Foster Wallace (A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again and Consider the Lobster), John Jeremiah Sullivan (Pulphead), and Joan Didion (Slouching Towards Bethlehem). In the Trait Triangles below, I indicate how I assess each one of them by various criteria. The further out the bold red lines extend, the higher I rate the writer’s abilities in those dimensions. The points on the first set of triangles are for the quality of writing, the abundance of insight, and the coolness quotient of chosen topics. As you can see, all four writers have substantial red areas. These writers are favorites for a reason, after all. But the takeaway point is the clear visual proof that Phillips more than holds his own. [image]Impossible Owls shows what an artful writer Phillips is, with lush sentences and word-perfect phrasing. He draws analogies well, describes people memorably, and offers slightly off-kilter points of view that, after a moment’s consideration, you recognize as so right. Here are a few examples of his style that I hope illustrate. Describing a bush pilot in Alaska that helped him follow the Iditarod:Jay was a Vermont kid, raised in a small town, and there was a mordant New England pluck in the way he gazed into the abyss and said, ""I see what you're trying to do there, abyss.""Two examples describing others he met in Alaska:Colin had a fascinatingly odd way of maintaining intense eye contact while simultaneously all but squirming with agony over the fact that he was being noticed--the way, say, your fifteen-year-old goth cousin might do. This was something I noticed time and again in the inhabitants of remote Alaska, this total, helpless acuteness in the presence of a stranger. It was as if isolation had kept them from numbing themselves to the fact of other people. I met Dick Newton [...]. He introduced himself to me in the dining hall. ""Introduced"" is a strong word. He walked up to me and said, ""Well, who are you?"" Not in an unfriendly way. Just in a way that said he was eighty-two and still handled deep Alaska wilderness on a daily basis and maybe shouldn't have to smile extra just because he met some kid who knew how to order pizza with an app.At the UFO Museum in Roswell:[...] the aliens start talking to the crowd. What they say is--I'm paraphrasing--""bzzzzrrg bzzzzoom ppozz bzrg pzow."" Imagine Donald Duck trying to mimic a dial-up modem; it's like that.And finally, from a piece covering the social impacts of certain fiction: One of the reasons J. K. Rowling's books exerted magnetic power over every sentient creature on earth is that they resolved, indeed fused, a cultural contradiction. She took the aesthetic of old-fashioned English boarding-school life and placed it at the center of a narrative about political inclusiveness. You get to keep the scarves, the medieval dining hall, the verdant lawns, the sense of privilege (you're a wizard, Harry), while not only losing the snobbery and racism but actually casting them as the villains of the series.As for topics, Phillips gave us an appetizing variety. They include the sustained madness of the Iditarod, the inside world of sumo wrestling, tiger-sighting in India, the other-worldliness of Roswell, a renowned Russian animator who has been working for decades on a masterpiece, the personal lives of British royals, and a story set in the Oklahoma town where Phillips grew up of an oil tycoon and his niece turned adopted daughter turned wife turned kind of crazy woman. In the second set of triangles (necessitated by my lack of an all-inclusive hexagon), I list a few more dimensions I appreciate in essays. The bottom left trait is Empathy—how much humanity and understanding the writer exhibits. On the bottom right I put Education, which might include fun facts from history, how things work, or descriptions of the sort found in great travelogues. The top is labeled Personalization. By that I mean how much first person narration is involved, which when done well, puts an added element of emotion into the piece. There are no “right” answers to any of these new dimensions. Plenty of great essays exclude these elements entirely. I’m just awarding bonus points when an author does especially well pushing any of those boundaries.[image]Phillips showed a heightened sense of people awareness on quite few occasions. One example was a bit about Kate Middleton which probably shouldn’t be viewed as out-and-out support for a monarchy, but is sensitive to the unreal and dutiful life. I felt like Phillips included quite a few interesting facts as well, so his Education marks are also sky-high. Plaudits, too, for the entertaining way he draws you into these different worlds and makes you want to learn more. Phillips didn’t always insert himself into these essays, but when he did it was very effective. His personal experiences in Alaska made me shiver. And the last piece about the oil tycoon and his wife included a segment about Phillips’ own boyhood as well as a poignant side story about his grandparents. He said that he likes his hometown and many of its people, but knew early on that it wasn’t where he belonged. I think that may be code that Harvard grads use euphemistically when they talk about anywhere but Cambridge. Every page had some reminder that Phillips himself is a very smart guy. He writes beautifully and observes keenly, but never comes across as someone as arrogant as he has a right to be. My only complaint is likely my own deficiency. When I’m reading along and see ABC FGH KLM and think I’m following the pattern, he might throw in something like φ§θ to put me in my place.

It was not a log of his activities or thoughts on the issues of the day, but rather an attempt to understand a complicated family dynamic with a flawed father driving it. He said the journal was like author’s notes -- another of the many parallels between Bruce and Stegner himself. Both had a saintly mother, a combustible father, an athletic older brother who unlike Wally and Bruce did not skip grades, and a nomadic upbringing that included time in Saskatchewan, Montana, and Salt Lake City. Here’s Bruce, though, reflecting on how impossible it is to truly understand any such thing:""I suppose,"" he wrote, ""that the understanding of any person is an exercise in genealogy. A man is not a static organism to be taken apart and analyzed and classified. A man is movement, motion, a continuum. There is no beginning to him. He runs through his ancestors, and the only beginning is the primal beginning of the single cell in the slime.""Nevertheless, the book did track back to figure out what it could. In the process, Stegner said, he managed to offload some deep-seeded resentments. I’m reluctant to go into any detail, because Stegner should be given the chance to reveal important plot points his own way. Let me just say he’s good at it. Each vignette draws you in completely, magnified and made grand by his sense of time and place. And every character profile has human dimensions that only a genuinely talented, observant writer can convey. OK then. [Taking a deep breath before attempting the tightrope walk that keeps me from over-sharing while at the same time justifies why the book deserves all 5 stars.] One genealogical precursor in this story was the father’s father who lost an arm and any sense of humor he might have had as a prisoner in the Civil War. Another was the mother’s Norwegian heritage and farm upbringing that made her hearty and resilient. Each member of the immediate family gets POV treatment which helps the long story move at a more spritely pace. Bo, the dad, was testosterone personified. He was broad-shouldered, good with his hands, quick with his temper, energetic, charming (at times), respected by ruffians, good with guns, and for the most part loving towards his wife Elsa. He chased dreams of the big score, the easy money, or in metaphorical terms, the Big Rock Candy Mountain that’s surely just past the next rise. (BTW, the book shares its apt title with a song that was featured in the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou. “And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth” being my favorite line.) Bo pushed boundaries, was confident (or maybe “delusional” is the better word), and liked signaling “big man” status when he could. In one case he paid more for the diamond stud in his tie than I do for 3 years-worth of clothes and accessories even before adjusting for inflation. (Hmm… I’m not sure if that says more about him or me.)Elsa was more practical, but rarely held sway. She was also, in contrast, consistently kind. The only knock against her is that she might have done more to protect the little birds in her nest. The older brother, Chet, was in many ways like his father. If Bo could be called a man’s man, Chet could be labelled a boy’s boy – physical, a ring-leader, adventurous, and at least half-full of mischief. Bruce was more of a mama’s boy. He did share one trait with his father, though: an intense willfulness. When the two were together, Bo’s manly standards and own intransigence made harmony as scarce as big money. Bruce’s reflections later in the book were powerful and wise (overlapping 99% with Stegner’s own). Father-son relationships often teeter lopsidedly between pride and disappointment depending on how the two generations reflect on each other and how reconciled they are to their differences.Stegner once said this was a book about motion. The family certainly moved a lot, with that B.R.C.M. always beckoning. There was movement of a different sort, too. Young Bruce, who was wise beyond his years, noted that people weren’t fixed points so much as lines, always changing a little from what they were “like the wiggly line on a machine used to measure earthquake shocks. […a man] moved along a line dictated by his heritage and his environment, but he was subject to every sort of variation within the narrow limits of his capabilities.” With Stegner drawing the plots, every wiggle was worth noting.The book was published in 1943 when Stegner was 34 years old, teaching at Harvard. The three other Stegner novels I read were written decades later. It was interesting to me to sample the young Wallace Stegner before the line of his life brought him to celebrated works like Angle of Repose and Crossing to Safety. In younger years he seemed to write with more raw power, hurt, and emotion. As he aged he became more refined and maybe more quotable. He was never less than great, though – marked by mature insights even as a young man and brimming with intelligence throughout. I’m giving this book 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5. The small demerit comes from descriptive passages that I sometimes felt could have been shorter. I also think that as Bruce/Wallace exorcised demons, there wasn’t enough elapsed time or self-awareness yet to say what would fill the void. A quote by Bruce near the end, though, hints at how both the protagonist and the writer thought the blanks should be filled.Perhaps it took several generations to make a man, perhaps it took several combinations and re-creations of his mother's gentleness and resilience, his father's enormous energy and appetite for the new, a subtle blending of masculine and feminine, selfish and selfless, stubborn and yielding, before a proper man could be fashioned.Knowing what I know of the writer to come, he iterated his way to that goal quite well, surpassing those candy mountains along the way....more",Notes are private!,0,174,1,not set,Jun 2017,"Jun 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10801.The_Big_Rock_Candy_Mountain

Jason Gay’s light-hearted little book is nominally meant to give advice and rules of thumb for navigating the modern world, but we all know it’s just a format for making jokes. It’s not entirely airy, though. He adds ballast with topics like his bout with testicular cancer and his father’s failing health. And every once in a while we’re led to think. But for the most part it’s all about the humor.Gay’s current job is as a WSJ sports columnist. He’s also written for Rolling Stone, GQ, and Vogue. With everything of his I ever read, I end up cracking a smile. His humor is droll, observational, and self-effacing. He’s slightly edgier than Dave Barry, not as big into anecdotes as David Sedaris, and less of a suburban housewife than Erma Bombeck, but he correlates with them all. His likability index is high, too, which always helps.I realized only after I was most of the way done that the best way to sell this book to friends would be with examples. Since I was too lazy to backtrack, I hoped that whatever I underlined from then on would be enough. Here are a few I came up with. You be the judge.Asking a survey question to discern how smart phone-dependent you might be:Are you reading this copy of Little Victories as “an actual hardcover book, with printed pages, by candlelight, in a hayloft, above sleeping livestock, as people used to do in the 1990s?”Talking about how orderly an aunt’s place is where they regularly visit in the summer:My house, by contrast, feels as if a tribe of orangutans has gotten loose and opened up a case of Heinekens.Describing advice from an older sibling on parenthood:My brother, whose daughter is on the verge of her teens, treats me like I'm still in the first season of Breaking Bad. Wait until Season 4, he says, when it takes your kid two hours to dress before school.On curbing the time kids spend with digital devices: […] if you hand a child a phone in a public setting, people look at you like you’ve just given your kid a sack of enriched uranium. You are lazy, you are ceding parenthood to the machines, you are not actively building organic fun. The parenting magazines and blogs tell you to set limits, and this is useful advice, but I am not setting limits on, say, an airplane. If it means a peaceful cross-country flight without dirty stares from every other passenger, I will let a two-year-old watch Scarface.The book contains wise words about the value of friends, the joys of a good marriage, the excesses of youth sports and the importance of little things that should be appreciated for how they cumulate, even if imperfectly, into a life. At his best, he mixes earnest good intent with some chuckles. The only thing that didn’t wear well was a tendency to exaggerate with numbers. For example, he said, “I am so afraid of poisoning you that I will leave that chicken on the grill until 2042.” Or, once in a job he made “21 billion cheese sandwiches.” There must have been more than 16 thousand such instances and they ultimately made me cringe.If you’re looking for a little palate cleanser between courses, and you want it light but still flavorful, this is one to consider.

We all know from chaos theory that it doesn’t take a very big butterfly to make a profound difference in Naperville, Illinois's weather. Decades ago academics decided they wanted in on the fun. They called their “what-ifs” counterfactuals whereby two states of the world would be compared: one where an intervention occurred (like some policy change or the advent of railroads or the internet) and one where it didn’t. Studies like this can be speculative and over-reaching. The lack of rigor means they can be argued to the point where no one will agree. It’s best to think of these things as creative exercises only. I’m more willing to listen to what Clarence says a world without George Bailey would be like than to what some economist pictures as the competitive landscape had the Glass-Steagall Act not been rescinded. Blake Crouch asks “what if” quite a lot. And he does it creatively. I’m happy to report that the three s I’ve read of this book were able to resist blabbing about the premise. I won’t spoil the how of the what-ifs either. In fact, I may just turn this whole  into a series of my own what-ifs, with only vague references to the book. What if a reader like me who naturally questions the scientific plausibility of science fiction so much that he’s often driven to distraction finds one where the story and its philosophical implications are interesting enough that disbelief is cheerfully suspended?What if quantum physics allowed bizarre interpretations of superposition such that random subatomic events could lead to states that are simultaneously on and off, or dead and alive, or acted upon and not, until such time as the states are observed?

The first wakeful moments in the shower usually let you know that any solutions you thought might apply were pure nonsense. Even more often you realize the things you were thinking about weren’t really problems anyway – it was all just anxiety for the hell of it. Anyway, last night I went to bed thinking about what I might say about this celebrated new Saunders book I just read. Even as I was falling asleep, I knew in the light of day this would end up being one of those non-problems. But then I started thinking about a request I got at work to give a presentation about statistical modeling to the 50 or so technologists in our firm. These are clever people – the types who could write episodes of Silicon Valley - so, warily, I began preparing slides in my head that might interest them. As soon as the REM sleep kicked in, I guess I conflated my two goals. I came up with mathematical breakdowns of Lincoln in the Bardo instead. Of course, the first drops of water from the shower should have told me to abandon such thoughts, but I was hard up for an angle as it was, which is a long introduction for what you’re about to see. [Note to self: Don’t mention Goodreads s in stats preso.]I might as well start with the star rating. The input variables in this case, all ranging from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest) were:Quality of writing = 0.88Creativity in structuring = 0.93Depth of probes into character = 0.48Exploration of themes = 0.85Achievement versus expectations = 0.27Applying equal additive weights to each variable we get:Rating = 0.88 + 0.93 + 0.48 + 0.85 + 0.27 = 3.41I’d read several rave s which enticed me. And the premise (Lincoln’s visits to the cemetery after his dear son Willie died at which time and place the transitioning souls there in the bardo encountered him) sounded interesting, too, even if a tad gimmicky. The multiplicity of stories and situations were a chance to place all of humankind on a platter for Lincoln (and us) to ingest. The bardo is a Buddhist concept pertaining to the state of being between death and rebirth – presumably a time of reflection and atonement. As Saunders envisioned it, the cross-section of inhabitants was a wide and noisy one. Still, a more enlightened understanding of one another’s ways was possible. Empathy and acceptance were the apparent goals. I give Saunders plenty of credit for highlighting these themes. (I give him even more credit for this commencement speech he gave a few years ago, making a related case for kindness.) My only disappointment was that the individual stories seemed too diffuse and too thin to really permeate. The book touched briefly on what life must have been like for Lincoln at that point. For someone who was said to be unusually kindhearted and sympathetic to begin with, the grief of Willie’s death along with the weight of the war were almost more than he could bear. Even so, as his country’s leader he knew he couldn’t wallow. Instead, he had to remind himself of the moral math (though he might not have thought of it in quite those terms) of suffering. His time in the cemetery reminded him that everyone has hardships of some kind at some time, some far worse than others. His job was to make decisions to minimize the cumulative sum of it. So, which is the smaller amount?Cumulative suffering given war = Σ Misery[i, t | war] (summed across all individuals i, and future episodes t)orCumulative suffering given no war = Σ Misery[i, t | no war] (summed across all individuals i, and future episodes t)The misery of slavery was given a suitably high weight, of course. In fact, Lincoln’s empathy for all was given a representational boost when certain of the souls discovered they could inhabit him and cross-absorb experiences – literally (for purposes of the story) walking a mile in his shoes. A former slave was notably included.Ancillary mathematical discussion: Certain traits seem to combine additively to produce a given effect. Others are multiplicative. In the example that comes to mind regarding Lincoln (hagiography alert), I’m positing an exponential relationship.Power ^ Empathy = GreatnessOne of the thornier issues we face as we endeavor to empathize is the amount of dispensation to assign. It’s easy to say that some higher moral authority has that job, but I still think the old “free will vs. determinism” debate is a good one. Several in the bardo argued that they may have done bad things, but were compelled by their natures and circumstances to do so. Expressing it in an equation, we might get something like this:Actions and Attitudes = function(Genetics, Brain chemistry, Upbringing, Outside influences like friends or books, Physical needs) + ResidualThe residual in this model is the part of our actions and attitudes that cannot be explained by the drivers. It’s what I’m imagining free will to be. So the question is, what portion, if any, is to be labeled a choice, superseding what the assigned factors would otherwise dictate? Is that what we’re to be judged by?I was coached once, when putting together a presentation, to go easy on the equations. Eyes for another half your audience will glaze over for each additional one you include. I guess he was saying:Remaining interest = Original interest * (0.5 ^ # of equations)How many of you does that leave?

It’s much harder to come up with anything new to When a book is as popular and praiseworthy as this one, it’s easy to join the chorus justifying why. It’s much harder to come up with anything new to say. I’ll attempt the latter in a minute, but first here’s a recap of what others have already said:» Young, debut author born in Ghana, brought up in Alabama writes a brilliant novel spanning multiple generations, putting faces on the African and African-American experience.» The story begins with Effia (the beauty) who seemed destined to become a tribal big man’s wife who instead is married off profitably to a British officer there for the slave trade. Esi, a half-sister Effia knew nothing about, is captured in a neighboring village, brought to the horrific dungeon (with worse conditions than a caged chicken’s) at the Cape Coast Castle where Effia lived, and is ultimately shipped off to America. » The book proceeds to tell the stories of characters in each subsequent generation, alternating between Effia’s line in Africa and Esi’s in the states.» Projecting into slavery and racism in the abstract is bad enough, but when it’s personalized through characters we come to know and admire, it sucks even worse.» Life in Africa wasn’t always great either with raids on villages, battles against the Brits, my-way-or-the-highway missionaries, and complicity among the Asante in the slave trade.» Character profiles allowed Gyasi to hit on many endemic hardships. Among the most affecting were: difficulties in being mixed race, severe pain and scarring from the lash, trumped up charges forcing labor in the coal mines, the lure of an artificial escape (narcotics), and racism that may attenuate over time, yet still persists.» The only real criticism I’ve heard is that the characters can seem underdeveloped. With only twenty or so pages for each one, we don’t get to know them all that well. Reviewers who dock a star invariably cite this as the reason. » Nobody I’ve seen docks more than one star – for any reason.Hmm… did I really commit to saying something new? Let’s see [scratching head, looking simultaneously sheepish and stupid]… Uh, well, there’s this:» Skin tones of different characters were often mentioned, almost always as some combination of a caffeinated beverage and dairy, with proportions varying.» At times, other properties of flesh (e.g., fullness, jiggliness) were detailed as well. Looks were emphasized quite a lot.» This isn’t so much a new thought as it is an amplification on a previous one. With the brief time spent with each character, Gyasi does an impressive job of highlighting personal experiences that may well have applied to many at the time. Each had idiosyncrasies, too. But if I’m honest, generations are already fading from my memory, and I’m only a week removed from them. Too many faces come in too short a time to keep track.» Related to the previous point, the character vignettes often ended abruptly. After seeing this pattern repeated, it felt like a device. And it kind of broke the spell.» Again commenting on the brief stints with each character, individual dramas had little time to build. I appreciate that Gyasi could bring forth an epic feel in 300 pages, but certain characters deserved more, I felt, to really permeate. Like I said, it’s hard to find anything new to say since Goodreads ers have already covered the relevant ground so well. As further evidence, I’m not the first to highlight the quote below. But it came from one of my favorite characters, a teacher in Ghana disfigured by fire, so I have to include it.[…]when you study history, you must always ask yourself, whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice [from the one in power] could come forth? Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too.

As one I know I can flog, think of Strout’s profile here as an artful little mosaic. She doesn’t use many tiles, but the ones she does display are carefully colored and placed. With enough distance, a picture does emerge. While it may be true that not every reader likes having the space between tiles, for me, squinting and mulling were part of the pleasure. Had the book fully revealed the miseries of Lucy’s early life and her complicated relationships as an adult, I might have found it too familiar or, heaven forfend, sentimental. What follows is a sample of what we do get from the tiles, followed by what we might ponder from the spaces.Tile Topic: Remember, this is a picture. It’s not an animation. Very little qualifies as a plot beyond the fact that Lucy has mysterious complications from an appendectomy and ends up in a hospital bed for nine weeks. She’s a young mother at the time. Lucy’s own mother flies out from rural Illinois to visit Lucy in New York after years of not seeing her. The five-day visit is mostly filled with gossip about people from town. Space Speculation: This is a “show, don’t tell” kind of book. Come to think of it, a corollary we might call “allude, don’t conclude” also applies. We sense that Lucy has something to forgive, but we’re not exactly sure what it may be. She’s careful to avoid making her mom feel bad, though, and in return, Lucy does seem comforted by the visit. Her mom does not express love in conventional ways, but might there be proxies (flawed though they may be) that Lucy seeks? TT: The book proceeds with vignettes years before and years after her illness. The most affecting ones showed very clearly that poverty sucks. Growing up, Lucy and her family lived in the garage of her uncle’s house. They wore ratty clothes, ate bread with molasses for most meals, had no indoor plumbing beyond a sink with tepid water, and spent too much time feeling cold. SS: Does that sense of being looked down upon ever dissipate? When, as a child, you see the looks on the faces of classmates on the bus hoping you’ll find a seat elsewhere ever fade away? Do the few acts of kindness you enjoy (e.g., a free Thanksgiving dinner offered with a smile, a teacher chastising certain fellow students’ superior attitudes) tell readers how impactful even small gestures can be to those in need?TT: Among family members, Lucy was the lucky one. She spent hours in the library (partly just to stay warm) where she discovered books as a way to fight loneliness. As a side benefit, she got top marks in school and escaped with a college scholarship. Her brother and sister did not fare as well. He was too repressed to ever be whole and she was too resentful. Lucy’s dad had a temper, a bad war experience, and jobs that would never last. Her mom had issues of her own and at times would lash out indiscriminately. SS: Left unsaid was anything about a big event that capitalized the D in their family’s dysfunction. The shadow of a “thing” seemed to lurk, but what beyond general hardship might have cast it? Another dynamic we can only guess at is why Lucy and her siblings apparently preferred feeling ostracized in isolation rather than together as a team.TT: Lucy ultimately became a writer. Her motivation was a noble one: to help readers like herself feel less alone. A story that rings true emotionally creates an empathetic reader/writer bond. Truth can sound like ""a child crying with the deepest of desperation,"" (though I doubt Lucy would allow it to appear overwrought). A fellow writer who served a short while as a mentor told Lucy we all have one story to tell. Lucy was told by another friend that she needed to write ruthlessly.SS: One question that occurred to me was whether “truth” is possible when there are lies of omission? It seems a relevant thing to ask in light of Lucy’s vague imputations. But then we may decide that reactions can feel real even when the causes are unknown. We may also wonder whether the “one story to tell” line suggests something the mentor may have had in common with Lucy – some sort of life-shaping trauma or sorrow. (One small tile showed how both Lucy and her instructor jumped out of their seats when a cat suddenly entered the room.) A clear-sighted vision of whatever this thing may be could inform an entire world view as well as the story one tells to represent it. And when that truth is an ugly one, a writer has to be ruthless to be honest. Coupled with that honesty, though – and this might just be the crux of it all for our protagonist, Lucy – is acceptance.TT: Thinking of this  as a kind of mosaic itself, it seems I’m working with even fewer tiles than Strout was. 1) I look at her themes and profiles and applaud the pixelation. 2) I like the greater truths that spring from fiction even when their roots are unknown. And 3), I argue that her book inspires in subtle, less clamorous ways.SS: OK, so maybe meta-mosaics don’t really work. Plus, I’ll admit that flogging a metaphor is one thing; but it’s quite another to maim it....more",Notes are private!,0,98,1,not set,Mar 2017,"Apr 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25893709-my-name-is-lucy-barton

I took a quick look at Nathan Hill’s photo and immediately thought: young guy, kind of a bro, probably pretty full of himselfFirst off, a confession. I took a quick look at Nathan Hill’s photo and immediately thought: young guy, kind of a bro, probably pretty full of himself. And when I learned this was his first novel – a long one at that – I figured on narrative sprawl and other excesses. Would he be judicious enough to drop weaker scenes? Could he bear eliminating superfluous modifiers? Would every perceived insight seem indispensable? But the book was producing a buzz, one Santa figured would suit me. I’m glad. It was clear early on that Hill would breathe real life into his characters. He’d be thorough, but not boring. He’d span quite a few years, mostly 1968, 1988, and 2011, doing enough homework to get the details of each setting right. I was especially impressed by his account of Daley cops thumping heads in ’68. And those insights I was afraid he might overvalue? They turned out to be genuine, even vital. The plot is hard to summarize so I’ll just touch on the highlights. Samuel Andresen-Anderson is a failed writer in his 30s teaching English at a liberal arts school near Chicago. He’s getting more disenchanted by the year. His solace is an online role-playing game called World of Elfscape, though as solaces go, it’s a hollow one. Much of his angst stemmed from childhood when his mother abandoned him. A more immediate problem is a student he caught plagiarizing – one talented at working the system, meaning more trouble for him than for her. (My wife who used to be in academics got a jolt of déjà vu from this section.) Then there’s news of his mom. National news. She had been arrested for throwing gravel (or rocks, depending on who’s reporting it), at some reactionary, nut-job politician. Faye (his mom) was suddenly back in his life. The news teams were quick to find photos of Faye among the protesters in Chicago in ’68, all unbeknownst to Samuel. He had thought she’d lived a quiet life in Iowa, marrying her high school sweetheart soon after graduating. Now she needs help that he’s wary of giving. That’s the launching pad. The plot shoots off in multiple directions from there, much of it backwards in time. Among other things, you get a boyhood friend into war games, the friends’ twin sister (a violin virtuoso and object of Samuel’s devotion), Faye’s undeserved miseries growing up, her father’s story dating back to his youth in Norway, Samuel’s gaming friend with an online addiction that’s plausible and scary, and Samuel’s literary agent who has his finger on the pulse of a nation replete with schlock, cynicism, and sanctimony. Oh, and I almost forgot. You get the Nix. This is a kind of house spirit that means different things to different people. I thought of it as combination of folklore and conscience, prejudicially deciding whether you deserved a pat on the back or a boot in the pants. Young Faye’s was quick to accuse and slow to let go.It’s a big, multi-themed book that some have labelled a mess. But in my mind the ambition paid off. For a while, I’ll admit, I felt like certain sentences could have been honed. For instance, when you read that “she was accommodating, docile, self-effacing, compliant, easy to get along with,” does it feel like the thesaurus was overworked, drained, exhausted, worn out? That feeling of excess soon went away, though. I’d lost myself in the story and thought not a whit about style. I’m sure I’m not the first person to notice a recent ing phenomenon where any societal ill that a book tackles is interpreted with orange-colored glasses. That Trumpian tincture now shades everything, it seems. We may well expect to hear how frightening and dire the darkness to come will be in Goodnight Moon given the looming shadows of the current administration. Even so, I feel like the applicability in this case is worth mentioning. Hill finished writing The Nix in 2014, a time when real estate and reality TV were enough to sustain Trump’s ego. While it may not seem as remarkable as Sinclair Lewis’s It Can’t Happen Here, Hill’s preconceptions do seem uncanny. His Republican presidential hopeful was an anti-elitist, anti-immigration demagogue, not above ""callously milking this minor distraction (Faye’s gravel) for all it's worth."" (Or was he ""bravely continuing his campaign despite tremendous personal risk?"" It depended on the cable news personality doing the reporting.) And how about this quote by Samuel’s agent for describing a balky electorate? ""...it's way easier to ignore all data that doesn't fit your preconceptions and believe all data that does. I believe what I believe, and you believe what you believe, and we'll agree to disagree. It's liberal tolerance meets dark ages denialism. It's very hip right now.""As for the assortment of other themes, Hill had plenty of thoughts covering those, too. Samuel’s aforementioned agent was entertaining as he attempted to justify commercialism in the arts. Selling out is honest when your stated goal is financial success (or something to that effect). Then there was a mini-motif on the vacuity of social media. The plagiarizing student had an app that allowed her to state which among a predefined set of emotions she was feeling. Friends could then respond accordingly with a feeling of their own, presumably something like “glad you’re happy” or “sorry you’re sad.” For convenience, there was an auto-response mode where the app would choose reactions for you. I’m sure I’m not the only one who would want an option for feeling cynical. Samuel’s gaming buddy, Pwnage, gave Hill a chance to expand on yet another theme: the perils of online addiction. (Hill said he had once been a World of Warcraft junkie, enough so to know the type.) The alternate realities can impinge on the primary ones pretty easily when you like your avatar better than yourself.Pwnage did offer Samuel some useful advice from his gaming experience. He would approach each problem as either a trap, an obstacle, or a puzzle. Applying this to people, Samuel figured “if you see people as enemies or obstacles or traps, you will be at constant war with them and with yourself. Whereas if you choose to see people as puzzles, and if you see yourself as a puzzle, then you will be constantly delighted, because eventually, if you dig deep enough into anybody, if you really look under the hood of someone's life, you will find something familiar.” This homage to empathy reverberated. In fact, had this willingness to dig into each character been Hill’s only accomplishment, it still would have been quite a book. On top of that, though, we get top-notch storytelling, some strong commentary, a bit of fun and entertainment, and maybe enough hope for the future that even those wearing orange-colored glasses may feel encouraged.I’m giving this a very solid 4.5 stars. Evidently J.J. Abrams really liked it, too, since he now has the TV rights to produce it. What’s more, Meryl Streep has signed on to play Faye.

Good thing for me that it's about others because what Marra described in this book sounded awful. We got chopped off fingers, burned down houses, torture-induced ratting, and a whole host of other atrocities. It was set in Chechnya in 2004 with much of the story backfilled from the prior decade of war. Russian politics and regional dynamics were deemphasized, though, so it was somewhat generically about any oppressed, occupied state. The focus was clearly on the human side. Three main characters filled the pages. The story began as eight-year-old Havaa watched her house burn down from the relative safety of the forest she was told to hide in when the Russian soldiers arrived. She became far safer when neighbor Akhmed, a kindly but inept doctor, walked her to a hospital where there was one remaining doctor, a Russian named Sonja. His best hope for Havaa was that the brusque but talented Sonja would take the girl in. Havaa was precocious, and was maybe one of the few people in Sonja’s league intellectually, so that helped her odds. But these things have to develop at novel-length pace, right? The cumulative conflict along the way has to reach a tipping point. A secondary set of characters got POV spotlights as well, including Akhmed’s physically and mentally compromised wife, Havaa’s loving father who had just been taken away, Sonja’s beautiful (better liked, now missing) sister, and an old villager named Khassan who had written a massive history of the Chechen people. Khassan’s son, a pariah for informing on his neighbors, had a story, too – a sad, multi-sided one. The title came from an old medical textbook Sonja owned. “Only one entry supplied an adequate definition, and she circled it with red ink, and referred to it nightly. Life: a constellation of vital phenomena--organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.” Marra no doubt wanted this to apply more widely to his entire book, with life intensified by perils of death. Did he succeed? Well… I’ve been trying to sort that out. It’s safe to say that he’s a young man with promise. And I give him plenty of points for ambition. The parts I’d criticize are really a matter of taste. I know, too, given all the stars this one gets from discerning friends that my own view is not the popular one, but I did find it a tad overdone. This may seem odd coming from a guy whose catch-phrase is “Nothing exceeds like excess,” but at times I felt that A Constellation of Vital Phenomena was an entanglement of florid descriptors or maybe an agglomeration of symphonious hyperbole. More than once I got a sense of him in a creative writing class, vying for teacher’s pet status. The structuring was fine, with the to-and-fro in time generally adding interest. He did have this quirk, though, were he’d randomly fast-forward the life of some insignificant character, telling us for no apparent reason that, say, twenty-eight years after the war a nameless sentry we just met retired from his career as a teacher. It was a device that called attention to itself, and risked breaking the spell. Better to crawl deeper into the skin of someone we’re meant to care about.I’m giving this 3.5 stars and rounding to 4. The vitality is there, as is the poignancy. The fact that I debated my own feelings about it meant that he made me think, which I should count as a good thing. I’ll be interested to see what a few years of ripening will do to Marra as a writer. It's a good bet his book of short stories, The Tsar of Love and Techno, will influence my eventual view....more",Notes are private!,0,115,1,not set,Feb 2017,"Feb 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18428067-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

I started out as one of the former (conditioned, no doubt, by fear of library fines), but became one of the latter. Cat’s Cradle was my first prurient experience, dating back to high school. Part of the reason was that I snagged my copy at a garage sale for a dime – cheap even then. But the real motivation was to highlight this great little rhyme:Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;Man got to tell himself he understand.That one deserved stars, a yellow marker, and the granddaddy of all desecrations – a dog-ear. I liked how it was framed as such a natural conclusion to the activity of thinking. We tell ourselves that our efforts to understand have paid off. If I’m honest, I don’t recall much of the book’s premise. I remember thinking Vonnegut was one of those cool, sort of counter-cultural writers who wielded his satirical axe well. He may have been a bit darker than Tom Robbins, and less playful with his words, but he was similarly entertaining, incisive and free-wheeling. The book tracks the unusual offspring of the man who invented the A-bomb. They possess a substance called ice-nine that can make water freeze at room temperatures. And you can imagine what might happen if it fell into the wrong hands. The Russians and Americans procured some as did the dictator of a secluded Caribbean island where a religion called Bokononism is practiced despite being illegal and, according to Bokonon himself, based on lies. Still, anything that sells “living by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy” will have its appeal.Vonnegut would poke fun at religion, politics, and just about any other human institution where our base natures hide in some gussied up form. And he may well have had a point. If I remember this cautionary tale correctly, a follow-up poem of my own might apply:Monkey got to play, fish got to swim;Man got to risk his life to some psycho’s whim.Monkey got to doze, fish got to coast;Man got to rest assured he won’t become a ghost.And it may give us pause....more",Notes are private!,0,126,1,not set,Jan 1974,"Jan 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle

His stories are fast-moving, his characters are recognizable, and his words entice without adornments. In fact, I like him so much I read this to become a completist. You might imagine that a memoir by a writer of his caliber would be a crowning achievement, and you’d be right for parts. But he chose a fairly narrow focus that in my mind weakened the whole. While I don’t doubt that his main subject – mother Jean – was a profound influence, I found myself wishing that the other drivers shaping him weren’t crowded out by her dominance. Jean had a “nervous condition” that impacted young Rick more than anyone else. Rick’s dad, a gambler with little tolerance for the home situation, had run off early on. Jean, while supportive in a collusive sort of way, learned to manipulate her son well enough to pull his strings even into adulthood. Russo’s wife must have been a saint to put up with all the different do-overs they provided for Jean. Her condition, a severe inability to cope, was undiagnosed during her life, but was later discovered to have been OCD. It certainly gave young Rick a writer’s feel for emotional hardship and conflict. After reading this, I concluded that Russo comes by his empathy honestly. And he’s constitutionally incapable of a bad sentence, though he can write a redundant one. The number of times Jean would buck herself up saying, “I’ll just have to give myself a good talking to,” was well into double figures.As big a fan as I am of Russo, I was hoping for more. There was so little of anything other than these difficult interactions that would count as character-shaping. An interesting exception was when he described his hometown in upstate New York. Gloversville, known in better days for its tannery and ladies’ gloves, was the kind of place he has written about so convincingly in Mohawk, The Risk Pool, and Nobody’s Fool among others.

It’s a tradition I’ve enjoyed with my dear wife, family and friends (with my old neighbor, Mrs. Sundquist, as the exception after she’d been hitting the pickled eel jar). I can also make KISS a mnemonic to apply here – a reminder to Keep It Short, Steve. (My original version was KISSSSSSSS for “Keep It Short, Spiel-Spewing Soapbox-Spouting Stupor-Stretching Stupidass,” but that would be silly and self-controverting.) Anyway, I hope to start clearing the backlog from my to-be-ed list with a few abbreviated remarks.Spurious is easy to summarize. You know the expression about the excitement of watching paint dry? Well, this one was a variation where the narrator, Lars, watched mold grow on the walls of his flat. That, and he’d philosophize (though not deeply or well) with his academic friend and rival known as W. They’d go on at length about the nature of their own idiocy, and how meaningful insights would be theirs if only a proper (absurd) set of conditions would prevail. It was a kind of running joke about academia and the over-examined life. I smiled more often than you might think. The put-downs were often clever since Lars and W. knew their shared vulnerabilities well. Here is but one of the countless examples:W., as usual, is reading about God. God and mathematics, that's all he's interested in. Somehow everything has to do with God, in whom W.'s not capable of believing, and mathematics, which W. is not capable of doing. And he's reading about God and mathematics in German, W. says, which means he doesn't really understand what he doesn't understand.Other ers have likened this to Waiting for Godot, and I can see that. There’s meant to be something beyond the inactivity. I can’t be sure, but I think the “something” is a sort of meta-existentialism. (I also can’t be sure if I’m joking here or not.) It’s a slim, seemingly insubstantial book, but anything fueled by heavy drinking and references to Kafka has got to have abstract, fuzzy, and metaphorical foundations, right?I opted for three stars, though at times thought it warranted four. In the end it seemed like whatever the point was, it was belabored. I remember thinking of those more experimental Saturday Night Live skits late in the show that would go to senseless extremes flogging the same basic joke. At least Iyer’s target was a fun one: his own chosen profession.

They surveyed a wide cross-section of people to provide unbiased reactions to my reading list. I figured their feedback would be more honest than what I’d hear from my kind friends on Goodreads who might be reflexively and/or uncritically supportive. Well, imagine my surprise when I learned that this same polling agency no longer exists. When I visited their website it basically said, “Blank you and the white, non-urban, non-college-educated horse you rode in on.”So my format has to be different this time. I’ve been busier and more backlogged than usual this year and haven’t ed many books. What I’d like to do, then, is to use Fionnuala’s inspired vehicle for sharing to provide capsule s of the handful of books I didn’t get around to writing about previously.2016 by George Orstradamus – This famous dystopian allegory written in 1984 tells the story of how pigs became the ruling class of a society in decline. An orange-tinted pig with unusually small trotters emerged as the leader. Many females, regardless of species, were castigated (ironically) as sows. Despite valid environmental concerns within the sty, foul odors were denied. The protagonist was an official within the Dept. of Post-Truth Politics responsible for news releases that may not have been in all cases wholly factual. A consistent theme seems to have been the thirst for power entirely for its own sake – well, that and maybe a little profit. The book also featured dogs who would respond in a Pavlovian way to various tones coming from small devices that had become their primary source of communication and entertainment. The rest of the book was just as far-fetched.How Not to Downsize by Susan Ho – This was quite a timely read for me and my wife. We moved from our family-sized house in the suburbs to a high-rise apartment in the city last spring, and needed advice on how not to do it. Then we pretty much did exactly what Ho said not to do. The first what-not-to-do tip was not to make it a fast and furious affair. By the time you’re to the fourth box in the fifth closet, the “does it give you joy” criterion goes out the window, because there’s precious little joy to be had at that point. We were also told to dispose of old tax returns and financial statements with care. Contravening her wisdom, the flames of the fire I built with them were licking the fireplace mantel. Ho also mentioned that a dog in a high-rise is not the same as a dog with a fenced backyard. The biggest difference, though, was in reading advice as opposed to following it. The Goat, Bound and Gagged by Theo Epstein and Joe Maddon, with forward by Steve Bartman – In case you hadn’t heard, the Cubs finally won a World Series. It had been 108 years of futility and occasional near-misses. Oh, and that damned Curse of the Billy Goat. This riveting account came out two days after the deciding game. It may seem surprising that they were able to piece the book together so quickly, but drama like this (a seven game series, decided in extra innings of the final game with a fateful rain delay allowing the Cubs to collect themselves after blowing a big lead) writes itself. Even so, I’m still impressed by their timeliness. Champagne hangovers are some of the worst.Monkey Fixiones by Collectively Anonymous – The Jorge Luis Borges Society decided to follow up the great master’s thoughts concerning infinite time, infinite libraries, and infinite turns in the labyrinths of life with a bold experiment. It’s actually a rather clichéd speculation: that a sufficiently large number of monkeys typing away over a sufficiently long period of time would eventually reproduce Shakespeare. Monkey Fixiones is attempt number 5,288,314,159,654, and was deemed to be the closest one yet. My favorite line was one Goodreaders should appreciate: “To thine own shelf be true.” If I’m honest, though, most of the rest was just gibberish.Pemberley’s Groom by Elinor Bennington – As proliferated as the space of Jane Austen fan fiction now is, I was surprised to find that the P&P perspective from the stables had not yet been covered. Miss Bennington has remedied that, with the verbal aplomb of a Regency Period parlor. I leave it to the reader to discover whether the horse whispering at the end was an incandescently happy encounter or not. Slight of the Invisible Hand by Adam Schmeichel – According to the author, modern financial markets are now entirely synthesized by a cloud computing network in New York, a giant data warehouse in Silicon Valley, a small cabal of rogue traders in Chicago, and an algorithm written by an autistic French physicist co-located on servers in Tokyo and London. And anyone who isn’t connected in to this is bound to be a chump. Fillmore by Ron Manuel Mirandow – For those of you who are not as familiar with opera, Mirandow is the librettist who put the Millard Fillmore story to song. The drama crescendos when Zachary Taylor dies and Fillmore becomes lucky President number 13. Be sure to find the version with the accompanying CD of the opera itself. The famous aria highlighting the endorsement the Know Nothing Party gave him in 1856 is not to be missed. Hunch: Thinking With Your Gut When Your Gut Has Mush for Brains by Malachi Tidwell – The basic premise of this book is that much of human progress comes from trials that are mostly errors. A sort of decision-making Darwinism plays out whereby the people who are bad at playing their hunches (the majority) become less likely to have many options left, meaning that the less faulty minority will make a greater number of the important calls. Books like this succeed or fail based on the examples they give. Fortunately for Tidwell, he hit the mother lode with reality TV. In the end, though, I couldn’t help thinking of the book’s implications for my own life. Having read it puts me on what’s sure to be a less consequential decision-making path. And now I’m second-guessing my decision to hit “Save.” Oh, what the hell.

Hey everybody, it’s meant to be – yoAs an urban commuter I felt that pulling a book out with lawn jockeys on the cover should come with a disclaimer. Hey everybody, it’s meant to be – you know – ironic. It’s written by a black guy; it’s satire. And just so you know, my iPhone doesn’t have one word of Breitbart News on it.Satires, to me, are like hoppy craft beers. The natural skew to the bitter side should be balanced out for optimal flavor. Paul Beatty’s deft touch with a joke made the astringency you’d expect from charges of racism something other than a straight diatribe. Smiles open more minds than they close.The premise of the book is actually sort of absurd. Bonbon, the narrator, farms the land in the “agrarian ghetto” neighborhood of LA called Dickens. His father was a sociologist who performed half-crazy, race-centric experiments on him when he was young that never amounted to meaningful research, but did mess with his mind a bit. When his father died (shot in a police snafu), the son inherited the farm, a funeral bill, and a legacy of racial awareness. Then, since it was an embarrassment to the city of LA, Dickens just disappeared from the map. At that point our narrator mounts an informal campaign to bring Dickens back. He makes signs announcing that a driver is entering, draws lines surrounding the area, then hits on the idea of segregating it to really stand out. He had an accomplice named Hominy Jenkins, a celebrity of sorts, known for being the last surviving cast member from The Little Rascals. Hominy, like the more famous Buckwheat, was a ""pickaninny"" who could “black it up” with bug eyes and electrified hair on cue. Somehow Hominy had it in his increasingly senile head that race had more meaning to him then and that a way to recapture this feeling was to offer himself up as a slave doing light labor (he was old) on the farm. The book opens out of order, with this voluntary slavery case being heard by the Supreme Court. Like I said, it’s kind of ridiculous, but it does allow a very full discussion of race – the stereotypes, the archetypes, and a panoply of attitudes from subtle to extreme.What the book lacked in plausibility it made up for in presentation. It’s like a serious essay on black consciousness as presented by Dave Chappelle at his edgy, observational best. Let my try to convince you by way of example. § As Bonbon’s court case was making its way up the judicial ladder, he said: “In neighborhoods like the one I grew up in, places that are poor in praxis but rich in rhetoric, the homies have a saying -- I'd rather be judged by twelve than carried by six. [...] I'm not all that streetwise, but to my knowledge there's no appellate court corollary. I've never heard a corner store roughneck take a sip of malt liquor and say, ‘I'd rather be ed by nine than arbitrated by one.’""§ He wondered why a certain successful type would mostly “talk black,” dropping g’s in their gerunds, but when it came to their public television appearances, they’d sound like “Kelsey Grammer with a stick up his ass.”§ Opining about another black intellectual: “Come on, he cares about black people like a seven-footer cares about basketball. He has to care because what else would he be good at.”§ Foy Cheshire was a prominent archetype who hosted a dying cable show focusing on black issues, had become successful stealing ideas from the narrator’s father, and had no original thoughts of his own. Foy was the one who had dubbed Bonbon ‘the sellout’ for not buying into a very particular brand of racial animosity. Someone speculated that “If he (Foy) was indeed an ‘autodidact,’ there's no doubt he had the world's shittiest teacher.”§ In one of the few non-race-related comments, Bonbon said: “I've always liked rote. The formulaic repetitiveness of filing and stuffing envelopes appeals to me in some fundamental life-affirming way. I would've made a good factory worker, supply-room clerk, or Hollywood scriptwriter.”§ Hominy was actually pretty lucid for someone who sought beatings and servitude. One example: “You know, massa, Bugs Bunny wasn't nothing but Br'er Rabbit with a better agent.”§ Here’s a great rejoinder to all who suggest, “You'd rather be here than in Africa. The trump card all narrow-minded nativists play. [...] I seriously doubt that some slave ship ancestor, in those idle moments between being raped and beaten, was standing knee-deep in their own feces rationalizing that, in the end, the generations of murder, unbearable pain and suffering, mental anguish, and rampant disease will all be worth it because someday my great-great-great-great-grandson will have Wi-Fi.”§ I also liked the name that Bonbon imagined for the white-only school in his planned segregation – Wheaton Academy. In contrast, nonwhites had Chaff Middle School. The Wheaton/Chaff distinction was a big one.I laughed every time I picked this book up. And I’m certainly sympathetic to the essential plight, despite the anaesthetizing humor. In addition, though I didn’t catch every reference, my street smart IQ is now at least a little closer to triple digits. Plus, its recognition in winning the National Book Critics Circle award for fiction as well as the Booker Prize speaks to the quality of the writing. Beatty’s background in poetry comes through with great word choices and cadences. Even so, I had to dock one star. While it’s easy enough to see the satirical poke at wrong-headedness, it was harder to figure the purpose of Bonbon’s ironic prescription. I wouldn’t presume that the segregation was meant to provide more motivation for Blacks and Latinos, though the Chaff School’s rising performance numbers were cited as though they were a consequence of having been separated. (The fact is, though, there weren’t any white kids there to begin with.) Was it more like the arguments you sometimes hear about the advantages of an education at a traditionally black university? I couldn’t say. Nor do I think the counterintuitive premise was meant just for a laugh. My best guess is that the extreme actions – slavery and segregation orchestrated by a black man – were meant to draw attention to the still existing, more subtle forms of racism. There was a line in the book about how it’s illegal to shout fire in a crowded theater. Bonbon went on to say that he whispered ‘Racism’ in a post-racial world. Beatty himself, in interviews, is tight-lipped when asked what he thinks it all means.

It’s usually aEver notice how, on rare occasions, certain writers really stand out for their ability to capture the subtle and complex ways of folks? It’s usually a reason to celebrate since these insights are there for us to imbibe. But it may be a source of distress if what’s revealed is a difficult truth. For me, Wallace Stegner is that sort of author, and this book is one I celebra-hate. Actually, hate is too strong a word, even when it’s combined with a good thing. I should say I felt twinges of disappointment when recognizably human elements in the main character’s make-up prevented a greater happiness. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not looking for slants a la Hallmark. I just feel sad about opportunities missed, especially when those doing the missing are characters whose innermost thoughts I’ve been absorbing with interest. I’ve told you about the malaise. I might as well mention a big reason for it (as long as I’m careful not to reveal more than the back cover does). Joe Allston, a crusty 69-year-old former literary agent, and his kindhearted wife Ruth live a rather isolated life in northern California. They had lost their son tragically in surf-boarding accident 20 some years prior. To make matters worse, Joe felt there had been unresolved father-son issues when it happened.The story begins as a postcard arrives from an old friend from a trip Joe and Ruth had taken to Denmark. The extended stay there was, in part, meant as therapy to take their minds off their then-fresh and constant grief. It also allowed Joe to explore the small town where his mother had lived before shipping off to the states and having him. As chance would have it, they stayed with a Danish countess whose diminished circumstances required her to take in boarders. Astrid (the countess) was the one who sent the postcard. This sparked memories of the trip that Joe pursued even more by breaking out a journal he kept at the time. Ruth asked that he read it aloud so that she, too, could take the trip back in time.The first entries in the journal were set on the boat ride over. They had met an older couple, which prompted Joe to write descriptively about their ilk, and about censorious people in general.They sit in lace-curtained parlors and tsk-tsk on an indrawn breath, they know every unwanted pregnancy in town sooner than the girl does, they want English teachers in Augustana College fired for assigning A Farewell to Arms, they wrote the Volstead Act. Once they arrived, the focus of the journal shifts to the countess. They learn that despite her elegance and good breeding, she was getting the cold shoulder from society types. Her estranged husband, unbeknownst to her when they’d been together, had been a Nazi sympathizer. Later into their stay they learn something else that explains the perceptions of her peers, but it would be a spoiler to say any more. I will say that you may or may not buy into this revelation. I decided that for me it was just a side issue, and that the far more important part of the book was Joe’s exploration of self.This self under the scope was very thoroughly studied. Joe’s observational skills as a “spectator”, passively taking things in, were keen enough to recognize himself as a spectator, passively taking things in. This quote was telling:I was reminded of a remark of Willa Cather's, that you can't paint sunlight, you can only paint what it does with shadows on a wall. If you examine a life, as Socrates has been so tediously advising us to do for so many centuries, do you really examine the life, or do you examine the shadows it casts on other lives? Entity or relationships? Objective reality or the vanishing point of a multiple perspective exercise? Prism or the rainbows it refracts? And what if you're the wall? What if you never cast a shadow or rainbow of your own, but have only caught those cast by others?Relatedly, Joe seemed to regret his apparent detachment:That is the way the modern temper would read me. Babbitt, the man who in all his life never did one thing he really wanted to. One of those Blake was scornful of, who controlled their passions because their passions are feeble enough to be controlled. One of those Genteel Tradition characters whose whole pale ethos is subsumed in an act of renunciation.But might there have been times, thinking of what the journal hinted at but omitted, when passions were less tepid? And might actions or inactions in the face of these be even more defining in his life? See, I know the answers to these questions, and the only way you will is to read this masterful book. While I don’t rate this one quite as high as Angle of Repose or Crossing to Safety, that’s a standard few, if any, can surpass. Stegner was just about Joe’s age when he wrote it, and advancing years were a theme. As sour as old Vin de Joe had become, I’d have preferred a cheerier example to live by. Beyond that, lines like this are beginning to hit home:[...] I felt an uneasy adolescent peeking from behind my old-age make-up, as if I were a sixteen-year-old playing Uncle Vanya in the high school play [...]Hey, but at least I wouldn’t call my face a “spiderweb with eyes.” Not yet, anyway. Quibbles aside, here’s the bottom line: Wallace Stegner is the real deal. With him, it’s insight and great writing on every page. I hope you all do yourselves the favor of his wisdom and art....more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,not set,Oct 2016,"Dec 01, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11045.The_Spectator_Bird

The antidote, as I’m sure you’ve all figured, is Richard Russo. His latest, a return to North Bath in upstate New York, offers a ready answer: they have lives. We who are high on our horses may look down and not see it, but these people have conflicts, interactions, feelings, flaws, and wisdom – pretty much the same as everyone else. Their economic engines may sputter at times, but they get by. Everybody’s Fool follows Nobody’s Fool, one I rate near the top of all time. The earlier book was all about Sully, a man of apparent contradictions. He’s a bit rough around the edges, but with an obvious charm; he makes poor decisions, but is quick-witted and bright; and he’s an authority-flouting scofflaw with a strong moral sense. Paul Newman played him to perfection in the movie version, which I also recommend unreservedly. I went into this book fearing sequelitis. What if it was like the movie version of Gilligan’s Island, where a perfectly brilliant sit com morphed into cheesy, chaotic nonsense? (OK, so maybe that’s not the best example given how little morphing was required to achieve such a state.) More to the point, what if it became an exercise in redundancy – character stasis, setting stagnation, and ennui as the action unfolds? But no, ten years hence it was like visiting old friends you haven’t seen in a while. They’re still recognizable, but with interesting differences. The book introduced new characters, too. I only occasionally got the sense that Russo was cashing in on his earlier successes.Sully himself was largely unchanged, despite altered circumstances. He’d come into some money, thanks in part to his religiously played trifecta finally coming in. But then he got counterpunched with worrisome news from his doctor. As Sully’s friends could tell you, though, he’s the type to take everything in his stride. Sully’s sad sack friend Rub, is still as simple as ever, with his happiness driven entirely by time spent with Sully – well, that and cheeseburgers and beer. An old flame, Ruth, had become more just a friend, as wise to the ways of the world as Sully. Ruth’s husband played an expanded role just as his junk emporium expanded beyond the walls of their home. Their daughter had been married to a misogynist who was bad even by the standards of certain politicians. In fact, one of the major plot points involved this guy’s hateful nature. Sully and Ruth were especially skeptical about his having found God under a newly turned leaf.A fairly minor character in Nobody’s Fool was way more fleshed out in this one. It was the hapless police officer, Douglas Raymer, who we grow to appreciate far more when we see how he came by his self-loathing. He was dealing with a lot: an idée fixe involving an affair he suspected his wife was having right before she died, his competence as chief of police, and confusing (flirtatious?) interactions with the smart, sassy woman at department headquarters named Charice. In the movie Nobody’s Fool, Raymer was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was a bit part, but had this book been included as well, it would have been a role more worthy of the late, great actor.I suppose as character-driven as Russo novels typically are, it doesn’t hurt to list even more of the cast. There was a reprise for Carl Roebuck, the would-be player whose construction company “had about one swirl around the drain left, after which he'd be officially wiped out.“ Carl had some of the funnier lines if you’re at all partial to gallows humor. To wit:""We've come this far.""At this Carl snorted.""What? Sully said.""Nothing,"" Carl said. ""I was just thinking about Napoleon invading Russia.""Both Sully and Raymer blinked at this.""Also the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition and the Vietnam War,"" Carl continued. ""Not one of those clusterf*cks could truly commence until somebody said, What the hell. We've come this far.""The mayor, a former academic with good intentions, and his half-deranged wife, who was only really at home in an imaginary world on the phone with imaginary friends, also had parts to play. Charice’s twin brother, the urbane but unstable Jerome, was another concern in Raymer’s world. There were small roles for Sully’s son and grandson, too. Son Peter was often on his guard, though, as the following would suggest: “Any youthful enthusiasm he expressed for how his grandfather navigated the world Peter considered his duty to temper, lest the romance of the tool belt and barstool take root.” Miss Beryl, the kindly former teacher and Sully’s landlady in the first book, was no longer alive, but she did have a great line in one of the flashbacks: ""We don't forgive people because they deserve it,"" she said. ""We forgive them because we deserve it."" The fact that no one understands this, she said, doesn’t make it less true.But the biggest other character was [cliché alert] the town of North Bath. Russo makes us physically present in Ruth’s diner with burgers on the grill, in the low-rent housing where misadventures were sure to take place, and in the lesser of the two taverns that smelled of “stale beer and overmatched urinal cakes.” Russo was also clever to create a rival town, Schuyler Springs, which attracted the nice restaurants, which did not suddenly have funky smells seeping in with the muck, and, going back in time, did not have its spring waters run dry like North Bath did. The contrast was palpable.I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It might not have been quite as fresh as its precursor, but it still had plenty of humor, action, and humanity to recommend it. And with books like this, I’m a lot less likely to encounter a Sully, or even a Rub, and think how small their lives must be....more",Notes are private!,0,134,1,not set,Oct 2016,"Oct 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27068575-everybody-s-fool

But what we consume doesn’t always have to be good for us. This book was full of empty calories, processed to a point where pretty much every bit of literary goodness was gone. And I ate every bite. A Jewish kid with an absent father moved with his mother and aunt into a tough part of Brooklyn just prior to Pearl Harbor. He and his Japanese-American friend got pummeled on a regular basis. But this kid had moxie (a word more common at that time, I gather). He started writing to the Giants’ up-and-coming star third baseman. These exchanges evolved from wise-ass banter to a sort of charming surrogate father-son relationship – one where a phrase like “I’ve got your back” had real meaning. Then the bombs began to drop. It’s a promising storyline. Like I said, though, don’t go into this book expecting anything truly substantial. The kid, 12-year-old Joey, was never really credible – writing and receiving personal letters from FDR, performing in night clubs, formulating war strategies, and so on. And the ballplayer, Charlie, was never completely real despite the author’s attempt to take an inherently big-hearted guy and give him a few rough edges to make him seem plausible. The hero worthy of worship was never far beneath the surface, despite the concocted lunk-headedness. After a while, I decided just to go with it. Snobby as it may sound, I felt that stooping to their uncomplicated level was worth doing, with disbelief duly suspended. Does this have anything to do with the Cubs having the best record in baseball? You bet your sweet Astroturf-free ballpark 3 miles up the road it does. Aside from the fun baseball lore, there was a strong supporting cast: the Japanese-American kid who (no surprise here) had a difficult war, the singer who was sweet on Charlie and helpful to Joey, the aunt with the wisdom of an old soul, a love interest for Joey (think puppies), and a buddy for Charlie from the Giants, famous briefly for the first unassisted triple play in decades. The plot and all its staging were entertaining enough to hold my interest. And it moved about as fast as Tinker to Evers to Chance. (For those who don’t know baseball history, please imagine I just supplied the perfect metaphor for quick and graceful movement.) So no, this wasn’t the edifying read many Goodreaders (myself included) might typically seek out. But if you’re in the mood for candy-coated popcorn, peanuts and a prize, this may be just the thing. Much like the Michelin Guide in rating the concession stand at Wrigley, I couldn’t quite justify four stars for the book, though there’s a simple pleasure in both.

Then I looked at a few of the titles I’d read but not yet ed. One of them, Disgrace, by J. M. Coetzee, had potential given the situation that brought this about, but like I said, it’s best not to talk about that. A Ship of Fools is out for the same reason. Then one jumped out at me – the much-discussed Booker Prize winner of 2011 by Julian Barnes, The Sense of an Ending. The title certainly fits.While the story may not be fresh in my mind (it’s been three years since I read it), I do recall a heated internal debate concerning the main character, Tony. Did he ring true? Could I imagine myself in his shoes? The book actually fits for another reason, too. It’s all about memories, faulty and biased though they may be. I’m sure in a few years’ time I’ll look back on my GR experience and remember writing thousands of s, making millions of comments, and stockpiling near infinite good will from it all.As a glib student, oblivious to his own clichéd thinking, Tony once said that “history is the lies of the winners.” A more nuanced discussion followed, including a quotable line from their brightest, most philosophical friend Adrian: “History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation."" Later, the classroom discussion led to a related point: ""That’s one of the central problems of history, isn’t it, sir? The question of subjective versus objective interpretation, the fact that we need to know the history of the historian in order to understand the version that is being put in front of us.""Barnes was clever, I thought, to apply this theme to Tony’s more mature self-analysis. As a retiree in his sixties, once married, now divorced, father of a daughter he considers close (contrary to most evidence), and one who has led a rather quotidian life, Tony reflects on several key junctures from his youth. It’s clear he’s an unreliable narrator of his own story, but readily cops to it, and to his credit, is disturbed by it. ""What you end up remembering isn’t always the same as what you have witnessed."" I don’t consider it a spoiler to say that one of those memories concerned a girlfriend from his university days, Veronica, who dumped him and ended up with the aforementioned Adrian. Tragedy struck soon after that, and the reason Tony is so keen to revisit those memories is that Veronica’s mother bequeathed him Adrian’s diary. But Veronica was the one in possession of it, and was very reluctant to give it up. That’s all I’ll mention of the conflict, but as you may well have guessed, there’s plenty more beneath the surface.When I first considered this book for my final , it hadn’t occurred to me that there’d be so many ways to tie it to my own reflections. Please indulge me one last time as I take even more quotes from this book and relate them to my years on Goodreads.The retired and resigned version of Tony near the end of the book had this to say: ""… as the witnesses to your life diminish, there is less corroboration, and therefore less certainty, as to what you are or have been. Even if you have assiduously kept records— in words, sound, pictures— you may find that you have attended to the wrong kind of record-keeping."" When he mentioned those assiduously kept records, especially the pictures, I thought of Facebook. The right kind of record-keeping, to me, would be the thoughts and reactions on Goodreads. Those reflect something meaningful, and say more about what makes you you. Even so, as the memories of those who participated with you fade, so does your presence. At least I’m keeping my account active so that I don’t disappear altogether.Getting back to the topic of unreliability, older Tony said, “… perhaps it’s that same paradox again: the history that happens underneath our noses ought to be the clearest, and yet it’s the most deliquescent.” Like I said, it was a few years ago that I read this, so my own reliability should be questioned. I guess that means anything I say beyond this point is meta-unreliable. Be that as it may, I think it’s true that subjectivity, the lives we make for ourselves that read more like literature, and even outright lies often make our accounts more interesting.As one last indulgence, I swear, I’m linking past s that I feel speak to that last statement rather well. From 2015From 2014From 2013From 2008I had considered giving this book either five stars or one since those are the s that often contain the most passionate arguments and attract the most curious readers. But that isn’t my true sentiment. (Let’s assume that the truth is at least slightly important to me). This one is a solid 3.5 rounded to 4. Tony was a little frustrating at times for his unreliable Tony-centric views, but I did like the theme. Besides, that Barnes guy writes really well.Before I sign off, I want to extend a big THANK YOU to you all for making these years on Goodreads so rewarding. I’ve enjoyed the countless insights contained in your s, the entertainment value, the recommendations, the overly generous comments, and the nonstop thinking and fun.

OnBefore you laugh at or chide me for the long delay in presenting my 2015 reading retrospective, please give me a chance to explain why I’m so late. One of the main reasons for going through this exercise to begin with, it seems, is for the feedback. We hope that our friends will come to agree that our lists reflect well on us. But what if you’re like me and have friends here on this site who are preternaturally supportive, to the point of stretching credulity. They’re either too nice to be honest with you or they’re too biased in your favor. Once I recognized this, it seemed like a pretty fruitless endeavor. I therefore sought out an independent polling agency, gave them a list of my books of 2015 as well as my ratings of them, and had them ask a statistically unbiased sample of respondents whether they viewed my list favorably or unfavorably. I think it’s interesting to get breakdowns by different categories of respondents, too. For instance, how do transgender Catholic libertarians from South Carolina view my selections? Anyway, the delay came from the fact that the polling agencies have been swamped lately with the US primaries. But then yesterday my results finally arrived. Here are the highlights along with selected comments from participants.Executive Summary of Polling Results: Steve’s 2015 Reading ListFrom a random sample of 12,946 respondents the overall rating was 41% favorable, 46% unfavorable, with 13% offering no opinion. The margin of error is 1.5%. The modest skew to the negative is common whenever a disparate book list is presented to a broad cross-section of participants. The more interesting results come from the demographic breakdowns and how they deviate from the sample-wide benchmark.Among women surveyed, responses were 48% favorable and 41% unfavorable. Participants mentioned that while only 10 of the 27 books Steve read were written by women, several, namely the four Elena Ferrante Neapolitan novels and Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, get extra consideration for their intense focus on gender issues. Participants also commented positively on H is for Hawk and We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves for the centrality of the women within them. Those 55 years-old and above also leaned to the positive (50% favorable, 37% unfavorable). Participants from that group cited Wallace Stegner’s Crossing to Safety as a tour de force of mature writing. This was Stegner’s last work of fiction, capping a long career. On Teaching and Writing Fiction, a how-to book of sorts by the same author was also mentioned for its fully ripened wisdom. A notable subset from this group, those who self-identified as crusty late-middle-aged white guys, made a point of commending Let Me Be Frank With You, Richard Ford’s latest Frank Bascombe book.Social conservatives were not so favorably disposed. A mere 21% were positive, with 58% responding negatively. Many agreed that David Foster Wallace’s In His Own Words was enough by itself to disapprove of the list. One participant (whose neck seemed redder than most) remarked that a bandanna is fine for Aunt Jemima, but not for a man. Several evangelicals also faulted The Brothers K as a selection for essentially being too ecumenical (our word, not theirs).For those who support a Trump/Palin ticket, the results were indeterminate. Responses were 1% favorable, 3% unfavorable, and 96% no opinion. The most common comments were, “Who has time for books?!” and “Ya gotta be [effing] kidding me!”Self-identified birthers (presumably referring to Barack Obama’s imagined birthplace, not Ted Cruz’s) constituted another group that was less than impressed. Of the 27 books listed, 16 were by foreign authors. Of those 16, 8 were British. The Patrick Melrose Novels packaged in one volume along with the series finale At Last were exemplars. Disgrace, set in South Africa, added to the global mélange. Titles like those accounted for the meager 14% approval rating from these members that, as surveys suggest, tilt towards xenophobia.Educational breakdowns proved interesting especially when isolating those with multiple post-graduate degrees. This group particularly appreciated seeing Orfeo on the list. They mentioned that it’s unusual to see both science and the fine arts combined in such an intelligent manner. Richard Powers is not a household name, but in certain rarefied circles, having him on the list garners an approval rating north of 80%. As a bonus breakdown, we also surveyed respondents to learn their favorite genres. Among those who chose sci-fi, the favorable/unfavorable percentages were 46/41. Respondents most often mentioned The Martian as their reason to be positive. Quite a few also cited Station Eleven. Those who identified historical fiction as their favorite genre also viewed the list favorably (52% to 37%). Wolf Hall was the most commonly mentioned reason for a positive response. All the Light We Cannot See was another popular shout. Less common, but still strongly supported was former Booker Prize winner The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Fantasy fans seemed less pleased with the list. Their 31% favorable to 44% unfavorable ratio was driven by Steve’s lukewarm rating of The Bone Clocks (this despite much higher praise for other David Mitchell books). Finally, those who favor mysteries and crime thrillers were moderately impressed (48% positive, 40% negative), citing the Sherlock Holmes story The House of Silk and Carl Hiaasen’s Bad Monkey as reasons for support.- - - - - - -So that’s it for last year. I hope for a more timely and complete analysis for 2016 should this precedent to share and evaluate lists be continued.

In the case of Edward St. AubHow much wit, wisdom and fine writing can an author stuff into a novel yet still be, for me, less than fully satisfying? In the case of Edward St. Aubyn and the last of his Patrick Melrose novels, quite a lot. In a more perfect world, where denouements are de rigueur and the ones you’re rooting for triumph in glory, Patrick would have used his keen intellect and insights into human nature to find an engaging space for himself. But I guess At Last was too true to life for that, or at least too true to St. Aubyn’s life. (The book mirrors the author’s world very closely.) What could have been galvanizing events – his unsupportive mother’s funeral, his social milieu exposed for its superficiality, and his boys becoming better versions of himself – nudged him closer to mental well-being, but were lacking in punch. Instead, we get cleverness as an end in itself, humor as bitter as radicchio, and self-reflections that bordered on solipsistic.That said, I enjoyed the writing so much that it almost made up for any aversion I felt from the scant drams of growth. See from these examples if you agree.Patrick’s abusive father, David, is revealed for who he is in this passage: David sat in his dark glasses smoking a cigar, angled away from Patrick, a jaundiced cloud of pastis on the table in front of him, extolling his educational methods to Nicholas Pratt: the stimulation of an instinct to survive; the development of self-sufficiency; an antidote to maternal mollycoddling; in the end, the benefits were so self-evident that only the stupidity and sheepishness of the herd could explain why every three-year-old was not chucked into the deep end of a swimming pool before he knew how to swim.Patrick felt that his mother, Eleanor, who was ill-equipped to protect him as a child, was drawn to (quasi-) Christian charity instead.Eleanor had expected to meet Jesus at the end of a tunnel after she died. The poor man was a slave to his fans, waiting to show crowds of eager dead the neon countryside that lay beyond the rebirth canal of earthly annihilation. It must be hard to be chosen as optimism's master cliché, the Light at the End of the Tunnel, ruling over a glittering army of half-full glasses and silver-lined clouds.David’s friend Nicholas was almost as bad as David himself, but sometimes he made me laugh and cringe. Here he is opining about Porgy and Bess.How nauseating, thought Nicholas, a Jew being sentimental on behalf of a Negro: you lucky fellows, you've got plenty o' nuthin', whereas we're weighted down with all this international capital and these wretched Broadway musical hits.In a later exchange, Nicholas and Patrick drew different conclusions about David.'Oh, I disagree,' said Nicholas. 'He saw the funny side of everything.''He only saw the funny side of things that didn't have one,' said Patrick. 'That's not a sense of humour, just a form of cruelty.'Finally, fragile though it may be, Patrick settles into a new equilibrium.This flat, the bachelor pad of a non-bachelor, the student digs of a non-student, was as good a place as he could wish for to practice being unconsoled. The lifelong tension between dependency and independence, between home and adventure, could be resolved only by being at home everywhere, by learning to cast an equal gaze on the raging self-importance of each mood and incident. He had some way to go. He only had to run out of his favourite bath oil to feel like taking a sledgehammer to the bath and begging a doctor for a Valium script.With this last quote, there were aspects of the new Patrick that rang true; ones that said maybe he really was on the right track. St. Aubyn confessed to writing this as a form of therapy. Patrick’s recognition that his parents were themselves products of bad parents and unhappy lives, deserving of as much understanding as blame, confers a certain magnanimity. Maybe it wasn’t so stunted after all. I hope some of you read the series to form your own views. It’s entertaining, smart and possibly even enlightening. I wrote about the four prior Patrick Melrose novels here. That was a more thorough , meaning long-winded and overbearing.

I’d explain in detail, but that would spoil all the fun. Instead, as elliptically as I can, I’ll hint at their relevance with vague allusions. Sue was an orphan in Victorian London, raised among thieves. Despite the fact that in the hierarchy of larceny her lot were never more than petite bourgeoisie, Sue’s existence was not as Dickensian as it might have been. Baby farmer Mrs. Sucksby seemed to take a particular shine to Sue, and more or less raised her as her own. Then came a fateful day when Sue was 17. A “gentleman” of their acquaintance called on them with an intricate plan. Mr. Rivers, known to them simply as Gentleman, outlined his scheme to bilk a young lady the same age as Sue out of her inheritance. Maud, the young target, lived in a declining but still functioning country estate with a reclusive uncle. Sue was to pose as a lady’s maid and bolster Gentleman’s case for marrying Maud. Sue would then get a cut of the money. So you’re pretty sure you know what I mean by pigeon, right? As for “pearl,” you might imagine those shiny white things cast among swine, or, if you know Sarah Waters and her reputation for lesbian love stories, you might picture lustrous riches in more carnal terms. Part of what I like about this book is that, for reasons of reversed notions, I’m forbidden to elaborate. That means an easier , benefitting you and me both.I can say that the book is broken into thirds. Sue narrates the first part, Maud gets a turn to tell her side of the story in the second, and Sue takes over again at the end. Keenly observed perceptions and perspectives are keys to making this work. But then, things are not always as they seem. As a rule, I like surprises, and Waters gives us some good ones. After reaching critical mass, though, I began reading each scene suspicious of more. To be honest, it became a distraction.As for the palpability, you expect that from Victorian England, right? Mind you, we’re not talking about Mayfair here. This is the seedier side, where the muck, the rough edges, and the hard feelings truly are palpable. Separate from that, the rare moments of tenderness are also honestly felt. As are the relationships, predicated on what each thinks she knows about the other at any given time. I give Waters credit for making me think about surface relations, hidden agendas, and more visceral matters of the human heart.I suspect anyone who has read both this book as well as The Crimson Petal and the White is constitutionally incapable of avoiding comparison. I know I can’t. For me, Crimson Petal gets the nod in the novel-about-fascinating-women-set-in-Victorian-England run-off. It’s unforgettable for its plot, characters and writing. But this one shines, too. The writing is vivid, the language is colorful (even in the title – fingersmith for pickpocket), the plot is engaging, and the emotions are, uh – what was that word? – oh yeah, palpable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,108,1,not set,not set,"Dec 01, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45162.Fingersmith

In this case, it’s to allow my personal reading history with the talented Mr. Tóibín. The first book of his I read was the much-loved Brooklyn in 2010. In fact, I would have purchased the movie rights then and there if I’d had the spare millions lying around. Then I read The Master, his well-written deep-dive into the character of Henry James. That one didn’t strike me as cinematic, but it was engaging all the same. At that point, Tóibín was a big blip on my bodar* screen. That’s why, when my lovely half-Irish wife and I were on our magical tour of Dublin, I could often be found in the T section of its bookstores. I happened upon this collection at one of them. When I told the sales clerk that I’d enjoyed several Tóibín books in the past, she graciously corrected my pronunciation. I’d said TOY-bin (like Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein, expressing a prurient interest in Madeline Kahn and her “turban”). She told me it was actually CALL-um Toe-BEAN. So now we all know. I’m lazy when it comes to ing short stories. There’s no way I’m going to do even capsule summaries when it’s more than a handful in the collection. The best you’ll get from me is a few loosely related themes, an overall tone, and maybe a mention of an outlier or two. With that in mind:Common themes – love, displacement, lust, despair, gay life, loneliness, and as The Observer aptly noted, “the unvarying dilemmas of the human heart.”Overall tone – refined in its writing, raw in its emotion, powerful in its impact, and shifting in its people, places, and times.Outliers – actually, there was just one, and it was bad. First, let me establish the baseline apart from which this one story stood. In general, the characters seemed like real human beings. Their concerns many not have always been our concerns exactly, but you were caught up in their situations and cared about how they fared. The emotions were honest and the writing was superb. Of these other stories in the majority, each, for me, was in 4 and 5 star territory. Then there was “Barcelona, 1975.” I’d be willing to give Tóibín the benefit of the doubt if I had a clue which doubt it might be. Did I simply not understand the point? Was it to shock an audience with graphic gay sex? I don’t think so since readers who’d be spooked by that would not have made it that far anyway. Was it to show the perils of the libertine bathhouse culture at that time? Somehow that didn’t seem right either, since there was no hint that it was a cautionary tale. Nor was it sold as the most liberated and satisfying lifestyle a man of that persuasion could hope for. In fact, there was no emotion whatsoever. The closest equivalent I can think of is a set of instructions for assembling a bookshelf from IKEA. One part is inserted into another, and the parts may be different sizes, but that’s about all you get in the way of plot. That’s all the character development you get, too. Sorry, Colm, but that one stuck out like a sore thumb. Actually, I take that back. A sore thumb would have been the most interesting plot point in that story.

This one is beautifully written, scholarly, a bit sad, and ultimately uplifting. It’s been quite a success, too, both at the bookstores and with critics. Oh, and just so you know, our daughter used to request A is for Annabelle on a regular basis. That’s all the explanation you need for my lead-in. Macdonald structured the book very cleverly. It was part nature writing (lyrical and literary), part memoir (detailing both grief and good humor), and part biography (with T.H. White, author of The Once and Future King, as the subject). The nature writing had to do with her experience training a goshawk, a particularly challenging breed known for its large size, hunting skills, and cussedness. She is a naturalist and research scholar at the University of Cambridge Department of History and Philosophy of Science. She’s also a talented writer. I had a good feeling about the prose when she described her state of mind on the very first page: “I felt odd: overtired, overwrought, unpleasantly like my brain had been removed and my skull stuffed with something like microwaved aluminium foil, dinted, charred and shorting with sparks.” And with the added “i” in aluminium, I knew it would be English English, unalloyed, full stop. Helen must have been an unusual girl. As an eight-year-old, she would explore antiquarian bookstores with her father seeking out and devouring books on falconry. Many of the volumes were centuries old. She seemed to inherit her obsessive behavior from her father who, as a lad during WWII, would hang around for hours just outside airfields making detailed notes on all the different planes. Young Helen somehow bought in to the long European tradition of country gentlemen flying their birds. Years later, after her father died without warning, she hoped to escape her grief by immersing herself fully into training a young goshawk she named Mabel. (Not exactly the scariest of appellations, is it?) She did a great job going into the cultural history and the applied science of falconry, in general, and of goshawks specifically. Though she might have been tempted to soft pedal the bloody bits, she disclosed it all fully. In fact, she made a point of reminding us (and herself, as narrator) that a goshawk is a wild animal that defies anthropomorphism. Early in Mabel’s training she noted this:”Everything about the hawk is tuned and turned to hunt and kill. Yesterday I discovered that when I suck air through my teeth and make a squeaking noise like an injured rabbit, all the tendons in her toes instantaneously contract, driving her talons into the glove with terrible, crushing force. This killing grip is an old, deep pattern in her brain, an innate response that hasn't yet found the stimulus meant to release it. Because other sounds provoke it: door hinges, squealing brakes, bicycles with unoiled wheels -- and on the second afternoon, Joan Sutherland singing an aria on the radio. Ow. I laughed out loud at that. Stimulus: opera. Response: kill.While I’m on the topic of killing machines, I might as well highlight one of the best advantages a hawk has:”Her eyes can follow the wingbeats of a bee as easily as ours follow the wingbeats of a bird. What is she seeing: I wonder, and my brain does backflips trying to imagine it, because I can't. I have three different receptor-sensitivities in my eyes: red green and blue. Hawks, like other birds, have four. This hawk can see colours I cannot, right into the ultraviolet spectrum. She can see polarised light, too, watch thermals of warm air rise, roil, and spill into clouds, and trace, too, the magnetic lines of force that stretch across the earth. The light falling into her deep black pupils is registered with such frightening precision that she can see with fierce clarity of things I can't possibly resolve from the generalised blur.”Macdonald was strong on other aspects of her hobby, too. She was honest in analyzing herself and about how Mabel fit into the angst-ridden rebuilding process. Metaphors came naturally from piecemeal improvements and untethered flight. Helen and her hawk were often portrayed as one in the same, with the former’s powers of observation drawing the parallels close.I mentioned the mini-bio within the book earlier. To me, it was a key component in rounding it out. White’s story was included because he had written a memoir called The Goshawk that Macdonald had read as a girl. She said that he was far from being an expert. In fact, he often did the exact wrong things in attempting to tame and train Gos (the name he gave his hawk). But his book was more than just a flawed “how-to” book. Macdonald was keen to dig into White’s motivations and the reasons for his book’s other more literary and philosophical elements. She discovered that he had a particularly unhappy boyhood, that he was constantly challenging himself to confront his intense fears, and that his homosexuality was viewed at that time as a kind of mental illness. It was interesting to read what Macdonald discovered. She made ties to his early life, to his famous book about Arthurian legend, to a would-be sadistic streak, and to his attempts to train Gos.If there is any weakness in H is for Hawk, it may be in her descriptions of nature. To me, they didn’t wear well. Maybe if my vocabulary included more East Anglian flora, I’d think differently. This is a small ding, though, in an otherwise well-paced and well-constructed book.

The four short books packaged together as The Patrick Melrose Novels are at the extreme end of the risk-return spectrum. Edward St. Aubyn took big chances hoping the rewards would be commensurate. He risked alienating readers at every turn with characters who are loathsome or over-exposed. And with the depth of the interior development, the potential losses (and gains) in credibility were magnified. Fortunately, from this investor’s point of view, the gamble paid off. It helps to have a taste for an acerbic wit. Realize, too, we’re not talking about vinegar here; more like sulfuric acid.In novel number one, Patrick is only five years old, living with his family in the south of France where the money from his mother’s side of the family allows them to live haute on the hog. Forgive me for flogging the metaphor, but such dining offers no guarantee against indigestion. Patrick’s father, David, is the primary cause, though his lush of a mother can be faulted, too, for her lack of intervention. David came from an aristocratic English family. He had at one time been a talented pianist and had also been trained as a physician (though one who must have had his fingers crossed when he took the Hippocratic Oath). By the time of this story, he was vile and abusive. Hard-not-to-cringe abusive, in fact. Patrick was a bright boy and, by nature, quite brave, but he lacked the power to stand up to his father.Much of the first story took place at a dinner party attended by David’s imperious friends. Zingers like this were bandied about:'Nothing but the best, or go without'; that was the code he lived by, as long as the 'go without' didn't actually happen.'The dead are dead,' he went on, 'and the truth is that one forgets about people when they stop coming to dinner. There are exceptions, of course -- namely, the people one forgets during dinner.'But that's what charm is: being malicious about everybody except the person you are with, who then glows with the privilege of exemption.'These people were deplorable snobs, but I figured it was OK to laugh with them as long as I laughed at them, as well. Another subject in this first book was not at all laughable. Many s mention it explicitly, but I won’t in case any of you want to read it as I did without knowing. The impact is likely greater that way.In the second of the four novels, Patrick is in his early twenties and his life is a mess. He’s on a trip to New York to collect his father’s ashes. A dead father is not the source of his trouble, though – a rather nasty drug habit is. His trust fund money is running out fast as he attempts to achieve a delicate balance of smack, coke, booze, ludes, pot and speed. The logistics in maintaining just the right high are complicated, as are any attempts to function in front of his father’s old friends. This was an important novel for the context it gave regarding both Patrick’s life and that of his father who was also a product of family dysfunction. Book three, called Some Hope, delivers what the title suggests. Patrick is a little older and a lot less addled. The toxicity in this one stems from the shallow lives of the upper crust. A grand party in the English countryside is the primary setting, and one of the attendees is Princess Margaret. St. Aubyn had met her in real life and evidently took advantage of the royal distaste for libel suits because he painted her as the epitome of self-importance with unmitigated disdain for any who were less than sufficiently sycophantic. The cast of smug and disagreeable personalities in this book was a large one. In the end, many had simply merged into a single type. I took this book to be an exercise in self-discovery for St. Aubyn whose own background was not what you’d call ‘common’. He had to identify and ridicule the haughty behavior to set himself apart from it, at least partially. (He’s godfather to Earl Spencer’s son – Lady Di’s nephew – and still a bit of a toff.) His character, Patrick, comes across as well-educated, wicked, and funny; and still intractably damaged.The fourth book, Mother’s Milk, was short-listed for a Booker. I’m sure that many would find it unfair to single out this one alone for the honor since the first three did so much to take the story to that point. By now Patrick is married and the father of two remarkable boys who share his best traits. His wife dotes on them so thoroughly that there’s no affection left over for him. The bottle becomes his most intimate friend, with a mistress running a distant second. Patrick’s mother gives him trouble, too. She attempted to fill holes in herself by way of charity and ended up being taken in by the oleaginous charms of a New Age spiritualist who convinced her to donate the family estate to his cause. Patrick was essentially disinherited when his soft-headed mum fell prey to the charlatan. The series ends with a fifth book called At Last, but that was not included in this volume. I’ll  it separately. As you’re no doubt aware, I’m running long as it is.In case it’s not already obvious, Edward St. Aubyn is Patrick Melrose. He had the same abusive father, the same mother who turned the blind eye in his youth and later gave away their estate, and the same struggles with addiction. In fact, St. Aubyn said he’s lucky to be alive. One day in his early 20’s he woke from a stupor with a syringe in his arm containing what surely would have been a fatal dose had he been unimpaired enough to administer it hours earlier. It’s easy to see how these novels could be viewed as a form of therapy. St. Aubyn decided to present what might otherwise have been a “misery memoir” as fiction instead. He said, ""It's more flexible. It goes beyond the mere shrill advancement of a complaint or a confession. I'm more interested in the dramatic truth of how something like cruelty occurs. That can be presented much more persuasively through fiction.” These books are all about identity. As St. Aubyn said in the same interview, they address ‘Why we are as we are, and whether we have any choice in the matter. The entire Melrose series is explicitly about that, whether we can lead a voluntary life. The most primitive definition of freedom is being able to place your attention where you choose, and Patrick is someone who is drastically unable to do that. His attention is usurped by memories, by addictions, by obsessions.’ Does this deplorable determinism persist throughout? We’d all have to have read the entire series to discuss that. As of book four, though, Patrick was still sorting it out:Nobody ever died of a feeling, he would say to himself, not believing a word of it, as he sweated his way through the feeling that he was dying of fear. People died of feelings all the time, once they had gone through the formality of materializing them into bullets and bottles and tumours. Someone who was organized like him, with utterly chaotic foundations, a quite strongly developed intellect and almost nothing in between desperately needed to develop the middle ground. Without it, he split into a vigilant day mind, a bird of prey hovering over a landscape, and a helpless night mind, a jellyfish splattered on the deck of a ship. 'The Eagle and the Jellyfish', a fable Aesop just couldn't be bothered to write.Patrick is complicated. I enjoy that, even when the complications are messy. What I enjoyed even more was the writing. I’ve already included a few passages, but want to include a few more to show that it’s witty, wise and urbane.'It's I-find-everything-boring, therefore I'm fascinating. But it doesn't seem to occur to people that you can't have a world picture and then not be part of it.'He was just one of those Englishmen who was always saying silly things to sound less pompous, and pompous things to sound less silly. They turned into self-parodies without going to the trouble of acquiring a self first.Debbie's father, an Australian painter called Peter Hickmann, was a notorious bore. Patrick once heard him introduce an anecdote with the words, 'That reminds me of my best bouillabaisse story.' Half an hour later, Patrick could only count himself lucky that he was not listening to Peter's second-best bouillabaisse story.Four bright, shiny stars for this collection. I can’t quite give it full marks, though, because at times it got to be too much. A lighter touch might have played better over the long haul. I realize that books focused on exorcising demons require evil at cask strength, but the 'bad' to be analyzed in this was just so bloody ubiquitous. At times the cleverness got in the way, too. A character or a trait might have been described as both X and Y where X and Y were negatively correlated and slightly ironic. It was appealing the first few times, but a tad over-used in the end. Even so, when I look back at all the highlighted lines, I realize there were many fewer misses than hits. Recommended for those who can handle occasional excesses for the pleasures of high-risk returns. ...more",Notes are private!,0,103,1,not set,not set,"Sep 29, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11717571-the-patrick-melrose-novels

If you don’t know the premise of this book already, I decided not to be the one to tell you. As it happened, I did read this with foreknowledge and suspect I would have enjoyed it more without knowing the twist. Fowler gets to it soon enough. And if your jaw doesn’t drop, expect, at a minimum, to crack a smile.Sans spoilers, I can still set the stage. Rosemary Cooke is a university student in California and in most ways fairly typical. She deviates most notably with a desire to blend in quietly – that and an odd connection to a fellow student who had acted up in a very public way over a boyfriend. The more Rosemary tells us of herself, the more hints we get of an unusual past. She came from a loving and broad-minded family, but one that ultimately saw older brother Lowell and close-in-age sister Fern leaving home. The circumstances leading up to this are the driving force of the narrative, and a delayed aftermath propels the story from there.Shortening the summary now seems like an especially good call. With so much space left on the page, short-shrifting premise and plot, I won’t feel guilty going on about the writing instead. As the Booker committee would no doubt agree (they short-listed this for the prize in 2014, the first year American authors were eligible), it’s very well done. It’s stylish, witty and insightful, as I hope these examples support:""Antagonism in my family comes wrapped in layers of code, sideways feints, full deniability.""""Parents are too innocent for the Boschian landscapes of middle school.""""When I run the world, librarians will be exempt from tragedy. Even their smaller sorrows will last only for as long as you can take out a book.""""2012.

Family dynamics featuring loss often do. Despite the fact that most readers will have no first-hand experience relating to the Cooke family’s drama, Rosemary is such an engaging narrator that we can’t help but see clearly through her eyes.

As everyone knows, countless movies, books and shows have been produced Much game has been afoot post-dating Arthur Conan Doyle’s brilliant creation. As everyone knows, countless movies, books and shows have been produced featuring the great detective with varying degrees of consistency. But before Anthony Horowitz, none had had the blessing of the ACD estate. Why him, you may ask? I suspect it has something to do with the fact that he’s very good – a professional writer since the age of 20, an OBE honoree, creator and writer of one of my favorite TV series ever (Foyle’s War), and the one commissioned by the Ian Fleming estate to write the next Bond novel.As far as I’m concerned, Horowitz did a creditable job capturing the voice and feel of the original. The sentences were long and the language ornate, though not to the point of distraction. And as you would expect, the same characters and traits were showcased. Holmes would no doubt know in a single glance my way that I spent too much time on the internet last night, ate more spicy food than I should have for dinner, and was overly annoyed by the man on the morning train shouting Gujarati into his phone to explain figures on a spreadsheet. Watson, the good doctor, was always up for another adventure, and would always write about it later, faithfully and admiringly. Inspector Lestrade had a role, as did the Baker Street Irregulars and Sherlock’s brother Mycroft. Even a repeat nemesis got a trot out, but I won’t tell you who.I shouldn’t talk much about the plot either, aside from saying it had twists. Red herrings were de rigueur, as were improbable deductions. (That’s part of the fun.) Without divulging details, I will say the principal crime was pretty horrific. It was certainly conceivable, but I think ACD would have avoided it. That was one of the few aspects of the book that didn’t seem true to the canon. We made this our audio book of choice for a long road trip home. I find there’s an art to choosing these well. For one, it helps when the story is strong since the beauty of cornfields in Illinois might otherwise divert us. Also, since the words are all spoken, cadences matter. You want a kind of meter and flow, and this one delivered. Of course, the reader is most important. Derek Jacobi was more than up to the task, I thought.

Clarke Award, finalist for the PEN/Faulkner, nominated for the National Book Award, and a 4+ rating on Goodreads – this must be pretty good, right? A. It is. But the weight of expectations was immense. And I’m not above a reflexive anti-kowtow when twitterpated literati seem a little too consistent in their praise. Q. Twitterpated – is that something to do with tweets?A. Grr… let’s agree that I’ll be the one to make the jokes, OK? Like I was saying before, albeit multisyllabically, I calls ‘em as I sees ‘em. And to be fair, this is was very good, I just thought it fell short of amazing.Q. I suppose most people know this is a post-apocalyptic story. What, beyond that, is this about?A. Well, let’s see, the book revolves around a famous seasoned actor named Arthur Leander who is starring in a stage production of King Lear in Toronto. The story begins with him keeling over from a heart attack in the middle of a performance. The next day, in an unrelated but far more impactful event, a pandemic begins as a planeload of passengers with the Georgia flu lands, spreading the fatal disease. This wipes out more than 99% of the world’s population in less than a month. The rest of the novel flashes forward and back to tell the stories of main characters with one degree of separation from Arthur. (It was not mentioned whether “Linking the Leander” ever caught on like “Linking the Bacon” did.) There was the paramedic in training who tried to save Arthur. There was 8-year-old Kirsten, cast in the show, who saw her friend Arthur collapse. There was his good friend Clark who knew Arthur before he was famous. And there was first wife Miranda who spent much of her time creating a comic book set on a massive spacecraft called Station Eleven.Q. “Leander” as Lear? What do you make of that?A. I suspect the ties are pretty obvious. Powerful, aging guy with a strong sense of loss – seems to fit. BTW, when I do my fan fiction send-up of this someday, I’m going to have Morrie O’Thellian in the lead of a play about race, revenge and repentance. Q. Post-apocalyptic stories in general would have a lot potential for conflict and speculation. Did this fit the bill?A. It did, but as post-apocalyptic dystopias go, this one was rather understated. For one thing, there wasn’t a single zombie. And Mandel made a point of saying that this was not a science fiction book since it had no fictional technology. It did feature a religious crackpot known as The Prophet, who offered a particularly overt form of conflict, but the post-apocalyptic tension beyond that was what we might expect from standard stress-tests of human nature – issues having to do with safety, scarcity, and loss. Q. What is it about the genre that allows self-styled prophets to thrive?A. I wish I knew. I guess the compromised social structures make the masses, such as they are, more vulnerable. BTW, it also seems to me that deranged prophets invariably want new rules saying they should have multiple wives.Q. Sorry, I got you a little off-track there. Anyway, you were talking about societal breakdowns that a book like this has us consider.A. Right. I don’t know that it was Mandel’s primary point, but I got caught up wondering about how we humans, who may not be as evolved as we think we are, really would behave when survival is at stake. It’s a chance to imagine the logistics involved in taking care of basic needs: food, heat, shelter. And it offered a glimpse of what the world might be like without electricity or fuel to run motors. Are we meant to acquire an appreciation for things we may currently take for granted? To be honest, I found myself second-guessing Mandel on how things would likely play out 20 years after the fact, which is the furthest into the future the book went. Would it be like the Dark Ages? My initial guess was not so dire. Then I remembered two things: 1) Sociologists have shown how scientific advancement relies heavily on different groups in close proximity sharing ideas. That may be lost when so many of the population centers are decimated. 2) Without the internet, how many entrepreneurs would there be? Would there be a critical mass of know-how and incentives for basic industries to revive? But then, after having just read The Martian, my faith in the ingenuity of Man has returned.Q. All well and good, but as you said, this probably wasn’t the main focus. If not that then what?A. I’m thinking it’s something more general, something loftier and more literary. Memories and loss, culture and art – that all comes to mind. In fact, when young Kirsten got older, she joined what they called the Travelling Symphony, a troupe that performed music and plays. Their vision statement, if you will, was one they borrowed from Star Trek: Voyager: “Survival is insufficient.” That, I’m sure, is meant to resonate. Connecting by way of a shared culture and refined aesthetics is humanizing, especially at a time when trauma might otherwise dominate.Q. Not that labels are necessary, but you kind of brought it up – is this more genre fiction or literary fare?A. I’m no arbiter of such things, but it seems to me that Mandel is a literary writer who, in this case, found the tropes of a certain genre useful for framing her story and themes. The writing itself is pretty restrained. There were no examples where I thought she sensationalized the big event, instead letting the more subtle core of her story hold sway. Nor were there cases of literary preening. It was just a good, smart story with well-drawn characters to push it along. As literary fiction with a post-apocalyptic overlay, it’s both remarkable and nice that she avoided excess. Q. You’re clearly a fan, yet you rated this one star short of the best. What didn’t you like?A. I thought her themes were well chosen, but wished she’d done more to support them. Art is important! But I didn’t see any examples where anyone was moved by a performance. A cool looking paperweight was mentioned, and Clark became a de facto curator of a Museum with a noble goal to preserve some of the former world’s glory, but these were isolated cases. I also wished that Miranda’s Station Eleven comic books would have tied in to the main story more concretely. Q. OK, but 4 stars is still very good. Can you summarize the appeal?A. Sure. (And don’t think I didn’t notice your use of “summarize” as opposed to, say, “go on at length about.”) Good plot – held my interest well. Good writing – never overdone. Strong characters – my favorites (Miranda, Clark and Kirsten) were especially well done. And finally, if you’ll allow me to write a complete sentence with commas and parens to be true to my discursive nature, I liked the whole post-apocalyptic premise with the what-if questions Mandel made me ask, and though my experience with books of this type is limited (hell, I haven’t even read The Road), I think it’s interesting to speculate about outcomes since, you know, it might someday be relevant and we’ll need food, water, and weapons. Oh, and culture and art....more",Notes are private!,0,99,1,not set,not set,"Jul 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

For one thing, the cold winters would have prepared him for the climate on Mars. Plus, being a Cubs fan, he must have learned how to deal with disappointment, like when you get caught in a dust storm one week into a planned month-long stay on the Red Planet, a gust of wind impales you with an antenna forcing you face down onto the craggy surface with no vital signs registering from your spacesuit at which point your endangered crewmates assume that you’re dead and make good their escape. The conflict needed to drive the narrative was easy to come by on Mars. Mark starts his log on the first day in survival mode by characterizing the deep doo-doo he’s in. If his oxygenator were to break down, he’d suffocate. If the water reclaimer were to break down, he’d die of thirst. A breach in the Hab and he’d “just kind of explode.” Supplies that were left behind were limited, and the next Mars landing wouldn’t be for years, so even if the equipment didn’t fail, he’d starve. Actually, deep doo-doo isn’t strictly correct. With fecally enriched soil, he might have the means to grow food.Fortunately, in this battle pitting Man versus Mars, the man had evidently stayed awake in his science classes. Each crew member had two specialties. Mark’s were botany and mechanical engineering, but he seemed to know a lot of chemistry, physics, computer science, and astronomy, too. This was the book’s greatest strength – a real celebration of ingenuity and STEM-based problem-solving skills. Weir was apparently born to be geeky (a term I use with the utmost respect). His father was a particle physicist and his mother was an electrical engineer. Weir himself was hired as a computer programmer at a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin at the age of 15, and has been a total NASA buff for years. He is so good technically that he didn’t graduate from college, which I believe is one of the new standards signifying computer wizardry. Whether it was turning pee into rocket fuel, using a highly unstable isotope (Plutonium-238) for heat, or making water from Hydrazine (burning hydrogen to mix with the oxygen in the air), Weir gets the science right. NASA scientists also verified that the code he wrote to figure the orbital mechanics was correct. I was tempted to do one of those pictorial s, one with Jesse Pinkman celebrating Mr. White’s knowledge of chemistry with a “Yeah science, bitch!” But someone beat me to that particular punch.For a short while I tried coming up with my own solutions to the problems that Mark faced. It made me appreciate the guy’s resourcefulness even more, and it pointed out the holes in my own knowledge. Maybe I can blame it on all the econ courses I took, where the solution for opening a can of beans on a desert island is to assume a can opener. Arthur C. Clarke once said, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” To turn this line upside down and add half a twist, I could say that any science fiction written by Andy Weir is indistinguishable from hard science. Some readers may be put off by the technological emphasis, but I’m guessing most will appreciate the factual integrity, the clever way it was applied, and the conversational style Mark used in his logs to present it.For quite a while, the book was a chronological account based on those log entries. Then it cut away to NASA where satellite photographs showed evidence of Mark’s survival. That opened a whole new and necessary thread. His Earthbound crewmates entered the picture again, too. The changes in perspective quickened the pace.If I were to rate this by literary standards, it wouldn’t be great. The dialog was often wooden and the ancillary characters were stick-like. Any would-be verisimilitude by way of fuck-b’s, er, f-bombs were ham-fisted, and anything approaching a human feeling was seemingly beside the point. Strangely enough, though, this made me like it more. The nerdy lack of social fluency was consistent and it accentuated the appeal. Weir’s joy in writing it was palpable. It was initially done as a serialized blog with feedback from friends. In interviews, we gather that Weir would be Mark Watney if he could, though his fear of flying would be a sticking point. The author/fan-boy also said that he’s not as smart as Watney, but justified any super-human poise and intelligence to the fact that the guy is an astronaut. The hero worship of space travelers was genuine and kind of charming. Weir said that he also shares Watney’s sense of humor, which came across as sarcastic, slightly bawdy and at times a little goofy. Speaking of humor, that, too, is a Chicago trait, or maybe you’d call it a coping mechanism. Anyway, I liked it. One of his recurring jokes was to state how the disco music one of his crewmates left behind truly sucked. This is yet another Chicago thing, as my astute friend Dave can attest, having risked decapitation to witness it first-hand.Better writers would no doubt have created a protagonist full of angst and navel-centric reflection. But to me, Weir more than makes up for any dearth of emotional realism with his likable main character, an infectious enthusiasm and a sense of scientific wonder. Scanning the many great s of this book, it’s roughly equal numbers who compare Mark to MacGyver, for one, and to Robinson Crusoe, for another. References to the Gravity and Apollo 13 movies were also apropos. I suspect Ridley Scott’s movification starring Matt Damon will be quite a hit, too.

After careful consideration, we have chosen not to publish your work in its current form. However, we believe that with certain modifications, our mutual interests may be well-served. The senior editor in our Business and Management Division, Lee Gultender, has what we hope is an intriguing idea for you to entertain. He proposes that you use the same main characters from your present book as exemplars in a sort of executive handbook. Certainly, the leadership principles applied (or misapplied) by Henry VIII, Thomas Cromwell, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More, etc. would still be relevant to this day. The competitive landscape in the modern economy is not so different from that faced by King Henry and his court. Consider the analogs: the Papal authority restricting Henry’s preferred modes of operation compared to regulators of today stifling proposed mergers and favored business relationships, or, the obstacles that Cromwell artfully removed compared to board room meetings where only one competing view can emerge. In fact, the Wolf Hall title itself, with its allusion to the Latin Homo homini lupus (“Man is wolf to man”) reminds us that the opportunistic Cromwell with his treacherous agenda would fit in quite well in our present dog-eat-dog world.Our editor feels that with his guidance, you could emphasize specific personality traits that would truly resonate among the readers of our business and management titles. To be frank, as currently written, your literary focus and subtle dialogue would severely limit your audience. If readers have any appetite left for protracted historical fiction, Sharon Kay Penman and Philippa Gregory will surely sate it. If, instead, you could couch successes and failures in terms of executive behaviors that brought them about, your characters would come alive with significance. Imagine the lessons to be learned, good and bad, from: » Cromwell’s impressive rise from working-class roots.» The conspicuous loyalty Cromwell showed to Cardinal Wolsey in the face of changing sentiments. » The benefits of knowing thy enemy – knowing his business, his language, his weaknesses. Cromwell used this awareness to great effect, and would no doubt do the same today negotiating with even the cagiest of counterparties.» It’s all well and good as the leader’s right hand to take opposing views, but as Wolsey demonstrated, you have to recognize when to give a rest, too, especially if those views are in every way antithetical to the king’s.» Same goes for Thomas More, maybe even more so. A principled opposition can be admired, but you may pay the ultimate price when failing to see the times when compromise is the only way forward.» Anne Boleyn, and to a lesser extent her sister Mary, learned the importance of using their assets well. However, they (and we) must recognize when those assets become devalued, say, due to profligacy. » As for Henry, perhaps the best take-away point is the one also observed by Mel Brooks: It’s good to be the king. Even if power corrupts, who is powerful enough to do anything about it?So in conclusion, Ms. Mantel, we remain very interested in your book if we can all work together towards these more commercially viable goals. If your original artistic vision can accommodate this change in perspective, please let us know.Best regards,Dean ArrowCarperHollins Publishers LLC...more",Notes are private!,0,71,1,not set,not set,"Jun 18, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6101138-wolf-hall

How else will anyone hear of it?OK, so P&P may not need my help. The word is likely already out. What that means is that I can scurry around the periphery of the story itself, make a few small points, and move on with near certitude that Miss Austen will have an audience regardless.It had been quite a while since I’d read anything written so long ago. Of course, the language was very different, and for me that was part of the appeal. The musicality of it must owe to the baroque style of the time as well as to the skills of the writer. Her words were precise and descriptors well-chosen. This passage about the piano-playing abilities of the lightly regarded middle sister is but one of many examples:""Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.""This example is also one of many instances where an ""air"" or ""manner"" was defined, or a ""countenance"", ""bearing"" or ""nature"". Much was read into facial expressions, too. Remember, this came from a time before “show, don’t tell.”As an older vintage depiction, there were also big differences in the social norms of the day -- the mores and the protocols. It’s a cliché to point out that Austen’s books are about manners, but it’s true nonetheless. Courtships, for instance, had rigid rules that are almost laughable to our modern ways of thinking. And the language was so stylized and indirect. Subtitles would make for a good skit, like in Annie Hall where Alvy is talking to Annie early on about some abstract artsy thing while his real train of thought was, shall we say, less chaste. Monetary details, class, and family reputation were important determinants in the matches of the day, too. Books like this give us great historical insight into the social contracts and conventions.There’s no need for me to repeat in any detail what most people already know or could discover somewhere else better than this. Elizabeth Bennet is great. Mr. Darcy emerges. Jane and Bingley are charming, though nearly victims of a misunderstanding. Mr. Collins is an obsequious toad. Mr. Bennet is a bit too laissez-faire with a daughter or two who needed tighter reins. Mrs. Bennet is a woman “of weak understanding and illiberal mind.” (I should have been using Miss Austen’s wording throughout. It’s not like I could improve upon it.) Lydia is heedless and Wickham is evil. Of these latter two it was said, “how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue.” The whole story is essentially how these characters play off of one another and sort out their relationships and their lives. Yes, and it’s told really well. It’s more than just the costume drama enthusiasts with their immoderate taste for romanticism that sustain this as a classic.I’ll close this hodgepodge hash of a  by introducing a fun new parlor game involving a mishmash of P&P characters. Pish posh you say? Well hear me out. First of all, if you haven’t already done so, read the book and learn the traits and idiosyncrasies of the characters. They range widely over multiple dimensions. Then take turns mapping these characters to the other players in the game. Composites are encouraged. For instance, my lovely bride of 30 years is 0.872 Elizabeth for her perception, quick wit, and probity; 0.127 Jane for her beauty and good nature; and 0.001 Mrs. Bennet for having watched on more than one occasion that show where bridezillas rate other bridezillas’ weddings, critically and cattily. Then look to see which participants turn red with embarrassment, or even redder with anger. Note: This is my  from a few years ago and may seem like a float.

It refers, of course, to an exceptional intellectual capacity manifesting itself in extraordinary creative works or IQ scores in the extreme right tail of the distribution. I’ve now read two Richard Powers books and both have made me think early and often of his own rare brand of genius. Part of the pleasure in reading him is his depth of understanding in things like music, science, and the creative process. Beyond that, his word choices and analogies are consistently brilliant. The MacArthur Foundation identifies genius in a wide variety of fields. Powers qualified in 1989 as a 32-year-old. His topics may not always be at the fore of the popular imagination, but this is not to say that he fetishizes the obscure. (Are your ears burning, Mr. Pynchon?) Powers does not choose specialized subjects to disguise vague conclusions. I think he simply focuses on new patterns and innovative relationships that are best expressed using less common elements (e.g., avant-garde music, molecular genetics).Certain geniuses can explicate only from within the eleventh dimension of string theory. Others can, or at least try to, convey thoughts through clear, precise language. Powers is the latter kind with an added ability to translate the former.Powers is the type who knows how to connect. Any one of us could qualify as Salieri to his Mozart, which is no slam on us. It’s a recognizable genius – one we can appreciate even if we can’t produce it ourselves. At the same time, I can’t say for sure that there aren’t layers of smarts outside my ability to perceive. But I’m fine with bones tossed outside my reach as long as I can stretch my rope just enough to snag a few. Roughly 80% of the time, when a writer is described as “cerebral”, it’s meant as a bad thing. All head and no heart, by implication. I like to think that with this book the word can apply without baggage. I’ll argue that human emotions do feature in this one, and work pretty darn well buttressing the brainy parts.The premise and basic plotPeter Els is a retired composer now in his seventies with time to experiment in his home lab on a project involving bacteria. It’s a quiet life until the day he calls 911 about his dying dog. As a follow-up to see if Els disposed of his dog properly, the two agents who visited started questioning him about the Petri dishes with mysterious cultures. The explanations Els gave did not satisfy them. The next day, while he was out, a task force in hazmat suits began removing his equipment. He might have tried intervening at that point, to explain how he was using the four building blocks of DNA to encode a musical sequence, but he felt the need to clear his head before making his case. The longer he delayed, the more Homeland Security paranoia accrued. Soon he was portrayed as a bio-terrorist. At that point, he ran. The book was structured as a bi-linear narrative. While elderly Peter was on the lam, young Peter’s back-story unfolded, starting with an all-encompassing love of music as a child. In high school he met a girl with musical appetites matching his own and followed her to Indiana where she studied cello. As she introduced him to Mahler and second base, it “was like graduating from the Crayola eight-pack to the rainbow box of sixty-four.” She convinced him to change his major from chemistry to music composition where “harmony pushed outward in ever more daring border raids on the forbidden.” After his girlfriend left him, he went to grad school in Illinois where he met his wife-to-be (a singer) and his bigger-than-life friend and collaborator, Richard (a manic impresario). To his credit, Els knew that his greatest composition was his daughter with whom he spent many creative hours while his wife supported them. However, once Richard re-entered the picture with a big project in NY, Els could focus on nothing else, and he lost his happy home life. The rest of that earlier thread was spent catching up to the first one, with interesting musical interludes and personal connections along the way.Therein lies the nubEls, and to an extent Powers himself, wanted “awe… surprise… suspense.” “Refreshment, a sense of the infinite. And change; eternal mutation.” Then, finally, coming clean: “Beauty.”That sense of the infinite was something that resonated. Composition was turned into a giant search across near endless possibilities. I haven’t done the math to confirm this quote, but it’s plausible: “Even a three-minute piece could run to more permutations than there were atoms in the universe. And you got three-score years and ten, to find one that was sublime.” Then, in one of the many inserted text boxes (curiously enough, capped at 140 characters), Els asks: “Does it hurt to know that any piece of music, however sublime, can be turned into a unique large number?” I may be quote-happy in this , but when it comes to Powers, I can’t help it: “The job of taste was to thin the insane torrent of human creativity down to manageable levels. But the job of appetite was never to be happy with taste.”Els was conflicted with his more remote niche in the music world. What’s the fear, Peter? “Failure. Success. The wisdom of crowds. Knowledge of what his notes must sound like, to everyone who isn't him.” Els wanted to stay true to his outré artistic vision, but also recognized the trade-off between that and connecting with a large audience. At one point, his wife pegged him as a closet extrovert. “You want to live in a hermitage in Times Square, with a big sign pointing to you reading, hermit.”Relationships and metaphors, most with at least half a heartIt became pretty clear that Powers was getting at all kinds of ties – those between music, the brain, the body at its most visceral, scientific inquiry, literary fiction, and his own approach to writing. I wouldn’t try your patience with words of my own, but don’t mind lengthening this with more of his. These were responses to interview questions.""It's that tension--between the music of pattern, the music of the cognitive brain; and the music of body, the music of pure spirit--that infects his life at every turn. Music is both those things! And human beings are both thinking creatures and feeling creatures. And the art that hits on all cylinders, the art that moves us intellectually and bodily and spiritually, is what we're after. But to capture all those things in the same vessel is a very, very difficult task.""And this, when an interviewer asked about ways in which science and fiction are analogous:""A good novel and a well-designed experiment are both speculations into meaningful pattern. Consensual wisdom has it that science is about rigorous patterns “out there” and art about soft patterns “in here.” But I am increasingly convinced that those two vectors are hopelessly entangled with each other. Meaning in both science and art depends on a whole lot of active processes trying to unite the beautiful to the true. And both science and art make their way by lots of good-faith blundering toward the significant. I must try to show that there is in fact a solid middle ground to stand on, a shared common earth beneath the feet of all the humanists and all the scientists […] There is, I think, such a shared view of the world. It is called bewilderment.""That whole head over heart thing some have said Powers brings about is, to me, refuted in this work. I did care about Peter and those he was close to, and not just as abstractions. Stories effecting empathy are some of the best metaphors around, don’t you think?Music Appreciation 401This is not an intro course. It’s more upper level. That said, even without much of a background in music history or theory, I was completely drawn in.Snippets covered the beauty of sounds in nature (especially bird songs), the rich overtones within a single note played on a piano, and the risky circumstances surrounding Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony in Stalinist Russia. There was also a longer, dramatic description of Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time first performed in a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp. The next and penultimate quote, I swear, highlights both great advice Els gave to a student, as well as inspiring words that Powers might have applied to any number of artistic endeavors, including his own writing.""Let no one persuade you of a single thing. Study your hunger and how to feed it. Trust in whatever sounds twist your viscera. Write in the cadences of first love, of second chances, of air raids, of outrage, of the hideous and the hilarious, of headlong acceptance or curt refusal. Make the bitter music of bumdom, the sad shanties of landlessness, cool at the equator and fluid at the pole. Set the sounds that angels make after an all-night orgy. Whatever lengthens the day, whatever gets you through the night. Make the music that you need, for need will be over, soon enough. Let your progressions predict time’s end and recollect the dead as if they’re all still here. Because they are.""One last quote that I’m not even sure I understand, but seems appropriate:""[...] classical music's real crime was not its cozy relations with fascism but its ancient dream of control, of hot-wiring the soul. He pictured Faust looking at his own neurons on a monitor--his bottomless hunger laid bare, his desire for mastery swirling through his brain like cigarette smoke curling in the air. As full knowledge filled the seeker at last, Mephistopheles, at his elbow, would sing, ‘Now we're both paid in full’.""Powers and prosodyI promised – no more quotes. But with all the ones above, you can decide for yourselves whether this guy can write. He mentioned to an interviewer that at certain stages of certain books, he dictates his words into a machine. Sound is important to him, the rhythm and the lilt. This was especially true in the parts where he described musical works. Even before I’d read this, I felt like the artistry of his prose was another part of his genius. The fact that I was reminded of this nearly every page speaks volumes (that turned out to be a more literal statement than I intended – sorry).The ending may not satisfy fans of resolution, but the well-chosen words packed an emotional wallop for me. I read it five times to get every crumb of meaning that Powers seemed willing to give. Closing the saleThis was a nominee for both a National Book Award and a Booker Prize. But I won’t say it’s for everyone. If the needle on your like-meter didn’t move for any of what I’ve described, give it a pass. At the same time, don’t necessarily be scared off by topics that look implausible, dense or remote. And know, too, that any challenges the man called “cerebral” presents are not meant to be nebulous.As geniuses go, Powers is a generous one. Chances are you’ll feel smarter by association, not dumber by contradistinction....more",Notes are private!,2,92,1,not set,not set,"May 21, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20663749-orfeo

For efficiency’A book topping the charts for weeks and weeks hardly needs my help, but I’m going to do this one the favor of a recommendation anyway. For efficiency’s sake, I’ll be addressing categories of friends en masse.To those who like big-boughed characters (i.e., more than just stick figures): You get two compelling souls with this one: Marie-Laure, the valiant and inquisitive French girl who went blind at age six, and Werner, the tow-headed German orphan who had a knack for gadgets and science. Set in the years leading up to and during WWII, these two were influenced by the great conflict, but were not defined by it. A whole host of related characters were also amply drawn. Marie-Laure’s loving father gave her what he could to engage her and make her self-sufficient. This included a wooden model of their neighborhood so she could learn her way around. Her extended network in Paris and later Saint-Malo played an important role, too, including a reclusive great-uncle who used to write and produce a science program for radio. Werner rigged up a receiver that he and his younger sister loved listening to when they were kids. Their favorite show was one broadcast from France discussing the wonders of the physical world.To STEM-types who don’t often read fiction: Consider making an exception here. Werner is clever and technologically savvy. Doerr must have become so, too, since he presented it all in such an appreciative way. Werner was recruited into an elite school that unfortunately had only one agenda for all the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math that they taught. Werner’s own STEM passions had nothing to do with Reich interests, but he had no choice but to play along. From a nobler perspective, we’d all do well to remember a line Marie-Laure read in Braille from Jules Verne: “Science [...] is made up of mistakes, but they are mistakes which it is useful to make, because they lead little by little to the truth.” To history buffs: This will be of special interest if WWII floats your flotilla. The book does a creditable job describing the climate in both Germany and France. You get a feel for how the Hitler Youth programs instilled aggression as well as how the Résistance encouraged sly subterfuge. Doerr clearly did his homework. As with most good historical fiction, the education you receive may seem almost incidental to the story itself, but it’s an obvious side benefit.To those who like plots that could win the Grand Prix of Monaco: This one’s got plenty of torque, and it takes corners well, too. You’d expect that from a war story / Bildungsroman. It’s filled with pathos, dramatic turns, and adventure. The two young people do meet, but the how, when and where of it is up to the book to divulge. Added to the generic perils of war is a side story involving a priceless diamond and a Nazi Arschloch – one who’s three-dimensional only if you count tenacious, greedy and cruel as dimensions.To those who like pretty sentences: I thought this one struck a good balance. It featured occasional flourishes, but not so much that it ever got in the way of the plot. Here are a few examples: “What mazes there are in this world. The branches of trees, the filigree of roots, the matrix of crystals, the streets her father recreated in his models... None more complicated than the human brain, Etienne would say, what may be the most complex object in existence; one wet kilogram within which spin universes.”  “To shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness.” “Abyss in her gut, desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of the cans of food…” To those who like page-turners (or similar methods of advancement involving clicks, swipes or presses): This one is paced well. Descriptive passages are rarely long or tedious. It switches perspectives often, but never to the point of distraction. And any jumps in time feel natural, part of the flow, not confusing.To barely literate, reactionary xenophobes: No, this one’s not for you. But then who of you would fit in this category anyway?4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,198,1,not set,not set,"Apr 15, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see

Countless reprWhen Rod Blagojevich was impeached and hauled off to prison, that made four of the previous seven Illinois governors to have done time. Countless representatives and aldermen have been locked up, too. Then there was my wife’s favorite: a former Secretary of State found after his death to have $800,000 stuffed in shoe boxes. Our reputation for corrupt politicians is, I dare say, unsurpassed. Fortunately, we here in the Land of Lincoln (as we call it on our license plates) have one historical figure capable of tipping the scales back towards respectability.I’ve taken a real interest in Abe and his legacy in recent months (more on why in a minute). Of the books I’ve read, this one and David Herbert Donald’s Lincoln are my favorites. They both deserve credit for finding unique space within what is arguably the most densely populated expanse of American history. Goodwin focused on Lincoln’s clever leadership in bringing together a group of his former opponents, thinking them to be the most capable cabinet members at a very challenging time. We get thoroughly researched sketches of:Edwin Stanton – a bitter rival contemptuous of Lincoln when they were both involved in a famous court case. He called Lincoln a long armed ape, but was subsequently recruited by a magnanimous Lincoln to be Secretary of War and grew to love the President.Salmon Chase – one of the founders of the new Republican Party who felt he was owed the nomination that Lincoln ultimately won, later did laudable work as Lincoln’s Treasury Secretary.William Seward – a senator and later governor of New York, was certain he was going to win the nomination in 1860. After Lincoln offered him the Secretary of State post, Seward figured on seizing power by essentially running his own government within the cabinet only to discover Lincoln’s skill at bringing different factions together. In Seward’s capacity as the anti-yes man, he became Lincoln’s best ally and friend.Edward Bates – a senior presence within the party who was coaxed into running against Lincoln in the primaries. After losing that battle he reluctantly took the job as Attorney General for the good of the troubled nation. He initially thought of Lincoln as an incompetent bureaucrat, but ultimately concluded that he was “very near being a ‘perfect man.’” Naturally, most of the spotlight fell on Lincoln himself. Goodwin showed us the tricky waters that led to the Emancipation Proclamation on 4/1/1863 – a Good Friday in every way – as well as other less famous but still important milestones that required a masterful helmsman. I give her ample credit for underscoring his sound judgment, his political savvy, his wry sense of humor, and his superabundant humanity. So why my sudden interest in Lincoln? I thought you’d never ask. Aside from the fact that he is probably the most analyzed and lionized figure in American history, it looks like I have a personal connection as well. I was revisiting some genealogical research I’d started years ago, knowing that the internet now reveals more ties than those dusty tomes I used to find in libraries and court houses ever did. One of my ancestors, Joseph Hanks, had a sister named Lucy who I’d never bothered following up on before. Anyway, according to ancestry.com, she was the mother of an illegitimate daughter named Nancy who was, by all known accounts, Abe’s mother. It was one of those can-this-really-be-true moments. But I triple-checked every link and am as sure as anyone can be given existing records that Abe is my second cousin six times removed. I’d originally thought to look into a DNA test like the one they did to explain all those red-haired, brown-skinned kids running around Monticello, but then decided against it. I wouldn’t know who to contact, it would likely be expensive, and I’d rather just assume that it’s true.Of course I realize this is a watered down relationship, and for all I know hundreds if not thousands of other people can make this same claim. I have to confess, though, that for a while I thought of myself differently. My gaunt face and hollow cheeks were no longer flaws, but indicative family traits. And though I haven’t tried to grow a beard in years, I’m certain if I did, it would be scraggly. I even looked for examples where I could count myself as a cut above in probity, eloquence and fair-mindedness. Before I got to the point of imagining Daniel Day-Lewis playing me in a biopic of my soon-to-be famous life, I realized that I was still just me – a guy who needs to remember that humility is one of his few attractive traits. Besides, (this is the really weird part) I did more digging into my family roots and discovered that my great-great-grandmother, Cora Claudine Flickinger from Byhalia, Ohio had a sister named Lula Dell Flickinger who the internet shows was the grandmother of one Barbara Pierce Bush. That makes me a somewhat less diluted third cousin once removed of George W. Bush. Suffice it to say I now think of these genealogical ties as less meaningful. I lack the power and initiative to unshackle an oppressed segment of society, but then I don’t feel any compulsion to invade Iraq either.So please understand I’m not obsessed by my connections, but today of all days, after ing this wonderful book, I feel enough of a kinship to quote my famous cousins. As Lincoln said, “You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” Cousin Dubya modified the quote (for real) observing that, “You can fool some of the people all the time, and those are the ones you want to concentrate on.”Are any of you picturing Pinocchio in a jester’s hat right now, perhaps in place of a white Rubik’s cube? Any theories on why I feel compelled to do this? I’m curious myself. Am I dissatisfied with reality and need the artifice to spice things up? (No, I’m luckier than most and I know it.) Am I simply attempting to entertain? (Hmm… sounds a little too noble and generous – probably not.) Am I trying to switch the focus away from anything relevant to shine the light on me, myself and I? (That’s probably closest to the mark. Either that or I’ve got a genetic predisposition for dishonesty.)

Not when I tell you that my problem has nothing to do with the novel itself, but rather in conjuring the right words to do it justice. You see every account I run through my head makes it sound more boring than it is. I guess I should just start by telling you it’s about two couples who met during the Great Depression. Sid and Charity Lang live well on inherited wealth. Larry and Sally Morgan struggle in comparison, but have inviting prospects in the groves of academe. While Larry and Sid were junior colleagues in the English Department at the University of Wisconsin, their wives met at a mixer that led to the alliance. Despite the generally hard times, the two couples shared lots of laughs and slathered layers of glue on to their friendship. Hard knocks ensued and health became an issue, yet the ties stayed intact. But nothing much happened you’d call sensational. In fact, the dearth of drama was something that Larry himself hit upon early in his narration: How do you make a book that anyone will read out of lives as quiet as these? Where are the things novelists seize upon and readers expect? Where is the high life, the conspicuous waste, the violence, the kinky sex, the death wish? Where are the suburban infidelities, the promiscuities, the convulsive divorces, the alcohol, the drugs, the lost weekends? Where are the hatreds, the political ambitions, the lust for power? Where are speed, noise, ugliness, everything that makes us who we are and makes us recognize ourselves in fiction?But would a failure by those measures be so bad? I’m lucky in that most of the people I spend time with are pretty fully evolved. (That includes GR friends, I say in the least unctuous tone possible.) Their deviations from the norm are more subtle, and all the more fascinating for how well I can imagine them playing out in my own outwardly conventional world. Stegner was a master observer of more nuanced traits. When he profiled characters (as was the case in about 90% of this book), depth was a foregone conclusion. Charity, with her outsized personality, was the natural ringleader. Larry was the most accomplished, and in his role as narrator, the closest to all-knowing. Sally had the oldest soul, the most empathy, and the biggest shoulders for a heavy load. Sid, the wealthy scion, turned out to be the most conflicted – a would-be poet and dreamer sometimes at odds with Charity’s agenda and will.I’m hardly a Stegner expert with this being only my second sampling (Angle of Repose being the first), but he strikes me as the wise litterateur who makes most other writers look bush-league in comparison. Every page has a reminder that his wording is superior, that his insights are better written and, for that matter, better conceived. Here are a few short examples to illustrate the writing and to hint at the thematic core.Larry, having been dealt another blow:Accept? I get tired of accepting. I'm tired of hearing the Lord shapes the back to the burden.Tenure hopefuls sharing a bit of dark humor:You hear what the dean said about Jesus Christ? Sure He's a good teacher, but what's He published?I can’t remember which character said this, but figure it might as well have been Stegner himself: Unconsidered, merely indulged, ambition becomes a vice; it can turn a man into a machine that knows nothing but how to run. Considered, it can be something else -- pathway to the stars, maybe.And another one that could have come directly from Stegner, maybe from a master class in writing:Drama demands the reversal of expectation, but in such a way that the first surprise is followed by an immediate recognition of inevitability. And inevitability takes careful pin-setting.Speaking of writing classes, Stegner was evidently very good as a teacher. Students such as Wendell Berry, Larry McMurtry, Thomas McGuane, Ken Kesey and Raymond Carver speak to that. I always wonder, though, if Lesson #1 is to first become brilliant. In a way it doesn’t matter, craftsmanship vs. innate intellect, since to me Stegner had both. And speaking of pin-setting, the closing scenes he built towards featured plenty of drama even if most of it was subcutaneous.This was the last book Stegner wrote, published at the age of 78. It was paced well at 368 pages, but I’d have happily read more had he cared to stretch it into an epic. The span of history was wide, from their early days in Madison to their elder years at the Langs’ summer home in Vermont. But most of the intervening decades were skipped. Maybe Stegner’s time and energy for a longer book were running out. Besides, he likely said all he intended to say as it was. It made me think that part of the wisdom we gain as we age comes in recognizing what truly matters: the people around us and the ways we connect. This book was a great paean to mature realizations....more",Notes are private!,0,300,1,not set,not set,"Mar 10, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9820.Crossing_to_Safety

To bolster my case, I’ll be using graphs to display falsely precise measures in an attempt to gain credibility. The real goal (apart from the gimmick) is to highlight the mix of traits this gem of a novel possesses, the combinations of which are rare and enticing. For instance, many books are either strong on plot or strong on character development, but not so many are good at both. In the figure below, note where The Brothers K ends up.   [image]Duncan gives us some of the most memorable characters in recent history. Four brothers are front and center, as you might guess. They have younger twin sisters, too, who play more than just bit parts. Their parents have interesting stories, as well, stemming from Papa’s minor league pitching career and his wife’s repeated chugs of Seventh-Day Adventist Kool-Aid. First born, Everett, is quick-witted, sarcastic, irreverent and outspoken. Much of the book was set in the 60’s and early 70’s, the perfect time for one born to be a campus radical. Peter is the contemplative one with a talent for abstraction. His skill on the ball field is somewhat at odds with his bookish mindset and obsession with Eastern religions. Next in line is the biggest of the brothers, Irwin. He’s slow to understand things, but earnest in his beliefs and genuine with his laughs. His loyalty, kindness and good intent could give Christianity a good name. Kade is the youngest brother, and the narrator for much of the book. Ironically, we learn the least about him. He’s the ordinary one against which the extraordinary traits of his brothers stand in contrast – a sort of benchmark, and an unbiased observer.A lot happens to drive this epic family saga. I don’t want to give much away, but there are fall-outs, crushing blows, young love, and moral issues to sort through. In those days, Vietnam was a point of contention, too, as some of you might have heard.Back to my visual aids, you see that I’ve put other books onto the plots, too. They’re meant to provide context. A book doesn’t have to be in the upper right quadrant from me to like it (Angle of Repose and The Martian are prime examples), but it’s a notable accomplishment when one does well in both dimensions. The Art of Fielding may be worth special mention. Not only does it share great characters and baseball as a metaphor, but it was edited by one Michael Pietsch, who is known for having worked with David Foster Wallace on Infinite Jest as well as with the other three-named David of note. In an interview, Duncan mentioned a bond with Wallace, citing a quote by the latter: “Few artists dare to try to talk about ways of working toward redeeming what’s wrong, because they’ll look sentimental and naive to all the weary ironists. Irony’s gone from liberating to enslaving…” This shared bravery in the face of perceived sentimentality shows up in The Brothers K.The next plot points to another trait the two Davids share: a willingness to tackle weighty issues. Neither wanted pure gravitas, though, recognizing that humor can not only co-exist with it, but also enhance it. The mature and subtle wit in Duncan’s work was a nice complement, I thought, tickling the same temporal lobe.  [image]I’ve only ever read the Classic Comics version of The Brothers Karamazov, but even that pointed to total heaviosity. I can’t speak much to the parallels between the Duncan and Dostoevsky books, aside from the fact that they both featured dissimilar brothers and metaphysical themes. As it is, though, my lack of knowledge about the older work did not lessen my appreciation for the newer one. In the third plot I’m drawing a distinction between feelings (love, pathos, and matters of organs below the brain) versus more cognitive pursuits. The more abstract our thinking becomes, the further it often strays from the gut and/or heart. I thought this novel did well, as it ventured down certain rather philosophical paths, to keep it relevant to our flesh and blood world. Angels on pins were not nearly as important as the better angels we might enlist to make ourselves tolerable. Duncan was no doubt shaped by a boyhood experience with a religious jerk who told him that his hospitalized older brother died because young David hadn’t prayed sincerely enough to prevent it. In an interview he said, “I think a lot of fundamentalists are wounded people whose hurt makes them want the world to be much simpler than it really is. They want something that is absolutely secure, that never waivers, that does not require hard decisions. When you can cling to a dogmatic system, the gray areas disappear.” This statement might seem a little condescending to some, but certainly less so than the too-bad-you’re-going-to-Hell-for-your-wrong-beliefs” world view that those wounded folks promote. Duncan thankfully takes this unkind and narrow-minded brand of religion to task.  [image]I like to think I’m one of those people who can handle negativity and bad behavior when a writer presents it honestly. But if the brush stroke is too wide, and the dreck is too pervasive, I often think the author is trying to appeal to a bias we may have in equating cynicism with realism. Granted, when it comes to politicians and televangelists, that view is mostly right. : ) But when it comes to my own circle, I’m not seeing it so much. I think this relates to that non-redemptive irony the Davids discussed. Anyway, a well-positioned book in the upper right of the following plot can be refreshing. The Brothers K gets there by way of imperfect, but striving characters who are reminded by the wise ones among them that respect and love by themselves can make for a pretty good religion. As for the rest of the church experience – the rituals, the rules, and the fellowship – it’s not so different from baseball.   [image]I haven’t said anything yet about the writing. It’s a long book, but well-paced; it’s creatively structured, but not to the point of distraction; and it’s semi-literary, but never flouncy. The top-right quadrant in this final plot speaks to its flair and invention in tackling complex issues without being cryptic or obscure.   [image]I could keep going in other dimensions, too (e.g., wisdom, breadth, social conscience), but you get the idea. This book excels in so many good ones. Instead, I’m going to close with a quote that I hope gives more color on the kind of applied philosophy you can expect. It’s from daughter Freddy (Winifred), echoing the words of her father. “He said there are two ways for a hitter to get the pitch he wants. The simplest way is not to want any pitch in particular. But the best way, he said--which sounds almost the same, but is really very different--is to want the very pitch you're gonna get. Including the one you can handle. But also the one that's gonna strike you out looking.” ...more",Notes are private!,4,210,0,not set,not set,"Oct 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19534.The_Brothers_K

But since she got me to read (and enjoy) Jane Austen, I figure I’m owed the chance to sell her on this unassuming little treasure – one that may well be the beau ideal of the whole curmudgeonly male canon. That’s my main goal with this . For those of you who have already read the book (including 10 friends who gave it a total of 50 stars), please help me entice her. For those of you who have not, maybe we’ll convince you of its worthiness, too. Here are my top five reasons to give it a go. I considered doing ten reasons, but then remembered that (notwithstanding asides like this) brevity is the soul of wit (and, with luck, the torque of an arm twist).1. The setting has more than just potato peels to interest us. Ebenezer is a Guernseyman. As such, he has all the independence of thought and intransigence of spirit you might expect from a rustic island existence. Guernsey is influenced by both France (it’s situated off the coast of Normandy) and England (it’s technically owned by the British Crown), but is ruled by neither. Beyond autonomy of state, they have their own distinctive culture and way of speaking. The patois Ebenezer used in his very conversational narration was a fun and constant reminder of the local color. Of course we all know that islands make great metaphors, too, positioned conveniently on the insularity/connectedness spectrum. John Fowles, in the introduction, made a good point: “Provincialism is not merely lacking city taste in arts and manners; it is also an increasingly vital antidote to all would-be central tyrannies.” Ebenezer’s Guernsey was a good case in point – proud of the different beat it marched to. And smaller ponds can give the fish within them a feeling of greater importance. That may explain why young Ebenezer’s pride in being the one to climb the greasy pole at the local fair to snatch the flavorful prize seemed so satisfying. To him it was like Olympic gold. To us, it’s a reminder that accomplishments are relative. Not to sound condescending, but it’s all the more heartwarming at the Special Olympics, all smiles at the more intimate glories.2. There’s an epic sweep to the story. Ebenezer was born in the late 1800’s and his book ended in the 1960’s. Many changes took place both to the narrator and to the island. The Great War, WWII (and the German occupation), the dawning age of the automobile, the advent of TV, the bloody tourists – they all had their influences. The book accommodated a myriad of characters across both time and type. The older generation played an important role when Ebenezer was young and the younger generation got its due when he was old. And it was fascinating to see the scope through Ebenezer’s wide-open eyes. Which, after burying the lead long enough, brings us to…3. The narration – it’s more affecting than I can tell you. It’s not that plot spoilers prevent me from telling you, it’s that my powers of description aren’t up to the task. The elements of a great story are there – conflict, death, Nazis, love, lust, and more – but the tone is somewhat prosaic and the action may seem underwhelming. So what does this backward, cantankerous old fellow bring to the party? I think the key may be the fact that someone who on the face of it was such an unlikely figure to write a book felt compelled to write one anyway. He was not well-educated, articulate, or a student of island history, but there was a passion he had for telling his side of things. And while he may not have been book smart, I think most would agree he could read people. He was an iconoclast, but one with an integrity we can admire. There’s something appealing about an energized old-timer who wants his life to have meant something, wants his perspective to have registered, and wants some kind of legacy to mark his existence despite the long odds. He had such a distinctive voice for it, too, never boring. There’s a knack good storytellers have for when to jump ahead and when to backfill in an otherwise linear narrative. Edwards, by way of Ebenezer, had that and more.4. Human temperaments are on full display. And we get quite a motley assemblage. The range of character traits is wide, spanning dimensions twixt petty and empathetic, magnanimous and mean, cowardly and brave, and combative and kind among others. Raymond, a younger cousin, was highbrow and philosophical, and gave Edwards (who in most ways led Ebenezer’s life) a vehicle to deliver his views on religion and the bigger world. Best friend Jim showed a bromantic closeness that Ebenezer lacked with women, even the special one in his life that he might have married. At least with his mother, sister, and aunts, Ebenezer realized that women could vary, even if he didn’t understand most of them. To his credit, humor was something he did get. One of his favorite accounts was when a bird dropped his calling card on a visiting Frenchman. Despite dirtying his new jacket, the man just laughed and said, “Dieu merci les vaches ne volent pas!” (Vache = cow in case you need help with the translation.)5. It’s like a fine wine: improved with age, boasting a great finish. Ebenezer mellowed over time. I was pleased to see such a clear example of personal growth in later years. (There’s hope for me yet!) Redemption might not be the right word, but it’s not far off. In real life, G.B. Edwards befriended a young artist who inspired him to write this pseudo-quasi-memoir in old age. Ebenezer made friends with a similar young man, one who had a mischievous past (at one time breaking a greenhouse window where Ebenezer grew his tomatoes). Neville, the misunderstood artist, was a kindred spirit. He was just what the book needed to tie loose ends together. Neville’s girlfriend, another simpatico soul, once said he painted in patois. Ebenezer liked that. In a way, it characterized his own artful reflections on life. I liked it, too. The whole book was as distinctive and prismatic as any patois could be. So have I convinced you yet Susan? You know it’s a compliment to your fine taste that I’m trying this hard....more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,not set,not set,"Oct 02, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/750407.The_Book_of_Ebenezer_Le_Page

How do I know you’re not George Plimpton?” There was very little Plimpton would not do in the name of “participatory journalism.” He would stand in as the amateur Everyman experiencing and describing a wide variety of jobs done by professionals, most famously in the world of sports. Actually, maybe Everyman is not the right word for Plimpton. He was a gawky patrician, educated at Phillips Exeter, Harvard, and King’s College at Cambridge and brought on as the first editor in chief at The Paris Review. In any case, he would somehow get people to play along as he inserted himself into situations he could later write about: pitching to a lineup of major league all-stars, running a series of plays as the Detroit Lions’ last-string quarterback, sparring with Archie Moore, and playing goal for the Boston Bruins in an exhibition game. Much of this collection is based on those experiences as the outsider on the inside.We develop a truer appreciation for the skills involved when we view them through the Plimpton lens. With his literary background, of course he wrote well, but he also knew not to let flourishes get in the way of the story. He put just enough of his own fears and shortcomings in to let us know the challenges involved. One of my favorite descriptions was when he played goalie. He said they had coached him to keep his eye on the puck at all times. But in a game situation he said that this was like catching occasional glimpses of a mouse scurrying about. The sports stories were fun not only for the laughs we have at his difficulties, but for the personalities surrounding them. He was a wry observer of the boyish pranks oddly coupled with the professionalism.Plimpton’s experiences went beyond sports. He also wrote about the time he did stand-up comedy, which sounded more perilous than you'd have thought. The most nerve-racking job he ever did, though, was as a percussionist for the New York Philharmonic. In sports, he explained, mistakes are a part of the game. In fact, the whole goal is to force the opponent into miscues and missed opportunities. With music, it’s all about just getting the thing right. His role in this case was an apparently simple one: sounding the gong when given the cue. But Leonard Bernstein was not the sort to laugh off mistakes. Plimpton, who didn’t even read music, came in at the right time (whew!), but with so much force that they joked about it for months. Character profiles were another major part of the collection. He wrote about poet Marianne Moore (training her artistic eye on baseball), another poet named Muhammad Ali (as pretty a pugilist as you’ll ever find), Hunter S. Thompson (the gonzo man himself), Norman Mailer (who may have been even crazier than Thompson, or at least more challenging to be with), Vince Lombardi (a sonuvabitch, but one you’d sacrifice plenty for), and various other literary figures and sportsmen. A young Caroline Kennedy was also featured, full of “vigah” as she competed in games at the beach.A few other stories stood out as well. One described the day Plimpton took his young daughter to a classic gridiron battle pitting Harvard against Yale. Her unique take-away points were later put in print in a newspaper she created. Then there was a story about an aspiring young writer who bid more than he could afford at a charity auction for a day with George. Once the man’s wife explained their finances to Plimpton and his wife privately, they wanted to make sure he got something both generous and sui generis out of the deal. They ended up going to Elaine’s where writers and assorted other artsy, intellectual types hung out. He met quite a few famous people including a normally stand-offish Woody Allen. My favorite piece, though, had to be The Curious Case of Sidd Finch. This was an article he wrote for the April 1, 1985 issue of Sports Illustrated. It profiled an amazing young pitcher trying out for the Mets. He had somehow combined the yogic mind-body training he received in Tibet with mechanics borrowed from cricket to master the art of the pitch. His fastball was clocked at 168 MPH. (For context, Nolan Ryan's record fastest was 108.) The article had photos of the lanky Sidd (short for Siddhartha), quotes from stunned teammates including a very sore-handed catcher, and only the vaguest of hints that it was an April Fools’ Day hoax*. It was brilliant! Plimpton pushed the boundaries of plausibility about as far as they’d extend describing the quirky Sidd. Most readers loved it, though some threatened to cancel their subscriptions not only to SI, but to all magazines the parent company offered. Count me as one who loved it.*Take the first letter of each word in the article’s subheading: “He's a pitcher, part yogi and part recluse. Impressively liberated from our opulent life-style, Sidd's deciding about yoga — and his future in baseball.”...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,not set,not set,"Sep 24, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/215252.The_Best_of_Plimpton

Don’t get me wrong. This audio set, which I was happy to receive as part of the First Reads program, has plenty to amuse, stimulate and inspire his fans. But I couldn’t help noticing a few things that put me off slightly.Some of that may have come from the choice of what to include. The one short passage from Infinite Jest was an example. It’s tempting to say it was forgettable, but in truth it was repellant enough to remain stuck in my head (about the guy at the tennis academy who hung around the gym to lick sweat off the young athletes). Then there were the true-to-the-title selections from Brief Interviews with Hideous Men. He would often go deep into these dark and flawed souls, to chilling effect – all the more repugnant for the penetration of his insight. The longest essay he read focused on the annual pornographic film awards – an easy target, of course. And it was truly fun to hear him rip into this smutty, classless bunch. It was just too long. (Please, this is not the time for a TWSS joke.) The material, in general, had a sort of outré edginess to it, with some highbrow elitism thrown in for good measure. Maybe if I was as smart as he was I’d preach from the high ground, too, but I would hope not to lose touch with the cultural underclass and its plights. I got the sense that he was empathetic to a first approximation, though at times he failed to convey that. For instance, he was recalling in one essay how many of the older women he happened to be with in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois when 9/11 was unfolding had no idea the Twin Towers were so far south on the island. One of the women was worried about a niece who worked in midtown. She and her ilk were labeled ignorant and out of touch, though to his credit he didn’t assume they were stupid; just not a part of his America. In one of the included interviews, he was talking about the poor outcomes when many of his writing students tried to be clever. I don’t doubt that many were tone-deaf in their attempts at it, and that it really is good advice not to even try walking the high wire, but it seemed a little funny coming from him. He always struck me as an aerialist himself when it came to the high falutin’. Could he have been saying this ironically, as someone aware of his own penchant for cleverness? Was he trying to be meta-clever? For that matter, am I? What I do know is that Wallace had confessed at one point to having been a sort of smart-assed know-it-all student back in the day, and then realized once he was older how right his professors had often been. That more self-effacing guy I can relate to. Let’s call it a Midwestern modesty connection.+ + + + + + + + + + +There’s only so much negativity I could ever send DFW’s way. For the most part, I still think he was great: kind, knowing, witty and mensch-like. At the same time I think it’s fair to say he was often conflicted between two parts of himself vying for primacy: the phrenic but spiky detractor vs. the goo-prone (his own expression) sentimentalist. His wife contended that his “inner sap” didn’t show up enough in his writing, but was, in fact, one of his most appealing traits. While I argued earlier that the more cynical David held sway in this collection, that’s not entirely true. The earnestly empathic David was evident, too. In the title essay from Consider the Lobster he showed a great depth of feeling even if most of it was directed the crustacean’s way. My favorite piece in the collection was the last one. It was a recording of his famous Kenyon College commencement speech also known as This Is Water. I had read this address for the first time the day after he died, a special and sad association. Anyway, his wisdom and humanity were on full display with that one. He asked his bright, young audience to fill mundane moments “learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think.” He imagined a higher plane of consciousness and meaning; one that overrides the default of self-centeredness; one wise enough not to worship money, power, or intelligence; one with the capacity “to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over … [and] making it to 30, or maybe even 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head.” Ouch, right? Like I said, special and sad.Lots of us feel a personal connection to this sensitive genius of a man. Just read the many wonderful Goodreads s of Infinite Jest and you’ll see what I mean. While this collection often struck me as bleak and disdainful, it was never less than powerful. It also featured enough of “nice” David to satisfy the gentler souls among us, too. Listening to it made me stronger, literally, since I had it on while working out at home and did my reps slower with less clanging (which is harder) to pick up more of his words. Still, I might have missed a few.

Of course, with the critical success ofFans of Mitch Davies had high hopes for this one, but I think it’s fair to say that reactions have been mixed. Of course, with the critical success of Mapping Thunderheads and Davies’ reputation for inventive structuring, this long-awaited release was meant to solidify his status as a literary virtuoso. My own feeling is he fell short of the mark, though with strong work that at times brought him close. As I was tallying my pluses and minuses, I made the mistake of looking at the many excellent Goodreads s already out there and now realize that most of my thoughts have been covered by them. I should have just left it at that – end of . But instead I probed deep into the internet’s entrails to find a piece that captures and exceeds the idiosyncrasies of my own view. Snippets from a  by Rich Kaserman in The Grumpus:Has the “Mild Child of British Letters” grown claws and fangs? With Mitch Davies’ latest, Temporal Flesh, the bonhomie we saw in many previous characters gives way to an air of testiness instead, and his world view goes from bad yet hopeful to bad and likely to get worse. Some may say, “Good damn deal – it’s about time that he saw the dark,” but they were never part of his chirpy fan base to begin with. … We first meet Haley Sipes in 1984 as a somewhat disaffected 15-year-old. She narrates the first section and appears in every section thereafter. In contrast to Jared Tyler, an insightful and creative contemporary of hers in Davies’ earlier Green Swan Commons, she is in most ways unremarkable. Perhaps that’s the point. Things happen to ordinary people, too.… Hugh Woolworth is as self-interested as they come, and he feels no compunction whatsoever trampling toes in pursuit of his wants. He believes it’s better still when his marks fail to see through his oleaginous charms. Hugh also has the best, most acerbic wit; a devious and droll fellow. Within his advantaged tribe, he’s known as the scholarship boy – clever, but not born to money. His insights into class distinctions are worth repeating:[...] while the wealthy are no more likely to be born stupid than the poor, a wealthy upbringing compounds stupidity while a hardscrabble childhood dilutes it, if only for Darwinian reasons. This is why the elite need a prophylactic barrier of shitty state schools, to prevent clever kids from working-class post codes ousting them from the Enclave of Privilege.Haley held her own when she met Hugh, which certainly interested him. She’d had years to perfect her standoffishness. As far as edgy amusement is concerned, Davies reached his peak at this stage. Too bad he couldn’t sustain it for the remaining two-thirds of the book.… Cris Reese was meant to have an enticing negativity as well. But the truth is, he’s unoriginal. He might just as well have been named Martin Amis for as thin as the veil turned out to be. Consider the evidence: Reese had a reputation for a drunken and libidinous lifestyle, had a famous father who wrote books that were hard to live up to, and early writing successes like Desiccated Embryos (as compared to Amis’s Dead Babies) lost luster with each new attempt to regain glory. Davies, in an interview, said this not an Amis send-up but rather a cautionary tale to himself. How many of us buy that? When you decide to break bad, you’ve got to own your contempt, Mitch.… It’s hard to decide which is worse – the backpedalling (above) or the attempt to front-run criticism (below) with a preemptive joke on himself. This was from a critic’s  of Reese’s latest effort:So why is Echo Must Die such a decomposing hog? One: Reese is so bent on avoiding cliché that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower. Two: The fantasy subplot clashes so violently with the book's State of the World pretensions, I cannot bear to look. Three: What surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry than a writer creating a writer-character?"" Speaking of violently clashing fantasy subplots, we get a stylized Armageddon when the Chronologues (in white hats) vie against the Ballastards (in black), all to minimal effect. What could Davies do, though, when his latest spin of the genre roulette wheel landed smack dab on fantasy? With this choice, we may wonder: Did the supernatural help get us to a greater truth? (Not really.) Were the atemporals important for making his point? (Probably not, though to be fair, do we know what the point was?) Did it fit as a piece within the Davies omni-world? (Yeah, I guess that was it.) One of the Chronologues said, “Some magic is merely normality that you're not yet used to.” And other magic, I’m here to point out, is just some writer’s random effluveum.Beyond its gratuitous feel, this section simply failed as a showcase for Davies’ talent. If the chameleon he’s become was trying to spoof bad fantasy that’s one thing, but it’s not clear this was the case. And even if it was, to what benefit? My annoyance compounded with each passage like this: ""The Act of Anesthesia is done. As per the plan, then: Marinus and Unalaq, you hiatus the icon to ensure he won't wake while Arkady, Oshima, and I psychoflame with every volt we've got."" It made me want to self-administer an Act of Amnesia and pseudosomatically hurl with every erg in my being. While I’m piling on, I might as well mention this habit the Chronologues had of conversing with one another through unspoken mental means they called “subspeaking.” We get dissonant constructions like “subaddress”, “subreply” and “subpoint out.” An editor should have subsuggested dropping the contrived subspeech.… Recognizing yet again the genre rotation, the repeated characters from previous books, and the linked novella structure, it’s fair to ask if the Davies bag of tricks is looking a bit threadbare from overuse.As something of a counterpoint, I also found this book report that high school sophomore Stephie Botopp wrote. Though lacking sophistication, it spoke to me (which is not to say that it subspoke). Temporal Flesh by Mitch Davies has many interesting characters, settings and themes. The six stories connect through Haley Sipes and the Radio People who sometimes show up like spirits to talk to her. In the first section of the book Haley is 15 and she talks about her bossy mom, her sketchy older boyfriend, and her insane times when she ran away from her home in England. In the second section Haley is in her twenties and she works at a Swiss ski resort restaurant. There’s this hilarious guy, Hugh, who’s sketchy in a different way, but he’s smart, and he kind of falls for Haley. But one of those spirits (atemporals, they were called) asked him to join up with them and never age and go to battle against some other bunch of atemporals who were the good ones. The guy was skeezy enough to do it and he stood Haley up. Then the third section was when Haley was in her thirties and she was married and had a kid, Aiouf, which bothered me a little because how do you pronounce that? Her husband was OK, but he was a war correspondent who would go after the hot story even when his family needed him. The section after that was told from Cris Reese’s point of view. He was called the Wild Child of British Letters when he was young but by the time of this section he was old and just plain nasty. His books were getting worse and he would get into word fights all the time. A critic, who was one of the students that Hugh hung around with in the second section, ripped Reese’s latest book to shreds. The critic got into huge trouble, though, even though he was innocent. It was like an eye for an eye wasn’t enough. Reese took an eye, a tooth, part of an ear, and some fingers. In this section Haley is now old, like in her forties. She got to know Reese because she wrote a book everybody liked about the Radio People and they kept meeting at these random book fests doing promotions. Reese liked her, but it didn’t really go anywhere. Even after he got nicer, he was still kind of a dud. The section after that was all about the atemporals. The good ones were immortal and had super powers, but the bad ones had powers, too, so they had epic battles. The good ones, called Chronologues, were vegetarians. The other ones, the Ballastards, were meat eaters. This was one of the themes: Good vs. Evil and whether you eat animals (and people). Anyway, these atemporals have long histories and it took a lot of pages to talk about it all and I hate to say it, but it got to be boring. If Davies was trying to be like J. K. Rowling, it didn’t work. The last section was set further in the future in a rural part of Ireland where Haley lived with two grandchildren. It’s a terrible time because there was global warming, they ran out of oil, and the internet was down most of the time. This was another theme: we shouldn’t ruin our planet by being greedy and negligent because young people don’t deserve an apocalypse. At the end, do the good atemporals use some of their super powers to save the day? In the last section, that’s what we wonder. If I wasn’t already at the end of the page, I would have compared this messed up future world with Lord of the Flies. In summary, Davies uses many characters with some of them being supernatural to talk about important themes like good vs. evil and why we shouldn’t rape the planet that young people will inherit.Actually, I had a few additional impressions that weren’t covered by these two selections.» As a big fan of his past books, I’m inclined to cut Davies some slack. He’s such an exuberant storyteller that even the poor execution of the fantasy parts didn’t spoil it for me entirely. Besides, if these body-dwelling entities were meant figuratively as the strong influences that live within us and help drive our attitudes, actions and morality, I can buy into that.» When Davies was a child, he spent hours constructing detailed maps and imaginative stories that no doubt comprised a grand vision. Fantasy was presumably a part of this. I guess I don’t want to see that creative boyhood world threatened.» In interviews, Davies is said to view his collection of novels as one big Überbook. In fact, novels he has planned for the future also fit within this framework. I personally hope that his emphasis will be on the flesh and blood parts of this world.» What are we to make of the point Kaserman made about Davies and his writer-character, Reese? Do we view this whole meta- thing as fun self-awareness or as a now tiresome post-modern ploy to remind us again that all of fiction is just made up? For that matter, what would we say about a  that meta-riffs on the same conceit? 3.5/5 unfairly rounded down to 3 because Davies’ bar is so high....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,not set,not set,"Aug 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20819685-the-bone-clocks

Whether the narrator was 9% Exley or 99%, it didn’t matter to me; I just didn’t like him. He was a bully and a butthead, his opinion of himself suffered Weimar Republic levels of inflation, and the list of his excuses for bad behavior was as lame as it was long. »   Exley was a man’s man, which is OK in and of itself, but he was just so blatant in his hatred of women. He took great pleasure in hitting one for giving a dead-drunk friend of his a hard time. A good rule of thumb says that any guy you imagine using the “Quit bustin’ my balls” line is not confronting a problem, he is the problem. »   There wasn’t nearly as much about what makes a sports fan tick as I was expecting. Hornby’s book was far better at that. All would have been forgiven, of course, had the more general self-characterization won me over. While Exley did do a decent job of identifying some of his many flaws, he was often less than sincere owning up to them – an egoist through and through. »   It disappoints me that this book has a cult following. Somebody even opened a bar named after him. To me, that would be like the Lance Armstrong Sports Nutrition Shoppe. »   Exley’s writing talent has been praised, often by Exley himself, but I found a fair amount of it clunky and overcooked. The adverbs were the worst offenders. (E.g., anguishingly solemn, an unbridledly dear price, admonitorily advising) To veraciously tell you the truth, it made me surpassingly peevish and dampeningly unsatisfied. A token attempt to be fair:»   Some of the writing wasn’t bad. The best parts tended to confess things. This line describing his short-term, ill-fated teaching experience was one of his best: “Sadly, I lacked the intelligence to simplify, and with an utterly monolithic and formidable pedantry I thought nothing of demanding that my students feed me back my own quackery.”»   Exley’s father was a locally famous athlete with a competitive streak that made me think that the defeated son came by his hang-ups honestly. »   Alcoholism is a disease. Maybe the poor excuses, offensive behavior, and irresponsibility are just common symptoms, and a book that shows this clearly is just being true to type.»   It’s not necessary to like the narrator to like the book. For me, though, it often helps. While I can easily appreciate a memoir showing how to be, I also want to be open to one showing truthfully (and wartfully, if you can forgive my newly attained habit for bad adverbs) how certain people simply are.

He was from slavery days.§ That Harper’s Ferry was a place, not a boat. And something of historical importance took place there, though I was fuzzy on exactly what.§ That Frederick Douglass was a famous black orator and abolitionist with an impressive head of hair.§ That slavery was a rotten deal for the slaves. They were abused, dehumanized and were denied elemental freedoms.§ That McBride’s book was attracting the attention of critics and award committees.Here’s what I came to know afterwards:§ That John Brown was a religious man, a dedicated abolitionist, and not afraid to die in his crusade against slavery. He seemed to be among the first to recognize that negotiations alone would not work; that it had come to a point where war was the only recourse left to abolish the institution. However, commanding such a small army (about half of which were his sons), his goals were rightly considered quixotic.  § A former slave boy in his pre-teens provided the colorful narrative voice. He was posing as a girl since Brown mistakenly thought he was one, which was just fine with Henry aka Henrietta aka Onion since it excused him from soldiering. In young Henry’s telling, Brown was almost a caricature – certainly delusional. Even so, you come away with a sense of knowing the man well. He was completely dedicated to the cause and figured having God on his side was his ace in the hole.§ The book followed the crooked path from Kansas Territory to Harper’s Ferry, VA with Brown and his small band fighting slavery the best they could along the way. The coup de grace was supposed to be the takeover of the armory at Harper’s Ferry at which point many slaves were meant to join the fight for their freedom. Having this to drive the plot – actual history mixed with the fiction – was a big plus. § The portrait of Frederick Douglass probably did cross the border into caricature. I won’t go into particulars, but predilections involving women and strong drink seemed exaggerated and his actual accomplishments (which Wikipedia indicates were many) were downplayed. I’m not sure what McBride’s purpose was in doing this. It’s no doubt something interviewers have asked him. In any case, Douglass did not fare as well as the Old Man (Brown) or Harriet Tubman did in PR terms.§ Like I said before, we all know already what a terrible chapter slavery was in our national history. What was interesting to consider after reading the book was something McBride was clever to do. Through Henrietta he adopted a much lighter tone: more humorous and meek, less severe and morally outraged. In fact, little Onion said he was never hungry as a slave, whereas he often felt starved riding with Brown. This is not to say that slavery was anything but horrible and degrading. I think McBride’s choice was meant to spare us the narrative sledgehammer that might have made us think of slaves as victims only – an exceedingly sad class in the abstract – without thinking of them first as the individuals they were. McBride developed his characters well so that by the time late in the book when Henry said this:”Being a Negro means showing your best face to the white man every day. You know his wants, his needs, and watch him proper. But he don't know your wants. He don't know your needs or feelings or what's inside you, for you ain't equal to him in no measure. You just a nigger to him. A thing: like a dog or a shovel or a horse. Your needs and wants got no track, whether you is a girl or a boy, a woman or a man, or shy or fat, or don't eat biscuits, or can't suffer the change of weather easily. What difference do it make? None to him, for you is living on the bottom rail.”it really resonated.§ The award committees knew what they were doing. It was exuberant, entertaining, and thought-provoking.

I’m imaging what a PR response might look like, though not The new book by Michael Lewis criticizing high-frequency trading has created quite a stir. I’m imaging what a PR response might look like, though not an entirely serious one. It’s structured in FAQ format, but the questions aren’t really frequently asked so much as ones I’d like to answer. The ideal audience would be the inquiring readers of Flash Boys open to a counterbalance.Q: Who is this Michael Lewis guy and why has this book been making such a splash?Lewis is an influential writer with a talent for making his readers feel smart. It’s like they’ve been given inside access to some previously hidden world. Depending on the book, it could be - an intimate understanding of how richly compensated alpha males at a trading desk on Wall Street dominate the poor schlubs (Liar’s Poker)- how a cash-constrained baseball executive can use statistics to cobble together a winning lineup (Moneyball)- how the geniuses of modern day football came to realize the importance of a great left tackle in protecting the quarterback’s butt (Blind Side), or- how a select few investors could foresee the folly of investing in subprime mortgages doomed to default (The Big Short)And he does this in a readable way. He explains complicated mechanics in understandable terms, he identifies heroes and villains, and he structures his narrative like any good writer would, building to conclusions after couching them as mysteries or puzzles for his brainy protagonists to solve.While Flash Boys features many of those same traits, it seems less like good investigative journalism this time. In fact, it feels more like marketing literature, or maybe a prosecuting attorney’s closing argument. Lewis has been criticized for not having spoken to anyone who knew about HFT (high-frequency trading) from the other side of the fence. That’s the raison d’etre for this FAQ of sorts.Q: Let’s wade in the same way Steve Kroft did with Lewis in his 60 Minutes interview. What’s the headline here?Essentially this: Michael Lewis is going to sell a whole bunch of books and will end up, by dint of some serious negative spin, manipulating public opinion way more than HFT has ever manipulated markets. Q: Is the industry reeling from the critical language? You and your market rigging ilk are evidently a “cancer”; nothing but “parasites”. In addition, in an impressive burst of lawyerly bombast, financial fraud attorney Andrew Stoltmann describes you as “little more than digital piranhas, creating feeding frenzies that can send the market into volatile, spasmodic fits” leaving “a trail of carnage.”Yeah, but aside from that we’re not so bad. Seriously, it’s frustrating when you know something is, at worst, light gray and someone with a microscope comes along training his lens on the black pixels only, saying “Oh, look how black it is; and hey, there’s another one.” And it doesn’t help when the lens is smudged so that each one he focuses on seems darker than it really is.Q: You’ll admit Lewis did a good job choosing his hero, right? If there’s such a thing as Boy Scouts of Canada, I bet Brad Katsuyama earned every one of their badges. He’s bright, hard-working, earnest, and no doubt set the standard for what the Royal Bank of Canada called “RBC-nice”. He’s the one who explained to Lewis and others what was happening when he attempted do a big trade. A split second after he’d enter his order, the market dried up on him. The quantities displayed on his screen at his targeted price were disappearing before he could get all he wanted.You’re right about Brad. He does come across well. To be honest, though, at first he was a little naïve. He was somehow expecting that his order for say 100,000 shares wouldn’t have an immediate price impact that reflected the new knowledge of a big and abiding appetite. Even back at that time, most sophisticated players in the market knew they’d have better luck breaking their order up, trading chunks here and there at different times and different exchanges as liquidity would allow rather than spooking the market with an order size that was bound to change the equilibrium price in an instant.Q: Yeah, but what about the front-running, where speed demons would take their knowledge of Brad’s intention to buy and go to other exchanges to buy ahead of him, driving up the price and making Brad pay more to get all the shares he wanted?OK, first of all, please use quotes when you use the term front-running. In fact, don’t use it at all. Front-running, properly defined, is an immoral and illegal act where a brokerage firm uses knowledge of its own customers’ orders to jump ahead of them in the market in anticipation of easy profits when the customer transactions cause the price to change. Anybody doing that truly is scum. They’ve broken the fiduciary trust, may make their customer pay more by the time the order gets to market, and have stolen privileged information to advantage themselves. Q: Back to the issue at hand, is whatever this thing is that you don’t call front-running fair? Brad, our authority on what’s “nice”, didn’t think so.A certain segment of the market probably does consider itself put out by these fast-changing conditions. But we need to look at the situation from a broader perspective. Once I explain I hope you’ll see why not everyone agrees with our “nice” friend.Q: Is this something we can understand by way of the company Lewis made up to illustrate his point – Scalpers Inc.? They’re the ones who would hastily get in ahead of every investor order, buy up all the shares, then sell them to the investor at a higher price after front-running running in front of them.Grrr – “running in front of” – for that I’m going to double the length of my response. So, in Lewis’s unrealistic example we’re to believe that those rascals at Scalpers Inc. somehow know with great certainty that the poor honest investor has a certain size trade to do, somehow skips ahead in line to snap up those shares, raises the price and imposes its insidious tax, all without risking a dime. Bzzzzzzt! Wrong. I’m sure Lewis would argue that this example was concocted for pedagogical purposes, meant only to illustrate net effects that we see. But it’s so far off the mark that it’s very misleading. First of all, for the big investor’s hand to have been tipped, a chunk of their order had to have traded. Then, Scalpers Inc. would have to make an educated guess about what the future price impact would be from the unknown remaining order size. From there, Lewis would have you believe that a sort of queue jumping would occur. Not true. The best they could do would be to go to another exchange to see if it’s worth crossing the bid/ask spread to bet on whether they predicted the big investor’s demand and possible price impact correctly. The Scalpers Inc. team is at its luckiest when they guess right about the price move and some of the participants quoting at the various exchanges (often HFT players themselves) hadn’t reacted yet either because they were slow or they disagreed about what the fair price should be. In this scenario, the big investor is likely to see the market back away from its order (meaning that market makers are cancelling the rest of their quotes at that price level). Again, that’s just a natural reaction to what is now viewed to be a new fair value from the market equilibrium. Q: That makes sense, but it’s a lot to chew on all at once. Can you back up just a skosh to cover how these markets are structured and who does what, when, where and how?Sure. The first thing to understand is that everyone wants to buy low and sell high.Q: OK, wise guy. You do know the meaning of skosh, right?Your archaic patois suggests that maybe I should start with intermediaries, specialists, market makers and bid/ask spreads. As you (probably) know, market intermediaries have served a useful function since the days cavemen were trading mastodon futures. Be they human or algorithmic, the goal is to provide liquidity by committing to buy at a lower price and sell at a higher price, serving as a conduit to facilitate trade. Of course it would be easy money if motivated buyers and sellers consistently and in synchrony came along to buy at your higher selling price and sell at your lower buying price. However, the spread between those two prices has to be big enough to compensate for the times when it’s only sellers coming along; and poor you, you’ve bought something falling in price without any buyers to sell your inventory to at the higher price. Of course, the market maker can be hurt in rising markets, too, with a short position that’s getting more and more expensive to buy back. The more the market makers can do to reduce those risks, the more willing they are to cut the distance between their buying and selling prices in order to attract extra business. Spreads are now razor thin. This is a huge benefit for the rest of the market, and apparently an underappreciated one.For anyone who has made it this far, and wants to see more, the faux FAQ continues here.

Troy Soos apparently took this advice to heart when he used his extensive knowledge of baseball and early 20th century American history to put together a series of murder mysteries. This one was his third, where veteran second baseman and amateur sleuth Mickey Rawlings was playing for the Cubs. It was 1918, and rookie shortstop Willie Kaiser found himself to be a very unpopular figure what with anti-German sentiments running high. Bach, Beethoven and Mozart were banned; Dachshunds were getting shot; and on July 4th Willie met his maker. Gott im Himmel. It was quite a while ago that I read this, but I remember the period detail being quite good. The wartime attitudes rang true, the Chicago atmospherics seemed plausibly raw, and the baseball scenes were spot on (meaning, for one thing, that the Cubs fell short once again). I liked that real players like Shoeless Joe Jackson and Fred “Not a Bonehead” Merkle featured in the story. The murder mystery was entertaining, too, with suspects that included the shortstop that Willie replaced, an anti-German vigilante group, and a minority owner who wanted to take over the team. I have two reasons for mentioning this book. First, the launch of a new baseball season has put me in the mood (though I don’t typically start wishing myself at the games until the ivy fills in at Wrigley, at which point the Cubs may be 10 games out of first). My other reason for this  is to announce my own intention to write what I know. With as much time as I’ve spent on this site the last few years, I had the idea to involve Goodreads ers in a murder mystery. I don’t want to give too much away, and it’s only roughly sketched out at this point, but the basic premise is that a rather heated debate occurs in the comment section of a , feelings are hurt, egos are bruised, attacks are ad hominem, sides are chosen and even the would-be peace makers have agendas. Then a suspicious death occurs among one of the principals. I don’t plan on using any real names, so no worries there. However, I suspect many identities will be thinly veiled.

Of course, when the lovely lass I married accompanied me there last year to celebrate a round-number anniversary, I can be forgiven for thinking about it even more, right? Beyond the history, scenery, culture, silver-tongued locals and tasty libations, there’s the draw of their proud literary tradition. Roddy Doyle has done his part to continue this. Many here know him from his book The Commitments, the first in the Barrytown Trilogy and the basis for a fookin’ brilliant film. Well, PCHHH is no slouch either. It won a Booker in 1993. Both Doyle and his protagonist are exactly my age. It was interesting to me to see the similarities and differences that a ten year old Dublin lad would experience in 1968. I could relate to the joys of transistor radios and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., for instance, and more generally to that emerging awareness of a complicated world. The horseplay among boys that age was another commonality. (When or where has that not been the case?). Even so, the extremes to which Paddy and his mates took it would have been ruled out of bounds most places. For instance, I’m pretty sure I never tried to set my brother’s lips on fire with lighter fluid, or hobble anyone from the wrong side of the tracks. The overall feel of it was like Ralphie from A Christmas Story had he been speaking about his miserable Irish childhood (a la Angela’s Ashes, though perhaps slightly drier) with the Marquis de Sade as technical advisor.One aspect of the book that was both similar and different was the emphasis on sports. While stateside the obsessions involved baseball, football (the oblong, American kind) and basketball, over there it was just football (the round, rest-of-the-world kind). George Best was the flashy Irish superstar at Manchester United who was Joe Namath, Mickey Mantle and Dr. J all wrapped into one. In their play-acting matches there was fierce competition for who got to be him. Paddy’s little brother Francis (a.k.a. Sinbad) opted out of that role, preferring to be one of the less celebrated players. I figured it said a lot about the brother relationship that Paddy always worked every advantage to appear the dominant star whereas Sinbad was happy to play an ancillary role, creatively feeding the ball to the scorers, ending up more responsible for the results even if less recognized. The fact that Paddy acknowledged Sinbad’s sacrifice and cleverness was meaningful since we saw only the antagonism prior to that point. George Best also featured in another story when Paddy’s da bought him a cherished copy of Best’s book, autographed by the man himself. Or was it?Paddy’s vignettes did not constitute a plot, per se. They were closer to stream-of-consciousness, though a post-Joycean variety where obfuscation was less of a goal. Plus, they built towards something of a climax -- an affecting realization. The convergence of Paddy’s growing maturity and empathy levels with his mum’s tears and his da’s sullen demeanor made him view Sinbad and his parents in a new way, but, begorra, I shan’t say more.

It was February of 1910 when baby Ursula died at birth,Chances are you’ve already heard about the device Atkinson used to tell this remarkable story. It was February of 1910 when baby Ursula died at birth, but she was granted a narrative do-over. Next time the doctor made it through the snowstorm to sever the umbilical cord that was strangling her. She also got another chance after tumbling from the roof trying to reach a doll her malignant older brother had thrown there. Similar life after death sequences played out after a seaside drowning, the Spanish flu, and various war-time atrocities. Some might call this a gimmick, but that seems too pejorative a term to me. In Atkinson’s capable hands it was a wonderful tool that allowed her to play ""what if"", to explore subtle changes with far-reaching consequences (though butterflies and chaos were never mentioned), as well as to evaluate moral trade-offs where alternative scenarios improve the lot of some to the detriment of others. The way I’ve described this so far you might imagine that Punxsutawney Phil and a very resigned Bill Murray would feature at every turn. But it wasn’t really like that. For one thing, the story didn’t always revert back to square one (where the Sonny and Cher equivalent might have been playing on the gramophone). Plus, there were exogenous differences in each scenario, separate from Ursula’s actions. A better analogy might be how we navigate our way through a maze, proceeding until we reach a dead end and backtracking to the point where we can follow a different path. But even that’s not quite right. With the maze, we know where the decision points are. At best, Ursula had dim recollections of previous paths taken – a vague sense of déjà vu. Atkinson scored literary points for the artful abstractions of these foggy memories. Before I get too carried away with the device, which I suspect had to do with a huge inventory of ready-to-use death scenes Atkinson wanted to employ ;-) , I should mention what I consider to be even better selling points: the story, the characters and the setting. As fans of her Jackson Brodie books will attest, Atkinson is a master of crime drama. She was not about to short-shrift us on plot. Each snippet of Ursula’s life (or, more appropriately, lives) had plenty going on including creative avoidance of paths we knew from before wouldn’t work. Her relationships with men got appreciably better in later iterations once she got past her teenage naivety and some very unwelcome advances. Many of the most poignant storylines derived from the hardship of the setting – England spanning the two world wars. You might imagine that air raids, deprivation, and loss of loved ones would leave little time for character development beyond a collective stiffness of upper lips, but you’d be wrong. Ursula herself was insightful, empathetic, philosophical and poetic. Her family members, including a larger-than-life aunt who struck it big with a children’s book series, had memorable traits as well; all of them recognizably human. Friends and co-workers were given enough personality to be interesting, too. That was even true of the German ones.Speaking of Germans, there was one in particular that authors of do-overs consistently wish dead. Atkinson was no exception (which I don’t consider a spoiler since it was taken up in the first two pages). It is a fascinating question, even if over-asked. What if he had been killed before he had influence? How many lives would have been spared? What would our culture be like had there been no Holocaust? Or, as Ursula wondered, what if the US had not spent its way out of the Depression during the war and become the dominant purveyor of goods and lifestyles. (Cheeky lady, implying it would be better. But I have to ask: how fast would her food be now? And how much reality would her TV feature?)I really liked this book. Typically I’m suspicious of devices that quantum physics, even at its strangest, can’t explain. But this one felt right. In a time when life was too easily lost, in a place where the war seeped into too many homes, it seemed appropriate that a work of fiction would offer some therapeutic revamping. All the more so after Atkinson personalized it for us, putting a likable lady with multifold potential in the middle of it all. And if one of the goals of personal development is to choose optimal paths, it’s helpful to see a template where repeated trials over similar circumstances lead to better decisions and an older soul....more",Notes are private!,3,153,1,not set,not set,"Mar 05, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790842-life-after-life

But reminders of that rule seem more frequent lately. We can appreciate Llewyn Davis for his artistic integrity even as we cringe at his lapses in kindness. And I suspect I would still laugh at Broadway Danny Rose, though since the news came out about Soon Yi Previn (even prior to Dylan Farrow) I came to see Manhattan in a different light. Anyway, the reason I bring this up is that the book’s central character, A. N. Dyer, is a writer who we’re told has great talent, but also has a callous disregard for most everyone around him. His magnum opus entitled Ampersand is a modern classic – often mentioned in the same breath with Catcher in the Rye. Both are riffs on the disaffected youth theme. And Dyer, like Salinger before him, is a recluse with an edgy mystique about him.Evaluating the art independent of the artist is fair, but that should not bias us in favor of something just because a miscreant created it. (Note that I’m no longer talking about Salinger here.) Related to this, I sometimes feel that darker, more cynical art gets a critical free pass because it’s deemed to be honest about our base assholish nature. But isn’t it possible to overshoot? While I wouldn’t trust Walt Disney to get the scene at an elite boys’ prep school right, I’m not sure I trust the portrayal of abject cruelty that Dyer produced either. As Sally said to Harry, just because you have a dark side doesn’t mean you’re deep. Nor does it make you unblinkered. And to paraphrase David Foster Wallace, arch ironists typically give us nothing in place of what they’ve taken down. So no, given the excerpts we see from Ampersand, I did not accept that Dyer had produced great art. I may have had even less regard for him (and it) than Gilbert intended, though that I can’t know. Maybe Gilbert would be fine with a reaction of any sort.After this prolonged and tangential intro, I hereby step down from the soap box and vow to hurry through the rest. Despite my feelings about Dyer, I did enjoy parts of this. It’s very much a book of its time, with plenty of contemporary references. At some point the cultural stereotyping gained better footing, the animus seemed less contrived, and I settled in for the ride.The title was undoubtedly meant to evoke the residuum after Ampersand, but it also refers to Dyer’s three sons. The profiles of Richard (the recovering addict, screenwriter and family man), Jamie (the self-knowing avant garde film maker), and their young half brother Andy (the high school kid and reluctant virgin who lives with A. N. [Andrew] near Central Park) were all delivered well. The plot opens at the funeral of Andrew’s friend since boyhood, Charles Topping, who was more faithful to Dyer than he deserved. Andrew agreed to speak at the funeral which caused a lot of excitement since the public had seen so little of him in recent years. Dyer had a mini-breakdown while there and afterwards sought to make up with his two older sons and to bring them closer to Andy. The rest of the book was about their reunion and the various angles that each one was working to capitalize on the Ampersand asset value. There was what many would consider a shark-jumping moment concerning Andy’s paternity, but by then you may feel it’s worth the suspension of disbelief required to get past it. The narrator was Charles Topping’s son Philip. He knew the older Dyer boys when they were younger, but was never part of their inner circle. That was a tension with potential. However, as a character, Philip was thinly drawn, and as a narrator, he was often unreliable. It irked me when he supplied dialog and thought bubbles to scenes he was nowhere near. I can see why Gilbert would want Philip included for the discoveries he made about his father and Dyer, but his quasi-omniscient storytelling didn’t wash. Nabokov might have pulled it off, but I don’t think Gilbert did.I’m willing to forgive much if the writing is good. In this case, it falls short of total redemption. His literary aspirations often smacked of trying too hard. To my ear, certain metaphors fell flat (e.g., “a friend approaching like a salesman selling hurry,” or a doorman described to be “like a noncommissioned officer serving the higher ranks, prepared to stop even the best-dressed bullet”). On top of that, words or phrases could seem a bit off (e.g., “an easy Nordic complexion”). But then other times the writing was bright and even funny. I’ll run the risk of a bad metaphor of my own likening Gilbert to the free-swinging slugger who strikes out a lot, but can also drive it deep when he connects.

Well, I’ve given myself a week to think about it, and the fact that I did think about it skews it to the positive. But then the equivocator in me recognizes that controversial books often have strong pluses and minuses to consider. Here are the factors as I see them.A compelling plot. Plenty happens to make this more than just navel fixation. Thirteen-year-old New York City kid, Theo, had one good parent (a mom who genuinely cared for him) and one bad one (a booze hound who had abandoned them). Then, soon after Theo’s mom described what was special to her about the goldfinch painting they were looking at, a bomb went off in the museum and he lost his good one. Dazed, and before he learned of his mother’s fate, he heard the dying wishes of an antique dealer who had been there with his niece Pippa. Theo’s original optimism that he and his mom would soon be reunited gave way to the agonizing truth, and he had to scramble to avoid foster care. He ended up in the posh digs of a nerdy friend from school who had been a co-target of bullying earlier when they both skipped a grade. Theo was still reeling from his loss, but did manage to deliver an heirloom to the shop where the antique dealer had told him to go. There he met one of the kindest characters in all of litdom, a much needed ally named Hobie, along with Pippa who was recovering from the museum trauma. My rule in s is not to reveal more about the plot than what the inside flap does, so the only thing I’ll add is that Theo soon finds himself on the outskirts of Las Vegas, the object of indifferent (at best) child care, but able to survive when he teams up with a fellow hard luck case named Boris who could swear in multiple Eastern European languages and was wise to the ways of the world. Like any pulsating storyline, this one keeps the pages turning. (+)As bleak as any house Dickens could conjure. I googled “Tartt Goldfinch Dickensian” and came up with 62,300 hits. So yes, people have noticed the hardship. In and of itself, the gloom could be a (+) or a (-), but it tipped negative for me when the conflict, at times, felt contrived. And it was relentless. I was hoping the law of averages would give poor Theo a break every once in a while. To be fair I should mention that my misery tolerance may be compromised by the weather we’ve been having. (-) Poor decisions. The problem for me was not in Theo’s choices per se, but how inconsistent they sometimes seemed given his intellect, character and street smarts. At the same time, I have to remember how young he was when made many of them, and how leery a virtual orphan is apt to be to trust anyone in a position to help. (+/-) Resonating themes. Beauty, love, good vs. evil – as a big sprawling book, this one took its time and developed its notions well. I give extra credit, too, for the natural way philosophical conversations grew out of the story. When Hobie opined about what constitutes beauty and what its role is in our lives, his thoughts are backed by the long hours he spent restoring antique furniture. And when Boris talks about situational ethics, it’s with an insightful and accessible perspective from his own sordid past and from all the Dostoevsky he’s read. There were even moments of profundity that no doubt earn it literary plaudits. (+)Art appreciation. The Fabritius painting titled the same as the book is, not surprisingly, central to the story. It was analyzed and praised, its history was explained in detail, and Theo, as he narrated, recognized it as a metaphor, citing the small bird’s bravery to keep plugging away despite being chained to his perch. In fact, throughout the book there is a heightened artistic sensitivity. Theo went into the antiques business with a good eye for aesthetics. He also learned more than he might have liked about the art underworld. (+)Emotional honesty. Theo had issues, but he came by them in a plausible and understandable way. I felt way more empathy than antipathy for him. One of the harder things he had to deal with was a rather nasty pill habit. Given his heredity, his influences (primarily Boris) and the harshness of his early life, we don’t judge so much as relate. The book was also credible about the feelings Theo had for Pippa, whom he had idealized from a young age. (+)How many more pages anyway? It is long. And dense, too. That said, I was not so much bored as just ready to move on. Other books I got for Christmas were burning holes through the shelf. (-)Damn good writing. I guess in a way I’ve buried the lead: Donna Tartt writes really well. I heard she took a full decade to put this together, and it shows. The prose is crisp and refined; the research was first-rate; and her characters, even the minor ones, are nuanced and memorable. As a very small quibble, I sometimes felt like she would choose a slightly wrong word for a male narrator to use, but that was an increasingly rare feeling the more she drew me in to the story. The descriptions were the kind you wonder, thinking back, how such sharp pictures are etched in your mind when you never noticed any long passages that would have given them to you. I got that feeling several times, most noticeably when she described the antique shop where Hobie lived, the shell of a home in suburban Vegas, and the otherworldliness of Amsterdam (or at least of its underbelly). (+)Weighing the pluses and minuses puts this at a solid 4 stars for me. Despite wishing I could have finished it faster, the characters and great writing are likely to be the memories that last....more",Notes are private!,0,186,1,not set,not set,"Feb 19, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

My own predisposition doesn’t stop me from guessing who will and will not enjoy this book, though.Group 1: Bears fans of any age; NFL fans in general who remember the days before fantasy leagues; anyone who can name more than 3 players doing the Super Bowl Shuffle – A must readGroup 2: Leadership gurus interested in the coaching techniques of Mike Ditka and Buddy Ryan; medical researchers studying Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE); sociologists interested in the citywide bonding in Chicago that year among blacks, whites, rich, poor, urbanites, suburbanites, brat eaters and those who prefer polish sausages instead – You’ll probably like it, tooGroup 3: Haters who wear cheese wedges as hats and can’t handle even a whiff of Bears hagiography; Jains sensitive to violence against cows as they’re milked and root vegetables as they’re pulled from the ground; smart-arsed Brits who make fun of any ball that’s not round; Chicagoans during that glorious fall who looked forward to game days for crowd-free shopping at the malls – Maybe not so much Naturally enough, Rich Cohen was a Group 1 guy. He was a skinny kid from the suburbs at the time, but he was caught up in the excitement as much as any die-hard, burly superfan. His idol was the punky QB, Jim McMahon, who thumbed his nose at the establishment (and even Ditka), but was a born leader. Cohen wrote the book partly as an excuse to talk to the heroes of his youth.After a brief introduction highlighting the phenomenal success of the ’85 team and their thumping of the Patriots in the Super Bowl, Cohen backed up to the earliest days of the professional leagues. Back then, the college game was by far the more popular of the two. Pro teams were often little more than outlets for factory workers. In fact, the Bears began as the Decatur Staleys (Staley being a food starch manufacturer). As fate would have it, they had recruited the visionary George Halas, who had been a successful college player himself, to run the team. He soon moved them to Chicago, recruited some known college stars, and knew to suggest the only name-brand presence among them as the first commissioner of the league – Jim Thorpe. Halas’s team came to represent the scrappiness of the city itself, endowed with plenty of the old “zipperoo” (as we were reminded too many times). Once he recruited the smart and athletically gifted Sid Luckman to revolutionize the offense with passing, the Bears began tormenting the rest of the league. Things were up and down for the Bears after that era, though, and by the time Halas hired his former tight end, the surly but influential Mike Ditka, to coach the team, they were pretty mediocre. They were building a hard-nosed defense, though, and the assistant coach responsible for it, Buddy Ryan, was kept on as a kind of co-head of the team. This autonomy created a rift between the two domineering coaches that was often unfriendly in the extreme.You can guess the rest. A nail-hard cast of characters joined the team, a take-no-prisoners-especially-opposing-QBs approach to the game prevailed, and the talented Walter Payton, who used to be their only weapon, finally had a supporting cast. One player who was regrettably not still around for the best Bears days was safety Doug Plank, the guy whose number was used as the moniker for the famous 46 defense. Plank was a nut case who confessed in an interview that his entire career would be a penalty in today’s game. The collisions took their toll, though. He hid smelling salts in his uniform to self-administer when necessary. After some hits he’d have to look down at his uniform to see what color it was so he’d know which huddle to go to for the next play. Also, he said, when they ask, “How many fingers?” the answer is always two.Cohen profiled quite a few players. Yale educated Gary Fencik was one he was especially excited to talk to since he was an odd combination of smart, urbane, normal-sized and self-sacrificingly brutal. And of course, many people remember the big gap-toothed fella from South Carolina, William “The Refrigerator” Perry. McMahon was an interesting interview, too. The hard-partying iconoclast spent much of his career injured and in pain, but said he’d do it again in a heartbeat. Worship from the legions is like that, I guess.The pinnacle year itself, 1985, and the Super Bowl of ’86, got less of a blow-by-blow description than I would have thought. Cohen did spend a fair amount of time on the one loss of the year against Don Shula’s Dolphins, a team motivated to maintain its record as the only one to have won every game of the regular season and the Super Bowl. Blitzing Bears defenders couldn’t quite reach Marino, and his vaunted quick-release passes to the exposed areas of the field won the day. Ditka admitted he was outcoached, though it was Ryan’s refusal to adjust the defense until late in the game that was thought to be the key. After the loss, the Bears were never threatened again. They won their post-season games, including the Super Bowl itself, by a combined score of 91-10, the first two being shut-outs. The Patriots’ QB had fear in his eyes for good reason. Of the 21 plays New England ran in the first half, only 4 went for positive yardage. The backup QB in the second half didn’t fare much better. The only cloud as far as the Bears were concerned hung over Walter Payton who felt cheated for not scoring a TD. In what would have been Payton’s best chance, with the Bears lined up near the goal, they gave the ball to the 300+ pound Fridge instead as a kind of novelty act.As much as Cohen is a fan of the game, he did not turn a blind eye to the damage that many of the players have suffered. CTE is a terrible thing and gets progressively worse after playing days are over. He says he looks at the highlight films of the most vicious hits differently now, especially when they turn out to be career-threatening. Ryan exhorting his team to open another can of quarterback doesn’t seem as sporting when a lifetime of pain may result. I’m wrestling with my own justifications for having been a fan at that time. Ignorance of the longer term impact is my only defense.Another interesting aspect of Cohen’s postmortem was to ask how such a spectacularly great team won only one Super Bowl. A combination of factors contributed, it seems. Injuries were part of it (McMahon’s especially), personnel changes played a role, as did the rest of the league’s adjustments to counter the Bears’ attacking defense. The overall tone of the book, though, was that it sure was fun while it lasted. Cohen’s enthusiasm was contagious. I recommend it to all of Group 1 and to at least some of Group 2....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,not set,"Jan 23, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17834830-monsters

William Stoner was the only child at his family’s farm in Missouri, with a work-to-play ratio that was high even by turn-of-the-last-century standards. When he came of age, his father sat him down and explained in about two minutes’ time how he thought it best to send his son to college to study modern agriculture. It was the longest Stoner had ever heard his father speak in one stretch. Stoner continued to do farm work for room and board while going to classes. The Ag Sciences curriculum was all well and good, but in his sophomore year he was thrown for a loop in a required English class. The professor put him on the spot asking for his interpretation of a sonnet by Shakespeare, and suddenly his life that had been a matter of facts gave way to matters of opinion, feelings, and gray scales. He switched majors without counsel or delay. This was his awakening, though little of it showed. He was still something of a stoic -- compliant and resigned. He did manage to break from farm life, enter grad school in English (to ultimately become a professor), make a few friends and meet a girl he quickly asked to marry, but we were often told that he was an outside observer of his own life, like a character in a book he didn’t write. I don’t know if anyone else interprets Stoner this way, but he seemed to me to embody the reading experience itself -- the losing of one’s self in the text and the passive acceptance that life’s narratives play out according to some authorial design. Stoner steps outside of himself to observe from afar his bad marriage, the effects of academic politics badly played, and the fall-out when his wife used his relationship with their young daughter in an unaccountably nasty battle against him. It’s frustrating to see how his inactions impinge on his happiness. But we also sense a richer inner life because of his books and his view of himself in light of them.The first quarter of the book was, to be honest, a little slow. Before Stoner’s love affair with literature, he was a tabula rasa. That being the case, it was difficult at that stage to generate much conflict to drive the story. What would an internal struggle be against? Then, faintly at first, the tabula took on a few etch marks. I’m not sure you’d describe Stoner as an everyman, but he was certainly a type of man -- the type who would find himself in circumstances he lacked the proactiveness to avoid. He’d have been the prime example of how not to do things in self-help books. He sucked at office politics (having taken what he thought to be a principled stand against another professor who soon became the department head), he wasn’t particularly collegial, and he could scarcely sell his own enthusiasms. On the face of it, he was some combination of schlub, schlemiel, and schlimazel. A brief spell of passion was disallowed by the political environment, which I liken to a favorite book that simply ends… with no sequel forthcoming. He lacked what it took to write his own story.Williams, an academic himself, said in a rare interview that he never considered Stoner a loser. In fact, he regarded him as quietly heroic, doing his job with few people encouraging him or caring, true to his life of letters. Judging from the high ratings, plenty of other readers must have picked up on this narrow but deep fulfillment, too. We may not consider him the best model for self-actualization, but we appreciate his integrity. There was an affecting end to the book, too, which I don’t want to spoil. The bottom line is this: if my theory about Stoner representing the reading experience is right, those of us who like reading will like Stoner. It’s a syllogism, right? And even if we don’t like the man, we can still like the book.Stoner gets the NYRB Seal of Approval and, for that matter, mine as well....more",Notes are private!,0,130,1,not set,not set,"Jan 17, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166997.Stoner

I realize that many of you will not be acquainted with this prophet of proper book choices. He writes a column for the Chicago Tribune’s weekly book  supplement. Aside from short essays on book-related topics (think pithier versions of chapters in Anne Fadiman’s Ex Libris), he invites readers to submit their own five most recent selections from which he divines the next one that should go on the list. It’s a fun exercise for someone like the Biblioracle (a.k.a. author John Warner) whose mother ran a bookstore in his youth, always ready with suggestions. Anyway, I submitted my own list, cheating just a little by including only the ones I really liked, and waited to see what the man with the oracular gift would suggest. Turns out his recommendation, Skippy Dies, was one I’d already read and loved, confirming his wisdom and reach. When I explained this in a mail, he graciously conjured up another one for me. To give him a little more to go on, I mentioned that I'd recently been smitten by Wallace Stegner’s Angle of Repose. This rather long-winded introduction explains how his choice for me, Walker Percy’s classic, The Moviegoer, now shows up on your screen.I can see why he chose it after I mentioned Stegner. The writing is very good, there’s an enticing complexity to the characters, and it has a strong sense of place. John Bickerson “Binx” Bolling is on the cusp of 30. He returned home as a wounded war vet and settled into a relatively successful job as a stockbroker in New Orleans. His passions in life are movies (had you guessed?), sporty cars, quirky family members, and the nicely curved back sides of his young secretaries. But is it enough? His personal “Search” for more suggests that it’s not.From other s I’ve read, it’s clear I’m not the only one to have picked up on a certain existential uneasiness here. In fact, I’d say the best thing about the book is trying to get a read on what exactly Binx is seeking out with his search. Percy was vague. He must have wanted us to speculate. Though there were tangible elements to it (a possible change in career in line with his aptitude for medical research, for one, or a good mate to share his life with, for another), the bulk of his searching was more abstract. Lines like this hint at a moral or spiritual dimension:My mother's family think I have lost my faith and they pray for me to recover it. [...] My father's family think that the world makes sense without God and that anyone but an idiot knows what the good life is and anyone but a scoundrel can lead it.But it seems to go deeper still into a psyche that’s in conflict with the escapist movies that he enjoys, the carnal pleasures that temporarily soothe his soul, and the easy charm he plies for surface connections. On the other side of the ledger lies a pretty profound Weltschmerz. When he says, “all the friendly and likeable people seem dead to me; only the haters seem alive,” his crisis seems real. In common shorthand, I guess you could say it’s a search for meaning – a way to reconcile his world-weary thoughts with what well-functioning folks intuit to be the good life. It was a theme with heft to spare. Had that been all there was, it might have seemed a tad ponderous. Percy may have sensed that, knowing to provide lighter fare as sides. Occasional humor helped the cause. And like many from the South, his language was rich and entertaining. Consider, too, that while it’s a cliché to refer to a place as another character, has it ever not applied to NOLA? Speaking of characters, there was a wealth of good ones beyond Binx and New Orleans. One was his aunt, a woman of rare insight and suasion. Another was his aunt’s step-daughter, Kate, who was Binx’s kindred spirit, and maybe even a love interest. She’d had some bad luck, though, and the thread she was hanging from was looking pretty thin. Such plot as there was had Binx and Kate driving.If you’re at all curious about well-written, character-driven, Southern existentialism, you should give this compact little prize winner a try. The Biblioracle knew to recommend it to me, and I’m grateful that he did.

Wallace Stegner’s Pulitzer PriFellow Goodreaders know that feeling of exhilaration when a new entrant pushes its way onto a top-ten-of-all-time list. Wallace Stegner’s Pulitzer Prize winner from 1972 is my most recent example. Of course, Goodreads ers also know the pressure involved in justifying the choice. So what makes this one so good? As befits a top ten inclusion, here are ten factors that come to mind.  1. A Damn Good Story Lyman Ward is a former professor of history with a bone disease that put him in a wheelchair. He moved into his grandparents’ house in California where he’d spent much of his boyhood. With a strong personal interest and a research historian’s skills, he studied the lives of his grandmother, Susan, and his grandfather, Oliver. She was an artist and later a writer transplanted from her genteel life in New York to be with her husband, the earnest engineer, out West. He specialized in big projects: mines, irrigation canals, etc. His integrity prevented the material success he would have liked as a source of comfort for Susan. She created what culture she could in mining towns, and had become known for her illustrations and magazine articles about life in the West. Stegner had permission to use real letters of a writer and painter from that era, lending the narrative an authentic voice. As their family dramas unfolded, Lyman had a few related episodes of self-discovery, all very cleverly done. 2. Complex Characters  What book could ever be considered great without an interesting cast? These players were decidedly not stick figures – more like Rubenesque (actually, that’s not the exact opposite I was going for, but you know what I mean). Starting out, Lyman seemed like a stock character – the crusty recluse – but he becomes more central and more nuanced as the book goes on. The way we see his grandparents through his eyes tells us a lot about him. To be honest, early in his narration I was put off by his invented dialog and false omniscience, but later, after he copped to this as a way to make them more real, I actually liked the device. All the characters, the ones on the periphery included, seemed very credible, with emotions that rang true and unexpected depths that only a first-rate writer could have imagined. 3. Interesting History It’s an impressive laundry list of things the curious reader can learn more about: technology of the time (from Oliver’s various engineering projects), culture (the arts community in NY, pioneer life in the West, the opulent part of Mexico where Susan and Oliver almost stayed for a job), and manners (subtle social conventions, shady business dealings, dirty politics). Lyman, with his background in history, was a very knowledgeable narrator. He had remarkable tunnel vision (literally, since his disease prevented him from turning his head) trained on his subjects. 4. Conflict  Clashes were easy to come by when the refined East (civilized society) met the rough-and-tumble West (opportunity). Tightrope walks were performed between desire and moral responsibility, the practical and the romantic, and in the case of Lyman and a curvy young assistant, the stodgy academic and the free-spirited hippie. There was conflict in Lyman’s concept of himself, too. Was he more like his grandmother or grandfather? It turned out to be a key question. 5. Blissful(?) Institutions The give-and-take of a marriage was a central theme. Susan was described as “more lady than woman” and Oliver was “more man than gentleman.” This made for some tension. As Stegner himself said in a Paris Review interview: Susan is more talented in many ways than Oliver. She shows off better. But while I wrote that book, thinking that I was writing about her as a heroine, I came to the end of it thinking maybe he is the hero because there is a flaw in her, a flaw of snobbery. She doesn’t adequately appreciate the kind of person he is, or the kind of work he does. That’s a story not about either men or women, but about a relationship, a novel about a marriage.On top of this, Lyman reflected on his own former marriage. Would he forgive his ex-wife for what she did to him? Should he have done more to prevent it from happening in the first place? More good questions both for him and for us. 6. Metaphorical Resonance  “Angle of repose” is an engineering term referring to the angle at which rocks and soil settle when tumbling down off a slope before coming to a stop. Lyman’s goal was to see “how two such unlike particles clung together, and under what strains, rolling downhill into their future until they reached the angle of repose where I knew them.” Another way to think of it may be as the point at which the slights that we suffer lose their animating force and finally give way to acceptance. Stegner spells out a second metaphor so well that I’m willing to risk further attention-squelching length to include it. There is another physical law that teases me, too: the Doppler Effect. The sound of anything coming at you – a train, say, or the future – has a higher pitch than the sound of the same thing going away. If you have perfect pitch and a head for mathematics you can compute the speed of the object by the interval between its arriving and departing sounds. I have neither perfect pitch nor a head for mathematics, and anyway who wants to compute the speed of history? Like all falling bodies, it constantly accelerates. But I would like to hear your life as you heard it, coming at you, instead of hearing it as I do, a somber sound of expectations reduced, desires blunted, hopes deferred or abandoned, chances lost, defeats accepted, griefs borne. 7. Powerful Descriptions What was clever here was how natural it was for Susan, the artist, to describe and even embellish the new sights she would see out West. Her eye for detail never got tedious. Of course, we know to credit Stegner for excluding any word that didn’t pull its weight. There were countless little analogies, too, that made for a pleasant experience. For example: “Bunion footed, wearing her look of a supposedly house-broken dog which is called upon to explain a puddle on the floor, Mrs. Briscoe labored toward them.” 8. Organic Philosophy  I like reading bigger thoughts, but less so when they’re without context. If they appear as natural outgrowths of a story or a character profile, I’m all in. With A of R I’m spoiled for choice looking for examples. Here are a few, ranging from aphorism and homily: It is an easy mistake to think that non-talkers are non-feelers. You'll do what you think you want to do, or what you think you ought to do. If you're very lucky, luckier than anybody I know, the two will coincide.  Home is a notion that only the nations of the homeless fully appreciate and only the uprooted comprehend.  Civilizations grow by agreements and accommodations and accretions, not by repudiations. The rebels and the revolutionaries are only eddies, they keep the stream from getting stagnant but they get swept down and absorbed, they're a side issue. Quiet desperation is another name for the human condition. If revolutionaries would learn that they can't remodel society by day after tomorrow -- haven't the wisdom to and shouldn't be permitted to -- I'd have more respect for them ... Civilizations grow and change and decline -- they aren't remade. 9. Awfully Good Writing I may have made my case already with the examples I’ve included, but let me add that this is more than just pretty language we’re talking about here. There’s plenty of substance to it, too. To my mind, Stegner is a true master of the craft. Every sentence has heft, yet never at the expense of flow. Early on I thought Stegner is like a grown-up when so many others are mere children in comparison. His candle-power shines brightly on every page. 10. Opportunities for Growth  Hokeyness aside, how many books do you read and wonder, “Gee willikers, am I possibly becoming a better person?” If you’re drawn to intelligence, please give Lyman, his grandparents, and most of all Stegner a try. If cumulative insight into human experience floats your boat, ships ahoy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,357,1,not set,not set,"Dec 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/292408.Angle_of_Repose

She’s a museum curator and he’s an amateur musicologist obsessed by the reclusive ex-singer-songwriter, Tucker Crowe, whose more limited popularity adds to his value in Duncan’s mind. Annie is surprised to find herself in e-contact with Tucker where they share regrets about lost time and the paths they’ve taken. Interplay ensues. From here, see if you can guess the answers to the quiz questions. 1. If we were to liken this book to a meal it would bea.

Poached Scottish Lobster with fennel puree, broad bean panisse and huckleberry emulsion – ultra-refined and highfalutin.d. Hot dogs and apple pie – as American as it gets; decidedly not bangers and mash with spotted dick.2. A theme in previous Hornby books that was repeated in this one (though not necessarily concluding that it was right) was thata.

The perlustration of a Gordian soul laid bare for us all to behold.c. A sandwich order at Sol’s Delicatessen .d. A new Tucker Crowe CD of old demo cuts put out 20 years after his far more polished album called “Juliet”; Duncan over-praised it, having been honored with the first public copy, and Annie panned it for being rough-hewn thus causing a rift.4. Among rock star stereotypes from Tucker’s era, the ones for which he became best known were for a. Green M&Ms before a show to the exclusion of all others.b. Snappy comebacks when requests for “Free Bird” were shouted from the crowd.c. Wine and women (to accompany song – accompanying to excess).d. Spandex and vomit.5. Tucker was increasingly self-aware, as which of these quotes would indicate:a. “There comes a time when you look into the mirror and you realize that what you see is all that you will ever be. And then you accept it. Or you kill yourself. Or you stop looking in mirrors.”b. “The truth about autobiographical songs, he realized, was that you had to make the present become the past, somehow: you had to take a feeling or a friend or a woman and turn whatever it was into something that was over, so that you could be definitive about it. You had to put it in a glass case and look at it and think about it until it gave up its meaning, and he'd managed to do that with just about everybody he'd ever met or married or fathered. The truth about life was that nothing ever ended until you died, and even then you just left a whole bunch of unresolved narratives behind you. He'd somehow managed to retain the mental habits of a songwriter long after he'd stopped writing songs, and perhaps it was time to give them up.”c. ""I rock, therefore I am.""d.

Wiki entries about Tucker’s career which, while clever to have included as a way to list facts, were unrealistically detailed and subjective.c. A pesky gnat that, as chaos theory suggests is possible, caused a train crash in Bolton.d. Certain GR ers who think increasingly in terms of gimmicks.9. The book seems to suggest thata. It’s possible to venture too far into the cult of celebrity, especially when the internet brings these people together with mutually reinforcing geekiness.b. Regret for time lost can be poignant.c.

John Stuart Mill had mastered Latin, Greek, Algebra and Euclidean Geometry by the time he was 8. Bobby Fischer won the US Chess Championship at the age of 14. When Orson Welles was 20, he directed his own adaptation of Macbeth as a WPA project with unemployed black performers in Harlem. Why I myself, if you’ll forgive me for crowing, memorized the batting averages of every member of the Cincinnati Reds’ starting lineup as a 12-year-old. So is it really all that impressive that Carson McCullers wrote this top 100 book* at the ripe old age of 23?! (Sorry, my humor never matured much beyond the days of Reds’ glory.)I have to confess that it was almost a distraction to read this knowing how young McCullers was to have written something so insightful, polished and world-weary. She managed to get deep inside the heads of five very different characters in a mill town in Georgia just prior to WWII and give voice to their many valid concerns. In the case of John Singer, the voice was purely an inner one. He was a deaf mute. In a way, he was the central island in the archipelago to which the others hoped to connect. Singer was a good listener (reading lips) and had understanding eyes, but there was a bit of Chauncey Gardiner about him, too, in that people assumed more of a Christ-like, simpatico alliance than was possible from their confidant. They didn’t realize how sad and lonely he was himself when his only friend, another deaf man, had been sent to the asylum. Singer’s hands (used for signing) became silent.Among the other characters, the adolescent tomboy, Mick Kelly, was most prominent. She’s said to be a semiautobiographical construct, which is easy to believe given her lanky appearance, her artistic sensitivity, and her advanced intellect. To me, she was a more human (read flawed, troubled and nuanced) version of Harper Lee’s Scout. She was written so powerfully – it was easy to ache alongside her as she craved more music (her big love in life) and peace of mind (that family circumstances would not allow).Doctor Copeland was another memorable character. As a highly educated black physician, he had few peers, but he had a vision for lifting his people and combating racial injustice. The lack of progress was brought home convincingly as McCullers did an excellent job personalizing it through him and his family. She was evidently ahead of her time, casting a critical, clear-sighted eye on the relations of the day. The two other POV characters were Jake Blount, a hard-drinking carnie mechanic with a Marxist bent, and Biff Brannon, a café/bar owner with a generous, aesthetic spirit struggling against alienation. They, too, bared their souls to John Singer as a part of an empathetic hub and spoke model.We get to know a handful of other characters, too, valuable for advancing the plot and populating the communal landscape. The Jewish boy growing up with Mick who fears the news out of Europe, Dr. Copeland’s son who finds himself on the wrong (black) side of the (white) law, Mick’s little brother George whose impulsive actions led to dramatic changes (most profoundly in himself) – they all had important parts to play.Things happen in this book, but I wouldn’t call it plot-driven. It’s mostly profiles of the people and reactions to the times. There was precious little cheer to go around. Faced with that fact, McCullers never did flinch. As one of the chaps in Spinal Tap once said, standing at Elvis’s grave, it was almost “too much bloody perspective.” Sugar must have been scarce in the Depression-era South – scant amounts to coat the world that she saw. But there seemed to be hope for sweeter days ahead. Even if I’m wrong about those hopes, this is an important and authentically observed book, well worth the time.*In 1998, the Modern Library ranked The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter seventeenth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

You may wonder at first if the unnamed narrator of these accounts could really be such an uncaring cad. Well, as a bottom line, maybe so. But the thoughts of murder, the thieving, and the ultra-callous disregard for fellow man were in large part a function of the skag, the booze, and the stolen pharmaceuticals. This does not excuse the insensitivity and messed up behavior so much as it explains the eeriness, fragmentation, and reflexive anger. But amidst the distortions, bits of clarity stand out. And in contrast to the alienation in dull shades of gray, a kindness of any tint will catch the eye. Has it ever been proposed as an exercise in creative writing to imagine being (if not actually being) high as a kite? What am I saying? Of course it has. And abstract, luminous words have come from such otherworldly mindsets, I’m sure. In fact, I would argue that this short book set in the psychedelic 70’s is a prime case in point. It figures, with Johnson also being a poet, that the writing would be taut and expressive. He captures the sentiments of the down-and-out so well, too. For example, he describes how the “tears of false fellowship dripped on the bar” and how a gunshot victim should be happy he’s getting “Haldol pumped by the quart.” The drug scene is the backdrop, but the fallout is the real focus.” I'd been staying at the Holiday Inn with my with my girlfriend, honestly the most beautiful woman I'd ever known, for three days under a phony name, shooting heroin. We made love in the bed, ate steaks in the restaurant, shot up in the john, puked, cried, accused one another, begged of one another, forgave, promised, and carried one another to heaven.”My favorite parts were when little hints of what it means to be human snuck into the stories. It didn’t always put the narrator in a favorable light, but usually pointed to something redeemable within him. He appreciated co-worker and co-addict Georgie for telling a friend of a friend who was seriously AWOL that he’d help get him to Canada. Georgie also wanted to save the baby rabbits of the mother he ran over with his car. Another story described the narrator’s best day ever, one where he and a friend made $28 each from honest labors stripping copper wire out of the friend’s abandoned house and then celebrating with their favorite bartender pouring them double shots but charging them only for singles.The last story was set at Beverly Home, a place for senile, disabled, and disfigured adults where the narrator was given a part-time job as the newsletter writer and a point of human contact for those rarely touched. He was off drugs and sober at this point, and regaining his health. His straight and narrow path was still a little skewed, though, when he discovered a Mennonite woman who happened to time her shower every day as he passed by her place after work. As immoral as his actions were, though, there was a sense that he’d turned the corner (view spoiler)[I was going to say he turned the corner to find an odd looking guy with a long beard but no mustache about to aim a shotgun his way, but I’d be taking too much literary license saying that. It never happened. (hide spoiler)]A book like this is an eye-opener. It’s a hard look at addiction, it’s an artistic peek at altered perceptions, and it’s a clever way to highlight humanity when set against the stuporous default settings.

It alsoThe title Ware chose for this wonderful assemblage of art work and words makes me think about the many ways in which authors tell their tales. It also prompts thoughts on how we size people up. Ware’s creation gives us plenty to say about story-building and profiling. Context, the narrative arc, appeals to our emotions, structuring, and connections among characters and to our empathetic selves all enter into it. You’ve no doubt seen the box that houses the contents. In it are 14 individual booklets of different shapes, sizes and formats. There is a bound book, a broadsheet newspaper, pamphlets, and even a cardboard foldout that makes you think of Boardwalk, Park Place and that other cherished asset among certain real estate professionals: the Get Out of Jail Free card. [image]You’re told order doesn’t matter. There are 14 choices of what to feast your eyes on first. Once you’ve committed to that, there are 13 choices for what to read next. Next there are 12 options, and so on. Those who are not used to factorials in math might be surprised to learn there are 87,178,291,200 different orders that could play out. The reason I mention this is to underscore the myriad of choices story constructors (authors, graphic artists, and those of us learning about people) have for how the story is told. Flashbacks, flashforwards, nonlinearities of all stripes… our perceptions can differ depending on the sequence we choose. Ware must want to emphasize the breadth of what’s possible. Does this enrich the experience? I’m not sure it does. We’re already used to wide combinatorial expanses and random probes into content from the internet. If anything, it’s a convenience when someone who knows what’s there to be conveyed lays out a preferred path. My own view is that starting in the middle at the time when the main characters live in the Chicago brownstone, then filling in with back-stories before picking back up with the chronology would be better. Plus, even though there is little in the way of action or extravagant drama, there was a kind of denouement that I would have been disappointed to learn about too early. It occurred in the 9” x 12” soft-cover booklet with the heading “Disconnect” if you want to save that for the end.It’s also interesting to think about the graphic novel as a story delivery vehicle. Ware did a brilliant job illustrating the advantages of his media. Like movies or plays, the visuals of a scene are there to behold; no words are needed. Also, a great artist like Ware can convey subtle emotions with his pen. It’s a slightly different, but still effective affirmation of the “show, don’t tell” rule. What I thought Ware did especially well, though, was to lay bare the characters’ interior lives. The many thought bubbles were insightful, they appeared naturally within the narrative, and they highlighted his talent as a writer. It’s no wonder Charles Yu, one of the judges in this year’s Tournament of Books at The Morning News website had this to say: I mean, this is the Tournament of Books, right? Not the Tournament of Fifteen Books and One Self-Contained Multimedia Sequential Art Narrative Architecture and Environmental Space. It’s like inviting the best 16 basketball players on Earth to have a one-on-one tournament and then telling one of them that, in addition to a basketball, he can also use a baseball bat. OK, that analogy maybe isn’t perfect, but you get my point.I’ll always prefer books for the full power of their words, but can also see the appeal of grown-up graphic novels. There’s the potential for extra creativity that Ware uses well. Even his panels are done with interesting twists, where the sequencing may be circuitous. Readers may also enjoy subtle clues about time passing, memories replaying, and impressions pixelating into oblivion. Another aspect of the art form and its potential for telling stories is hinted at on one of Ware’s more interesting pages. In this case the brownstone itself is narrating (which briefly made me wonder if the word building in Building Stories was meant to have a double meaning). Anyway, this page speaks to our curiosity about people and their stories even when these stories are mere snippets or peeks through a window:Who hasn’t tried, when passing by a building or a home at night, to peer past half-closed shades and blinds hoping to catch a glimpse into the private lives of its inhabitants? Anything… the briefest blossom of movement… maybe a head, bobbing up… a bit of hair… a mysterious shadow… or a flash of flesh… seems somehow more revealing than any generous greeting or calculated cordiality (say, if the tenants were to suddenly be born unto the porch and welcome the voyeur, hands increasingly outstretched) … the disappointing diffusion of a sheer curtain can suggest the most colorful bouquet of unspeakable secrets.With all this introductory blather I’ve said very little about the characters. This is a gross injustice because this collection is very much character-driven. First and foremost is the young lady on the top floor of the brownstone. She’s often rather sweet but is starved for companionship. Her cat does not suffice, it seems. Oh, and she’s missing part of a leg after a boating accident when she was young. On the floor below is a young married couple with problems. The main source of their trouble as I see it is the guy. He’s a lout. (In fact, the men in this rate poorly, in general. I wonder if Lifetime still makes movies and if so, if they’d be interested in the film rights.) On the bottom floor is the elderly landlady who has always lived there. She was an artist at one time and might have had an interesting trajectory herself, but Ware did not pursue it. The caterwauling couple had a back-story, too, but it wasn’t developed much. Maybe with a sequel, something like More Bricks for Building Stories, we can extrapolate. The lonely young lady at the top, in contrast, was fleshed out completely (unless you want to be literal about it, with the ever-present reminder of her missing lower leg there for us to notice). Anyway, the unnamed protagonist was mostly but not entirely a sympathetic character. I found myself wanting to bolster her self-esteem given her body image issues tied to her prosthesis and to the weight she was gaining. Sadly, she gave me a feeling of schadenschade. (Freudenfreude would have been nicer, but that wasn’t in the cards.) The happiness that certain events in her life gave her didn’t seem to alter her outlook for long. (I almost used the word Weltanshauung for outlook, but decided I’ve hit the compound German constructs hard enough already. (Now if I could just kick my habit for parenthetical asides.)) From what I’ve heard, Ware’s first major success, Jimmy Corrigan, was more dire than this one. It was uplifting to see that the protagonist here had an impetus for optimism that paralleled Ware’s own – the birth of a daughter. Interviews point to quite a few similarities between Ware and this character. She, too, went to art school and has a way with words. From accounts I’ve heard, self-awareness and a sharp inward focus are other traits they share. A judge in the later rounds of the Tournament of Books called this collection twee. The commentators, who are typically mild-mannered and supportive of all points of view had trouble letting this comment stand. I can see why. This is a mature work with as much ambition and emotional heft as any standard-format fictional work. It may hurt your soul a little, but it’s well worth the glimpse through the windows into these lives.

Thanks to Connell’s many revealing vignettes, everything about her rang true.Mrs. Bridge and her husband, a successful lawyer who worked long hours at the office, lived in Kansas City with their two daughters and younger son. The time period covered the twenties up to WWII. During much of this time, of course, the country was in The Great Depression, but you wouldn’t know it by them. Her Lincoln, laundry, kitchen and home were well-tended. At first I viewed her as a kind of numeraire -- a God-fearing Midwestern middlebrow against whom the differing attitudes of the day and quirks of other characters could be measured. Then, as more tiles in the mosaic were put in place (117 short chapters), I found that her own nuanced profile had emerged. It wasn’t always one we could admire, but it was one we could understand. She was a recognizable product of human nature and the times.There are so many examples of Connell’s brilliant character bites that it’s difficult to come up with a representative few that can illustrate. These tidbits did not constitute a plot, but they were interesting enough in their own right to keep the narrative lively. Characters other than Mrs. Bridge were profiled, too, including her family, servants and friends. We’re reminded of the state of race relations (“knowing one’s place” in essence) and the role of many housewives in the pre-feminist era (deferring to the husband in most every way). Mrs. Bridge was the most fully drawn, of course. (Mr. Bridge got his chance in a follow-up book Connell published 10 years later.) She was » not one to speak her mind if it could be construed as poor manners to do so» a careful student of appearances» innately suspicious of change» friends with a woman who liked arts and books, but could never seem to follow through with her own self-improvements (Spanish lessons curtailed after chapter 1, her short-lived political awareness campaign yielded the way to Mr. Bridge’s pronouncements, and books were often abandoned)» progressively less successful imparting her old values to the new generation of BridgesWhile it was not always easy to like Mrs. Bridge, it was no leap at all to feel sorry for her. As her children grew independent, she had very little to do. Companionship from her husband was minimal. And the purposelessness she felt really stung. To sum it all up, Connell’s last short chapter presented the perfect ending: (view spoiler)[Mrs. Bridge was pulling her Lincoln out of the garage when the engine died. Her door was right up against the side of the garage and the other doors were obstructed, too. She was trapped, with no clue of how to get out. Would anyone hear her cries for help? If so, when? (hide spoiler)]Character profiles usually hinge on how well they're crafted. On that count, this one gets top marks. It's subtle, observant and well-written without so much as a whisper to say that upper-class ennui might be boring or twee. 4.5 stars rounded to 5....more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,not set,not set,"Aug 16, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8262059-mrs-bridge

He could observe them readily in the people of his day; ascribe them to his characters; and make readers feel that by identifying them in others, they’d be immune to their transcription. (Well, maybe I’m just hoping for that last part.) O’Kelly was a journalist, activist, playwright and story writer of some renown back in the early 1900s in the western part of Ireland. The Weaver’s Grave is purported to be his masterpiece. Very human failings were in full display in this and the other stories in the short collection I read. They were telling and often darkly humorous. Most of the title story takes place in the Cloon na Morav (Meadow of the Dead) where the old weaver’s young widow along with twin brothers who were there to dig the grave were patiently waiting for two old curmudgeons to figure out the exact burial site. There were no maps. The widow and brothers were at the mercy of the two men’s conflicting memories. And “conflicting” is the operative word. This retired pair enjoyed their brief revival of purpose, and neither one was about to be outdone by the other as the light was again shining their way. The antipathy between them was real, precipitating the black humor I mentioned above. The widow was getting anxious, though. The weaver had been the graveyard’s lone authority on final resting spots, but had neglected to tell anyone where his own was meant to be. The two old gits were trying to remember where the weaver’s family had been buried, but ultimately contradicted each other. The widow sure didn’t want a restless spirit dissatisfied by the placement. As conflicts go, this may not sound like much, but O’Kelly draws it out well. Plus he introduces other dimensions to the story to add flavor, including one about the widow recognizing how even identical twin brothers can be unique. Minor spoiler: (view spoiler)[Maybe one has a little more sparkle in his eye than the other. (hide spoiler)]. I liked the way the narrator put it:  There is nothing more powerful, but nothing more delicate in life than the valves of individuality. To create the impression that humanity was a thing which could be turned out like a coinage would be to ruin the whole illusion of life.The end was a bit of a surprise, but interesting in that we finally see what O’Kelly’s intentions were all along. By and large, the writing was good. The dialog was idiomatic and therefore fun, and the insights into people, especially their foibles, were how ze French mat say au fait. There was one other story in the collection that I thought was very good – “Nan Hogan’s House.” Nan was a rather sour widow who fell ill. She was incapacitated in most ways, though her tongue was still as active and sharp as ever. During her stay in the hospital, away from her house in Kilbeg, she…[…] had no longer a monopoly on gloomy speculation, for her fellow sufferers in the ward were all more or less inclined to take a morbid view of life. This fact took a great deal of point from Nan’s outlook. She had a feeling she was only throwing ink on a black sky. There was no satisfaction in holding parleys with patients who paid back gloom for gloom. She missed the lively background of Kilbeg, the conflict of outlook that brought out the light and shade of her battling will.When Nan learns that another woman has taken over her house, she quickly regains her strength and the battle begins. This story had more than the usual amount of insight into those personality flaws I keep mentioning and it featured some clever ways of getting around them. I have a soft spot for this book because of the way we discovered it. My wife and I were at a bookstore in Dublin perusing the Irish Fiction shelves when an older gentleman who I’m pretty sure must kiss the Blarney stone annually came up and started telling us in increasingly spirited tones about this, the greatest Irish short fiction of all time. He said we could get it for 5 Euros at such and such place. He was a kindly old soul, not at all like the irascible rivals in the title story, but maybe similar in that he was hoping to still prove himself relevant. In any event, we were excited to track this down. As it turned out, such and such place didn’t have it. Nor did the dozen other places we tried, and it wasn’t even clear that it was still in print. I have to say it wasn’t as much fun getting a used copy from an online seller, but then it might not be the most magically transcendent Irish short fiction of all time either. The memory of the old man talking it up with such passion remains my favorite part of the experience. ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12307373-the-weaver-s-grave

Thomas Bernhard’s Concrete is chock full of misdirection, loneliness and dark humor that combine for a truly unique albeit dissonant reading experience. The main character, Rudolph, is a middle-aged Austrian and would-be musicologist, paralyzed by indecision and molehills disguised as mountains. He is not the least bit proactive or even functional. I won’t divulge much of the plot, but I will say that his solipsism ultimately gives way to a bit of human outreach. His decade-long writer’s block as he sought just the right context was painful and funny in equal measure. So too was seeing his artistic sensitivity pitted against his complete inability to do anything useful with it. It would be a disservice to you dear readers to say more. The bigger point, it seems to me, is that for certain individuals and maybe for all of us to an extent, connections with other people can be tenuous, uncertain and even distasteful, but still fundamental. The aphorism about being an island still applies – no one is.The book was quasi-standard literary fare. Bernhard wrote the entire novel, short though it was, as one uninterrupted paragraph with stream-of-consciousness coursing throughout. It was an effective marriage of modernism and existentialism, with a shaggy dog serving as witness.All in all it was interesting to see the curmudgeonly Rudolph attempt to justify himself and become slightly more self-aware in the process. I was entertained, frustrated and made to wonder all at the same time, or, just as I said before, unresolved.3.75 stars rounded to 4.Review written by Phil Indablanck using SHAMS (the Steve Hotopp Assisted Manuscription System™)------------------------------Linked examples:See here for Alfaniel's stellar application of the SHAMS product as he ed True Names... and Other Dangers by Vernor Vinge.Stephen M's lack of success in achieving his SHAMS objective (wealth, women), shown here, is one we'll call the exception that proves the rule....more",Notes are private!,0,104,1,not set,not set,"Jul 30, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7181039-concrete

Before that, though, seeing as how I’m foaming over with excitement and appreciation, I have multiple people to thank.⊕ First, to the author: I know that you’re dead, but believe you must be sitting at the right hand of Odin, smiling that another reader has recognized your magnificent talent for stories, your impressive capacity for research and your sure way with words. Plaudits to your translator, too. It couldn’t have been easy to get the spare, vaguely archaic tone of this right.⊕ To NYRB Classics: Had I known that your choices for reissue were this good, I’d have sampled your collection much sooner. ⊕ To my lovely, level-headed wife who may be a bit prejudiced against Norsemen (and, for that matter, frat boys): Your initial reluctance to believe that a story about Vikings in the late 10th century could be good made me realize that I’d have to work hard to make my case. And yes, Susan, women were featured, though the chivalry they were shown was not what you might call refined.⊕ And finally, to Sandmeyer’s Bookstore, my favorite purveyors of fine reading here in Chicago: From the bottom of my ale-cup to the tip of my Andalusian steel, I say thank you for placing this book in my hands. Ellen and Ulrich, you and your well-read customer who named this the best story ever were absolutely right – I now have a new standard for rollicking good fun and ripping good yarn.Plot and HistoryTo me, the best historical fiction integrates real events into the narrative in such an entertaining way that you hardly notice the education. This is exactly that kind of book. I now know lots about the Viking Age, Al-Mansur in Andalusia, Brian Boru in Ireland, Ethelred the Unready, the Battle of Maldon and many of the Norse Kings and chieftains. This comes as part of the package featuring the adventures of one Red Orm (red being the color of his hair and of his face when he’s angry). We first meet Orm as a young teen left at home in Scania (now southern Sweden) with his mother as the older men were a-viking. He tried his best to defend their farm against a party of thieves, and for his efforts gained enough respect to join the raiders as an equal rather than a captive. As they sailed along the Frankish coast, they allowed an escaped prisoner named Solomon to take refuge. (Interesting side note: Bengtsson was a staunch anti-Nazi and would not allow translations that attempted to delete Solomon, an honorable Jew, from the book.) After Solomon guided them to the castle of the Castilian Margrave who had betrayed him, they sacked the place and made off with the spoils only to be captured and enslaved by an Andalusian fleet. At this point I realize that any further attempt to summarize would be folly. For one thing, there’s simply too much. Believe me, there’s enough peril, action and intrigue to wear out three if not more musketeers. The other reason is that you will read this book and will find out what happens on your own. You’ll enjoy learning more about the actual history, the customs, and the character of the people involved with each new adventure. It’s also satisfying to track Orm’s growth as a man, a leader and what must have passed at that time for a mensch.Cultural TidbitsSo much of what I liked about this book comes down to the thousand-year-old perspective that Bengtsson effected for viewing their lives. Imagine a spectrum with the current day at one end and a time when we weren’t much more than Jane Goodall subjects at the other. While I’m not sure exactly where this cast of North men would fit in a cultural interpolation, it’s probably a little to the earlier side of The Princess Bride. I suspect the meek, back then, inherited very little of the earth. These were men of large appetites and a single-mindedness of purpose. Nuanced they were not. At a Yule feast Orm attended, hosted by wise King Harald Bluetooth, all weapons were to be checked at the door and “no women were allowed to be present at so tremendous a drinking-bout, for it was difficult enough, King Harald thought, to keep the peace when men were by themselves, and it would be many times harder if they had women to brag to in their cups.” Demand for good medical care seemed to outstrip the supply. When leeches were deemed ineffective, potions made from the juice of sloe, boar’s gall, saltpeter and a pinch of horseradish were the next best thing. Orm was pretty certain he would die at one point when the leeches would not suck his blood. It was a sure sign of poisoning, so he thought.With all the pillaging, drinking, carousing and the like, it’s hard not to view these Norsemen as a very ungentlemanly lot, especially by our standards a full millennium hence. There were codes of honor at times, but they were akin to Chicago’s (you know, the one that says once you’re bought, you stay bought). Brother Willibald, when asked to introduce the Christian God to these men, probably got it about right:His voice became frenzied, and he glared wrathfully from one to the other, brandishing his arms and crying: Blood-wolves, murderers and malefactors, adulterated vermin, Gadarene swine, weeds of Satan and minions of Beelzebub, generation of vipers and basilisks, shall you be cleansed by holy baptism and stand as white as snow in the regiments of the blessed angels? Nay, I tell you, it shall not be so. […] How should men of the north be allowed to enter the gates of heaven? You would scrabble at the blessed virgins with your lewd fingers, you would raise your war-whoops against the seraphim and archangels, you would bawl for ale before the throne of God Himself! No, no, I know what I speak of. Hell alone will serve for such as you, whether you be baptized or no.Christianity at a CrossroadsScandinavia at that time was in transition. Many still preferred the pagan Gods, and in many ways this was more practical. For instance, turning the other cheek was often deadly. The most effective witnessing tended to emphasize the luck Christ could bring. Which is better, a prayer to the Christian God or the blood of a goat when launching ship? The empirical evidence was mixed. It was funny to hear a new convert talk to others trying to get them to join the fold. It reminded me of Book of Mormon where they didn’t get it quite right, but you could understand why. Religious conflict made for an interesting theme throughout the book.The Writing: A Bit of the New With the OldThe narrator was omniscient, or at least “scient” about “omni” as it was known at the time. The story was told episodically and in aggregate made for quite a saga in the Icelandic tradition. It even contained bits of poetry, and characters who could create rhymes on the spot were greatly esteemed. As for style, it was straight-ahead story-telling at its best. I often go for more literary fare, but was happy in this case that these Vikings had no interest in navels. The prose may have been unadorned, but that’s not to say that it was simple-minded. There was often a quick-wittedness and a sly humor that transcended the many centuries. For instance, I had to laugh when some of the graybeards were sitting around complaining about how soft this new generation of men had become compared to the men of yore. There was a certain cleverness in financial matters, too. In one tongue-in-cheek exchange, one of the men negotiating terms suggested that A should decide how much B should give him and B should decide how much A should give him. Or when one of the priests divvying up some windfall was trying to explain how difficult it was for a rich man to pass through the gates of Heaven, the men offered to help lessen the riches of others to help better those men’s chances. Some of you (are you still with me Susan?) will be happy to hear that the women, such as Orm’s wife Ylva, were among the cleverest. There were knowing little nods to sexuality, too, that a modern audience can appreciate. Closing the DealBe you man or woman, weenie or brute, I implore you to embark upon this journey, unlikely as it may seem to besot you. It’s an adventure book that will not insult your intelligence.

At the topmost level we soar, giddy with love, thrilled by the ride. At the unlucky other end, we may have lost a loved one, crashing hard in the fall, crippled by grief. Barnes probed these levels by structuring this short book into three parts: 1) “The Sin of Height” -- this is essentially an extended metaphor depicting freedom and flight by way of three celebrated balloonists in the late 19th century. One was an English officer and adventurer, Colonel Fred Burnaby; another was the most famous actress in her day, the exotic French bohemian, Sarah Bernhardt; and the third was a French inventor who was the first to combine ballooning and photography (another metaphor), a man they called Nadar. This section contains historical snippets, switching often among the subjects. In these we learn that Burnaby is bull-headed, Bernhardt is free-spirited, and Nadar is “very witty and very stupid.” Aside from the factoids about the people and their experiences, we get a sense of the excitement and unpredictability of ballooning and also how the sin of height may be punished. Remember that guy Icarus?2) “On the Level” -- the focus in this section was on Burnaby and Bernhardt who did meet in real life, but whose full story is left to Barnes to flesh out. Anyone who has read Arthur and George, the historical fiction Barnes wrote about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and a falsely accused solicitor named George Edalji, knows how effective this format can be, where actual events are filled in with plausible details and dialog to bring the story alive. The romance between these two larger-than-life figures was not fully requited in the end. Its main purpose, it would seem, was to transition us between the highs of Part 1 and the lows in Part 3. It also spoke in generalities and abstractions. “Why do we constantly aspire to love? Because love is the meeting point of truth and magic. Truth, as in photography; magic, as in ballooning.” The title of this section was repeated in the text. Was Sarah “on the level” with Fred as they came to their understanding? 3) “The Loss of Depth”-- this was the meat of the book; its real, albeit sad purpose. “It was 37 days from diagnosis to death,” Barnes wrote of his dear wife. As long as I’m quoting, he reminded us, too, that “every love story is a potential grief story.” A gifted writer like Barnes speaks of his emotional state with honesty and clarity without any of the overwrought melodrama could have resulted under the circumstances. Nor did he sugar-coat the ordeal. He was frank about how little happiness there is in just the memory of happiness. His pain was displayed at its worst when he discussed his carefully choreographed suicide plan. Fortunately, the time came when he knew he would not kill himself. He said “I realised that, insofar as she was alive at all, she was alive in my memory.” So memory matters after all. I hope, too, that even as he felt “sharply the loss of shared vocabulary, of tropes, teases, short cuts, injokes, sillinesses, faux rebukes, amatory footnotes – all those obscure references rich in memory but valueless if explained to an outsider,” that these things would remain rich. The goal of this three-part exercise was clear. Parts 1 and 2 were meant to set the stage and provide context for the memoir/essay in Part 3. The grief language was expanded by way of contrast with the earlier theme (or in concert with the theme when it happened to go wrong, e.g., hurtling a balloonist’s legs a foot deep into a flower bed and exploding his organs). The truth is this level breakdown felt a bit forced at times. I won’t criticize too harshly, though, since each section worked well enough individually even if the set of them didn’t cohere. This had to have been a difficult book for Barnes to write. I imagine a form of tunnel vision applies where you can only see things from your own painful point of view. The solipsistic undertones were no doubt born of honest emotion. Friends typically didn’t help much. He would complain about those who would mention her name too often and those who would avoid mentioning it at all. The words “passing away” and “losing her” irked him, too. And he really hated (as would I) those who would cite as Gospel truth that whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. All that is understandable. I suppose, too, that this was meant to be less of a tribute to his wife and more of an in-depth exposition on grief. (See Calvin Trillin’s About Alice for one that is a touching memorial to the love of a man's life.) Barnes asserted that grief is a state whereas mourning is a process. His book was primarily about the state, but near the end he did mention in more hopeful terms that he’s getting better. One thing that helped was when a widow he knew told him “it hurts as much as it’s worth.” He finally learned to accept his pain in those terms. And, of course, time helps. As does a realization that he’s not alone in missing her; others do too. I also thought that having used “uxorious” half a dozen times (which must be a record) that he wore the word like a badge. If this book was part of the process for moving on, I’m glad for his sake he wrote it....more",Notes are private!,0,113,1,not set,not set,"Jul 21, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262198-levels-of-life

Two friends read An Evening of Long Goodbyes and gave it, on average, 2.5. This says two things: 1) I have clever, discerning friends, and 2) Paul Murray got better -- appreciably so, in fact. There may have been hints of the greatness to come in Skippy, but this, his first attempt, was honestly pretty uneven. Charles and his sister Bel are twenty-somethings living in the well-to-do part of Dublin. She is an aspiring actress and he is a man of leisure with an undue sense of entitlement. And wouldn’t you know, conflict somehow ensues. It was not a sustainable lifestyle: Charles had put a big dent in the previously impressive wine cellar, finances don’t just take care of themselves, and the grand old manor was becoming perceptibly less grand. Their father had passed away a few years before and their mother had been away for health reasons. They had a Bosnian refugee who did housekeeping, but her foothold in the real world was not enough to do them much good. Charles, the oblivious cad, was laughably bad. He might have been funnier still had there been any aspect of subtlety in the humor. Of course there’s a great tradition of “toff as twit” in Isles writing (think Bertie Wooster or certain Monty Python sketches), and I appreciated the attempt to accrue more, but can’t say that it was a complete success. I think the problem stemmed from inconsistency in the cluelessness. Charles narrated, which was for the most part a job well done, rife with affectation and flair. He even succeeded in telling jokes on himself (mistaken interpretations of responses to his buffoonery) without knowing they were jokes. My problem was in how he could display compelling insights into personalities at one moment and then be so callow and imperceptive the next.What I will give credit for is the narrative voice, at least when it was at its pompous and descriptive best. Here are two examples:[...] I was subjected to what he referred to, seemingly without irony, as his 'music'. Sometimes it sounded like a huge metal something -- a tank, maybe, or an enormous set of cutlery -- falling down an infinite staircase; sometimes it sounded like a hundred thousand Nazis, goosestepping through the Place de la Republique; the general idea seemed to be to capture the sound of civilization collapsing [...][...] her expression with every passing second becoming more remote, like a Cinderella who has outstayed her time to see not only her carriage change back to a pumpkin, but Prince Charming's suitcase fall open and a whole horde of glass slippers fall across the floor [...]There was an element of French farce to this -- and believe me, I counted off for it -- but it also had a few weightier themes that, in part, helped to compensate. One message, if you’ll excuse my reductive shorthand, is that a friend in need is a friend indeed. This wasn’t always so obvious to Charles, unless he was the friend in need. Another prime character, Frank, who was a big lunk of a guy, rough around the edges, and Bel’s boyfriend for a time, was Charles’s polar opposite. That may not have made Frank persona grata at the country club, but it did give him street smarts, empathy for the luckless and a certain personal dynamism. Seeing the contrasts between the two was one of the better parts of the book. Redemptions were wobbly, though, and the book generally hinged on what humor there was to be had.On its own merits, this gets maybe 3 stars. If we allow the lexically impossible and compare it to the incomparable (that is, Skippy Dies), it’s more like 2 stars.

When it comes to WW1, the permamuck of the trenches, the seared throats from deadly gases, and the pants-soiling horror of seeing a comrade’s detached body parts inches away are associations powerful enough to shut us down. There’s only so far we can extend our comprehension in the face of palpable terror. So how does a good author milk it a little more, getting us past the autonomic desensitization and back into the boots of shared experience? In Sebastian Barry’s case he creates a character so earnest and eager to please that he seems custom-built as an empathy magnet. The fully realized inner life of Willie Dunne (the 18-year-old central figure, a Dubliner gone off to fight England’s war) combined with a fascinating account of the politics of Irish Home Rule made for quite a story. It was beautifully written, too. Barry deserved his acclaim, short-listed for a Booker.Willie loved and respected his father, a policeman and loyal supporter of the crown. At 5’6” tall, Willie was not allowed to join his 6’6” da in the police force (Sir Francis Galton’s regression-to-the-mean effect overshot in this case). Aching for respect, Willie signed up to fight the Germans in the name of the King. The word was that Irish Home Rule would be granted after these volunteers fought in common cause alongside the English. Willie also had to leave his girlfriend behind along with his youthful innocence. It didn’t take long after the grand send-off to realize what we all already knew: war sucks. Barry’s descriptions were realistic and mortifying. We’re made to care about the men even more for getting to know them as people – real, sentient beings with personalities and aspirations. A scene that really got to me was one where some middle-ranking, tough-as-nails guy named Christy, seemingly against type, had a soft spot for music. He was temporarily at peace with the world when Willie sang Ave Maria.Willie was given furlough for the Easter holiday. It was a short, happy stay, but there was a massive confusion just as he was reporting back – gunshots, and not ones coming from Germans. It was the Easter Rising of 1916 where Irishmen who wanted Home Rule faster and more assuredly than England would likely deliver rose up against them. Willie and his fellow soldiers were asked to quell the uprising. Our politically naïve protagonist had his eyes opened. The remainder of the book had new conflicts to add to a mix that already seemed saturated with them. Willie’s ambivalence about the English cause didn’t set well with his father. Sentiment in Ireland had swung against the Dublin Fusiliers that Willie felt duty-bound to stick with to the end. Nor did the English command give them much respect. (I wanted to tell a certain Major Stokes to stick it in his hole when he said, “What, you Irish couldn’t stand a little gas?”) And as if that wasn’t enough, our young hero had girl troubles, too. The worst part of it all was how little of it Willie deserved. He was such a good kid.Stories like this need to end the way authors want them to – with readers reading their books to find out, not with overzealous ers spilling the beans. The only thing I’ll add is that an emotional involvement on the reader’s part is likely.On a personal note, my wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary with a trip to Ireland. The love of literature there, and of words in general (even away from the pubs) was one of the great things about the place. They enjoy their history, too, with plenty of it around to engage them. We learned a lot about the Easter Rising visiting the General Post Office where much of the rebellion took place. Later we saw Kilmainham Gaol where many of the rebel leaders were imprisoned and in some cases executed.[image]The gaol has been featured in several films including The Italian Job (the original one), Michael Collins, and In the Name of the Father. U2 also filmed a video there, with Bono looking very much like a man of the 80s.4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,not set,not set,"Jun 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/379087.A_Long_Long_Way

How else will anyone hear of it?OK, so P&P may not need my help. The word is likely already out. What that means is that I can scurry around the periphery of the story itself, make a few small points, and move on with near certitude that Miss Austen will have an audience regardless.It had been quite a while since I’d read anything written so long ago. Of course, the language was very different, and for me that was part of the appeal. The musicality of it must owe to the baroque style of the time as well as to the skills of the writer. Her words were precise and descriptors well-chosen. This passage about the piano-playing abilities of the lightly regarded middle sister is but one of many examples:""Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.""This example is also one of many instances where an air or manner was defined, or a countenance, bearing or nature. Much was read into facial expressions, too. Remember, this came from a time before “show, don’t tell.”As an older vintage depiction, there were also big differences in the social norms of the day -- the mores and the protocols. It’s a cliché to point out that Austen’s books are about manners, but it’s true nonetheless. Courtships, for instance, had rigid rules that are almost laughable to our modern ways of thinking. And the language was so stylized and indirect. Subtitles would make for a good skit, like in Annie Hall where Alvy is talking to Annie early on about some abstract artsy thing while his real train of thought was, shall we say, less chaste. Monetary details, class, and family reputation were important determinants in the matches of the day, too. Books like this give us great historical insight into the social contracts and conventions.There’s no need for me to repeat in any detail what most people already know or could discover somewhere else better than this. Elizabeth Bennet is great. Mr. Darcy emerges. Jane and Bingley are charming, though nearly victims of a misunderstanding. Mr. Collins is an obsequious toad. Mr. Bennet is a bit too laissez-faire with a daughter or two who needed tighter reins. Mrs. Bennet is a woman “of weak understanding and illiberal mind.” (I should have been using Miss Austen’s wording throughout. It’s not like I could improve upon it.) Lydia is heedless and Wickham is evil. Of these latter two it was said, “how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue.” The whole story is essentially how these characters play off of one another and sort out their relationships and their lives. Yes, and it’s told really well. It’s more than just the costume drama enthusiasts with their immoderate taste for romanticism that sustain this as a classic.I’ll close this hodgepodge hash of a  by introducing a fun new parlor game involving a mishmash of P&P characters. Pish posh you say? Well hear me out. First of all, if you haven’t already done so, read the book and learn the traits and idiosyncrasies of the characters. They range widely over multiple dimensions. Then take turns mapping these characters to the other players in the game. Composites are encouraged. For instance, my lovely bride of 30 years is 0.872 Elizabeth for her perception, quick wit, and probity; 0.127 Jane for her beauty and good nature; and 0.001 Mrs. Bennet for having watched on more than one occasion that show where bridezillas rate other bridezillas’ weddings, critically and cattily. Then look to see which participants turn red with embarrassment, or even redder with anger. ...more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,not set,not set,"Jun 20, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice

They can detect much fainter scents from much farther away. What’s more, when a stew is cooking and all we smell is stew, they can pick out each ingredient –- the potatoes, carrots, beef and even the bay leaf and parsley flakes. Close readers who are analogous to these super sniffers are the ones who will enjoy this book the most, I suspect. No worries for the rest of us, though. I’m proof that this can still be a good experience even if the only thing you can distinguish is stew.As must be true of most Nabokov works, this book features multiple layers of intellectual fascination. There are those I recognized, those I read about after the fact, and even a few “plums” that Nabokov said were yet to be plucked years after publication. The base level is the story itself. It’s structured, cleverly enough, as a 999-line poem by a character named John Shade along with a metafictive analysis around it comprising a forward and an extended commentary by Shade’s university colleague and neighbor, Charles Kinbote. The poem is actually pretty good, though parts seemed slightly satirical. It details events in the poet’s life including encounters with death, idylls of the day-to-day and insight into the creative process. The rhymes were clever, too. However, the poem was just the starting point. The crux of the story was Kinbote’s reaction to it. We quickly realize a second level to the book –- that this fellow academic and wordsmith is off his rocker. He had long, discursive comments where he began inserting himself into the poem in ways we as readers know couldn’t be true. Kinbote’s style was literate and at times pompous – almost a caricature of a bloviating professor. To be honest, I liked it. I kept imagining Frasier Crane in the role. Nabokov was no doubt poking fun at academics, especially those who write literary criticisms. Kinbote’s analysis was often marked by a strained (and comical) attempt to tie his own narrative to the poem. It featured a country in the far north of Europe called Zembla ruled by a certain King Charles. Is it a coincidence that this is Kinbote’s given name? I think not. Nor will you. We also learn of an assassin who was part of a Soviet-backed revolutionary group. Though slow-witted, he tracks King Charles down to the college town in Appalachia where they live and (technically this is a spoiler, though I think most would agree that the plot points were of secondary importance and therefore spoilable) (view spoiler)[mistakenly murders Shade. This is notable in that Nabokov’s own father was killed by mistake by an assassin in 1922. (hide spoiler)]. The next layer was one I had only partial success interpreting myself. It involves the fiction within the fiction and Kinbote’s true identity. Some of the hints are obscure, but I’ll mention that the Index at the end of the book can be a help. A scarcely mentioned Russian scholar by the name of Botkine was noted as an anagram of Kinbote. Some critics have speculated that Kinbote was an invention of Shade. Others (though fewer) think it may have been the other way around. Anyway, if you’re the kind of reader who likes to try smelling what kind of onion was put in the stew, this layer will add to your pleasure.My own enjoyment came from imagining the fun Nabokov had writing it. He could lampoon the field of literary criticism, comment on how easy it is to insert personal experiences and perspectives into an analysis (how could it be otherwise?), and demonstrate his talent as a polyglot (he grew up speaking Russian, English and French at home; studied Slavic and Romance languages at Cambridge; and must have enjoyed constructing a vaguely Germanic sounding Zemblan tongue in Kinbote’s commentary). I couldn’t help thinking of this book as a subtle but indecorous display of whimsy. It’s dressed up in formal attire, but with a T-shirt underneath that says “I’m with Stupid →”.I took a few points off for being a tad slow, and a few more for trying too hard to be cleverer than I could perceive, but the levels of wonder left over still merit four shiny stars.

(It might be tempting someday to write a book about such books about books about books, but let’s not get silly, or meta-silly for that matter.) Anyway, Fadiman’s essays are as elegant and well-written as my introduction is awkward and inane. She’s the kind of bookworm friend we’d all ‘like’ to the stratosphere here on this site.Fadiman is the daughter of renowned literary critic, Clifton Fadiman, and former author and WWII correspondent for Time Magazine, Annalee Jacoby Fadiman. She had a very bibliocentric upbringing, as you might imagine. As a kid she was allowed to build a playhouse out of her dad’s 22-volume set of Trollope books. You might say she was to the omnibus manor born. She grew to love sesquipedalians (a great self-descriptive word meaning ‘long words’) like everyone else in her family, and shared an obsession for editing grammatical flubs with her “captious, carping, pettifogging” relations. Her essays cover a variety of topics that are bound to interest booklovers. She begins with a personal story of how she and her husband, after five years of marriage and a child, “were ready for the more profound intimacy of library consolidation.” The challenge was how to decide between her “French-garden” approach (ordered and well-tended) and his “English-garden” style (abundant but more haphazard). In other essays we learn her thoughts on: * Classifications of book people into those who keep their volumes as pristine as possible out of respect (“courtly lovers”) and those who might dog-ear pages and delight in marginalia (“carnal lovers”)* The joys of reading out loud* The art of the inscription (with great examples among literary giants)* The pleasure of buying 19 pounds worth of used books (as opposed to fungible new copies from big box stores)* How, to the reading obsessed, even a roommate’s 1974 Toyota Corolla Owner’s Manual will doThis is a small appetizer of a book, but one full of literary flavor. While it’s not what I’d call LOL funny, it is amusing in a clever and scholarly way. Fadiman writes very well, too –- never a word wrong, never a cacophonous beat. I’m tempted to buy a bookplate that says “Ex Libris Steve” to print inside its cover. Oh wait, an ex libris of ex libris books is too much like the twaddle in my intro.

But the truth is a tricky business. This epic story set in the DemocrLiterature is a fiction that tells a greater truth – so somebody wise once said. But the truth is a tricky business. This epic story set in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (that’s the bad one) offers frequent reminders of that fact. First, there’s the question of where the genuinely dire straits of North Koreans end and the semi-satirical abstractions begin. Did Johnson exaggerate the atrocities? Did his fiction indeed tell a greater truth? Then there’s a related question about Jun Do, the book’s central figure. At some point he becomes the subject of the ultimate in unreliable narrators: the DPRK propaganda machine. Fortunately for the reader, the parts handled by the omniscient narrator dominated, and they made for quite a story!In various post-publication interviews Johnson said he conducted extensive research for the book (it took him 7 years) including talks with refugees and a visit to Pyongyang. He mentioned that, if anything, he had to tone down some of the brutality that he’d heard about from former prisoners. Jun Do, as the North Korean everyman, was unrealistically amalgamated, but this was an effective device. Making him a composite with a wide variety of experiences was a convenient way to drive the plot. The action begins at an orphanage where his father was the orphan master, but one who showed no favoritism to his son. Jun Do’s first official duty was as a soldier specializing in tunnel combat (taekwondo in the dark), then he was recruited to help kidnap Japanese civilians. After language school to learn English, he worked as a spy doing radio surveillance on a fishing boat. He gained national “hero” status sacrificing himself for the sake of a lie that kept the fishermen out of prison. This renown got him placed as one of the delegates for a state visit to Texas where cultures inevitably clashed, often humorously. (For instance, dogs in this strange land were somehow deemed to be venerable creatures.) Then, as the dark side of governmental caprice would have it, he ended up in prison doing hard labor. This was no picnic, unless you consider the protein-rich moths the cagiest survivors gathered when the lights went out to be nice alfresco fare. I don’t feel like I’m giving anything away outlining Jun Do’s experiences above. They were the basis for the first half of the book where he proxied for a molded North Korean identity. The second half of the book was structured quite differently. Jun Do assumed another role altogether as he replaced a high-ranking army official. To avoid spoilers, I’ll be vague. I will, however, mention that his assumed role included the name, the station, and the wife of the ex-commander, but not his demeanor. The second half also introduced two new narrators. One was an interrogator who was attempting to piece together the commander’s story. The other was the aforementioned propaganda machine, broadcasting throughout the land over loudspeakers. Officials told a very different story, as you might imagine. In their version of things -- a step well beyond the truthiness of Stephen Colbert -- Americans used their lights at night (which were virtuously precluded for the North Korean citizenry) to practice indolence and homosexuality, Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il shot 11 holes in one in a single round (I remember when this story really was reported, which must have stretched credulity even there), and the spin put on our commander’s story would put any self-respecting gyroscope to shame.The book has been described variously as a thriller, a love story, a dystopian political satire and (by Johnson himself) a trauma narrative. It featured elements of each. Johnson not only conjoined these disparate styles, he told the bigger story with nuance and flair. Had he confused the old rule and made it “tell, don’t show,” his efforts would have fallen flat. Instead, the privation and torture are palpably clear, and the easy-to-draw inference resonates all the more. Johnson was clever in the way he humanized Jun Do at the same time that he obscured his identity. Making him a de facto orphan must have been a way to show the subjugation of family in favor of state. Even his name, which an American confused with John Doe, signifies the unidentified man. The reader knows different, though. We see the real man. We see how individual honesty can trump totalitarian lies for the sake of true love.I don’t view this as a perfect book. Certain aspects of the plot seemed implausible that didn’t need to be to tell the same story. Plus, even though I just praised Johnson for showing and not telling, there were times when I felt like Jun Do was a little too remote –- like a few more glimpses into his interior life would have helped me connect. Even so, this is damn near 5-star territory. Though the greater truths about North Korea –- its people and its rule –- may be approximate, they’re a whole lot more than I’d ever known before. ...more",Notes are private!,0,136,1,not set,not set,"May 03, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11529868-the-orphan-master-s-son

Here’s the list I came up with along with how Still Life did with respect to it.✓     Interesting characters✓     Plausible forensics✓     Sensible structure to the story✓     Skill in the uncovering of clues✓     Details of the setting for added flavorx     Success in avoiding an annoying, witless junior officer who thinks she knows way more than she really does and is terrible at reading peopleSo with the exception of the last criterion, this one does well. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache qualifies as interesting in that wise and avuncular way that inspires confidence. It’s set in Quebec in a French and English speaking town south of Montreal. The local flavor was delicieux. As far as the forensics are concerned, there were some bits involving bowhunting that were out of the ordinary. This was Penny’s first book, but she seemed very polished in the way she set the stage and kept us guessing. As you’ve no doubt already gathered from my list, I did have a problem with one of the characters on the investigative team. She seemed almost willfully obtuse. If the goal was to create conflict to foil the naturally unflappable Inspector Gamache, there had to have been more satisfying ways to do it than through her.

So herI figure my best hope of getting more readers than the Cubs have victories is to mention straight away Maria Semple’s bona fides as a satirist. So here it is: she wrote for Arrested Development. Her talent for skewering plays out well in book form, too, as it turns out. Bernadette, the protagonist, is creative, whip-smart, and now that her daughter, Bee, is past some pretty serious childhood health issues, able to devote herself almost entirely to snarky send-ups. The targets are primarily from Seattle where they live. Beyond the standard subjects of grunge, rain, coffee and Microsoft (where husband, Elgie, is an engineering superstar), there are also the cliquish and bothersome moms from Bee’s school. Complications arise, though, wouldn’t you know. Much of the book is back-story told in epistolary form. There are email exchanges between Bernadette and an online personal assistant, notes from Bee’s school, several catty moms opining about Bee’s parents, and various other documents of a plot-spoiling nature. From these we learn that Bee is the most outstanding student in her 8th grade class, Bernadette was an award-winning architect in earlier days, Elgie gave the 4th most popular TED talk ever, they’re planning a family trip to Antarctica to see penguins, and the gnats (as Bernadette refers to the busybody moms from the school) are out of control. The list of problems is a long one, too: Bernadette has lost her professional mojo, Elgie is married to his job, one of the gnats becomes Elgie’s admin, Bernadette has become over-reliant on her personal assistant, and another gnat has brought trumped up charges against Bernadette. Breaking points were reached. Near perfect storm status was achieved. Bee narrates the story of her mom’s disappearance and the subsequent search. But it’s a disservice to go much deeper into the plot. Instead, I’ll mention the pleasure of the overall tone. For one thing, the social satire was done well. The supporting characters were revealed cleverly, with more than just their stereotypes to define them. It was also nice that we weren’t just told that Bernadette, Elgie and Bee were smart, we got to see the evidence of it as well. Another point in the book’s favor is that it had more than just humor going for it. There were also deeper probes into relationships for us to consider. Special mother-daughter bonds were handled deftly.I have a friend or two out there (oddly enough, near broad-minded Boston (view spoiler)[Note that I did not say Milford since that would have been specific enough to identify exactly who I meant (hide spoiler)]) who might be tempted to judge a book by its cover, and in this particular case assume “chick lit.” While it does have a female perspective, I personally wouldn’t defile it with such a label.

I chose today since it was exactly 35 years ago that something very memorable happened to me – the sort of first occasion that sticks with a guy. If you don’t mind indulging me, I’ll set the stage. It was spring break during my semester abroad and a couple of buddies and I were in Paris. While my friends were taking an afternoon nap to get ready for another long night out, I had to break away to the local Laundromat to deal with pommes frites grease and a splotch of vin rouge. I was struggling to apply my less than sufficient French to a long set of directions when a nice English-ish-speaking lady helped explain that the coin slots were on the opposite wall. She had a strong accent that I couldn’t immediately place (though later learned was Scottish). I guessed she was around 60, but spirited, with a friendly face and lively eyes. As I waited for my load to finish, I started reading a copy of Ship of Fools that a girl on the train gave me in exchange for the Hemingway I’d finished earlier. When I looked up from the page, my kind helper was making eye contact. I gave her a little smile and she took that as a cue to join me. Her first comment was about how much she enjoyed Katharine Anne, like she knew her personally. She then proceeded to tell me all about the context for this book. Evidently the Ship of Fools allegory has been a fixture in Western art and literature for centuries. Crazy and oblivious passengers on a boat without a captain can represent any number of things. When I remarked on how impressive her knowledge of this was, she said it was her business to stay up on all things literary. At that point I knew there was no way this could be a two-sided exchange, but to my credit, I was genuinely curious. She introduced herself as Muriel Spark, author of numerous books. Since I couldn’t very well fake having heard of her, I asked which one was her best known. When she mentioned The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, I was happy that I at least knew of the movie they’d made of it. “Didn’t Maggie Smith win an Academy Award for that,” I asked? “Yes, dear lad, she did. Ha, I should have known that an American would connect to my work, if at all, by way of Hollywood.”I don’t think she meant this as a dig, so I didn’t take it that way. She chuckled with droll self-deprecation, saying that she was enjoying quite an extended prime herself. Then she went on to tell me some stories about Maggie Smith that she knew would entertain me. (Maybe I’ll save those for a  of Miss Brodie someday.) Anyway, at that point she realized that I might appreciate a chance to break in to what was turning out to be a monologue. ""Have you seen the Père Lachaise Cemetery yet? Jim Morrison’s grave is quite the popular site, you know.""When I said that it was on the list, she correctly figured me for a Doors fan. She tied this back to our previous conversation by mentioning that “Ship of Fools” was a song on the Morrison Hotel album. It was impressive that she knew so much about popular culture, which I figured was consistent with the fact that she was in Paris soaking up their version of it. Not wanting to be left behind entirely, I mentioned The Grateful Dead song of the same name. This, in turn, launched me into a story of the Dead concert I’d seen earlier that year. While it may be true that almost any story about seeing The Dead is at least slightly interesting, she was hanging on my every word. It was flattering in a not-quite-to-be-believed way. We continued in the same vein, both trying to impress the other by the overlap in our worlds until our laundry was done. She then asked in a slightly shy tone of voice if I’d like to join her for tea. Her hotel was nearby, and they served a version of it that was nearly up to her British standards, she said with a grin.Before we sat for tea, she joked that in the civilized world we’d have aperitifs beforehand. The specialty of the house was some brandy concoction that I have to admit was pretty good. Then at tea, I could see why we were meant to stimulate our appetites with aperitifs. What a spread! I thought it would essentially be, you know, tea, with maybe a wafer for dunking. But this was scones, petit fours, and all kinds of stuff I’d never seen before (or since for that matter). This was going to make quite a story when I got back with my buds: semi-famous British author invites me to a fancy feast all from a chance encounter at the Laundromat. Little did I know what I would later not be telling them.Anyway, the tea was superb and Muriel was great at carrying the conversation, drawing me out my shell on occasion, never once making me feel the fool. I was beginning to believe that my charm had somehow magically doubled. It might have helped, too, that over the previous year or so my pizza face was finally losing most of its pepperonis. Maybe I wasn’t so unpleasant to look at anymore. Then a minor faux pas – a crumbly bit of scone I had loaded with clotted cream fell off as I took a bite. Muriel did her best to set me at ease saying it was part of the tea tradition for a first-time participant to lose a bit of scone. She then helped point out spots where the cream had gotten on me. One I couldn’t see was on my collar. When she reached over with her wetted napkin to help me, it seemed like she might have taken greater care than necessary. Embarrassment for my accident gave way to embarrassment for what I began to feel – embarrassment mixed with excitement. With Muriel so close, and nowhere to look but in her sparkling eyes as she attended to me, turning my head with her soft, confident hands on my cheeks, presumably looking for more cream, it was almost impossible to fight an impulse. How much of this was she picking up on? How much of this was she perpetrating? If I was April and she was September, did it matter?Muriel passed away in 2006. I told myself that day, April 1, 1978, that I’d never cause her one moment’s anxiety over what transpired after that. Even now, after her death, and with virtually no chance that anyone she knew would see this, I’m reluctant to say much. What I will allow myself to divulge is something I’ll hide under a spoiler. It’s your choice whether to avoid or participate in my little confession. (view spoiler)[ I’m way too fond of April Fools’ Day stunts. That said, there was an element of truth in this story.

Here was the hook: Miss Lonelyhearts, an advice columnist in the early 30’s, is really a man. Sounds like a role for Jimmy Stewart at his gosh-darned chirpiest, doesn’t it? But the first few pages put a different image in mind – it was Pottersville without benefit of George Bailey. The letters in to Miss Lonelyhearts were just so bleak. Of course, it was a time when deprivations were de rigueur. Those lacking money, health, or wedded bliss had very little recourse. The joke, if there ever was one, was on him. (Note: he was only ever referred to as Miss Lonelyhearts, which makes me think we’re meant to know him as a 2-dimensional everyman.) His editor knew how hopeless these advice-seekers were, so it was a cruel act on his part to assign Miss L, a man with shaky mettle and faith as it was, to the task. Once I replaced my rose-colored glasses with a much darker shade, I got attuned to the mood West was going for and the dystopia he envisioned. There was certainly a noir feel to it all. The book was interesting to view as an 80 year old time capsule, too. Lots of the interactions between Miss L, his editor, and various women took place in speakeasies. Fat lips were a common occurrence, and distinctions between lovemaking and rape weren’t as clear as they should have been. It was also a time when the word “gay” was used often and differently.We’ve all seen s where the place is identified as a character. In this case, it seems more appropriate to say that the zeitgeist was. West, whose real name was Nathan Weinstein, was no doubt aware of the growing anti-Semitism. These were meaner times, in general, and it was easy to see how Miss Lonelyhearts, who had above-average levels of compassion and Christian good intent to begin with could become disaffected. Miss L went several rounds against the aforementioned zeitgeist, but you’ll just have to read the novella to find out how he fared.The Day of the Locust shares a sense of alienation. The central character was Tod (the German word for dead) and the story follows him to Hollywood where his artistic ambitions are brought down a few notches as a painter of movie sets. This one was set in the Depression era, too. He falls for an aspiring actress, Faye Greener, who tells him upfront they’ll only ever be just friends because he had no pull in the movie biz. They meet an unfortunate but financially secure schlub from Iowa who was told to go West for health reasons. The guy lets Faye stay at his place which made things complicated since one of his reasons for leaving Iowa was to suppress sexual impulses. (Did West get his directions mixed up?) Anyway, this guy’s name, Homer Simpson, sent me straight to Google. As it turns out, Matt Groenig has given two answers to the obvious question, one being that it was from this character, the other being that his dad was the source. These characters and a memorable set of others including Faye’s dad (a former vaudevillian), a hard-drinking, quick-tempered midget, a cowboy extra in movies and the cowboy’s Mexican friend (an expert in cock-fighting) existed at the margins of Hollywood. West got to know this world as a screenwriter so it seemed to ring true. It was truth at its darkest, though. Love was a sham, glamour-seekers were deluded, and the American dream failed both for its spirit and promise of riches. West died in a car accident along with his wife the year after this was published. He was 37 years old. There’s no way we can know if a country lifted from The Great Depression would have lifted him, too. He would have at least been gratified to learn that this poignant latter work made the Modern Library Top 100 list as well as the one Time Magazine compiled. ...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5585547-miss-lonelyhearts-the-day-of-the-locust

Much of the time spent trying to solve the stories’ puzzles involves bandying these concepts about. I can’t honestly say I understood them all, but moments when something did click were exciting because the ideas behind them were subtle and cryptic. Comprehension somehow boosts us to a higher plane. The ultimate in advancement, if it can be imagined, is the universal infinitude of all experience.*The more grounded me says, Steve, aren’t you kinda, like, talkin’ out your ass? And the more grounded me answers, yes. However, I contend that Borges himself, if asked, might have said the same thing (though surely more artfully). For him, I think, it was the mind-bending absurdity of the questions he posed rather than some metaphysical (and unattainable) truth of the matter that excited him. It’s hard to describe these stories to anyone who hasn’t read them, and harder still to back what I’m saying by way of example. Instead what I’ll attempt is a bit of Borges-inspired logic that may not have been the exact point of his stories, but occurred to me as a result of reading them.If we take as a given that time is infinite, then every possible set of realities would have a chance to play out. If in one iteration I typed an O here, I could in another type an X, with all else being the same. Every single permutation imaginable could occur as each Big Bang and collapse in infinite time came to fruition. Imagine the implications! Borges did, at least in a way. In one story he imagined a near infinite library containing books with every possible letter combination. In such a place, a man could conceivably find the story of his life, though practically speaking, and without Google, it would be damned difficult. Borges also considered a single book that could contain all knowledge, made possible by pages that were infinitesimally thin. (Zeno’s paradox, as Borges mentioned, can be explained in a similar way where infinitely many infinitely small increments can be summed to something we can observe in the physically limited world.) To Borges, a labyrinth is a similar metaphor of life. Each person has a complex set of turns in a ridiculously intricate path that I think represents every decision we face – right, left, X, O, date, dump – whatever. It’s this kind of thing that the man of many places (he lived in Argentina, Switzerland and Spain) and many languages (he translated Wilde, Shakespeare, Kafka, Poe, Hesse, Gide, Whitman and Woolf among others) would have resonate for its universality and unboundedness.While I have huge respect for the man, I also feel like I’m not his ideal audience. For instance, his philological references exposed me for the literary dilettante that I am. He could also come across as a bit too academic for my taste, and at times even tedious. I will not challenge its status as a classic, though. In fact, I truly enjoyed the quasi-logical extremes he went to in pursuit of intellectual entertainment, imaginative possibilities and hard won ah-ha moments.*I liken this to the “total consciousness” that the Dalai Lama promised groundskeeper Karl Spackler in Caddyshack....more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,not set,not set,"Mar 22, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/426504.Ficciones

Well George Saunders You know those disconcerting dreams where nothing you can do will seem right; lose-lose propositions are the only ones on offer? Well George Saunders is the large deluxe pizza you ate before bed. He's the likely culprit. I started with a comment about Saunders himself because his stories, and collections in general, are hard to . Plot summaries don’t really work because there are too many of them. Unifying themes aren’t always easy to come by either. Even if there are common threads, they’re often obscured, as though anything obvious would go against the short fiction writers' creed. Which brings me to another point. Might it often be more accurate to call a “short” story a “truncated” story instead? They’re not so much whole stories that happen to be short as much as ones that might have been whole but were lopped off – skipping background, transitions, and even endings. But that can make them fun puzzles to solve. Any discomfort we get from our fragmented look can be included in that all-important category of conflict. But none of this helps the er.Yet, hard as it may be to frame, this book is crying out for a discussion. I think it’s fair to say that Saunders is the flavor of the month. When the NY Times Magazine features an article called “George Saunders Has Written the Best Book You’ll Read This Year,” we can assume there’s a buzz about him in Lit World. Those familiar with his past work applaud this one for its greater realism. It still has absurd elements, but each story is allowed to find its most natural, relatable way to be told. Wasn’t there some famous sculptor who said he never knew what object would come from a big chunk of marble until he started chipping away to find out? The more mature Saunders evidently has less use for surrealism and I suspect his empathy is more apparent when his people seem more real. Having read only a few of his stories before this, I can only speculate.His style may have evolved, but his targets have not. He’s still the class warrior he always was. That said, I never found his characters to be pat. For instance, I don’t think he equated being poor with being noble or right, rather, just people to be pitied. To Saunders, capitalism is hard, with a whole range of possibilities within the construct. In an interview, he was thinking back on his own leaner times and said, “the cumulative effect of an absence of wealth was the erosion of grace.” As a younger man he was an Ayn Rand acolyte. When he fell away, he fell hard and it politicized him. It makes the piece he wrote for the New Yorker, posing as Rand’s former young lover, all the more prickly as a satire. His liberal sentiments are well-established, but he can surprise us with human tendencies at odds with them. For instance, one story called “Semplica Girls” came to him in a dream. He said in the linked interview, “I went to a window that didn’t exist in our house, and I looked into the yard, and I saw a row of what I understood in the dream logic to be third-world women who had a wire through their heads,” he said. “Instead of horror, my reaction was like, ‘Yeah, we did it.’ Just like if you’d gotten a new car or a kid into school or something, that feeling of, I’ve come such a long way, I’m able to give these things to my family. And there was a sense that there was an alleviated shame.” If I were to point to a common element in these stories, I’d say that they’re good at maximizing our discomfort. They do their damnedest to pose moral dilemmas. We’re led to a point where we want to judge, but can’t quite do it. There but for the grace of good fortune goes the reader – a statement that speaks to the compassion that Saunders elicits. My favorite story, the title piece that was put at the end, was somewhat of a contrast to the moral quandaries that preceded it. An unpopular schoolboy was walking home lost in a reverie, casting himself as a hero to impress a girl, when he encountered a coatless man in the snow who was hoping to front-run a death decreed by cancer. Preferred courses of action were clear, and they were ennobling. It was a nice note to end on. Humanity scored a clear winner for once.I’ll close with a reference to a conversation Saunders had at one time with DFW, J. Franzen and B. Marcus on the topic of the ultimate aspirations of fiction. (How many of us would gladly have been maggots on the molding of that room?) “The thing on the table was emotional fiction. How do we make it? How do we get there? Is there something yet to be discovered? These were about the possibly contrasting desire to: (1) write stories that had some sort of moral heft and/or were not just technical exercises or cerebral games; while (2) not being cheesy or sentimental or reactionary.”I’m not sure this collection met the goal completely, but I could tell that it tried.

Flashbacks tell us about their war experiences. We learn more about their victory lap, too, as they were trotted out to various media events including one at the White House. The most significant stop for Billy, though, was to an empty part of Texas. There at home he saw his doting sisters, long-suffering mom, and now disabled, still ornery father. He discovered the medical bills had outpaced his heroism. At surface level, though, the whole tour was a chorus of “We Support Our Troops” and “Thank you for your service.” It was nice to feel appreciated, but it may have rung hollow after awhile. And none of it paid the bills. Nor did it offer reprieves – they all had more war to go. To a man, though, they knew what they’d signed up to do.At the game, plot lines were shooting in all directions all at once. A movie dealmaker was constantly on his cell trying to get the Bravo story on the silver screen, and money in their pockets. Then there were the texts from one of Billy’s sisters trying to arrange for him to skip out of his return. And let’s not forget Billy’s newfound love, a Cowboys cheerleader with a connection to his hometown. The Cowboys organization was a story in itself from owner Norm (who was as thinly disguised a version of Jerry Jones as Frankenstein would be in a Frankenstein mask) to the players (a subset of whom offered gangsta-style assistance in Iraq for a few days). Most of the book worked well for me. On the minus side, though, I found writing at times to be a tad overdone. It can be a fine line. Exuberance is tricky. For me, an author with a good ear can even border on purple and still be OK, but other times it’s simply distracting. Here’s an example; judge for yourselves. “It’s just too much for his hangover, all the mounds, slabs, sheets, hummocks, and hillocks of edible matter resembling a complex system of defensive earthworks, and it’s that thing-ness, the sheer molecular density on display, that gives him the lurch.”Then a few pages later, I think Fountain gets it just about right. Describing the luxury box crowd: “The men have the hale good looks and silver hair of successful bank presidents or midsized-city mayors, tanned, fit sixty-year-olds who can still bring the heat on their tennis serves. Their wives are substantially but not offensively younger, all blondes, all displaying the taut architectonics of surgical self-improvement.”Other passages show Fountain’s powers of observation. To wit: “Norm is confident, absolutely, he is the king of self-esteem, but this is the confidence of self-help tapes and motivational mantras, confidence learned as one learns a foreign language, and so the accent lingers in his body language, a faint arthritic creak in every smile and gesture.”Back on the minus side were instances of implausibility. I’ll skip past examples from the plot since I’ve said too much about that already, but will ask if we should believe that a young man can drink beers and highballs (more than a dozen), split a big joint, and still answer interview questions as lucidly as you please? While I’m at it, do moms in Bugtussle, TX really talk like the coolest urbanites in the ice tray? To pile on with one more, there were cases where I felt his stereotypes were a bit too convenient (a notable exception being the born-again Christian with an impetuous moment of passion).Ah, but I’m being too picky. The bottom line is Billy is great. In a way, he’s an every-grunt, but one that grows very aware. He may not have been a scholar, but he’s smart, and seeking. We can empathize completely as he searches for role models who can give him some wisdom and truth. Shroom had been one, but as Army buddies often do, he met a bad end. I mentioned before that not everything in the story seemed realistic, but it was all very real to Billy. This more than compensates. His feelings in the face of his conflicts seemed genuine and the book succeeds on those grounds; at its best, spectacularly....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,not set,not set,"Mar 01, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13325079-billy-lynn-s-long-halftime-walk

I cIn 2006, Janet Maslin of the NY Times said, “Jess Walter is a ridiculously talented writer.” That’s been a blurb on every book he’s written since. I can see why, especially since I happen to agree. This, his most recent novel, showcases these talents well. The writing is effortless, the plot is engaging, the characters are memorable, and it’s full of fun and insight. The social commentary is awfully good, too, meaning I approve of the targets he pokes at. The story begins in the early 1960’s in a remote fishing village just beyond Italy’s fashionable Cinque Terre. Young Pasquale, fresh out of college, has come back home to run his family’s small hotel. A beautiful American actress named Dee arrives (mistakenly?) as a guest. She was originally in Rome for the filming of Cleopatra. Though Pasquale’s English is not great, and he’s also a bit shy, his earnest good intent makes an impression. But she’s sick (dying?). We then cut to contemporary America – Hollywood – the epicenter of both glitz and schlock. Claire is a film-loving assistant at Michael Deane’s studio. Deane, a cheeser of some repute, began his career as a production assistant for Cleopatra, later became a big-time producer, then fell off the pace awhile before getting his groove back via reality TV. (Walter’s skewering of this broadcast idiocy is something all but the lowest of brows can appreciate.) Anyway, Claire is about to give up when two visitors show up. One is a young writer hoping to pitch his sensationally bleak movie idea and the other is an older Italian gentleman there to see Michael. So that’s how it sets up. We then get the back story that brings us up to the present. And what a story it is. One of the characters is an American writer (a car salesman, really) who visits Pasquale’s hotel annually with the intention of writing a book, but in practice to drink wine. He did manage a chapter, though, and the truth is it’s very good. We also witness some touching scenes where Pasquale and Dee connect, if only briefly, at soul level. Then there was the whole Cleopatra circus. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (or Lizard as I like to think of them in this era of Brangelina) took some managing, and Deane was the man tasked with the job. The Welshman was a handful with his unslakable thirsts. His cameo role was one of the highlights of the book. Fast-forwarding a few decades we meet Pat who is all about wine, women and song. At least the song part had at one time provided an income. He’s in rather dire straits when we meet him, though. Naturally, his story connects with the others. Back in Hollywood, agendas are identified and actions are taken. Now, in the time-honored tradition of keeping important plot points to one’s self, I hereby button my lip.I’ve been a Jess Walter fan for several years now. He’s one of those writers who’s found the sweet spot between flourishes and flow. He never appears to be trying too hard while giving us bright, shiny nuggets in an entertaining way. Richard Russo identified this talent early in Walter’s career, which is meaningful since Russo is another writer I’d put in that category. My expectations for a Walter book are high. In fact, I may have rounded down from 4.5 stars to 4 because I know his capabilities. The shortcoming in this work, I felt, was in his character development. He tended to trade depth for breadth. With as many as 8 POV characters, it would have been nice digging deeper into a select few. But hey, let’s end this on a positive note. This is a very readable book — by a ridiculously talented writer....more",Notes are private!,0,81,1,not set,not set,"Feb 21, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11447921-beautiful-ruins

With something like Bulgakov or a Booker Prize finalist from 1998, I know not to expect it, but I really thought this might be the time. Turns out, I’d have qualified had I been reading E.L. James, but finding the coincidence was never going to be that important. My point is, this is a very popular book, especially here in Flynn’s sweet home, Chicago. There’s a reason it’s selling so well. It’s very good. . . and good in that smart, involving way that can elevate a mystery thriller beyond its genre label.In any given year, arbiters of such things pronounce that russet, or cerulean, or some such is the new black. In this context we can say that neo noir is the new black, both stylistically and tautologically. The neo part comes from new technologies (Philip Marlowe never had to worry about the traceability of cell phones or password protection on laptops), modern dialog (with updated epithets included), and media involvement (the tendency to sensationalize has been with us a while, but it’s stained even more by a reality TV vibe).The trick in talking about the plot is spoiler management. There are twists, as you’ve no doubt heard. And the more I say about who, what, when, and where, the more those of you who haven’t read the book will read it with different eyes. I think I’m safe in saying that Nick and Amy start out as the perfect couple. The book is cleverly structured where the two take turns with first person accounts of their lives together. Then, on their fifth wedding anniversary, she goes missing. And guess what – he’s a suspect. Something else occurs to me that makes this neo noir. There’s a kind of meta quality to the old cliché that the husband is always the prime suspect. Multiple people refer to it in the book including Nick himself. Credit to Flynn here because we all read this book looking for twists including one that might have Nick innocent. Or one that goes 180 degrees further still. Flynn never tips her hand.There’s a real mutability to this book. Our views of relationships change and change again. There’s foreshadowing, but there are also developments we’re not meant to see coming. If this sounds to you like a page-turner, you’d be right. Each section makes you want to know what happens next. Then you switch narrators, but that’s good since, hearkening back to the section before, you’d been left wanting to know what comes next from that one, too. In some ways this was a police procedural. Coupled with that were some deep probes into the characters. Plenty of amateur psychology was applied, some of which was presented as artifice (which added to its appeal). Really, the only points I took off from an otherwise great story were for something that’s hard to describe, especially without spoilers. Let’s just say there was the occasional feeling of too-muchness to it all.

To prove this point, I read a book set in Europe. . . France, no less. And it didn’t even have one of those page-turning plots to drive it.What it did have was a plenitude of French themes. Food, especially the fine dining variety, was foremost among them. Art was another. Cultural divides of the type pitting aristocrats against republicans also featured. Romance was another theme, but not in an entirely typical way. We all know about love triangles. Well, this was more of an appreciation tetrahedron, where the sides denoting closeness among the four main characters would vary in length at any given time. It seemed like the point of the book and the pleasure to be derived from it was in watching the tetrahedron change shape.The points defining this geometric object were Camille (a cleaning lady or really more of a starving artist – starving from anorexia, that is), Philibert (gentle, awkward, and to the manor born), Franck (a talented chef but one with attitude – brusque, tired, and hurting), and Franck’s grandmother (less self-sufficient than she’d like to be, good-hearted but not always able to give more than she takes). I wish that the “land of the misfit toys” reference wasn’t so popular so that I could claim it as my own and apply it here. Anyway, these four interact in the ways real people do. It takes time and intermittent acts of kindness for the bonds to form, and it proceeds in fits and starts.This is a quick read with plenty of dialog and a respect for the show-don’t-tell approach to character development. It’s strong on lifestyle, too. The author even sprinkles in a bit of philosophy, though nothing heavy.

I can’t seem to scare up relevant examples, but I figure some of my friends more up on quaff-and-comment mode can help me with that. Imbibing ers are liable to say anything. It’s less formulaic. Plus, some previously guarded opinion may slip out. In vino veritas, right? The relevance of this to me is to ask a related question: Can it be said, in the same vein, “In Nyquil, naked truth?” Or if not naked truth, inanity? Or could it be neuroticism? The following is more or less verbatim from last night’s stream-of-semi-consciousness. It may not be the best idea to analgize and analyze or medicate and encapsulate, but sadly enough, it’s all I’ve got.[Me, in bed; tossing, turning, stealing covers, kicking covers off, with inner voice blathering.]“This is a dream, right? Well, yeah, but it seems real enough. Besides, if I was really deep in REM sleep, would I be capable of asking the question? Along similar lines, would I know to ask whether surreality is a word? What about metadream? Oh hell, let’s just go with it. I wonder who I’m meant to be in this quasimetasurreality? All I’m getting is darkness, a vague discomfort, and a closed-in feeling like I’m at the bottom of a well gone dry. Ahh, OK, now I get it. I’m a Murakami character. Does that mean Jay Rubin had a hand in making me? Jeez! [Flailing back and forth fitfully.] Oh well, it’s not like I have a choice at this point. They might as well shove me into the friggin’ labyrinth, or waterless well, or wherever it is these internal struggles are meant to play out. Do I at least have a proximate cause for my concerns? A missing cat? A missing wife? Whatever it is, I seem less panicked than I might. I guess I’m not much of a man of action. [A slight adjustment of the pillow does little to suggest otherwise.] I’m nondescript (that’s a shoe that fits), kind of an every man, and will need to go deep down within myself to figure out anything interesting. Now I get why I’m in a well. Even a double-shot of Nyquil wouldn’t obscure a symbol that obvious. So now that I’m the protagonist, Mr. Wind-Up Bird, I should be visited by those two psychic sisters. One was like a succubus, but this being a dream of a dream would, I imagine, make her pretty severely pixelated. And what about that wise-beyond-her-years, morbid-beyond-her-aspect teenage girl? She’s supposed to help clarify my odd behavior for me if I’m not mistaken. For that matter, the old soldier who told such a gruesome war story and seems to have so little to live for is also meant to sort me out. Then there are those mother and son mind healers who recognize my latent powers to do the same. Why not. . . it’s a dream, remember? Supernatural or not, it’s all good. And it’s all confusing. But let’s think. I’m down here in my well with plenty of time to mull things over. It’s catharsis time, right?

However, the long, half-awake dream did remind me of the feeling I got as the reader, and the connection I felt for the character.

He knows all about Victorian England – its people, its paradoxes – and what’s more, he knows what you don’t know but would find fascinating. Transitions back and forth between our modern perspectives and their older, more circumscribed ones are virtually seamless. He’s wise about people, too, their quirks and motivations, independent of setting. Oh, and the language. . . every word is perfect. You’ll hardly notice the passing hours. Right from the very beginning this omniscient fellow speaks directly to you, promises you intimate details (some of which are dark and surprising, even a bit graphic), and lures you straight into 1875. You’re in very deep soon enough, utterly beguiled. Character-driven, with the plot riding shotgunI think it’s a disservice to reveal much of the plot. The narrator/tour guide will get to what’s relevant when the time is right. I will summarize the inside flap, though, which I figure is fair game. William Rackham, the purposeless heir to a perfume manufacturer, meets Sugar, the clever and willing young prostitute who suddenly fills him with ambition. He takes over his father’s business, enjoys a quick reversal of fortune, and sees to Sugar’s ascent from the squalor so that he can have her all to himself. What follows is a whole lot of interplay between these characters and a well-drawn host of others. The primary ones are:The aforementioned William – self-centered but not entirely vile; a would-be essayist and wag; a man defined and even a bit constrained by his social standing and the times.The aforementioned Sugar – enterprising and smart; a devotee of [pun alert] Dale Carnalgie’s How to Win Johns and Manipulate People; riveting to see how her people smarts and hooker’s talent for prevarication play out in chess matches of actions and reactions.Agnes – William’s wife who is actually somewhat deranged (we as readers are clued in to the cause even though the characters are not); beautiful yet naïve; almost laughably shallow by modern standards as the product of a finishing school.Henry – William’s older brother who is in certain ways the better chap; would rather have been a man of the cloth than a man of commerce (as their father had originally hoped); earnest as the day is long but unable to suppress those pesky animal urges.Emmeline Fox – a somewhat iconoclastic widow who does social work to help prostitutes in need; the object of Henry’s affections; one with a better applied sense of religion; ill but unyielding.Sophie – William’s six-year-old daughter who begins as a near non-entity but turns into a character with surprising depth; much of her blossoming is due to a source I shan’t divulge. Interesting others, among them prostitutes whose hearts range from gold to substances not nearly so glittery, a leech-toting doctor who sees to poor Agnes, and a couple of William’s friends from school – abominable but pretty damned funny.Victorian London, seeds and allIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Sorry. . . that’s unoriginal. But Dickens comes to mind for a reason. There were still many hardships for the poor, class distinctions were endemic, and byzantine morals lay beneath thin but glossy surfaces. The narrator states, “no righteous man must dare to think of the flesh, and no righteous woman must be aware of having it. If an exuberant barbarian from a savage fringe of the Empire were to stray into St. James's Park and compliment one of these ladies on the delicious-looking contours of her flesh, her response would most likely be neither delight nor disdain, but instant loss of consciousness.” Yet prostitution and pornography were booming. Conflict is easy to come by in a setting like this. It need not be manufactured or contrived. Faber said, plausibly enough, that he did a huge amount of research into the times, but didn’t actually use much of it. He said he hates when authors try so desperately to show off their knowledge to justify their efforts in obtaining it. Faber’s goal instead was to paint a vivid picture without ever allowing the pace to bog down. He hoped there was none of that “Let’s pause here for some historical stuff.” And there wasn’t.Purple prose? Pshaw! While the Victorian setting makes a certain richness of prose seem natural, there was a conscious effort to mix in faster paced elements, too. This was done so well that the writing, while lush, never felt overly verbose or ponderous; this despite longer sentences and even occasional adverbs. (In an interview, Faber made fun of Stephen King’s book on writing that basically said a pox upon modifiers. My feeling is that King may be right for most writers, but exceptions must be made for those like Faber who are so good at choosing them; you know, advisedly, unerringly.) Analysis (sans spoilers) I mentioned already that the writing is both sumptuous and fast-paced, a mix of old and new. It seems the same can be said for its literary classification. Pomo, you might ask? Well, yes and no. The narrator at the very beginning makes no bones about the fact that you’re reading a novel. And he switches between multiple POV characters, occasionally speaking directly to us as modern-day readers. Some have even called this “tricksy”, though those same people also admit that in Faber’s capable hands, it works. For the most part, though, the book features older style narration. Faber’s answer to an interview question speaks clearly to the way he wants this to be perceived. “I'm not impressed when authors rub their readers' faces in the fact that a book is only an artificial construct, that characters are not real, that it's all an exercise in deception and intellectual conceit. There's nothing new or clever about this. Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy did it to perfection two hundred and fifty years ago.”For me the most interesting question is how a book so long never once bored me. It wasn’t just the setting or the writing, though both were appealing. I suspect it had more to do with how real the characters seemed. Faber said that in an earlier draft William was more villainous, but was rewritten to become more likeable and complex. This made his bad behavior all the more poignant since it came from someone I cared to learn about. Sugar was revealed in even greater detail as she vied for influence and a better life. We’re granted valuable access to her hopes, fears, sensibility, and schemes. When I sit for a tick to think about it, it’s the way the characters are revealed (through dialog, the story, the inner voices, and that amazing narrator’s talent for description) that makes this the best book I’ve read in quite a while. The sense of a non-endingThis book is not loved universally. By far the most common complaint is the lack resolution at the end. Maybe The Sopranos helped prepare me, but I kind of liked the open-endedness. Some have surmised that after 900 pages, Faber just ran out of steam. As meticulously drawn as the storyline was up to that point, though, I suspect Faber wanted us to speculate. It made the story even truer to life, where loose threads dangle all over the map. Faber evidently caved in to the pressure and later wrote a book of short stories called The Apple New Crimson Petal Stories that features the same characters. Whether it truly ties up loose ends, or is up to the standards of this one, I don’t know. But I plan to find out.Trust meRead this book! If not immediately, then soon.

It finally dawned on me that they must have meant manners in a broader sense – prevailing customs, ways of living – that sort of thing. ;-) If my new interpretation is indeed correct, I can state with confidence that this collection of twelve Anthony Powell classics is also all about manners. The setting is England between the wars where stylized manners abound. Plenty is happening, of course. Mutation both within and between classes is de rigueur. The narrator, Nick, is somewhat upper-crusty in a semi-Bohemian way. He’s not a bad sort, really; just a tad slower than we are to recognize romantic turns and new social orders. As a narrator he’s not so much unreliable as he is resistant to the tides of change. Nick has a good education as well as a novelist’s eye for detail. He’s great at observing quirks and he describes them well. We quickly get to know the three other central characters through Nick’s powers of observation. They all went to the same top school (Powell himself was an Eton chap) where the patterns were set early. Nick’s friend Stringham was the brash aristocrat, their friend Templer was the raffish womanizer, and their colleague off to the side, Widmerpool, was both oafish and ambitious – an awkward combination. A whole host of other characters played supporting roles. Each one was described with care and sometimes with a bit of fun. For instance, Nick said of his Uncle Giles: “He was also habitually unwilling to believe that altered circumstances might affect any matter upon which he had already made up his mind.” Someone else was said to have “transmitted one of those skull-like smiles of conventional friendliness to be generally associated with conviviality of a political sort.” In fact, much of the collection that I’ve read so far (the first 3 of 12 volumes comprising what they call the First Movement) seem like character profiles and dialog tied together not by plot but by dinner parties, art shows, and dances. The people come in all varieties: twits, ditzes, toffs and cads among them.The writing is lush; teeming with commas and semicolons. On average, there’s one more clause per sentence and two more words per clause. Once you tune your ear to it, though, it sounds pretty good. Strike that. With Powell’s command of the English language, “pretty good” doesn’t pass muster. It’s filled with little aphorisms, too. For example: “Being in love is a complicated matter; although anyone who is prepared to pretend that love is a simple, straightforward business is always in a strong position for making conquests.” In the main, the humor is like a fine claret – subtle, dry, and well-balanced. There’s a reason the Modern Library listed it as the 43rd best novel in English in the 20th century and Time Magazine included it in their top 100 English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. Since I’m only a quarter of the way through the series, I can’t comment yet on the full epic sweep. It extends into the 60’s. Evolution is inevitable, if not revolution. There’s a fabulous documentary film series that began in the early 60’s in England. It started with a cross-sectional profile of 7-year-old kids from all different backgrounds called 7 Up. Seven years later they returned to these same kids as 14-year-olds to see how they’d changed. Was their future foretold? How had they changed? They’ve repeated the process every 7 years since, so far up to 49. It was fascinating to see how their lives turned out – their professions, their relationships, their worldviews – sometimes as you’d expected, other times not. Anyway, Powell’s series has that same potential.

Interviews also show that he’s completely dedicated to his craft. Poet laureates are bound to be. Now that I’ve read two of his books (thereby allowing me to feign expertise), I’ll say that this recent one from 2008 has a slightly lonelier, edgier tone – maybe a Bronx cheer to his advancing years. The playfulness, the self-deprecation, and the unhurried contemplation are all still in evidence, though, as some of my favorites will show.Hippos on Holidayis not really the title of a movie but if it was I would be sure to see it. I love their short legs and big heads, the whole hippo look. Hundreds of them would frolic in the mud of a wide, slow-moving river, and I would eat my popcorn in the dark of a neighborhood theater. When they opened their enormous mouths lined with big stubby teeth I would drink my enormous Coke. I would be both in my seat and in the water playing with the hippos, which is the way it is with a truly great movie. Only a mean-spirited er would ask on holiday from what?Billy told George Plimpton in a Paris Review interview that his mom used to read him Black Beauty and The Yearling -- sentimental animal fiction. And his dad brought him all the Lassie books. It must have made an impression.A Dog on His MasterAs young as I look,I am growing older faster than he,seven to oneis the ratio they tend to say.Whatever the number,I will pass him one dayand take the leadthe way I do on our walks in the woods.And if this ever managesto cross his mind,it would be the sweetestshadow I have ever cast on snow or grass.And here he is with a bit of play:AdageWhen it’s late at night and branchesare banging against the windows,you might think that love is just a matterof leaping out of the frying pan of yourselfinto the fire of someone else,but it’s a little more complicated than that.It’s more like trading the two birdswho might be hiding in that bushfor the one you are not holding in your hand.A wise man once said that lovewas like forcing a horse to drinkbut then everyone stopped thinking of him as wise.Let us be clear about something.Love is not as simple as getting upon the wrong side of the bed wearing the emperor’s clothes.No, it’s more like the way the penfeels after it has defeated the sword.It’s a little like the penny saved or the nine dropped stitches.You look at me through the halo of the last candleand tell me love is an ill windthat has no turning, a road that blows no good,but I am here to remind you,as our shadows tremble on the walls,that love is the early bird who is better late than never.Not all the commentary on older age was negative. This one, I thought, was nuanced with a more accepting view.Old Man Eating Alone in a Chinese RestaurantI am glad I resisted the temptation, if it was a temptation when I was young,to write a poem about an old maneating alone at a corner table in a Chinese restaurant.I would have gotten it all wrongthinking: the poor bastard, not a friend in the worldand with only a book for a companion.He'll probably pay the bill out of a change purse.So glad I waited all these decadesto record how hot and sour the hot and soursoup is here at Chang's this afternoonand how cold the Chinese beer in a frosted glass.And my book –– José Saramago's Blindnessas it turns out –– is so absorbing that I look upfrom its escalating horrors onlywhen I am stunned by one of his gleaming sentences.And I should mention the lightthat falls through the big windows this time of the dayitalicizing everything it touches ––the plates and teapots, the immaculate tablecloths,as well as the soft brown hair of the waitressin the white blouse and short black skirt,the one who is smiling now as she bears a cup of riceand shredded beef with garlic to my favorite table in the corner.But sometimes the edginess was clear, and even literal.DivorceOnce, two spoons in bed,now tined forksacross a granite tableand the knives they have hired.One of his most common subjects was poetry itself. Billy at his meta-magnificent best:The EffortWould anyone care to join mein flicking a few pebbles in the directionof teachers who are fond of asking the question:""What is the poet trying to say?""as if Thomas Hardy and Emily Dickinsonhad struggled but ultimately failed in their efforts—inarticulate wretches that they were,biting their pens and staring out the window for a clue.Yes, it seems that Whitman, Amy Lowell and the rest could only try and failbut we in Mrs. Parker's third-period English classhere at Springfield High will succeedwith the help of these study questionsin saying what the poor poet could not,and we will get all this done beforethat orgy of egg salad and tuna fish known as lunch.Tonight, however, I am the one trying to say what it is this absence means,the two of us sleeping and waking under different roofs.The image of this vase of cut flowers,not from our garden, is no help.And the same goes for the single plate, the solitary lamp, and the weather that presses its face against these new windows--the drizzle and the morning frost.So I will leave it up to Mrs. Parker,who is tapping a piece of chalk against the blackboard,and her students—a few with their hands up,others slouching with their caps on backwards—to figure out what it is I am trying to sayabout this place where I find myselfand to do it before the noon bell ringsand that whirlwind of meatloaf is unleashed.Or this, the last one in the book:EnvoyGo, little book,out of this house and into the world,carriage made of paper rolling toward townbearing a single passengerbeyond the reach of this jitter pen,far from the desk and the nosy gooseneck lamp.It is time to decamp,put on a jacket and venture outside,time to be regarded by other eyes,bound to be held in foreign hands.So, off you go, infants of the brain,with a wave and some bits of fatherly advice:stay out a late as you like,don’t bother to call or writeand talk to as many strangers as you can.With certain ps my wife will lean over and whisper, “It's like we've seen the whole movie now.” We both hate when they do that.

The first I ever heard of this was when Amazon sent me one of those “since you liked x, we recommend y” mails. So right off the bat I was predisposed against it. Who wants some algorithm deciding things for them? [Insert wink that’s more than a little ironic given that I’m in the algo biz myself.] My second time hearing of it was when a nice older lady at a charity book sale was telling me how much she enjoyed it. While I don’t automatically dismiss what we might imagine is the Doily and Crumpet Club’s book of the month, I do resist seeing the correlation climb too high. Then came the turning point. My friend, the ever-popular Jason, gave it enthusiastic thumbs up here. He even likened it to Middlesex, one of my favorites. It was only a week later that I saw a copy at the annual book fair in Chicago. The vendor was a worse-for-the-wear guy from downstate with bad teeth and scraggly hair. He seemed to know a lot about every book he had including the Orhan Pamuk my wife picked up. Approval of my choice from the guy more dedicated to books than personal hygiene sealed the deal. And I’m glad.It’s a great story and an even greater education. The bulk of the action is set in a mission hospital in Ethiopia where we learn a lot about medicine (underfunded though it may be) as well as the culture and history of the Selassie-led nation. The book focuses on identical twin boys, Shiva and Marion. They had been joined at the head at birth and were lucky to have survived the separation. Their upbringing was lucky in another way. When in the first hour after birth your mother, a nurse and devout nun from India, dies, and your father from the secret union, a brilliant English surgeon but the one who botched the operation, bolts, you need all the luck you can get. This came in the form of fellow doctors at the mission who adopted them. Hema and Ghosh, the adopting parents, also took in a young girl named Genet along with her servant mother. It was all one big happy family for a while but conflict was inevitable. It came in political, sexual, and moral forms. The narrative sweep extends into adulthood, through armed conflicts, a stint in New York, and medical traumas. These different stories matter to us more because the characters are so well-developed. You’ll be pleased to know that emotional investments here earn returns rarely seen in assets these days.Verghese himself is a doctor so his book about doctors might easily have been didactic or hagiographic. I never got that sense, though. The technical details of surgery were integrated well within the story. They never seemed gratuitous. Both Marion, who narrates, and Shiva were also doctors. It was good to have a narrator who was three-dimensional and imperfect (especially when it came to Genet, his fleshly idée fixe). And he puffed less than he might have about his profession. I never thought of the book as preachy either, despite its moral elements. The only real flaws I perceived were 1) the first person account that occasionally became too omniscient, and, 2) a case of coincidence near the end that felt like an odd polyhedral peg somehow winding up at the exact hole to fit through. The feeling of contrivance broke the spell, but it was cast again soon enough. The later tightening in my throat was testament to that.Verghese is also a very self-assured writer. In combination, knowing how to save lives, teaching at Stanford, and attending the Iowa Writers’ Workshop must translate to confidence on the page. I certainly won’t hold his writing education against him (though I might have preferred hearing that his talent was purely a function of genius, not, in part, programmed). In any case, it was that unobtrusive style of writing that calls very little attention to itself. The pacing was good, the nonlinearities were effective (never confusing), and the sense of foreshadowing was masterful. Who cares if it was just good coaching – it worked.I’ve been vacillating between 4 and 5 stars. It’s Friday today and my spirit is more generous. So 5 it is. Besides, when I think back on what made me like this book so much, it comes down to its genuine appeal to our better angels. It was more than just platitudes. Faith and doctrine were trumped by real compassion and attention to those who suffer. It made me want to be a better person. Read it and see if you agree. Then we’ll meet for injera bread and spicy wot and talk about Ghosh (so caring and wise), Hema (the talented obstetrician and protective mom), Matron (the brave and pragmatic head of the mission), and ShivaMarion (the twinned entity who continued to sleep head-to-head throughout childhood, had an almost psychic connection despite many differences, and were fascinating to observe in how their shared empathy and antipathy played out)....more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,not set,not set,"Oct 26, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6930014-cutting-for-stone

So when I say it’s no easy matter to add anything that’s not been said better elsewhere, most of you will know what I mean. That’s especially true with this group, loaded with smart people who’ve already done their s. The group (which we all thank Kris and Mary for running so well) has been great for providing discussions and links to help interpret the symbols, themes and historical context. But this, too, makes original thoughts about it hard to come by. Anyway, this is my justification for punting, and instead trying (perhaps too hard) just to be different.I will say that I never really lost myself in the story nor cared about the thinly drawn characters. Maybe it’s not meant to be that kind of book. The greater pleasure was in trying to figure out the different elements of the allegory, what the broader questions were, and how Stalinist oppression may have driven it. The fact that this emerged in the 60’s as a samizdat well after Bulgakov’s death in 1940 was part of the appeal. The axe he was grinding to counter the shush on creative freedom continues to resonate. It’s easy to pose questions: What does the devil (Woland) represent? What is Bulgakov saying about Stalinist Russia; the general population; the arts community/intelligentsia? Is there a religious angle? What about moral judgment; free will vs. determinism; the nature of man?I won’t attempt to answer these because 1) I don’t want to supply any spoilers, and 2) I’m not sure I can.Others have done a much better job addressing the main themes: good vs. evil, courage vs. cowardice, and related to that, artistic freedom vs. toeing the line. About the only motif I haven’t seen mentioned is the contrast between felines and canines. The big, black, humanized cat in Woland’s retinue was like a badly behaved Marx brother. As an example of his character, he tried cheating at chess. Conversely, Pilate’s dog was nearly fearless and ever faithful. I’m surprised that cat owners have not been more vocal in their protests against such an unfavorable contradistinction.Three stars is a cop-out, I know. I was caught between extremes.

Suppose you want to commit the items on your to-do list to memory because you don’t have a pencil and paper. The first five items on your list are:1. Buy a bottle of Bordeaux for tonight’s dinner party2. Put Trainspotting at the front of the Netflix queue3. Finish the office TPS reports before the weekend4. Pick up the copy of The Master and Margarita that’s on hold at the library5. Check the Haile Selassie wiki entry to see if the account of the attempted coup in Cutting for Stone was factualThe list may be much longer than this, but the shortened version above will illustrate the point well enough. Research shows we remember mental images of things much better than we do raw data by rote (things like numbers, playing cards, poems, or list items). Most people can only keep a random sequence of about 7 digits in their heads at a time when first hearing them. Memory experts have found that by transforming any sequence of things into pictures instead, and sticking these pictures in what they call a memory palace, that we can recall them much more effectively. An example should help show this.First of all, we need to visualize a place we know very well. This is the memory palace. In fact, the home you grew up in, while it may not have been a real palace, is probably rich in the kind of recallable detail that can help in retaining long sequences. We then position the mental images associated with the objects we’re trying to remember along a path within the home. In my case, that might mean I come to the front door where a little doe – say Bambi’s girlfriend Faline – is resting. You can tell by her eyes that she’s bored, though. She’s a “Bordeaux”. (I know it’s bad, but this is going to work.) Let the image burn into your brain for a moment. Once inside at the base of the stairs in the foyer I come to a freight car of a model train. It looks ridiculous spotted with pink polka dots, but hey, it’s a way to remember Trainspotting. Up the stairs on the left is a faux antique table. On it sits our mnemonic for TPS: miniature tepees. And just to make it more memorable, imagine that a teenager lives inside one of them and it was TPed with Charmin. (I was tempted to have Lumbergh say “Ummm… yeah…. “ at this point, but wasn’t sure that Office Space was a universal reference.) Then it’s a quick right into the living room. In the middle of it is a big hot tub, but instead of water inside, it’s a giant margarita. The drink comes complete with salt around the edge of the tub and a wedge cut from a lime the size of a beach ball. Inside the tub is a miniature ship with a master on board shouting orders. Some of the crew look like they wouldn’t mind walking the plank. Finally, through the entry way into the kitchen I see Marley’s ghost (Bob Marley, that is) and he’s sitting on the table with doctor/writer extraordinaire Abraham Verghese. In case the link to Haile Selassie isn’t clear, he was also known as Ras Tafari, viewed by many a Jamaican as a messianic figure. Surprisingly enough, Marley is not holding anything rolled up and burning; he’s got a dove perched on his hand instead and it’s cooing (which, of course, is auditorially equivalent to coup-ing).So there’s our list. Picture it in sequence one more time: the bored doe just inside the door, the spotted train at the base of the stairs, the tepees on the table at the top of the stairs, the ship master in the margarita in the living room, and finally, sitting on the kitchen table, the Selassie worshipper with the author of Cutting for Stone and the cooing dove. I could presumably have had dozens of these images stuck along a path throughout the house. The placement along a set route (say up the stairs and clockwise, hitting every room) helps since that way we aren’t as apt to skip anything. Experts also say it’s best to choose images that are ridiculous or racy or in any other way more apt to stick in your head. That pretty much covers the trick to memorization. To get an entire book out of the deal, though, Foer had to expand the scope. He started out mentioning the remarkable feats the elite memorizers can perform (x digits of pi, y decks of cards, z lines of verse). He then got into the small but interesting world of competitive memorization, including his own involvement. Foer began his investigation on a journalistic whim and ended up, with hard work and a lot of help from memory mentors, becoming the US champion. Even though the end result of his competition is mentioned at the outset, there is drama in how it unfolds. The competition involves several categories, one of which is memorizing card sequences. The trick in doing that is an offshoot of what I described above. The difference is that every card has a mental image associated with it that you spend days and days drilling into your head beforehand. Each mental image has a subject and a verb. The ace of clubs may be Karl Spackler (the Cinderella boy himself) teeing off at Augusta. The two of clubs may be Groucho Marx lighting a cigar. And so on for each card in the deck. Then, when you want to memorize the randomized order of a deck, you put these images in a fresh memory palace. Only to make fewer images necessary, you can join the subject of one card with the action of the next card into a single image. If the first card is the seven of diamonds (which you may have associated with Einstein twirling the tassel on his mortarboard) and the next one is the jack of spades (which is J.D. Salinger moonwalking, say) then the pair of those cards together would produce an image of Einstein moonwalking. Memorizing the deck would then involve 26 images. There may be variations, but that’s the basic approach. Sequences of digits are done similarly, only for that you may have 100 different pre-memorized images – one for each pair in the range from 00 to 99. Foer points out that our memories don’t get much of a workout these days. We all know how easy it is to rely on spell checks and Google searches for things we used to keep in our heads. So is it useful to keep more information available for immediate use? Probably. Foer argues that our ideas, abstractions, and arguments depend on recallable units that are the building blocks. What Foer does not do as effectively is demonstrate how the aforementioned devices help with that kind of practical memory. He admits to it, too, though only after he tells his fun story of the US Memory Championship. The “mental athletes” he first encountered were not what he’d expected. They were not savants, nor did they possess photographic memories. Rather, they’d all learned these visualization techniques that date back to the ancient Greeks. The top competitors were often the ones with the most creative images. After being coached by several top mnemonists, Foer was able to compete with the best in the US. He said he still loses his keys, though.There was more to this book as well. However, and I say this with a full appreciation of the irony, I don’t remember much of it. (It was several months ago.) There was a partial debunking of the savant from 60 Minutes who was “born on a blue day”, there was a bit on the tricks in reciting poems, and there was the blow-by-blow action of the memory competition. My impression at the time was that it was all fairly interesting, but not very useful in the end.So who remembers the to-do list? Would you have remembered it without the images? I just tested myself and I can recite it back without error, but then I’ve made six rounds of edits to this stupid . I’d probably remember it anyway. Besides that, I usually have a pencil and paper. ...more",Notes are private!,1,419,1,not set,Mar 2012,"Aug 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6346975-moonwalking-with-einstein

Whatever the number, it’s a rule that John Irving must have taken to heart. Readers of this book will not soon forget the little guy in the title. Owen was exceedingly small, and had a high, almost cartoonish voice. But he also had a commanding presence. When he spoke, people listened. In large part, this was because he had a lot to say. He was opinionated, influential, and smart.The narrator, John, was not as central to the story. But he and his family allowed us to get to know Owen through their interactions with him. Johnny was Salieri to Owen’s Mozart, and Irving deserves credit for making the device work. The member of Johnny’s family that launched the initial part of the plot was his mom. Owen, as a boy, had an almost unnatural attachment to her including an appreciation for the way she filled out a sweater. (According to s, breast obsession is kind of a thing with Irving. His newest book is evidently chock-full of boobaphilic references.) Anyway, the whole world within this book was turned upside down with one swing of a bat. Owen, who rarely got to play, and even more rarely got to try for anything but a walk, hit a foul ball that ended up killing Johnny’s mom. Of course, it was nobody’s fault, but Owen began considering himself some kind of instrument of fate. Despite the initial impressions Owen made, he won over most everyone he met. This included Johnny’s extended family: cousins, father figure, and patrician grandmother with the big house where everyone often met. (As another aside, I wonder why, in the interest of gender equality, there’s no such word as “matrician”.) Though less privileged than most, Owen became a big-shot at the private school that Johnny’s family arranged for him to attend. He was known as “The Voice” for his popular and well-argued op-ed pieces in the school paper.The plot continues into the Vietnam War era where Owen becomes a soldier and John does not. Several mysteries are explained, but mum’s the word about those. I will say that Irving did a good job sustaining momentum. The only dull parts are those focused on Salieri John in contemporary times. In flashback mode, which is most of the time, the pacing is brisk. As for themes, there was no attempt to be sly with the Christ allusions. In fact, one scene featured Owen playing baby Jesus himself in the annual nativity play. (I’m big on parentheses today. This time I’m wondering if it’s an old joke to suggest that Christ had an Owen Meany complex.) Then the God stuff somehow morphed into visions and the supernatural. To me, this was a disappointment, because the plot was driven inexorably and gratuitously by it. The story was doing well enough before this sledgehammer blow of thaumaturgy. The surrealism nullified what had previously rung true.I shouldn’t end this  with a complaint. So I’ll reiterate what an extraordinary character Irving gives us with Owen. I still try to imagine his voice. Whenever Owen speaks in the book, the text is all CAPS so we’re constantly aware that he’s meant to stand out.

Here’s a list that Unbroken brings to mind – things that would be either great (↑) or decidedly not (↓). Having a family that supports you as a child even when you’re a light-fingered, hyperactive little hellion. ↑Becoming enough of a juvenile menace that the police are called to intervene. ↓Having an accomplished older brother who has your back, especially if this brother knows you well enough to divert your energy on to the track. ↑Showing rapid improvement in races, ultimately making the 1936 Olympic team at the age of 19. ↑[image]Gorging yourself on the trans-Atlantic boat ride’s free food that proves all too tempting if you’ve never had a restaurant meal before in your life. Gaining 12 pounds as a result and losing race fitness. ↓Passing numerous runners with a blazing last lap to finish 8th and having Hitler ask to meet you afterwards, remarking, “Ah, the boy with the fast finish.” ↑Stealing a German flag as a souvenir. ↑Setting a collegiate record two years later for the fastest mile, a record that would stand 15 years. Having experts say you’re the likeliest to first break the four minute barrier. ↑Seeing hopes of Olympic glory in 1940 go up in flames with the advent of the war. ↓Joining the Army Air Corps as a bombardier; soon thereafter coming back from a mission with 600 bullet holes in your B-24’s fuselage. ↓[image]On a different plane (a lemon that nobody wanted to fly), having it crash into the ocean due to mechanical problems, killing 8 of the 11 crew members. ↓Finding out after the crash that your life raft has very little in the way of supplies. ↓Living on small raw fish and rainwater for week upon week, aimlessly drifting at sea. ↓Facing a typhoon with 40 foot waves. ↓Facing Japanese bombers strafing you with bullets, missing you (miraculously), but blowing holes in your raft. ↓Sharks. (Even if they don’t come with laser beams, this would suck.) ↓Finding out that the survival manual was correct. With a hard punch in the snout, a shark will usually turn tail. (I’m forcing an interruption to the down-arrow streak.) ↑ Discovering that the land you finally get to after a record 6+ weeks at sea is a Japanese-controlled island. ↓Getting beaten every day by a hyper-sadistic prison guard they call The Bird. Getting singled out as his favorite target. ↓↓Finding out how much starvation, filth, dysentery, and physical abuse a human being can endure. ↓Finally being liberated, going home to a hero’s welcome after you’d been declared dead, and eating mom’s pasta again. ↑Showing signs of PTSD. Drinking to forget. ↓Having your devoted young wife guide you to a spiritual conversion that allows forgiveness and a chance to move on as a motivational speaker. ↑Going strong – still unbroken – into your nineties. ↑Up- and down-arrows apply to Laura Hillenbrand, too. She suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that, for the most part, keeps her in the house and inactive. But she had this to say about her writing, particularly her subjects. “I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically, so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination. And it's just fantastic to be there alongside Louie as he's breaking the NCAA mile record.

There are enough of them that Jennifer Lawrence can’t possibStrong, resourceful young women are enjoying the spotlight these days in popular fiction. There are enough of them that Jennifer Lawrence can’t possibly play them all in movie versions. Serena qualifies for the club with her street smarts (or its Appalachian equivalent), her initiative, and her poise in the face of danger. Too bad she’s also a bloodthirsty, bad-to-the-bone sociopath. She and her husband George Pemberton are Depression-era timber barons in North Carolina. We’re introduced to them as newlyweds as they got off the train from Boston only to be greeted by a young teenager carrying George’s child along with the girl’s father who had a knife and no mind to negotiate. Serena told the girl she was lucky to have such a sire, but that she wouldn’t be so lucky again. The father wanted to settle matters, and Serena calmly told Pemberton that he should get his knife and do exactly that. At least it was a somewhat honorable fight. Later encounters would be less so.It didn’t take long once they reached camp for Serena to establish herself as the alpha dog. Her father was a timber man in Colorado before she was orphaned, and he had taught her the business well. The men never doubted her knowledge or fortitude. In the coolest example of her mettle, she imported a large eagle and trained it to kill rattlesnakes with its dagger-like talons. That was one less danger for the men, but plenty of others still existed. It was said that if you took all the body parts that were lost in accidents and stitched them together, you’d get a new man every month. But at that time, you could always get more workers.Soon enough, major impediments stood in their way. Conservationists wanted the timberland for National Parks, the various interests in the company partnership began to diverge, and the local law didn’t always see eye to eye with Serena and her accomplice in almost all matters, Pemberton. Once it was established the extremes to which Serena and Pemberton¹ would go, there wasn’t much nuance left in the characters. Good and evil were clearly established. With a view of logging as land rape, it could be no other way. On the good side of the ledger, there was Rachel, the pregnant girl in the first chapter. She, too, was strong and resourceful, but with a lot less control. Things are more difficult with a baby and no savings. She was the third POV character and a good one for showing the life and times. The local sheriff was a good guy, too. He was one of the few officials who could not be bought by the Pembertons. Assorted loggers were featured as well, serving, as someone said, as a kind of Greek chorus. They reflected the highlander culture and language while offering commentary on the conflicts they witnessed. And with the story’s many conflicts, they had plenty to discuss. But I won’t (in the interest of spoiler forbearance).Despite seeing each successive problem a mile away, and venturing a good guess about what the reactions would be (it’s checkers, not chess), Rash keeps us turning the pages. He’s a good story-teller and has a very fluid style. I liked how he painted the landscape with his words. He also gave a strong sense of how even very simple lives involve specialized survivor skills that you and I probably don’t possess. For instance, Rachel had to know where to look for ginseng, how to keep the bees, and how to patch a chimney. These were as important to her as knowing the mot juste would be to a Valley girl for social survival.The one thing I didn’t care for in an otherwise great book was how little internal conflict there was once Serena’s relentlessness was established. She ceased to be anything more than an Ayn Rand character raised to the 666th power. There are plenty of other things to like, though. If the following quote by Rash in my edition’s P.S. section is an indication, maybe the main character was the region and its shared humanity all along. Serena was just its foil.To me, one of the most interesting aspects of literature is how the most intensely “regional” literature is also often the most universal. There’s no better example of this than Joyce’s Ulysses. The best regional writers are like farmers drilling for water; if they bore deep and true enough into that particular place, beyond the surface of local color, they tap into universal correspondences, what Jung called the collective unconscious. Faulkner’s Mississippi, Munro’s Ontario, and Marquez’s Colombia are exotic, and they are also familiar.¹I was tempted to shorten this pair to S&P, but I suspect they need no further insinuation as symbols of big business as it’s purported to be, rapacious and predatory....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,not set,not set,"Jul 20, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6294205-serena

BasebalCrash Davis knew that an important part of Ebby Calvin “Nuke” LaLoosh’s preparation for the big leagues was to teach him the standard clichés. Baseball, and sports in general, are full of them. There’s a favorite that certain sports books seem to evoke, too: “You don’t have to be a fan of the game to like this.” Since I am a fan, I can’t speak with any authority for those who are not, but my guess is that for The Art of Fielding, it’s at least partially true. I can be more certain if you’re a fan of campus novels, in-depth profiles, literary allusions, or quality writing.Five POV characters share the stage at little Westish College in Wisconsin:Henry Skrimshander – the super-skilled shortstop on the Westish team. He’s a rather flat, unassuming character except for his amazing focus on the game and willingness to work like crazy to improve. The Art of Fielding by Cardinals great Aparicio Rodriguez (the perfect shortstop name if your knowledge of the game extends that far) is his Bible.Mike Schwartz – a natural leader of men, captain of both the football and baseball teams, and the one who discovered the slick-fielding Henry. Mike’s a dutiful team-first type, but might have a little problem with pain meds meant for his abused catcher’s knees. He’s also smart enough to get into a very good law school, but maybe not the ones he’s applied to.Guert Affenlight – a Westish alum and now its President. He became a star scholar of early American literature, especially the works of Melville. (Harbach was completely overt tying his book to Moby Dick.) Guert taught at Harvard, was a handsome devil, well-spoken, and could engage any audience. Pella Affenlight – Guert’s daughter who may have been more precocious than was good for her. She opted out of an Ivy League education to be with an older man and it ended up going wrong (surprise, surprise). She’s rebuilding a life at Westish with inspiring resolve.Owen Dunne – Henry’s half-black, all-gay, baseball playing roommate. Owen is brilliant, urbane, literate, and improbably well-liked by the jock set. Harbach drew lines in interesting ways to connect each one of these characters to the others. Shy, coachable Henry was given killer workouts by Mike that included weights, stadium steps, and thousands of balls to hit and field. That coupled with his Zen-like oneness with the ball* paid off. He was on the verge of breaking the record his idol (the aforementioned Aparicio Rodriguez) set for consecutive games without an error. Then something happened, and though it would only be a minor spoiler to say what, I won’t, because I didn’t know myself going into this. Meanwhile, Mike met Pella. Their relationship provides a tension between their ambitions on one side and the potential for contentment reining them in on the other. Then there’s another relationship; this one involving Owen. Readers may or may not want to know about this beforehand. (view spoiler)[Guert, who had always been a lady’s man, is smitten. (hide spoiler)] I’m not allowing myself a very complete summary because that would mean elaborating on what I’ve already judged to be giving too much away. It’s part of the pleasure of the book to see how things unfold. If you’re like me, you’ll find it all too easy to get personally involved in the characters’ lives, too. You’ll have rooting interests beyond the Westish 9.The Trib’s literary magazine provided some background on Harbach’s rise to fame. Initially, he received zero interest from publishers. Then a young baseball-loving agent went about promoting it and scared up an offer of $175K from Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This was more than Harbach had earned in the 7 previous years of his working life. However, he refused this offer and ultimately saw his agent bring it to auction where it garnered a bid of $750K from Scribner. Harbach instead accepted $665K from Little, Brown because they offered him the chance to work with Michael Pietsch, David Foster Wallace’s editor for Infinite Jest.I liked this one a lot, though I can’t quite see it as 5 stars. It was very well written, but had some slightly annoying quirks. As my wife recently asked as she was reading it, do people really say freshpersons now? A few of the plot points stretched credulity, too. Still, a fifth star was tempting. Resorting again to clichés, we saw the old “baseball as metaphor for life” trope play out well both on the field and off. It featured foiled plans, imperfections, and chances at redemption. And you know what else? It ain’t over ‘til it’s over.*As TA0F within TAoF said, “One moves not against the ball but with it. Bad fielders stab at the ball like an enemy. This is antagonism. The true fielder lets the path of the ball become his own path, thereby comprehending the ball and dissipating the self, which is the source of all suffering and poor defense.”...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"May 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10996342-the-art-of-fielding

As is true of any simulation, there is a deterministic component and a random component. Simulated paths will vary, but the statistical distributions from which the stochastic terms are sampled match those of GR. Our approach, as applied to text generation, is novel¹. It is, however, closely related to the methods employed by computer scientists in the so-called Markovian Mozart initiative². We begin by describing the basic structure, we then discuss our vision of the text generation process as it applies to GR, and conclude with final thoughts on how text simulation may be used going forward.Simulation StructuringInterest in random text generation appears to have begun with the famous, though untested, proposition that an infinite number of monkeys with infinite time at their keyboards would ultimately reproduce Shakespeare. Of course, pure randomness without some kind of structure is a highly inefficient path toward literary art. Plus, the process is just as likely to produce piggy porn as it is to emulate Pynchon (granting, for our purposes, that there is a distinction to be made). The opposite side of the spectrum would be a well-defined set of sentences featuring blanks to fill in using a pre-chosen set of options. This was a style popularized by Mad Magazine³. Such an approach differs from ours in that their structure is more narrowly defined, allowing insufficient latitude to characterize the chaotic and disorienting nature of GR.The input parameters to our simulation will, by default, result in 4 sections, 73 chapters, over 400 characters (mostly minor, wordplayfully named), and 776 pages, just as the original did. However, one of the advantages of a simulator is that the resulting length is configurable. We are also careful to specify stylistic breakdowns that may enter in a probabilistically identical way. The sampling ranges extend from ridiculous to sublime in one dimension and vulgar to sublime in another. By applying noise terms to the narrative, comprehension will vary throughout.Text Generating ProcessThe backbone of our simulation structure is established in the initial step. We specify a superset of core influences which are drawn upon by the random text extractor in accordance with user-supplied probability weights. This superset, A, is defined byA ⊂ (WWII Historical Almanac, V-2 Rocket Technical Manual, Pavlovian Psychology [loaded in backwards], German-English Dictionary, Freud’s Comprehensive List of Phallic Symbols, phrasebooks for various romance languages, Anthology of Daft ‘n’ Bawdy Poetry, Urban Thesaurus [1945 edition], Guidebook to Pharmacology, Introduction to Tarot Symbolism, Applications in Multivariate Calculus and Differential Equations, a short book of surprisingly tender love stories, a longer book of genuinely raunchy lust stories, and an assortment of engineering textbooks)Text drawn probabilistically from A serves as our starting point, S1. The next step is to intersperse small elements of plot into S1 with insertion points determined by a Poisson distribution. Specifyf(k, λ) = λ^k ⋅ exp(-λ) / k!where k is the number of insertion points for each sub-block of S1, ! denotes factorial, and λ is the mean inclusion rate (λ > 0, but not by much)The storyline to be parsed and inserted as indicated above is presented (by us and by Pynchon) in skeletal form. The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature sums it up well⁴. The sprawling narrative comprises numerous threads having to do either directly or tangentially with the secret development and deployment of a rocket by the Nazis near the end of World War II. Lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop is an American working for Allied Intelligence in London. Agents of the Firm, a clandestine military organization, are investigating an apparent connection between Slothrop's erections and the targeting of incoming V-2 rockets. As a child, Slothrop was the subject of experiments conducted by a Harvard professor who is now a Nazi rocket scientist. Slothrop's quest for the truth behind these implications leads him on a nightmarish journey of either historic discovery or profound paranoia, depending on his own and the reader's interpretation.As a work in the postmodernist tradition, nonlinearity must be actuated. At no point may the plot as a function of time (P[t]) be twice differentiable, and only rarely may it be first-order differentiable. Flashbacks, digressions, and various other discontinuities must be introduced as P[t] is inserted into S1. In a related way, causal orderings must be distorted for a more authentic Pynchonian narrative. Specify Cause ⇔ Effect +/- δtwhere δt = α + β⋅δJ + σ⋅δz with J being a jump parameter; δz being Gaussian (not DeLillovian) white noise; and α, β ‘n’ σ being user-defined constants.Once the plot convolutions specified above are inserted, resulting in S2, various themes may be brought to bear. Seminal s by Penkevich (2012), Jenn(ifer) (2012), and Graye (2012) discuss a wide variety of these themes and should serve as the basis for the next stage of textual input. The motifs identified form a set B ⊂ (Nature of Control, Paranoia, Preterite vs. Elite, Us vs. Them, etc.). Sampling from B proceeds in the same manner described above for A, i.e., according to the probability weights defined by the user. We denote the result of this as S3.Authorial insights into human nature are treated in a similar way. However, lists constructed using the aforementioned s feature insights of the ers themselves. This, in essence, removes layers of obfuscation so that transformations are necessary to reconstruct the more muddled original set. This is achieved by adding random perturbations and mapping the results into Hilbert space. Draws from this set of transformed and re-adumbrated insights inserted into S3 give us S4.Stylistic modifications to S4 are important when attempting to simulate the GR experience. For one, the narration should vary depending on the POV character. Allow average words per sentence in certain randomly chosen sections to be fully three times greater than the overall average. A smaller but consistently applied transformation is to take a common four-letter word and substitute in a three-letter alternative that, for what it’s worth, is phonetically more correct. For Pynchon, this meant “says” → “sez”. The result of these modifications is denoted S5.A GR simulation would not be complete without one further stylistic “enhancement”. Any vanilla sex scenes within S5 may be replaced with random draws from Y. Denote:U := incidence of urolagniaC := incidence of coprophagiaK := incidence of kinkiness of any other formWe can then specifyY=U⋅C⋅K!Finally, the result of this last modification, S₆, should be submitted to voice recognition software and compared with Pynchon’s own voice. Any wavelets that differ by more than 2 σ should then be truncated within S₆ to create S7. It is our contention that S7 will be a lexically similar rendition of the original when the default values of the parameter inputs are chosen. Alternatively, our framework also allows customization such that GR may be generated with a twist. Options along these lines are discussed in the final section below.Prospects Going ForwardPynchon’s well-known penchant for formulaic detail coupled with random noise makes GR a natural vehicle for demonstrating our methods. As stated above, by choosing the relevant inputs and their GR-consistent probability values, a book very much like GR may be generated. By repeating the process, multiple instances may be constructed. With sufficient computing power, these multiple instances can be fed into a genetic algorithm to determine an “optimal” GR (where optimality is defined in terms of individual tastes). For instance, by dialing down the weight assigned to silly poems in the initial stage, one could generate a new GR of even greater ponderousness and density. Similarly, length settings may be varied. A GR sampler could be generated that is only a fraction of the original length. Or for the show-off readers out there looking for even greater challenges, a simulated version that doubles the length and halves the signal-to-noise ratio could be produced. Of course, our methodology may be applied to simulate any piece of writing⁵. Hybridization is also possible. For instance, if the inputs for David Morrell’s First Blood were combined with those for GR, setting it in Vietnam, and substituting in violence for half the sex scenes, something like Gravity’s Rambo would result. Hybrids that do not involve GR are also possible. Inputs from classic works by Margaret Mitchell and Haruki Murakami could be combined to create Gone with the Wind-up Bird Chronicles. The key to performing these simulations well is to draw on the astute observations of ers for synopses, insights ‘n’ context. We encourage readers to generate these important inputs to spectrally enrich and parabolically ground all further text simulation exercises.The code used to generate simulated versions of GR is available upon request: SLOTH, Simplatz 00001, The Zone.Endnotes¹As a further demonstration of our techniques, we invoked a random pun generator in the construction of this paper.²Their simulation involves inputting all published works of a composer such as Mozart, codifying tones, tempos, and dynamics to be used in pattern recognition software that then assigns probabilities used to generate subsequent notes. For example, if the previous measure consisted of four quarter notes with the pattern E E F G, the algorithm would scan the entire sample of the composer’s works for similar patterns as well as the notes that had followed. It may then be determined that there is a 31% probability that a quarter note G will be next, a 14% probability that it will be a quarter note E, and so on. This is then fed into the simulator to randomly determine the next note consistent with the probabilities. The newly generated note pattern would then be windowed and used in an iterative fashion to determine all subsequent notes. ³An example might be to choose words or phrases to construct a political speech: My opponent is a (Republican, Democrat, cretin) and is therefore given to (flip-flopping, demagoguery, pleasuring male goats). In contrast to him, I vow to support (education, the environment, the people, bridges to nowhere only when the quid is sufficiently pro quo). ⁴While it is only right to recognize Greg (2010) for the brevity and pith of his plot summary, it did not allow us to specify a P[t] function to highlight the nonlinearity w.r.t. time.⁵This write-up itself was generated through simulation – a kind of meta-feature of what amounts to postmodernistic content formulation.ReferencesGraye, Ian, 2012, Goodreads  Review of Gravity’s Rainbow.Greg, 2010, Goodreads  Review of Gravity’s Rainbow.Jenn(ifer), 2012, Goodreads  Review of Gravity’s Rainbow.

He said the further he got into it, and the moSomething my Uncle Bob once told me about his days as a competitive bridge player always stuck with me. He said the further he got into it, and the more advanced the players were, the less fun it all became. I guess at some level it got to be a serious business – one where everyone wanted to show that they were as smart as or smarter than all the other laser-focused competitors. Any social element of the game was beside the point, or worse still, a distraction. J.D. Salinger’s idée fixe for many years, the Glass family, was a lot like that in the game of life, it seems. They had plenty of insights, but not much in the way of joy. Is this a disappointment? Maybe a little. The natural tendency is to use smart people as guides, but that’s not always wise. The Basic PlotFranny and Zooey were the youngest of seven siblings. All of them, when they were young, were stars on a radio quiz show. Beyond a command of the facts, they could also be witty and engaging on cue. In the first of the book’s two stories, Franny is a college student visiting a boyfriend of sorts for the big Yale game. Her date’s hopes for a nice show-off weekend were thwarted, though, when Franny’s vague peevishness grows into a spiritual crisis. She ultimately passes out. The first story mostly just sets the stage for the more important second story. That one starts with Zooey, a part-time actor in his mid-twenties, having a snarky conversation with his mom while he takes a long bath. This segment establishes his character as one who thinks he knows everything, actually does know a lot, suffers fools less than gladly, and seems to consider his mother one of the fools. At least he shows some concern for his younger sister who is now home. Finally dressed and ready for his day of nothing much, we get to the meat of the story. He prods Franny for the details leading to her breakdown. She’s reluctant to say much at first, but Zooey persists. We discover what’s bothering her (people, essentially, and her place in the world among them), what her attempted solution is (repeating the Jesus Prayer – Lord Jesus have mercy on me – until a Zen-like state and oneness with Christ is achieved), and Zooey’s appraisal of this (that it’s not exclusively a Christian phenomenon she’s going for or even a religious one). Then Zooey tells her (and us) a more pertinent homily, one that their oldest brother Seymour had told about being your best for the fat lady (= the every-schlub in the radio audience who wants reasons to admire them). And you know what? (You may or may not consider this a spoiler.) (view spoiler)[Paraphrasing: no matter where an actor acts, there isn’t anyone out there who isn’t Seymour’s fat lady. (Salinger sets this up better than I do – it was throat-tighteningly good the way he did it.) (hide spoiler)] Sorting It All OutIt’s hard to know my own mind with this impactful little book. Since it’s clear that Salinger relates strongly to these gifted, knowing characters, my view of the story becomes almost more of an assessment of the author himself. What do we make of the charges leveled against him as a pretentious elitist and bourgeoisie basher? That’s even harder for me to figure. Certainly, F&Z can be evaluated with those same traits in mind. In addition, the author and the book share themes relating to the cult of celebrity, reclusiveness, and Buddhist philosophy. But the key for me is figuring how effectively F, Z, and JD rise above their innate disdain for the common man. It’s easy to see how the elitism of others – a kind less honestly come by – is shot down. Lane Coutell, Franny’s date for the football weekend, was a pseudo-intellectual who thought very well of himself for his discourse on Flaubert. I think we’re meant to relate this to the phoniness that another Salinger character famously berated. But what about the smarter-than-thou Glasses? They’re the truly clever ones, right? Their cerebral attainment is not pseudo (though I suspect it’s all relative). On the face of it, Salinger’s fat lady solution has them on the right track – accepting of mankind despite its middlebrow flab. Does Seymour’s soft glowing light bulb suddenly mean their disaffected days are behind them? Even if we do accept their conversion, might there be something just a tad condescending about it? I think I need to read more of the Glass stories to round out my view. What I will venture to say, though, is that the changes in attitude still seem unlikely to bring them much wonder and joy. In a sense, we might view this book as meta-elitism. I wonder what that would make my critique of it? If you’re thinking your own critique of my critique would be anti-meta-meta-elitism, let me remind you that, at least in this context, there’s a fine line between anti- and meta-. ;-) Anyway, getting to the bottom line, I figure a book that generates this much debate with myself must be pretty good. ...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,not set,not set,"May 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5113.Franny_and_Zooey

Even some further down our list of favorites could provide mild, mindless fun. I went into this book expecting something similar. It didn’t take long, though, to realize that this was a cut above that. Ferris pieced together something funnier and more knowing. To couch it in sit-com terms, it was like those episodes of MASH where the normal humor and sarcasm would give way to something serious and poignant. They were effective because we were made to like the characters first so that anything bad happening to them would have greater emotional mass. I won’t give away any of the book’s major plot points, but I will say that there were parts, especially in the middle section which really stood out, where some trenchant events were set up very well by a lighter touch beforehand. The book is set at an advertising agency in Chicago in the not so distant past. It’s an ensemble cast of mostly mid-level creative types doing whatever it is those types do at the office. Their activities included: working, gossiping, joking, politicking, backstabbing, note-comparing, consensus-gathering (about important non-office issues), and reflecting on their own situations, often tinged by paranoia. In other words, just what you’d expect. One thing that makes this different, though, is the first person plural narration. It was odd at first hearing “we” and “our”, but the device actually turned out to be pretty effective. Each character within the “we” is developed separately and thoroughly, but no single one of them becomes a dominant voice in the telling of the story. I suspect Ferris had good reasons to go with the collective we. It may have been a way to comment on group-think and the good and bad aspects of a team approach. Or it may have been a way to render unbiased opinions (without being omniscient) simply by mixing divergent views into an average. In the process, the idiosyncrasies of individuals are made to stand out against modern office orthodoxy. But what do I know – those are just guesses. What I do know is that there were some characters worth caring about. The middle section I referred to earlier was a good example. It was like a separate, but connected story. In fact, it was no longer the first person plural narrator. Instead, a sensitive and insightful all-seer took their place. Lynn, the talented and respected boss, faced an ordeal, or rather didn’t face it, at least not head on. Her proactive, achievement-oriented MO went AWOL. Other characters had issues to resolve, too. Some succeeded, and some didn’t. It wasn’t Andy Griffith, but it wasn’t Curb Your Enthusiasm either. So from my experience you should go into this expecting a few grins, some mildly amusing banter, and a mise en scene from the likes of Dunder Mifflin, but come away knowing you got a fair amount more than that.

She told him he possessed the most important trait a writeWhen JSF was a freshman at Princeton he took Intro to Writing with JCO (Joyce Carol Oates). She told him he possessed the most important trait a writer can have: energy. I guess I can see the evidence of that in this, his first novel, published when he was only 25. It was based on real-life research he had done in the Ukraine trying to find the woman in an old family picture who helped is grandfather escape the Nazis. He put a fictionalized wrapper around all this that bundled not only the family history, but tales about life in the shtetl, an account narrated by his young Ukrainian translator (Alex), and the correspondence between them. The writing was usually pretty lively no matter whether it was JSF or Alex at the helm. The switching between them kept the pace spritely as well. But with all this energy, something else was lacking. It falls under the more mundane category of editing. First, there were the gimmicks. There was nothing inherently wrong with them, I just didn’t feel like they were very well-executed. The fact that JSF himself was a character in the novel was a contrivance, but understandable. At least he could write convincingly from that particular point of view. His Ukrainian counterpart, though, Alex, was not as plausible. His narration was meant to be funny, replete with idiomatic inventions and not-quite-right synonyms. For instance, he would close each correspondence with “Guilelessly” rather than “Sincerely.” Actually, that was one of the better ones. Others were more far-fetched, and the repetition got old. That was part of an overall inconsistency in tone, sort of like if a classically trained violinist tried to play hillbilly-style every third or fourth measure.Good editing could have helped in a few other areas, too. For instance, the sex scenes in the early days of the shtetl didn’t ring true, pre-dating by many years movies like Long Dong Silver where the outlandishness might have been more fitting. The stories, in general, were sort of inane. Then there was an extreme case of Deus ex machina to explain how Alex’s grandfather, who was the putatively blind driver in this investigation, connected to the people they met. Foer was also criticized for overstating the part Ukrainians played in abetting the Nazis in the actual historical event at Trochenbrod (which was the model for his story). I’m sure Foer is a real talent. My feeling with this one, though, is that he had no one in his corner telling him anything other than how great he was. He’s probably matured since then, as have his people, and the editing is bound to have improved. Can anyone who’s read any of his later books confirm this?Afterthought: For a much better Holocaust story with a twist, try The Complete Maus....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,not set,Dec 2011,"Mar 14, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/256566.Everything_is_Illuminated

On the face of it, we’re led to believe that it’s a story of the terrible suffering perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jews in Poland and throughout Europe. But if you scratch beneath the surface, I think you’ll find that this particular holocaust story was made to symbolize something more pervasive and endemic. I speak of the horrific violence that persists to this day; that inflicted by cats on defenseless mice. Perhaps the most obvious clue that this is, in truth, the intended theme lies in the title itself: Maus. For those of you unfamiliar with German, this is their word for mouse. Beyond that, when you look carefully at the drawings, you see that the goose-steppers have distinctly feline features, while the persecuted Jews in the ghettos and camps have rodent-like proboscides and disproportionately small eyes. Cat on mouse violence is so old and pervasive that, in a way, we’ve become desensitized to it. Countless depictions of it in the arts have made it a stale, clichéd topic; almost cartoonish at times. That’s why I thought it was particularly effective to tell the story allegorically. When seen through the lens of the Jewish experience, and with Spiegelman’s masterstroke of personalizing the story by laying bare the difficult relationship he had with his father (the survivor), the residuum of cat brutality that can literally tear mice families apart is brought home to us in a very different way.Original: Mar 9, 2012------------------------Addendum: Aug 23, 2013This still ranks as my top graphic novel of all time, but I just finished Chris Ware's Building Stories which gives it a pretty good run for the money.

It seemed like he’d been going non-stop. And he was even more digressive and random than before. I also noticed that he never looked my way when he was speaking. Others that he engaged apparently connected well with him. In fact, some were calling him a genius. I sure wanted to appreciate what they were seeing, but that’s not the sort of thing you can force.

A prominent member of the faculty has just read your submission for a contest. He is genuinely excited for you. “A marvelous story! Pure magic. No—no—not magic. Alchemy. The dross of self-consciousness transformed into the gold of self-knowledge.” Pretty heady stuff, isn’t it? Old School’s protagonist was at an experiential high point when he heard that one. The truth is there are moments within the book where you could congratulate Wolff for the same achievement. More than once I asked myself whether a passage was so good because of its insights or because of the way it was worded. The answer was typically both.The story was set in the early 60’s at a prep school for boys somewhere in New England. The narrator, who never gave his name, was on scholarship there. It was an eccentric, bookish place where writers, not athletes, were the heroes (if you can imagine that). The school featured a series of literary competitions where the prize for each was one-on-one time with whatever notable figure was recruited as judge. Robert Frost was the first. The old man passed on our boy’s work in favor of one he misinterpreted as having depth and irony that, in truth, was simple and earnest. (Think of Peter Sellers’ character in Being There.) For the second competition, Ayn Rand was judge. The narrator was seduced by her philosophy of self-interest to the point of obsession, reading The Fountainhead four times. Then he became deliriously ill. He was too sick to write an entry, but thought he could at least go to her talk. As she turned her disgusted face on him after he sneezed, he was quickly disillusioned. “She made me feel that to be sick was contemptible.”The final competition was the big one. Hemingway, his hero, was the judge. The whole school felt a kinship to the man via stories of friendship with one of the teachers formed during the Great War. The drama really begins as the narrator thinks of what to write. And this is where I stop summarizing because I might give too much away if I don’t. Let’s just say that the truth can have good days and bad days. I’ll also hint to you that class, privilege, and identity come into play, but it’s all by the teaspoon not the trowel-full. People who would know have called this a thinly veiled memoir. This is a natural form for Wolff who has a great reputation as a memoirist. All I know is the writing seemed exceptionally good. His short stories have always rated well, too. If associations are at all indicative, I’ll mention a wiki factoid: He was on the faculty with Raymond Carver at Syracuse, and students who worked with Wolff while he was there included Jay McInerney, Tom Perrotta, George Saunders, and Alice Sebold.This was close to a 5-star book for me, but I’m compelled to take one away because the main character’s clash with himself seemed a wee bit contrived. Or maybe it was just inconsistent with the way I’d been viewing him.

(“Polysyllabic” is the usual example – a word that describes itself.) When multiple blurbs for a book call it nuanced, you can bet it’ll feature more in the way of inner life and less in the way of plot. Of course, this can be good or bad depending on how skilled the writer is, how interesting the drill-downs are, and the extent to which the M.O. might otherwise be hackneyed or boilerplate. It’s like jazz standards. I’m not talking about the ivory tickler at Joe’s Piano Bar in Des Moines – all glissandos and grace notes; I’m thinking more like Jarrett, Peacock and DeJohnette, where nuance is everything. We already know the tune, so our favorite jazzmen can play us the complements instead, merely hinting occasionally at the melody. The indirections alter our balance just enough to enjoy the ride. Often it’s the notes they don’t play that are the most transcendent. (Thanks, Thelonious, for that insight.) Before I get too carried away, I should say what must already be obvious: The Master is nuanced. In a good way. The standards are themes like love, longing, grief and regret. Toibin comes at these in an understated way, with subtlety and refinement to spare.This is an interesting slice of biographical fiction based on the life of American-English writer Henry James. The action, such as it is, takes place from 1895 to 1899 in England and the continent. There is conflict, as any good book must include, but it’s usually the personal kind. Toibin’s account begins as Henry’s new foray into play writing is given a bad reception. Meanwhile, Oscar Wilde’s new play at a rival theatre was packing them in. For something to do the night his own play opened, Henry witnessed Wilde’s production, where “as the curtain rose and the audience began to laugh at lines which he thought crude and clumsy, he felt under siege. He did not laugh once; he thought not a moment was funny, but more importantly, he thought not a moment was true. Every line, every scene was acted out as though silliness were a higher manifestation of truth. No opportunity was missed in portraying witlessness as wit; the obvious and shallow and glib provoked the audience into hearty and hilarious laughter.”Looks like Henry was quite the earnest highbrow, perhaps concluding that Wilde lacked nuance. Toibin did a good job going back and forth in time to give the context needed to understand the present-day Henry and his complicated relationships with people. One of these relationships was with Oliver Wendell Holmes who he knew from school days at Harvard. Here’s another snippet that reveals more about Henry’s perceptions (and Toibin’s fine writing) as it applies to Holmes and other Americans Henry had known who later became famous.""When they came to England, they appeared mysterious to him, so confident, so adept at finishing their sentences, so used to being listened to, and yet they seemed to him, compared to men of their kind in England and France, oddly raw and boyish, their brashness a kind of innocence.""Another friend was the writer Constance Fenimore Woolson. She was also an American who lived in Europe. They travelled together, critiqued works of art together including each others, and might have become closer still had they both been the right types. Sadly, as Henry wrote to another friend, “she had always been a woman so little formed for positive happiness that half one’s affection for her was, in its essence, a kind of anxiety.”Before the book, I knew next to nothing about James aside from the fact that he was prolific and from a famous family. His father was a prominent intellectual, his brother William was a famous philosopher and psychologist, and his sister Alice was a noted diarist. Toibin’s meticulous research provides what I’m sure is the real deal. And there’s plenty to be learned. To give the account even more authenticity, his text includes bits taken from letters by James, his friends and his family. Those familiar with James’s books say that Toibin captured the voice well with his ornate sentences and keen observations. The back cover likened it to Michael Cunningham’s book The Hours. Henry was sometimes hard to figure. His reluctance to act often had repercussions that were every bit as consequential as dramatic actions would have been. Several people – a favorite cousin, his sister, his friend Constance – expected him to share more of himself with them, but he was bound to disappoint, often using his work as an excuse. Then there was a failure to act on certain other impulses, which I’ll come to in a moment. His brother William observed another aspect of his nature, fairly or not:“I believe the English can never be your true subject. And I believe that your style has suffered through the strain of constantly dramatizing social insipidity. I think also that something cold and thin-blooded and oddly priggish has come to the fore in your content.”Books like this which rely heavily on a sense of period often focus on manners, it seems. This may be especially true where the n-word (nuance) is involved. Isn’t Jane Austen described as being all about manners? With her it was always women seeking men. With this one, it’s man seeking, uh, we’re not really sure, but it’s pretty clearly from a vantage point deep within the closet. The impulses I mentioned earlier, felt but not pursued, fall under this category. You can read as much into this as you want, but to me it was just another part of a man with more going on beneath the surface than above it.Graced with nuance, the cowardice, the guilt, and the extreme sensitivity that would typically form an unsympathetic figure are combined with more redeeming traits to create an interesting composite. I wasn’t always sure I liked the guy, but he had a lot of facets to consider. The only knock I have against the book is that with all the long descriptions, my mind would sometimes wander. That said, it often wandered in entertaining directions – character parsing and the ineffable way of folks.

(hide spoiler)]Actually, these weren’t really spoilers at all. I just saw Bird Brian use the sliding door to great effect in one of his recent s and thought it was fun and different.Getting back to Skippy, this book has plenty to recommend it. The characters seemed very real, the dialog was pitch perfect, the conflicts were plausible, and the writing was top-notch. I can’t say whether it was plot-driven or character-driven because it was both. And it was funny. And sad. At times even thought-provoking. As we’ve established, Skippy does die right at the start. The book then backtracks to tell us about the months leading up to that point. Skippy’s roommate, Ruprecht, is also central to the story – an overweight genius with an abiding interest in string theory and all eleven of its abstract dimensions. A cross-section of other friends includes one who was idiosyncratic in his earnest good nature, one who was nobody’s fool, and one who provided comic relief as a would-be Lothario (named Mario) who didn’t catch the irony of a lucky condom he’d been carrying for three years. Anyway, Skippy has conflicts (surprise, surprise). One is a dying mother, another is a dream girl at the neighboring school who is both out of his league and unaware of his existence. Besides that, she kind of has this thing going with bad-boy Carl who trades pills for affections. We get to know this cast of 14-year-olds well, with that odd mix of credulity and cynicism characteristic of the age.Adults are given full treatment, too. There’s Howard (the Coward) who teaches history and lives with his American girlfriend Halley, who fell for him because he was ""Irish-looking, by which she meant a collection of indistinct features – pale skin, mousy hair, general air of ill-health – that combine to mysteriously powerful romantic ¬effect"". But Howard was also in the thrall of a substitute geography teacher, the alluring Aurelie (alliteratively speaking). She may have been a femme fatale, but she did inspire him to improve his classroom performance. One of the more poignant bits of the book was during an impromptu field trip where Howard told the boys about the WWI experiences of an Irish unit that had been renowned for their rugby prowess during school days only to find dramatic changes in their fortunes from the war as heroism was redefined in the wake of anti-English sentiment. Then there was Father Green (or Pere Vert as the boys called him). There’s a murkiness about this guy which would be a true spoiler to reveal. Another, Greg Costigan, was an exceedingly political school administrator. He was so bad it was funny. Anyone who talks about the school “brand” is meant to be a caricature, I figure. It’s surprising he wasn’t made out to be an American, one of the buzzword-wielding business-trained elite. The plot makes its way to these various characters very skillfully; never too fast, never too slow. We get fights, bravery, cowardice, boy meeting girl, and even a few flirtations with the supernatural (or might that be quantum physics, as only Ruprecht could possibly know). I won’t go into the details because this is already too long, but I will say that any fears I had about jumping the shark (at the dance where Skippy meets Dream Girl) were off base. In Murray’s capable hands, I ended up buying it all – the White Goddess, the Irish mythology, the weird science, the Druid drug dealer – all of it.Sadly, Skippy does die. But we’re better people for knowing his story and the stories of those around him. Murray tells it so well.

The Littlest Hitler features stories that mix humor, biting social commentary, and surrealism in varying amounts, all to good effect. While I can’t wax profound like Joshua did in his , I can tell you that the more absurd elements have a point to them. In one example, a woman produced a new weapon in the face of office politics (and sexual politics, too) when she came to work with a beard made of bees. One of the most appealing things about these surreal stories is how casual his tone is when he tells them. It’s emphasis through understatement. The absurdities were not shouted. There was no laugh track. They were simply offered up in a straight-faced, unimpassioned way as part of an otherwise standard narrative.Not all his stories embraced the bizarre. In fact, the first one might have been taken from the David Sedaris playbook: conventional observational humor (though, to my mind, Boudinot’s was hipper and funnier). Another one I enjoyed -- one about the dynamic between two couples who came to realize they’d grown apart -- kept mostly within the real world, too. To be honest, the surreal stories, for me, were more hit or miss. Even though the intended targets of his extrapolations were usually clear, I didn’t always view his absurdities as responses to anywhere we’re actually heading. For instance, what social ill would be addressed by having 18-year-olds (view spoiler)[killing their parents as part of a government-sanctioned program (hide spoiler)]? Maybe that was more for the shock value itself. Same goes for the matter-of-fact way that a mom would alter the usual dinner menu with a once-a-week special night of (view spoiler)[cannibalism (hide spoiler)]. At times like those, I was reminded of the highly experimental skits on SNL that they’d show at the end of the program. I guess outré is not always a means to the end. Sometimes it’s an end in itself. (As counterpoint, one that did strike me as on message featured Glengarry Glen Ross acolytes behaving badly, where the rape-and-pillage Viking ethos that they took door-to-door was just kind of accepted as the nature of the beast.) I’m a lot less ambivalent about the writing. It was crisp, cool, and seemingly effortless. He was good at that style that mixes the sagacious with the scurrilous for taste sensations that the most inventive chefs can make work. Don’t you envy people who can sound smart without the obvious signs of trying too hard? I suppose for Boudinot, it’s simply a matter of good word choices – ones he’s confident will connect with his audience. When I think about it, his audience must be mostly young, clever readers from the slightly out there wing of the party. Then I wonder how it is I have any right to like this....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65457.The_Littlest_Hitler

I thank all these people because I ended up LMNFTRAO (that’s “laughing my numb-from-the-road ass off” for those of you unfamiliar with the shorthand).Many believe that the type of humor a person likes says a lot about them. By that criterion, or the reverse engineered version of it, people seem surprised to hear I ever advanced beyond The Three Stooges and Mad Magazine. But the truth is I’ve now added Tina Fey’s brand to my list – that somewhat self-effacing, observational, semi-edgy, but not too nasty kind. When you sample all her different vehicles you realize she’s got quite a range. Bossypants, for instance, had more bite to it than you’d expect from, say, her Liz Lemon character. One early snippet from the book gives you the idea.“I was so used to being praised and encouraged that when I finished my drawing [on the first day of kindergarten] I held it up to show [another kid] Alex, who immediately ripped it in half. I didn’t have the language to express my feelings then, but my thoughts were something like “Oh, it’s like that, motherfucker? Got it.”Not made for network kind of shtick, but still funny.I also liked the many times she was in smart/cool/feigned cool mode. One example was at a photo shoot.“The photographer will ask you what kind of music you want to play during the shoot. Remember that whatever you choose will be blasted through the loft and heard by an entire crew of people who are all so cool that the Board of Ed. officially closed school. Just murmer, “Hip-hop”, or make up the name of a hipster-sounding band and then act superior when they’ve never heard of it. “Do you guys have any Asphalt of Pinking? [disappointed] Really? [shrug] Whatever you want then.”Another is at the beginning of her chapter called “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again” about her honeymoon cruise.“If you get this reference to David Foster Wallace’s 1997 collection of essays, consider yourself a member of the cultural elite. Why do you hate your country and flag so much?!”She went on to describe a fire threat on the boat. “Everyone is quiet. Which is the woooorst. It’s scary when a group of people all know instinctively not to joke around. Another voice comes over the PA, repeating, “Please, remain calm. Please proceed to your muster stations.” The German half of me is thinking, “Shove the old people out of the way. Shove the old and the infirm! If they are strong enough to resist you, they deserve to live.”The book was not entirely humor. She seemed to have a few axes to grind, too (many of which involved the difficulties of women climbing the ranks). More often than not, though, she’d end her more serious segments with something funny.“My dream for the future is that sketch comedy shows become a gender-blind meritocracy of whoever is really the funniest. You might see four women and two men. You might see five men and a YouTube video of a kitten sneezing.”There’s plenty more where that came from. Read it and see. Better yet, listen and hear.

This memoir is filled with anecdotes from his childhood spent fixing radios, his experiences as a young man doing bomb research at Los Alamos up through his days as a renowned professor at Cal Tech. The central theme was always that this is one smart cookie. It was interesting to pick up on his thought processes. It probably didn’t feature as much pure science as most of his other books, but at least you could appreciate his intuition into the physical world’s biggest puzzles. Rather than emphasizing the technical details of physics, most of his stories were focused on his other interests and his geeky humor.While some of the stories were entertaining, and the lumens of candle power abounded, it didn’t always work for me. I kept getting the feeling that had the same stories been told in the third person, they would have been better – less egotistical sounding. In every one of his sidelines, he was masterful. It was like he was still driving home the point of how brilliant he was even when he was slumming it. After a while, I got tired of hearing how he became fluent in Portuguese when he taught in Brazil, or impressed the locals to no end with his distinctive style of bongo playing, or could dance like a professional, or got just about any woman he wanted to sleep with him. It was this last one that left the worst taste in my mouth. Some of his tales of attraction and conquest occurred when one of his wives was on her death bed. He was probably not as bad as I’ve made him sound. Like I said, we can certainly appreciate his intellect. He had a rare ability to explain difficult concepts in laymen’s terms, too. I got a confirmation of this a week after I finished the book when we were interviewing a former student of his from Cal Tech. He mentioned the “Feynman Effect”: a phenomenon whereby someone asking him a question got answered in such a clear and intuitive way that it was only later that they realized they still didn’t know exactly how it all tied to their existing understanding.So, count me as a fan of his scientific contributions and his ability to communicate, but not of his swagger. If it had all been a bit of a joke (you know, physicist … funny hair … limited social skills … but a would-be Lothario in spite of it), I would have laughed along with him, but I don’t think that was his intention. ...more",Notes are private!,2,63,1,not set,not set,"Nov 30, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5544.Surely_You_re_Joking_Mr_Feynman_

He had no formal education in either fiction or the classics, but had an abiding interest in The Odyssey since his early teenage years. When he finally completed this book after plugging away on it for years, he got zero interest from publishers or agents. Then he won a young writers’ competition and suddenly became a star. I noticed in his bio that he’s now teaching at Oxford – the one in England, no less. My own transformation was more limited. It wasn’t that I disliked it; it’s more that I didn’t have much of a starting point to transform myself away from. I don’t think O Brother Where Art Thou counts as a very thorough grounding. But even without Homer as a springboard, I could tell that this was a very clever re-imagining of the classic travel adventure. It was confusing at first since the order was all scattered and the stories sometimes contradicted one another. (For instance, the various accounts of Penelope’s actions during his absence ran the gamut fidelity-wise.) But it was evidently very much in the spirit of the tales that had been told aloud for generations prior to Homer converting them to poetry and committing them to papyrus.  I liked Mason’s tone. His Odysseus was a man of many faces – often, but not always, brave, honorable, witty and wise. The mixture was inconsistent, but that was alright. This underscores how a legend like The Odyssey coalesced from many different sources. Variations would be expected as a consequence of repeated retelling and different takes on human/god behavior. Mason’s contributions reminded me of I’m Not There, the movie that was described as ruminations on Bob Dylan. The six character portrayals it featured were not meant to be of Dylan himself, but to embody different aspects of his music and life. Each of Mason’s 44 mini-chapters were inspired by the original, but were riffs he could call his own. Characters like Penelope, Telemachus, Achilles, Calypso, Agamemnon, Helen, the Cyclops and the sirens were also given their due. My favorite vignettes were the ones where Odysseus outwits some adversary. I also enjoyed it when some seemingly more modern insight into the way of folks was put to us in a distant historical context. A smart guy like Mason had plenty of those moments. For that matter, Homer probably did, too. I imagine this is a great book for Homerphiles. It was even pretty good for a sham scholar like me.

Well, I’ve got a new one that ought to exist if it doesn’t already. It’s schadenselbstungeduld, which translates roughly to “the sadness of your own impatience.” Maybe you can guess why I’m bringing this up. I’ve had a bad case of it since last month when I joined the ranks of several Goodreads friends who have read all five of the David Mitchell books. We’re now waiting long days, weeks, or, heaven forfend, even months for him to give us our next fix.As a last high from the current stash, number9dream was a good one. And the ending, about which my keyboard remains silent, made me want more – no, in fact, more than that – more to the 9th power. The main character, Eiji, is a young man with problems. Parental abandonment is certainly part of it. A separate tragedy from his boyhood is always at the fore as well. He goes to Tokyo to resolve what he can, but he’s not all that practical. In fact, his daydreams and fantasies often get in the way. They’re a useful device for Mitchell, though, since they give his creative juices a chance to flow (if not gush) freely. As for Eiji’s real life, it’s a multifarious journey. His destination is sometimes diffuse, but seems to include acceptance of his situation, love, a sense of self, and whatever else coming of age stories are meant to bring. Along the way he meets some interesting people, drawn in Mitchell’s customary way to a full human scale. Eiji also meets a few scum-of-the-earth types from warring yakuza gangs. The plot features plenty of action, some that seems as crazy as Eiji’s dreams. (At one point it struck me as funny that it mattered so much to me to know if a scene was a made-up dream when, in fact, a work of fiction is itself made up. But you see where I was coming from – I wanted to know what was what for the integrity of the story (as opposed to the story within the story, nested like these parentheses.)) The only points I took off for in this otherwise excellent book were for a few heinous crime sequences that I felt were over-the-top. I almost got the sense that Mitchell didn’t feel the reality of them either (within the story, that is) since Eiji didn’t seem as affected by them as a real, sentient person probably would be. The pyrotechnics are something I think Mitchell has always been drawn to, and he seems to have learned since how to modulate his use of them. Cloud Atlas, his next book after this one, provides all the evidence you need of his ultimate mastery. Back to number9dream and its many positives:-- The little narrative devices worked – lots of perspectives and styles including cyberpunk, crime drama (boiled good and hard), fantasy (a kid’s story within the story about a goat who would sometimes unwittingly eat the pages he wrote), and military history (a moving tale in epistolary form of a suicide mission in WWII).-- Eiji is a very likable character. You’re happy for every small victory and anxious with every new threat.-- The young lady he likes, the waitress with the beautiful neck and sublime musical talent, is wise beyond her years. She’s given some thought-provoking lines.-- Those of us who are big DM fans have always liked the way he writes. He has fun, he chooses his words well, and he’s very creative with both structure and concept. That’s all in evidence here.-- People tell me that after DM, HM (Murakami) should be next. Is The Wind-up Bird Chronicle a good choice?I’ll end this with a personal note to David since he seems likely to respond to the pleas of his devoted fans. Will you please hurry up with that next one?!

His defining affections are football (the English kind), rock music, and pub culture. At the same time, he reads lots of books – and some of them are serious. Maybe such a subspecies is less rare in England, but where I’m from they’re scarce. Of course, as a writer it’s not so surprising that he’s a reader, too. It’s the kind of books he reads, though, and his criterion for choosing them that makes Polysyllabic Spree worthwhile to read. It’s a short compilation of columns he wrote for Dave Eggers’ magazine The Believer where he discussed his monthly book purchases and gave short s of the ones he actually read (with the former list always longer than the latter). He also included a few excerpts, among them works by Dickens, Chekhov and Patrick Hamilton.Hornby’s well-stropped wit, where the jokes are often at his own expense, complements his entertaining take on things from the Every Man point of view. Joe Sixpack was the old appellation around these parts, but I’m not sure what the English equivalent might be – something involving pints and pies I would guess. Anyway, he’s not the type to be taken in by anything pretentious and “littrary” . At the same time, he can enjoy good writing; even classics and critically acclaimed stuff. Maybe I’m making too much of this, but if his other interests really do seem at odds with his taste for the writerly arts, the apparent anomalies somehow make his declarations more affecting. Maybe it’s like the extra attention you might pay to a hipster extolling the virtues of one Jane Austen novel over another, or a guy in a hoodie holding court on which cozy mysteries are best. A fresh perspective can be good, especially from a fish who cares enough to come out of the water to give it. Beyond that, Hornby himself writes very well. Despite his incongruities (or maybe because of them), to my mind he’s credible.

It doesn’t always play the notes our melody-trained minds might expect; it plays better ones instead. It’s writing about jazz. It’s writing as jazz. Beyond that, I can’t think of a better way to describe Dyer’s purpose than to lift large chunks of his preface.When I began writing this book I was unsure of the form it should take. This was a great advantage since it meant I had to improvise and so, from the start, the writing was animated by the defining characteristic of its subject. Before long I found I had moved away from anything like conventional criticism. The metaphors and similes on which I relied to evoke what I thought was happening in the music came to seem increasingly inadequate. Moreover, since even the briefest simile introduces a hint of the fictive, it wasn't long before these metaphors were expanding themselves into episodes and scenes. As I invented dialogue and action, what was emerging came more and more to resemble fiction. At the same time, though, these scenes were still intended as commentary either on a piece of music or on the particular qualities of a musician. What follows, then, is as much imaginative criticism as fiction.  Many scenes have their origin in well-known or even legendary episodes: Chet Baker getting his teeth knocked out, for example. These episodes are part of a common repertory of anecdote and information -- “standards,” in other words, and I do my own versions of them, stating the identifying facts more or less briefly and then improvising around them, departing from them completely in some cases. This may mean being less than faithful to the truth but, once again, it keeps faith with the improvisational prerogatives of the form. Some episodes do not have their origins in fact: these wholly invented scenes can be seen as original compositions). […] Throughout, my purpose was to present the musicians not as they were but as they appear to me.Then he does precisely that. Beautifully. There’s a fair amount of the black experience that folds into the telling of jazz. Despite being a white guy from England, Dyer’s treatment sure seemed plausible to me. There was often a feeling of otherworldliness to it, too, like the lens was a little out of focus and the lighting was dim. The music he described was all the more vivid in contrast. Both the subject matter and Dyer’s writing itself offered glimpses – no, more like long, appreciative gazes – into the creative process.While it’s true to say that you can appreciate this book without having much interest in jazz, it’s a bonus if you do. I enjoyed playing Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, and Keith Jarrett while I read it. For all I know, the experience may have been enhanced by smoking, drinking, and shooting up, too, but I stopped short of that.

Nicholas Morath is the perfect archetype. Of course, the background and circumstances of a Furst hero can vary. Morath was an ex-pat from Hungary residing in Paris right before WWII. He was living life well working as an ad executive and seeing an attractive Argentine heiress. As the big conflict approached, though, a prominent uncle, Count Polyani, asked him to attend to a few wrinkly affairs of state. These projects grew increasingly urgent when Hitler’s designs on Eastern Europe became obvious and fascism threatened their homeland. As a former war hero with a talent for espionage, Morath was well-equipped for these activities, but it hurt him to know that the good life would soon be a thing of the past.

Like the others who failed, he was not Lewis-like enough to carry the narrative. On the plus side, I give Das credit for his clear explanations of the many derivative products that are out there today. Let’s award points, too, for his title, even though the book couldn’t quite live up to the humor it was meant to project. As for the shortcomings, the worst, I thought, was the short shrift he gave to the more human elements. Lewis can get you involved with the people – smart or naïve, honest or corrupt, successful or beaten to a pulp. You want to know what happens to them in the unfolding story. Your understanding is helped by the fact that whole messy business has been personalized. With Das, it’s more just a laundry list of the financial products and recycled press accounts of famous meltdowns. Whenever he does involve people, they’re either fictitious stick figures or categories of investment subspecies lumped together a little too conveniently into bins of disrepute. I’m sure he has a point when he says many of today’s financial instruments can postpone tax bills, shift risks to less savvy clients, and obfuscate product deliverables, but in my mind he overplayed his cynicism and lost credibility in the process. Not all M&A activity is cannibalism, not all derivatives were created to dupe someone, and not all people in the industry are crooked.

He rattled off a few titles then ended his list with “anything by Jess Walter.” I can see why. Walter is funny, writes as though it’s an easy thing to do, reveals what we recognize as true human nature, and creates characters who aren’t perfect, but you find yourself pulling for anyway. In other words, he’s a lot like Russo. This particular one may not reach the same heights as Citizen Vince (the best of the four Walter books I’ve now read), but it’s still entertaining. On the face of it, the plot might seem silly. Matt Prior quit his job with the newspaper to launch a website devoted to financial news and commentary presented entirely in blank verse. In the meantime, his beautiful but perhaps less than faithful wife developed an eBay addiction. Their financial situation was understandably dire. The story begins at a 7-Eleven where Matt falls in with a pack of dope-smoking slackers. His schemes for getting back on track seem to have been influenced by the new, pharmacologically advanced pot that he sampled. Trouble ensues, along with a dark and sarcastic form of hilarity. The Financial Lives of the Poets is well worth the small investment in time. And there’s plenty of great dialog to make it livelier still. My only criticism is that it seemed almost too easy. When a track star runs the mile, we’d be disappointed if he’s not breathing hard, even if he finishes below 4 minutes. Walter said in an interview at the end of the book that it took him a very short while (not more than a few months) to put this one together. Be that as it may, I contend that the hastily constructed ramblings by a talented guy like Walter are far better than the ponderous works by the multitudes of lesser lights....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Sep 15, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7857552-the-financial-lives-of-the-poets

Pomo, writerly, and long: those were my only preconceptions. Now I can at least pretend to see what the fuss is about. The book starts with a resounding shot, as in the one “Heard Round the World” – a phenomenal account of the 1951 playoff game where the Giants took the pennant from the Dodgers thanks to Bobby Thompson’s dramatic bottom-of-the-ninth home run. Baseball lends itself well to good writing, it seems. For example, you might appreciate an author who describes warm-up pitches that “crack into the catcher’s mitt, a series of reports that carry a comet’s tail of secondary sound.” I started out afraid that DeLillo’s style would venture into some sort of overwrought, near rococo extreme, but the language actually kinda grew on me (which, for an 800+ page book is a good thing).After the game, the story moves ahead 40 years where we learn about Nick Shay, a boyhood Dodgers fan who at that point owned the famous home run ball. It had taken a circuitous route from its ricochet off a bleacher seat into the quick hands of a hooky-playing, gate-hopping kid named Cotter and then to various collectors along the way, each with a story to tell. But the ball was just a narrative device. The real focus was on threats posed by the Cold War and the detritus of our nuclear age. There were quite a few characters featured; Lenny Bruce and J. Edgar Hoover among them. The primary fictional ones included Nick (mentioned above), a man with a secret who worked for a huge waste removal company; his little brother, a former chess prodigy, who did research in nuclear physics for the Defense Department; and Nick’s former lover who today would be labeled a cougar. She was an artist who led a huge project to paint B-52’s retired to the desert. The various stories were then told in reverse chronological order dating back to the early 50’s. An epilogue set years later then wrapped things up and settled a few of the conflicts. DeLillo structured it all very cleverly. Connections beneath the surface were consistent with the whole “underworld” motif, as were the possibilities that things buried long ago could resurface again (like nuclear waste, for instance). The strands that tied together reminded me of Colum McCann’s Let the Great World Spin, especially the parts in New York with the graffiti art, the haves and have-nots, and the multicultural crosscurrents. I then saw that a couple of the blurbs for this later work mentioned a debt of gratitude to Underworld for paving the way.While this book provided a decent return on my investment in time, I can’t go to the extreme that certain professional ers have with their “Great American Novel” talk. The shortcoming for me was the hollowness of the characters. Even Nick, who got first person narrative privileges, just wasn’t all that human at the core. Maybe other DeLillo works aren’t so fixated on big themes or the writers’ craft, and he concentrates more of his effort on vivifying the people within them. For all the praise he gets, I hope that’s the case....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,not set,"Sep 13, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/399.Underworld

For me it took the form of extra reading time walking the sidewalks from the train to the office. I noticed I was given a wide berth when people saw the size of the prow coming their way. With such preoccupation you might imagine I was lost in the story, but it was more like getting lost in thoughts about the author himself. He and his sprawling intellect loomed large on every page, as did his full frontal honesty, his playfulness, his complexity, and yes, his clinical depression. I suspect everyone reading this already knows the David Foster Wallace story: genius writer, gifted teacher, empathetic friend and all-around cool guy couldn’t get his brain chemistry right after rejiggering his meds and that meant the end of him. Like many others who finally tackle IJ, I had already read many of Wallace’s essays, interviews, and speeches. I even read Lipsky’s extended interview that became a book. So it was all too easy to read IJ with what I already knew about the man firmly in mind. Not losing myself in the story is far from a criticism. I mention it only because a Wallace-centric lens may make my take on the book less about the tangibles and more about what might have made him tick. If you’re like me, you find glimpses into real genius, tortured or otherwise, pretty fascinating.The best puzzles are those that make you struggle, but not so much that you can’t solve them in the end. With the challenge Wallace set out for us, he wants us to think hard, knowing that that can be a reward in itself. In interviews, he said he never intended to be ambiguous. He wanted us to understand despite the inherent difficulties. I would guess most readers come away feeling like the heavy mental lifting paid off, but they may also have a sneaking suspicion that there was even more that a complicated guy like Wallace was trying to say that may not have come through right away. Maybe that’s why smart people seem to get so much out of the experience and fans often reread it. It’s because it’s a challenge. [Note to self: Don’t even think about picking this up again until your head is good and rested.]Summary, Structure, Themes and the LikeOne thing that struck me was that Wallace took the old write-what-you-know advice to heart. He featured tennis, addiction, philosophy, and social commentary. At the same time, he seemed to thumb his nose at certain writerly conventions. He often had very long sentences, paragraphs that would last for pages, and vocabulary words that even the most pedantic litterateurs would agree are excessive. And what about those discursive authorial intrusions – the endnotes – damn near 100 pages of them? It makes me wonder if Wallace was saying to the establishment, “It’s against the rules, but I can make it work.” I’ll give an abbreviated plot summary since this is already feeling long. Besides, there are plenty of other s that set the stage well, including one by my astute friend Robert. There are three main stories. One is set at an elite junior tennis academy in Boston founded by James O. Incandenza who had formerly been a very good player himself, a brilliant scientist, and a somewhat misunderstood film maker. His wife, Avril, is French Canadian, obsessive-compulsive, teaches grammar at the academy, and is still “endocrinologically compelling to males.” Their sons Orin, Mario and Hal are all extreme in their own ways. Orin is a born ladies man and now a punter in the NFL, Mario is a remarkably well-adjusted guy for one with a whole host of physical deformities and challenges, and Hal (who is probably the most like Wallace himself) is precocious beyond belief with his verbal acumen, having memorized large sections of the Oxford English Dictionary. Hal is a high-ranked player and very focused, but his talents seem programmed. Any joie de vivre, or feeling of any kind, for that matter, seems squelched. This is not completely at odds with his status as a striver.  A few klicks away from the Academy is Ennet House, a residence that runs a drug and alcohol recovery program. There we meet, among others, big Don Gately, a former thief and Demerol addict. He’s a counselor now, with a mostly good heart. The AA Kool-Aid may not always taste great, but he knows that it’s good for what ails him. When it comes to selling it to others, he’s all the more credible for his doubts. Joelle Van Dyne is another resident. She is one of the story connectors since she was once Orin’s girlfriend and had been the lead in several J.O. Incandenza films. She’s notable, too, for the veil she wears to hide her face. We’re left to wonder whether it’s to conceal a disfiguring scar or, as she once intimated, because too many men fall crazy in love once they see how flawlessly beautiful her face is.The third story centers around an extremist group of Quebecois separatists called Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents (Wheelchair Assassins). They formed after the US convinced Canada and Mexico to join them in becoming the Organization of North American Nations (ONAN). (Robert’s right, referring to someone who comes from this union as an Onanist has to have been a fun joke for a word guy like Wallace.) Secession is their goal. Their weapon of choice is an odd one: a film called Infinite Jest by one J.O. Incandenza. It features Joelle Van Dyne and somehow enthralls viewers so completely that they cease to want anything else and ultimately die. It’s like rats that can’t stop pressing the pleasure bar. If the assassins can get their hands on the master copy, they can reproduce it, and bring those weak-willed pleasure seekers in the States to their knees. Will they find the original? This is the plot’s primary engine. I’m afraid I don’t do it justice, though, with my description. The other big question concerns how, in the beginning of the book, in a kind of flash forward, the lexically brilliant Hal had lost his ability to communicate. And there were questions about Don, too, as he dealt with terrible pain in his hospital bed after standing in harm’s way on behalf of one of the Ennet House residents. Will he succumb to the lure of those wonderful, addictive painkillers? Lots of other people have problems to resolve, too.Wallace once said in an interview that the structure for IJ was motivated by something called a Sierpinski triangle. Leave it to a guy like him to use a fractal design from chaos theory for such purposes. I can kind of see it, though. You start with an equilateral triangle – a side for each of his main stories. You then imbed another equilateral triangle within the original, leaving three scaled-down triangles around it. Each of those can represent a further excavation, delving deeper into the three stories. Then, each of those smaller triangles can be subdivided yet again meaning even deeper drilling. I wonder if the fact that these subdivisions can keep going ad infinitum means something about an ultimate lack of resolution. But then maybe the patterns that are set in place in the story are supposed to be enough. We’re meant to extrapolate what’s needed in order to understand. It’s easy to draw parallels, too, between the structure and the penetrating nature of Wallace’s thought processes.While the plot is a bit of a puzzle, the themes are not. It’s pretty clear what topics Wallace wanted to address. He had a lot to say about addiction (some of the best pages were about the craving, the guilt, the deal-making with oneself, and the feedback loop with depression), perfectionism (in athletics, grammar, obsessive behaviors, and even the perfect pleasure), entertainment (films, sports, recreational drug use), family relations (not always pretty, almost always poignant), and anhedonia (depression’s little brother, and something Wallace seemed to know a lot about). Here’s an IJ snippet intensifying the last theme: “dead-eyed anhedonia is but a remora on the ventral flank of the true predator, the Great White Shark of pain…the person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise…It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames.” Sounds terrible; all the more for its plausibility.One of the most interesting themes, though, and one literary taxonomists and critics were quick to pick up on was Wallace’s point about the “popular delusion that cynicism and naïveté are mutually exclusive.” It’s for statements like this that many have labeled IJ post-postmodern, where cold detachment gives way to earnest empathy. Related to this, someone interviewing Wallace’s wife, Karen Green, asked her if she thought the best of him made it into his writing. She said:""I guess it depends how you define best, but in my opinion, no. The writer's voice took on a life of its own, which I think he found very constraining. I think part of what he was struggling with was how to change that voice. Cleverness, particularly for someone as clever as David, is the hardest thing to give up. It's like being naked, or getting married as opposed to having one-night stands. People don't want to be thought of as sentimental. Writers don't anyway.""Green and Wallace used to have a long-running jokey argument along these lines, about whether Wallace should allow his ""inner sap"" into his prose. ""I thought the inner sap should be allowed out sometimes,"" she recalls. ""It was quite a wonderful thing. I'd argue that sometimes when a piece of writing, or a piece of artwork is too clever it loses that ability to connect. David was obviously trying some of that, and it's those bits of the book I loved the most.”Then there is what Wallace himself said on the topic within the IJ text:“We are shown how to fashion masks of ennui and jaded irony at a young age where the face is fictile enough to assume the shape of whatever it wears. And then it’s stuck there, the weary cynicism that saves us from gooey sentiment and unsophisticated naïveté…the last true terrible sin in the theology of millennial America…that what passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really some kind of fear of being really human, since to be really human (at least as he conceptualizes it) is probably to be unavoidably sentimental and naive and goo-prone and generally pathetic, is to be in some basic interior way forever infantile, some sort of not-quite-right-looking infant dragging itself anaclittically around the map, with big wet eyes and froggy-soft skin, huge skull, gooey drool. One of the really American things about Hal, probably, is the way he despises what it is he’s really lonely for; this hideous internal self, incontinent of sentiment and need, that pules and writhes just under the hip empty mask, anhedonia.” A blogger and fellow fan of those passages said, “This is why I read Infinite Jest. Not for this statement, though I believe it is the key to the post-postmodern literature we’re all alive and lucky enough to watch take shape. But because it took Wallace 700 pages to get the reader to a place where she could hear this. Read it without a sarcastic roll of the eyes.”When a guy who is as naturally hip and cool as Wallace was opines about the dangers of a culture where hip and cool irony is all the rage, you pay more attention. Hits us where we live, doesn’t it?A Helpful “How to”The book has a certain cult appeal. There are classes, books, and sites dedicated to it. Something that really helped me get through it was a site called Infinite Summer. Back in 2009 someone had the idea to divide the book into 75 page chunks that readers would get through each week and then tune into the site for panel discussions, summaries, and comments (without spoilers). It’s all archived so you can follow along even though you can’t actively participate. I liked their link to a special IJ dictionary which, trust me, comes in handy. Admit it, you might not know one or two of the following: Samizdat, fulvous, teratogenic, halation, and Csikzentmihalyi. And that's just a random sample from pages 93-98. I found, too, that even when I thought I was reading carefully, someone will have commented on something I hadn’t picked up on or asked a good question, and this helped me appreciate it all that much more.  Stray BulletsI’ve got just a few more points to make, but lack both the smarts and the energy to structure them well, especially if fractal geometry is required. So bullets will have to do.-	This was a funny book in places, especially the language, but Wallace’s stated goal was to write something sad.-	A disproportionate number of characters sounded clever and/or professorial – even some of the young tennis players.-	Many if not most of the characters had extreme physical characteristics. Avril was 197 cm tall, which, when you do the conversion, is 6’6”. Husband James was half a head taller than that. Gately was a huge football player who even in his early teens was well over 200 lbs. and ran a 4.4 40 – NFL receiver type speed. Conjoined twins played as a doubles team at the tennis academy. Another player, one who tried to seduce Mario, weighed over 400 pounds. We often suspend disbelief while wondering what Wallace was trying to say about this. Could the physical and intellectual extremes say something about the way he viewed fictional constructs, or himself?-	Is there a relative to LOL when a section is so good, so insightful, so well put you want to announce it to the world? If so, IJ earned a few. And I’m more discriminating than most with my OL sentiments. -	An Infinite Summer commenter mentioned the famous Jerry Garcia line that summarized the Dead Head phenomenon. It’s like black licorice, he said. Not everyone likes the stuff, but those who do REALLY do. Jest Heads (if I’m allowed a neologism in Wallace’s own tradition) seem much the same.-	At the same time, IJ could also be likened to drinking from a fire hose. Actually, that’s such a worn out expression. Plus, it wrongly implies you get nada to slake your thirst. I invite commenters to come up with something better. Reading IJ is like _____.I’m not the first person to point out that s often aspire to the work being ed, at least in format and style. Well, I think I got the length part right.* For those of you who’ve never tried black licorice and are open to different things, at least take a bite. Forswear anhedonia.

While he’s always been considered an immensely skilled writer and a superb storytellerI was happy to see Mitchell try his hand at historical fiction. While he’s always been considered an immensely skilled writer and a superb storyteller, it's his inventive structuring that seems to bring forth the highest praise. Read Cloud Atlas to see if you agree. With this most recent work, as he said in a post-publication interview, he was trying a more straightforward narrative form – one without gewgaws (I think that was the word he used, or maybe it was “jiggery-pokery”). I’m pleased to report that he succeeded beyond all expectations, even with the ropes of convention constraining him. Jacob was an earnest young Dutchmen amongst the motley assemblage at a remote trading post on Dejima, an island near Nagasaki. The story began in 1799 at a time when Japan was a very closed society. In fact, the isolated post offered the only real exposure to the Western way of life. Unfortunately, honor was scarce on all sides of a typical Dutch East Indies Company transaction. Jacob, a junior clerk at the time, did meet some virtuous people, though. Foremost among them was a midwife named Orito Aibagawa who was studying medicine under Marinus, the highly skilled, highly evolved physician on the island. Orito was a promising student, empathetic, and attractive despite a bad burn mark on the side of her face. Young Jacob was smitten. Romance wasn’t easy, though, for reasons the reader soon discovers. Jacob had other travails, too, when he refused to falsify one of the shipping documents. He was demoted and made to report to a conniving, downright scurvy rival. Then Orito was sent away. And it sure didn’t help matters when the language and culture were so different and there were so few people he could trust.I’d rather not get too deep into the plot (though it’s a worthy one) and instead focus on the book’s other qualities. I’m convinced that David Mitchell is incapable of committing a bad sentence to paper. He’s also very good with character development as we see with Jacob, Orito, and various translators, magistrates, and seafarers. And that rare storytelling ability I mentioned, it takes the action well beyond the island. He leads us up a mountain to a nunnery harboring secrets and to treacherous parts of the Japanese shogunate.I was already a big Mitchell fan so it was interesting to me to see the contrasts with his earlier works. One thing that was different was the immense amount of research involved in putting a book like this together. In fact, there is a section at the end where Mitchell appends a short essay on the topic of historical fiction. He said he’d tried earlier to apply the antiquated language of the times, making “extensive word lists to incorporate into [his] text—and ended up with Blackadder.” He also mentioned the danger in showing off his recently acquired scholarship at the expense of narrative flow. Even so, one criticism of the book was that he may have gone a little too far with his descriptive passages. Once the story gained momentum, though, that was no longer an issue. I wanted to give this the full five stars, but in the end couldn’t quite do it. My problem was with Jacob. He seemed a tad too forthright, at times, with a lack of people smarts. We admire his integrity and hard work, but can’t always see his human aspect. Maybe it’s just that I’m so used to really liking (or at least understanding the frailties of) Mitchell’s main characters and had been hoping to do so again. Overall, though, this was a great reading experience. And my view of Mitchell himself is still as high as any cloud in the sky, mapped or otherwise....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,not set,"Aug 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7141642-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet

His best move was when he recruited four young guys from the local orphanage, before they were old enough to shave, to be errand boys. These young bucks were eager, loyal assistants that somebody dubbed Motherless Brooklyn. Frank treated them to bigger boy delights like twenty dollar bills and bottles of beer for their efforts, and they just stayed on staff as they got older and more useful. They were not typically involved in anything all that bad, but an element of shadiness did exist – under-the-table, dark-alley, undercover kind of stuff.The most memorable character from a cast chock full of them was Lionel Essrog. He was the biggest and lumpiest of Frank’s boys. Beyond Lionel’s bruiser/enforcer looks was the fact that he had Tourette’s. He always made Frank laugh with his verbal tics and twitchiness. It’s gratifying to find, though, that Lionel is not entirely defined by his condition. He had a hale and hearty interior life just below the surface.As the fast-paced storyline develops, Lionel and a colleague witness a terrible, unexplained act perpetrated against Frank. Each of the boys, now Minna “Men”, reacts in a different way, mostly grabbing for power and prestige while trying to appear helpful. Lionel is the one most willing and able to actually figure things out. He proves to be surprisingly effective at gathering information and piecing together clues, all the while navigating his way through the Tourettic minefield. The inner workings of the guy’s mind were fascinating to see. This is one of those books that arbiters of such things would call a genre buster. It certainly works as a mystery/action/crime/thriller. But it has legitimate lit cred, too. It won some national book critics’ award, after all. I liked the mix, but then I’m the kind of guy who’d have no trouble washing a deep-dish pizza down with a fine Barolo wine.Something else a real er would say, I’m sure, is that the place is a character, too. Lethem did a great job of bringing Brooklyn alive. Maybe he was helped by the fact that we’ve seen so much of urban jungle life in movies, but I had a clear picture in my head of the surroundings each step of the way. All in all, it’s a fast and enjoyable read, with a different kind of protagonist to pull for.

Of courThe Major was a throwback to a time when honor, duty, and respect for tradition were traits to which a well-bred Englishman naturally aspired. Of course, in modern times this mindset can lead to conflict. The Major’s son, in a contrast meant to exemplify the contemporary, fell short in just about every way. He was as self-centered as they come – a deal-making businessman – greedy, inconsiderate, and shallow. It was easy to choose sides when it came to their disagreements. Even today’s more refined society people were a source of consternation for the Major. Fortunately for him, he discovered a kindred spirit, one cut from the same fine, worsted cloth. This woman, Mrs. Ali, was kind, intelligent, and despite being Pakistani, big on British traditions. Her heritage was one of the conflicts the Major had to confront, more in the eyes of his clubby associates, those guardians of class (and light-complected) prerogative, than from his own personal feelings. Our man the Major had other issues, as well, among them: spotty health, a local real estate development plan that would invite the wrong kind of commercial interests, and some pretty nasty cultural rifts poorly concealed by a very gauzy veil. Then there was the sticky situation over claims to a valuable gun from his recently deceased brother’s estate that was part of a pair that their father had split between them and wanted to keep as a set within the family. The plot served its purpose well as it revealed a lot about the characters. Mrs. Ali and the Major are worth getting to know.

Since I’ve never read anything like it, I don’t quite know how to compare it. If pressed, though, I’d say it’s like James Joyce for the lilt, Camus for the angst, and Lewis Carroll for the false logic. The most enjoyable parts for me were from the realm of pseudo-science. The principal character and narrator, who never gave his name, met a group of policemen down in what amounted to Alice’s rabbit hole. One of the officers was a master craftsman of infinitesimals. For instance, he had a lance with such a sharp point that you could feel it stick you before you could see it touch your skin. In another fun distortion of science, the policeman gets us all to agree that the image you see in the mirror is an ever-so-slightly younger version of yourself given travel times of light. Therefore, if you have a mirror reflecting an opposite mirror which itself has an image of the first mirror, and the mutual reflections continue on and on, you can see arbitrarily far back in time. The temptation in ing this story is to give away the same spoiler that the egghead/bonehead who wrote the introduction did. I would urge you to either skip the intro to this edition, or read it afterwards. I’ll mention a somewhat smaller spoiler instead.

Doctorow figured out a great formula for historical fiction. He takes real life iconic figures from whatever era he’s covering and has them interact in believable ways with his fictional characters. It makes for a “show, don’t tell” scenario that brings history alive. With Ragtime, we get to peek inside the heads of Houdini, Freud, J.P. Morgan, Emma Goldman, Henry Ford and others. In the process, we learn the issues of the day and get an authentic feel for the setting. We can appreciate the context and connections that animate his stories. Ragtime is set in the decade leading up to WWI. There was a lot going on in those days, especially in a place like New York. It was a period of social unrest, brought on, no doubt, by the great divide between the haves and the have-nots. An upper middle-class family in New Rochelle was one focal point of the book, and a Jewish immigrant and his young daughter were another. Their changing fortunes were charted in revealing ways. A ragtime pianist also featured prominently – as articulate and clean as a President (sorry, Joe Biden has always seemed blunderously funny to me) until racist stupidity on the part of a fire chief pushed his buttons. Doctorow, as usual, weaved the stories together well. He was long on conflict, too, which kept the pages turning.World’s Fair and Billy Bathgate were very good in a similar way, that is, in mixing real people and events with those of his own creation. At the same time, I’ve also noticed some common threads that have begun to put me off just a tad. For one, the men and even the young boys are often – how should I put it – carnally preoccupied. (Some might say it’s almost to the extreme of actuality.) Another repeated theme seems to be how much more fully evolved the Jewish soul is compared to the Gentile one. Again, some may say it’s a representative depiction of the true demographic, but it seems a little too overt when virtually all the Jews are wise (both in the book sense and the street sense), morally superior, and rife with character for having been so downtrodden. Doctorow grew up in the Bronx, of Russian Jewish parentage, so I suppose he comes by any biases honestly. It’s not like any of that particularly bothered me. It was just something I noticed. What seemed more provocative, though, was the favorable light he seemed to shine on the anarchists he profiled. Anytime killing people is part of your agenda, I like to believe you’re inviting an “Extremist” label to your cause, but I didn’t get the feeling from the book that E.L. agreed.I’m still a big Doctorow fan, but I don’t necessarily look to him as a guide across history’s rockier political landscapes.

This was MitchellWith Ghostwritten you catch glimpses and sometimes even longer scenes of the feature-length greatness that’s to come in Cloud Atlas. This was Mitchell’s publishing debut. As may be true of many first works, he could barely contain all that he wanted to say. It was chock full of people, places and ideas. He gave himself nine very different vehicles for addressing the question of why things happen as they do. The settings of the nine stories span Asia, Europe, and the US. Good, bad, young, old, East, West – it’s all there, with different tones for each. They connect often in incidental ways. For instance, events in story A are probably not crucial antecedents in story B. But the links can be entertaining in the same way that recognizing characters Mitchell reused in his other novels can be. Seeing the likes of Neal Brose, Luisa Rey, and Timothy Cavendish, who reappear in later books in different phases of their lives, can be fun. It’s like when you watch Mystic Pizza years after it was filmed, and see Matt Damon in a minor role as the kid brother of the spoiled, rich guy. Anyway, these connections, and all connections, could be mere happenstance. Or they could be fate. Then ask yourself this: Is everything determined by sets of causal inputs? Is there a role for free will? Is choice an illusion? What are the drivers within the system, the control variates, the precipitants? What part is played by love, greed, altruism, or self-interest? Mitchell’s answers to these questions were sometimes oblique, but he deserves full credit for raising them.Getting back to structure – the focus of many s – Mitchell’s hallmark inventiveness was in early evidence here. To be honest, though, I didn’t think the pieces were stitched together quite as effectively in this one as in Cloud Atlas. Still, there were signs of the mastery to come. He switched voices well, clearly recognized the importance of good storytelling, and only occasionally dragged when describing the many people and places. I thought the stories set in Tokyo and London were especially well done. Other characters were appealing, too, or if not that, at least interesting. The common thread of the parts I enjoyed most was that they were told without devices, in a straightforward, true-to-life kind of way. I felt in other parts of the book that the then less mature Mitchell relied too much on transmigrating spirits, sci-fi AI constructs, and other phenomena not of this world. The supernatural entities helped tie things together, but for my taste they took more away in cogency than they added in creativity. He was also more convincing with the nobler traits. The young sax player in love was so much better drawn than the terrorist who was brainwashed. Thank you, David, for that.I’ll sum up my experience reading this with a reference to Keith Jarrett. He’s the pianist that the young jazz buff in the Tokyo chapter appreciated for his improvisational skills. Jarrett will occasionally throw in little vocalized drones during his solos that can be a distraction. Despite this, you often get some of the best original work ever. And he just makes it all up.

[Citizen Vince (see ) does even more so.] He’s never slow, he adds insights without overdoing it, his dialogue is bang on, and his plots keep Kindle screens refreshing incessantly. I like his style, too – kind of edgy, but with a genuine regard for his characters. If you were to shoehorn this one into a category, I guess it would be a police procedural, but in no way do you need to be a fan of the genre to enjoy it. Clark Mason was found high up on the ledge of an abandoned hotel with too much on his mind. He’s in need of some grooming, and he’s wearing an eye patch, but police detective Caroline Mabry is oddly attracted – this despite being pegged as a “loon” in her diacritical taxonomy. He tells her he has something to confess. But this is not your typical kind of here’s-the-crime/here’s-how-I-did-it admission. In fact, he’s vague about what of the act was even criminal. He sells it as a story of a bad thing that happened for which his own culpability was key. To appreciate the guilt, he said, you had to understand the context. Caroline took the bait and soon became the Father confessor. It was a protracted statement that they decided he should write out himself. He fills multiple legal pads over multiple days. In the meantime, Caroline digs up what she can of Clark’s background and recent woes. It’s quite a story. And the context is important.The book has two storytellers. Clark, with his first-person account beginning in grade school, was one; and an omniscient narrator, with the focus on Caroline’s investigation, was the other. Clark’s chronological telling is where we first encounter Eli, a complete social misfit with clumsiness, smelliness, and bad skin just the tip of the iceberg in his ostracized existence. Both he and Clark suffered at the hand of the neighborhood bully, but came out of it differently. Much of the rest of the tale involves their interactions and separate fortunes. I won’t reveal anything, but I will say that both are very interesting in a real-life, human kind of way. Clark’s self-awareness allows us to empathize. The independent assessments that Caroline digs up from people who knew him at various stages round out our view. I’m going to hold back one star because it was ever so slightly clichéd and ever so slightly implausible. To the latter point, I had trouble accepting that Clark’s written output could be so comprehensive and polished all in a weekend’s time. Then again, maybe the fact that it was so good should be celebrated for the enjoyment it brings, however implausibly. The other reason I’m stingy with the extra star is that Citizen Vince, a book I liked even more, needs a one-better rating.

Olivier was Alexis in roughly the same way that Cate Blanchett was Bob Dylan. Historical fiction that’s inspired by real people, and that doesn’t even use real names, is free to make up relationships, back stories, dialogue, and events to make the narrative more interesting. In this case, that proved a somewhat elusive goal. It tended to drag at times. The premise was a good one. It began in post-Revolutionary France where young Olivier, his family, and their fortunes were on a roller coaster headed primarily down. His blood remained bleu, though. Parrot was a different story – literally. He and Olivier traded first person accounts throughout the book, and spent a fair amount of it without overlap. In contrast to his noble counterpart, Parrot was not to the manor born. Along with his itinerant father he ended up working for a printer that they later learned ran a side operation making “legal” tender. This was frowned upon in certain circles and poor Master Parrot found himself separated and made the servant of a shady one-armed Frenchman. The scene was set for adventure.After a series of filler stories (less adventurous than you might hope), the two finally joined on a boat ride to America. Parrot acted as Olivier’s secretary, scribe, and de facto servant. In the beginning they shared a mutual distrust for each other. Of course, it was easy to predict that this would not last. That said, they took their sweet time about it. And the rapprochement was never fully intact, it seemed. Maybe part of the reason for this was that neither was altogether deserving of respect; Olivier especially, I’d say. It was like the whole of their time in the states they alternated between good traits and bad ones. Tick-tock, to and fro, back and forth – it got so I didn’t care anymore how they might end up on my ledger of likability. I’ve probably made this sound too negative. There were two aspects of the book that I did like. One was seeing how, or whether, Parrot would reinvent himself in the Land of Opportunity. The rags to riches theme was a big one. The other thing I liked was Olivier’s reaction to the unadulterated democracy (and meritocracy) that he witnessed. He was astute enough to recognize the vast differences compared to the status-conscious European way of things, but was also reluctant to cede his class prerogative. He thought it was notable how everybody in America works, how land was up for grabs (even for the common folks), how a simple woodsman (Andrew Jackson) could become President, and how it was that a farmer’s youngest son could possibly hope to rise above his station. His snobbery was on full display when he talked about how provincial this new world seemed and how dangerous it was for the “tyranny of the majority” to trump those who were born to make more informed decisions in matters of style and state. Those parts of the book made me curious enough about the real de Tocqueville to read the wiki entry.

This book’s got that and more. The most important part of the ""more"" is that it’s very, very funny. It’s a satirical look at the world of books: publishing, promotion, schlock, sensationalism, selling out, and above all, literary pretension. Pete decides that writing a bestseller will be the best way to save face, and to be in-your-face, at his ex-girlfriend’s wedding. He gleans what he can from today’s popular choices, adopts a writer’s lifestyle (in Vermont, no less), and waits for the fame he’s convinced will soon come.

In feeling lukewarm, there’s a distinction to be made in how you Times I hear, “You either love him or hate him,” I often both love him and hate him. In feeling lukewarm, there’s a distinction to be made in how you got there. To find every aspect average is not the same as combining extreme likes and dislikes that tally to the same net amount. I’d rather feel strongly both ways. So here’s my highly variable assessment of Franzen and his latest.On the “like” side of the ledger, I have to give him his due for being one helluva good writer. His sentences flow, his words are well-chosen, and his observations (of which there are many) are made in an interesting way. I also liked how he alternated among his four point-of-view characters. He doesn’t half-ass it in developing them either. I noticed, too, more redeeming qualities in these people compared to the dyspeptic family in his previous would-be classic, The Corrections. At least for a while that’s what I thought. But Franzen’s tendency towards acrimony eventually plays out. Everyone has problems, nobody’s happy for long, and they lash out fiercely, often indiscriminately. In a way it was more depressing this time because for some characters, over some stretches, he actually made me care. I can handle “dark”, and sometimes even “bleak”, but for Franzen’s cast, they didn’t seem to come by it honestly. Walter and Patty, the married couple, were every bit as inconstant (and not just towards each other) as they were intelligent (or at least meant to be). Their inconsistencies didn’t ring true. If you’re in the “love him” camp, you might view this as a wonderful saga of our times. The modern day, green-conscious, gentrifying class (I believe “yuppie” is the antiquated term) is skillfully deconstructed. Generations are studied. Evolution is noted. And it is a big, sweeping book with a big, obvious theme (see title). Detractors, though, may have a point when they mention how confused the politics can seem. Son Joey might as well have worked for Halliburton, but that’s at odds with his previously avowed views and certainly with his upbringing. Walter is a conservationist, but becomes a sorely compromised one. And Patty’s family back east is from the limousine liberal school of thought, yet had a very unsupportive view when it came to a vital women’s issue (I won’t say what, but it rhymes with date crepe). You might conclude they were all a little naïve about the best and worst traits of their own chosen sides.The big theme was mentioned often and explicitly. The conclusion is easy to summarize: Freedom isn’t always a good thing. You can be given enough rope to hang yourself. This is true for individuals as well as societies, and his examples, either personal or political, were meant to show this. To be honest, I don’t see Franzen at his insightful best when it comes to this issue. Who wouldn’t agree that freedom is good up to the point it encroaches on toes? The crux of the biscuit comes in deciding where the line should be drawn. I also felt that the characters hurt by their own freedom of choice were pretty short-sighted, even borderline stupid at times. Fortunately, some were capable of learning from their mistakes. Discovering who comes around to a new way of thinking is one of the pleasures of the book because most of them needed to.I suspect the most telling critiques recognize what the literary establishment says is at stake. Is this truly an American classic? By those standards, I side with the arbiters of such things who look at the pillars of our American experience – individualism, consumerism, might as a proxy for right, and self-interest (which may teeter with self- loathing) – and distrust Franzen’s constructs to represent their abuses. I recognize buttheads in everyday life, including my own brand, but I just don’t see his type as being the real deal. It occurs to me that my  may be as inconsistent as one of Franzen’s flawed characters. I’m saying I don’t much care for the core of what he says, but that he says it very well. That gets him three and a half equivocating stars, rounded to four – well short of Great American Novel status, but worth the effort to see what all the fuss is about....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,not set,not set,"Mar 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7905092-freedom

They’re always trying to get inside characters’ heads. In the case of this particular author add the fact that he grew up as an orphan and maybe it makes sense he’s so good at depicting the mutability of self. In the three different storylines the key figures show both the ability and proclivity to change. It quickly becomes apparent (and thus does not qualify as a spoiler to mention) that identity theft is the main theme. Part of the process is reinventing a new person and another part is dispensing with the old one. Both offer drama.One of the more interesting, though not altogether convincing, elements of the book was the stark contrast between identical twin brothers.

He was a Gentile who was about as nondescript as they come. He only ever showed much color or depth when he took on a kind of quasi-Jewish persona. The two friends he hung around with in London were Jews: clever, worldly and in Julian's mind, at least, exclusionary. They had both recently lost their wives, which was a good reason to spend more time with them, for support. One of the friends, Finkler, was a contemporary and a rival of sorts. He was a successful writer, academic, pop-philosopher and TV talk show guest. The other friend, Libor, was much older, Czech-born, wise and urbane. He had at one time been a Hollywood gossip columnist. Julian wanted to join the club and saw Jewishness as his in. This is further proof of my point: even the goy was Jew-obsessed. At least this gave Jacobson a device for framing the culture from an outsider’s point-of-view, and allowed him to belabor his themes as though to the uninitiated.Parts of this were funny and parts were insightful.

The most innovative bit was a PowerPoint presentation by a young but perceptive school girl discussing family dynamics. A chapter set in the 2020’s was another spotlight on Egan’s creativity.There was not much in the way of a central plot, but there were absorbing little subplots that tied together well. It’s probably most accurate to call the book a discourse on popular culture – music and celebrity – and the act of promoting it. Relationships are a big thing, too. What’s most interesting is to view these themes from the different characters’ perspectives, with the different technologies available for connecting, and, yes, with the passage of time (both forwards and backwards). You may be pleased to hear that even though time is a goon, the tone of the book is not all that grim. Some, it seems, can live with its passage, reconcile themselves to it, and fare reasonably well.

Unfortunately, I read this one fast on the heels of David Simon’s great non-fictional account, Homicide. Just about anything would suffer in comparison with that. Simon had great character profiles, crisp language, and well-paced plots. With Price, the dialog was good and the plot was above average, but the characters weren’t as vivid. Maybe Simon’s advantage was that truth really can be stranger than fiction. He could describe interesting, quirky people he’d met in real life. Price, on the other hand, as ironic as it may sound, may have felt constrained in creating characters unremarkable enough to seem realistic. In any case, Price’s weren’t as memorable. I found myself questioning, too, whether the police work and the good-guy / bad-guy attitudes rang true. Again, with Homicide as the benchmark, I couldn’t help disputing any part of Lush Life that seemed inconsistent. So I guess the answer to my original question is that I’ll have to let my memory do its now all too natural thing of fading before I can enjoy any crime fiction again.As a side question, since Price co-wrote some of “The Wire,” I wonder how much of those efforts were steered or edited by the two main creators, Simon and Burns.

One of the fun things he could do was take the Budweiser beer jingle and play it umpteen different ways. The first might sound like Bach; then he’d switch to Chopin. After that maybe it’d be a ragtime version, or blues, or bebop. His versatility went hand in hand with his virtuosity. After Cloud Atlas, I put David Mitchell in that same category. Nearly every  of this book talks about how innovative the structure is. The stories are told in different styles with different settings (including the future), first in chronological order, with each one referring to the one before it, then in reverse order until he’s back to the original tale. It’s long and sometimes dense, especially the future parts where it takes time to process the evolved (or devolved) dialogue, but it’s never boring. And please don’t think of this book as only a gimmick. It has fresh ideas, recurring themes, and plenty of truths to tell. Plus, despite all the different voices and styles, the writing is always first rate. Unlike Christina Aguilera’s National Anthem, there were just the right number of notes. Literary merit often comes from not overdoing things, doesn’t it seem? I suppose I run the risk of praising too effusively. To be honest, I liked some segments better than others. But I enjoyed them all. Even the sci-fi parts – typically not my thing – were done in an enlightening, entertaining way. It strikes me that most stories set in the future take vaguely disturbing trends from our own recent history and extrapolate them to unreasonable extremes. We’re then led on a rail to read into this what the cultural and moral implications are for this current path. Though you do get a bit of this in Cloud Atlas, it’s more subtle, and it touches on human issues that seem more foundational.

We learn about the things a humping GI carries both literally and figuratively. The storytelling is remarkable, without a single word wasted, written in a deft, deceptively simple style by a guy who was there. O’Brien is clearly smarter than the average bear, but he’s also the voice of the everyman: empathetic, observant, and linked in. He puts you there in a very real way – before, after, and during the conflict. It reads like a memoir, which it sort of is, but it’s fictionalized in a way that I suspect tells the story in a truer way than the truth does. This is something he talks about in the book. You hear similar arguments all the time in support of good fiction, but you rarely see examples where it’s so clear. When the full story of Vietnam is divvied up instead among a handful of memorable characters and glued into a tight narrative, it can crystallize the experience in our own heads better than hearing a scattered set of factually accurate accounts ever could. I didn’t get the sense that he was manipulating us with sensationalized half-truths, either. Nor did he stretch credulity by glorifying himself or his fellow grunts. They were sent to do a terrible job, they were brave (not from lack of fear, but as a troop-wide coping mechanism), and they forged bonds where phrases like “I’ve got your back” would have real meaning. Most of us will never comprehend the magnitude of this, but The Things They Carried at least gives us a glimpse. War stories matter.

I bet a lot of novels these days feature that manyI wasn’t really counting, but seven is a plausible tally for the types of ambiguity put forth here. I bet a lot of novels these days feature that many just to maintain their modern lit cred. What’s unambiguous is that there were seven parts to the book with seven different narrators, each with a key part of the story to tell. It centers around Simon who is still madly in love with Anna, an ex-girlfriend who broke up with him 10 years ago. He’s a hopeless romantic, but one infused with enough sensitivity, insight, and empathy that I’m pretty sure we’re meant to like him – this, despite his truly stupid ploy to win Anna back. I won’t spoil anything by saying what he did exactly, but will say that it was a risky, ill-conceived plan that involved her school-aged son.It’s a long and ambitious book. Perlman should be credited for the homework he did to make his assorted narrators seem believable. This involved a working knowledge of psychology, finance, gambling, and prostitution. There was a trial, too, which played to an already existing strength. Perlman is a barrister in his native Australia.  I liked the way the seven different parts were structured. Each advanced the plot, but with overlap from one to the next. The different perspectives on the same events were revealing, and helped make the voices more distinct. I see that some ers have criticized the multifold narration for its lack of contrast, and that may be true, but at least the most noticeable attribute they shared was an appealing one: acute vision and understanding. This struck me as a book about how to be. We’re given plenty of examples of idealism, loyalty, and social conscience, along with a few slightly less lofty attributes like readiness to protect turf, chutzpah, and the benefits of calculating well (financial outcomes, cards, and people’s reactions). There’s a lot to think about here. I might have even given it Steve’s 5-Star Seal of Special Merit were it not for a few annoying cases of  Deus ex machina and overcooked coincidence. One was particularly bad, I thought. With no reason to suspect, a wife wanted to know if her cheating husband’s prostitute had committed a particular act involving corporeal gold (nothing to do with her heart, mind you; and not exactly a common practice). As it turns out, she had, but with a medical explanation. My other reason for docking a star is that I was reminded at times while reading it that the writer is a lawyer – a profession that involves lots of words, but not always ones destined for good prose. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,Feb 2010,"Jun 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153612.Seven_Types_of_Ambiguity

If you stared at what looked like random dots or patterns in just the right way,Remember those Magic Eye pictures that were popular back in the 90’s? If you stared at what looked like random dots or patterns in just the right way, forcing your eyes apart from their usual angled focus, a hidden 3-D image would suddenly pop into view. Some of them were pretty cool. If you were like me, though, it took a while to get it right. I remember moving the picture back and forth, commanding my eyes not to cross as it got closer to my nose and trying to hold that same angle as I moved it back out. Finally, it worked. The hidden fish (or whatever it was) came into focus, like it was floating off the page.I kept thinking The Black Book might amount to the same thing. If I could just train my view a certain way, the hidden meaning would emerge. I tried all the harder because the protagonist, Galip, seemed to be doing the same thing. Only he was looking into a mirror. You see, Galip was suffering an identity crisis. It was easy to understand why. His wife, Ruya, disappeared one day with only a short note to explain herself. At the same time her half-brother, Celal, a celebrated columnist in Istanbul, went missing as well, presumably with her. Celal was Galip’s older cousin, a man he greatly admired. Galip’s own life as a lawyer was colorless compared to Celal’s. As a writer, Celal was acclaimed by his many readers for his allegories and mystical tales about Turkey’s cultural identity. But why would the two of them go off without him? How does the view Galip has of himself change in light of this? He spends most of the rest of the book trying to find them, but also trying to find his true self. If anything, though, he begins to see himself through Celal’s lenses.The book is educational. It’s also structured in an interesting way, alternating chapters that are first an omniscient narrator’s account centering on Galip and then columns written by Celal. Then there was a convergence of sorts near the end that I won’t go into for fear of spoiling things.Even a poor student of history (like me) can appreciate the parallels between personal and national identity that played out in this book. It was set in the early 80’s and was, in a way, a debate about East vs. West, old ways vs.new, and maybe Islam vs. Hollywood. Istanbul, I’m guessing, was as conflicted a place as any when it came to these opposites. They were still sorting out Ataturk’s march towards modernity.Unfortunately, my search for the magic focus got to be tedious. The book was dense with descriptions that might appeal to anyone who has visited Istanbul, but probably won’t to those who haven’t. The main points seemed belabored, too. I’m not saying it should have been Twitterized, but a good editor might have found 100 pages to cut. Plus, once I did see the picture (if I truly did), its impact underwhelmed me. Assuming I understood the premise, to know or become your true self requires isolation from any outside influences. But then what could you draw on to form your eclectic self? Do closed societies with closed minds achieve a compensating inner purity?

It’s the natural, albeit overused, word for what McCann did so well: tell multiple stories about multiple people with multiple themes, focusing on one point-of-view at a time, but with enough overlap to bind them together. (I tried to come up with a more distinctive metaphor, but my spinning disc with multi-colored curves coming from the center like one of those psychedelic swirl lollipops smacked of trying too hard.)Anyway…This was a very good book. I liked the way it was structured, with Frenchman Philippe Petit’s historic walk on a tightrope between the Twin Towers in 1974 as the common strand in most of the stories. For any of you who saw Man on Wire, you know this was a pretty cool, real-life event. McCann’s 10 other stories seemed like they could have been true, too. With millions of stories in the Naked City to work with, the challenge was to come up with a representative subset. And to combine them in the manner of a spinning disc with multi-colored curves coming from the center like one of those psychedelic swirl lollipops. (OK, I see it now: “weave” truly is better.)The cast of characters is as engaging as it is varied. We meet a modern-day urban monk, his brother from Ireland, mother-daughter prostitutes with hearts of something less clichéd than gold (though not like greasy black banana peels either), an unfortunate society lady whose son had been in Vietnam, her husband the municipal judge, her new friend in a support group who didn’t know quite what to make of her (with race as a complicating factor), the nerdy developers who gave birth to the internet, an art photographer with a specialty in tagging, an artistic couple with integrity in varying degrees, and the daughter of one of the hookers, sent away and now grown, returning to tie up a few of the stories’ loose ends. Phillippe features, too, though not always as a focal point. The writing, I thought, was top notch. The plots were engrossing and the descriptions gave a real sense of time and place. Plus, McCann lays out his words with a real rhythmic flair.

Are there other authors or titles that come to mind, perhaps even more focused on the primacy of style?Steve: Well, let’s see… Maybe the first book I read where a certain shadowy deportment really popped as a pure statement of style was Raymond Chandler’s Farewell, My Lovely. The book itself was a cannibalization of three earlier short stories of his. Whereas the stories were neatly contained as standalones, the edits in piecing them together were more slapdash, sacrificing both congruency and clarity in the process. Chandler responded saying, ""My whole career is based on the idea that the formula doesn't matter, the thing that counts is what you do with the formula; that is to say, it is a matter of style.” And of course that hard-boiled, noir feel of his is prevalent to this day. Audience Question: I may be taking you further afield, but is this visual, visceral style brought on by Chandler one that necessarily de-emphasizes plot?Steve: I don’t think so. Style is not everything. (Nor is image, much as Andre Agassi would have us believe on Canon's behalf.) Furthermore, …Audience Question: [interrupting what would surely have been an insightful elaboration on the topic of substance v. style] But think back to the movies. When you picture Bogie and Bacall in The Big Sleep, do you remember the on-screen chemistry and the wise guy patter, or is it a plot detail, something like the perp who stole the falcon, that stuck with you?

Steve: Admittedly, HumpBac, as I like to call them (retrofitting a nickname) were iconic, but…Another audience member: Those couple combo names have kind of run their course, don’t you think? Who’s even together at this point? Certainly not Brangelina. TomKat? – no. Zanessa? – no. Yet another voice from the audience: What about Bennifer? Are they? It’s hard to keep track.

AsThis may be perverse, but part of the appeal of this book was in trying to figure out what makes it worthwhile despite seeming to be so ungrounded. As a benchmark for contrast, Walter’s award winner from a few years before, Citizen Vince, was unambiguously good —- and good in a straightforward way. It had a fully fleshed out, likable main character, a colorful supporting cast, and a plot that strode on with cocky assurance. The Zero did not. Brian Remy, in the lead role, was a NY cop in the aftermath of 9/11. Even though the images were vivid, they were purposely fragmented. We never really got to know what made Remy tick. This was due, in no small part, to prolonged gaps in Remy’s memory. If you’re like me, you may read much of the book looking for explanations. Was there a medical reason for these lapses? Had he been drugged? Was he repressing terrible acts? I won’t give anything away, but I will say that allegorical satires are usually not meant to be taken literally. In fact, you may get more out of it if you imagine looking through Gregor Samsa's big bug eyes (as Walter’s nod to Kafka might have it). So what was Walter’s point then, if not a straight narrative? To be honest, the biggest hints came in the interview included at the end of the book (in my edition, at least) -- there and in the appended pages from Walter’s journal entries. He had evidently been disturbed not only by the heinous, unprovoked acts of terrorism themselves, but by the US reactions that saw us invading Iraq, torturing prisoners, quashing civil rights, etc. Beyond that, he was disappointed by how quickly we wanted to forget about the whole thing: “like we watched terrorism on TV for a while, got bored and turned back to American Idol.” You can see some of these themes brought out in the story, even if only elliptically. There was a bit of comic relief, too, with 9/11 heroes shilling cereal and The Boss (a thinly veiled reference to Giuliani) advancing the art of the photo op. The dominant theme, though, was the surrealism. Snippets of Remy’s reality would come through, but many were dreamlike, unconnected, and even cryptic for having been suppressed. (I looked down and saw blood on my shoes. How did that happen?) We’re left to wonder what Walter meant by it all. What does Remy represent?The confusion was often a riff on a standard –- some of it droned or atonal. There was a romance, but it was hard to appreciate since we knew so little about the characters. Other parts read more like a thriller, or were they actually more like a farce? We were often off-balance or in the dark. Was that part of the point? The more I write, the more tempted I am to downgrade this effort. But then I remember two things. 1) There’s a right way to read this that isn’t so concerned with the story on the surface, and 2) the NY Times blurb makes a valid point: “Walter is a ridiculously talented writer.” Four stars seems fair if you read it the way it was intended (though I don’t think I did until late)....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"May 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1188662.The_Zero

Taking in his best works, you’re granted kinship with the elite. Like a trader at Salomon Brothers, you might laugh at the chumps in the bond market; or like the money-constrained boss of the Oakland A’s, you might cobble together a winning line-up by way of statistics; or like a genius of modern day football, you would recognize the importance of a great left tackle in protecting your quarterback’s blind side. Now, with The Big Short, you will have no doubt foreseen the folly of investing in subprime mortgages with their impending defaults. He does this in a very readable way, too. The characters are all interesting – often genuinely quirky. And his vantage point as a quasi-insider signifies the straight scoop. Whatever the topic, he explains its subtleties well enough that you can paraphrase it to impress friends over cocktails. Our man Lewis was clever to focus on the winners of the bet. As he explained in an interview, those were the ones who were willing to talk to him. They saw what became obvious in hindsight: that many of the loans backing mortgage securities were originated with very low standards applied (by firms who didn’t have to eat their own cooking), were issued with teaser rates that would soon adjust up, and were likely to default as soon as the air started coming out of the big housing balloon. For reasons Lewis explains well, the bet against the bubble was not so apparent to many. These securities were hidden in tranches of complicated mortgage-backed securities with obscure features that made it harder to do proper due diligence. They were also rated too high by Moody’s and S&P for the default potential they contained (partly because the agencies were easily duped by the Goldmans of the world who were paying their fees and wanted AAA assets to vend). Plus, there was little to go on from past default data because such high levels of credit unworthiness had never before been experienced. Modeling assumptions were poor, too. For instance, it was thought that diversification across regions would reduce risks. The widespread downturn in housing showed otherwise, of course. Default correlations were high. It hurt the cause, too, when some of the strongest personalities in the business, like Cassano at AIG and Hubler at Morgan Stanley, were also some of the wrongest.The misdeeds on Wall Street were spotlighted well. I couldn’t help feeling, though, especially at the end, that Lewis had overstated his case. There were times when he claimed the investment banks were stupid for not knowing the true value of these assets and at the same time duplicitous in passing them off to customers. You can’t have it both ways, at least not in that case. I was also hoping that he would weigh in on some of the other factors that contributed to the crash, such as the role of government with its CRA program and the poor oversight of its sponsored enterprises, toxic waste-makers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Other points Lewis made against the investment banks were more deserving, I thought, among them, the fact that they are no longer partnerships (where any losses would truly hit home), but rather corporations with limited liability. Agency theory in economics points to the problem of employees receiving a much bigger share of the upside (with bonus structures as they are), and a lot less of any downside. Riskier strategies result. That doesn’t explain everything, though. Several of the notable blow-ups included principal architects who were also major shareholders. For instance, Richard Fuld lost over half a billion in share value when Lehman went under.The other thing I thought was noteworthy about Lewis’s critique was something he alluded to in the introduction. He said when he wrote Liar’s Poker that he intended for it to be a finger-wagging at the industry’s bad behavior. Many read it instead as a how-to manual. This disconcerted him, and it was apparent that he went to greater lengths this time to dwell on the negatives. That said, might we still get the sense that he wants it both ways? His descriptions are alluring, the language of the cognoscenti is enticing, the personalities are bigger than life, and the market savvy that decides who wins the pot is celebrated. Wittingly or not, there’s an extent to which he glamorizes. I’ll take him at his word that he doesn’t want to see bright young people flocking to Wall Street anymore, but it seems there’s a small, slightly disingenuous part of him that still finds it all pretty fascinating.In summary: strongly recommended as a guidebook on the crisis, very entertaining, but maybe not the one-stop shopping it might have been for assigning all warranted blame.Addendum: 1/26/2016I never would have guessed this book had movie potential. And I never would have thought that if it was adapted, that they’d bring in the director of Anchorman and Talladega Nights to do it. Now I half-way expect the Farrelly brothers to counter with a version of Think and Grow Rich. Or maybe those guys who made Airplane! and the Naked Gun movies could team up to put Who Moved My Cheese? onto the big screen.

Martin, a second-rate professor of philosophy and a first-rate pedant, is the storyteller in this one. As you already know, the joke is on him. His new research interests concern art, iconology, nominalism, and assorted other obscurities. His wife is an art historian specializing in iconography (as opposed to iconology, which Martin distinguishes as a difference that matters). As they begin a working vacation in the country, they’re asked by a loutish neighbor nearby to look at some old family paintings. There’s one the lout knows is worth something, but it’s another that Martin believes through his particular expertise to be an unsigned, yet truly major piece by a noted Dutch artist. Frayn’s work here was very skillfully done. As I’ve now come to expect from just about every writer from the Isles, he has a real way with words. But Frayn’s accomplishment goes beyond that. He gave Martin’s first person narrative a book-smart plausibility even as we readers were clued in to his debilitating lack of common sense. The good professor’s foil was the aforementioned lout, who was hoping to liquidate the remaining chunks of his inheritance. But the truth of the matter is that Martin’s biggest foe was Martin. If you’re like me and find yourself obliquely pulling for the guy, he’ll jangle your nerves with his missteps. And they were all so avoidable. (My dad couldn’t bear watching “I Love Lucy” for similar reasons – a heritable trait, I suspect.) Anyway, Martin could never see what the other players in the chess match might do; how even a nakedly greedy lunkhead could outmaneuver him in matters of finance. At the same time, he did superlative research into the neighbor’s painting. It was his idée fixe. He shed all kinds of light on its religious and societal context. And even the most abstract symbolism was explained or considered. Actually, the art history was more interesting than I would have thought even if it did, at times, go on for too long.I rate this closer to 4 stars than to 3, but somewhere in that range.

Then Eilis, the younger of two sisters living at home with their mother, has a whole new life arranged for her in New York. It took rather a stiff upper lip for a young woman to cross the stormy seas and settle in a foreign land where the only person she knew was the priest who arranged the whole thing. Sea sickness gave way to homesickness, but her strength of character prevailed. The story then settled into how she built her new life, complete with a job at a clothing store, night classes to learn bookkeeping, relations with her catty fellow boarders, and ultimately with Tony, his brothers, and the Dodgers. It was a more innocent era (even in the big city). At that point I was wondering if it was possible to be nostalgic for a time and place you’ve never experienced. People were generally nicer; more thoughtful. Then again, I wondered whether an era like that when polite behavior and higher standards were de rigueur would be more likely to come down hard on subtle deviations. Would social acceptance be too narrowly defined? Seemed like something interesting to consider in light of the book’s focus on manners, integrity and the social fabric of the day. I was happy enough with the manufactured, third-order conflicts. It helped that despite her passive nature, Eilis was likable and observant. (I’d be curious to know if women who read this think Tóibín did a credible job getting inside the head of his young protagonist.) Then, towards the end, BAM! -- you get genuine, first-order conflict. I won’t spoil it for anyone, but will mention that certain dilemmas were laid out well: old life vs. new, family duty vs. commitments to others, the growing comfort of the here and now vs. the fading memories of pleasures past, and romantic prospects vs. … what (?). There’s a pay-off to reading through to the end. Which way will the wind blow? Will Eilis be blown with it? It was a story simply told and all the more forceful for it.Update: I’m happy to report that the movie adaptation was a good one. It’s not a substitute for the book, of course, since there is plenty of interior life a film can’t hope to capture.

One is a dowdy concierge in an upscale Paris apartment and the other is an unusual 12-year-old girl living there with her well-to-do family. I like how their brainpower comes through in their ideas and observations rather than from the author just telling us how “wicked smaht” they are (to borrow Chuckie’s phrase from Good Will Hunting). Their outsized crania were not always easy to carry. Renee, the concierge, was not to the manor born (probably more like the servants’ quarters) and she never seemed to forget it. She had a real thirst for knowledge, though –- an accomplished autodidact in philosophy, film, art, and music. But she never felt comfortable sharing any of these joys with anyone given what she felt the attitudes towards a woman of her social standing would be. The girl was a different story. Her cross to bear was how to carve out a niche for herself in a family that was all too comfortable with its elevated status. Her main weapon against the soullessness of life in the upper crust was cynicism. She wielded it well, sometimes to humorous effect. At times she may not have seemed real, but then you could say the same about the Coneheads, and if you recall, they too were from France. As everyone knows, smart people don’t always figure out ways to be happy. This is one of the themes. However, they might just meet someone with a clear-sighted appreciation for hidden beauty, an easy manner, and a rich vein of empathy for kindred spirits. Much of the meeting up takes place late, but is powerful when it finally does. The spoiler police prevent me from saying as much as I'd like.In addition to interesting characters, a solid plot, and real wisdom to impart, the book was well-written to boot.

I’m going to guess, though, that any signal distortion is a problem on my end, not hers.The people in her stories are engrossing and complex. Again, it’s impressive that they’re drawn so completely in so few pages. Maybe it has something to do with the gravitas she gives them. Her central characters are not what you’d call blithe.

I suppose you’d call it a crime drama more than anything else, what with made guys, high-stakes poker, low-level scams, hookers, dope, and countless misadventures all presented in the crisp, colorful patois of the street. But it’s smart and funny, too. Even edifying at times. The characters are fully fleshed out, and the writing can verge on the literary, though never to the point of distraction. On top of that, there’s a surprisingly good segment on Reagan and Carter on the eve of the election that stretches the genre further still.

Then he wrote a scene where Jack Griffin, his main character, was on the side of the road talking to his shrew of a mother on the phone when a seagull flew by and dropped a calling card on his head. At that point any tidy resolutions to Griffin’s problems weren’t going to work – further development was going to be needed. But at 261 pages, we could have used more. To be honest, it felt a little thin. I say this at the same time I claim Russo as a personal favorite; I’m grateful for dollops of any size. Had this been my first of his books, I’d have nary a critical word. But fans know the heights he can scale.Griffin is a 55-year-old academic, a former screenwriter, a husband, and a son, but doesn’t seem fully engaged in any of his roles. With parents like his, pulling away was understandable. They were academics themselves, Ivy-leaguers appointed beneath their station in the Mid-effing-west, with a haughty disdain for their intellectual inferiors which to them included pretty much everyone. At times they were laughably bad (one of the book’s great strengths). Griffin disengaged from them, but not as much as he wanted to believe. This was a major theme, even as they became ashes in urns. Troubles in his marriage were harder to figure. His wife was not the problem, though; that much we surmise. Russo is usually so good at developing characters. This time, too, he gets into heads and tells revealing stories about Griffin and the gang, but … (you knew there’d be a but) at times he makes Griffin out to be borderline obtuse. If Griffin, in one instance, can write so knowingly about people, as he did in a very good story within the story about a boyhood friend at the Cape, how can he be, at other times, so heedless, turning even allies against him? Russo characters are often flawed, but rarely lacking in people smarts or self-awareness as Griffin seemed to be. Then again, maybe that was just part of the dark humor that ran throughout. Irony is another guess, what with the writer/professor falling short in the insight department, unable to read people.Despite the brevity, many of the secondary characters were memorable. Griffin’s daughter, who was getting married in Act III of the book, was honest and kind—-more like her mother, Joy. Joy’s family stood out, too. Her knuckleheaded brothers, twin Marine MP’s, were a hoot. I was also interested in a character named Sunny Kim, a Korean immigrant and friend of Griffin’s daughter since childhood. He was smart, respectful, and repressed, but Russo went beyond stereotypes to give us a glimpse into a rich inner life, too. (Mr. Russo, since you’re likely to stop by soliciting feedback from ers like me, please consider a follow-up story focusing on Sunny. I have a similar suggestion involving Rub from Nobody’s Fool.)When it’s all said and done, this is a very satisfying read. I might have a few quibbles about Griffin and his plight, but in the end it’s recognizably Russovian, which is always a good thing....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Sep 16, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6413210-that-old-cape-magic

He looked down at the shards reflecting segments of his face and liked what he saw. He also liked what he didn’t see. His mind’s eye had to fill in the gaps in his image – serendipitous disjointedness a la Picasso.  Maybe this book is a little like that. The vast middle section is a profile of “infrarealist” poet Arturo Belano (Bolano’s alter ego) and sidekick Ulises Lima as told by dozens of narrators spanning 20 some years. Each mini-story was a piece of the broken glass. Some were more distant, some closer up, many were fogged or distorted. Ironically, it was often the story-tellers who were slightly insane that made the most sense. Drug-induced, sleep-deprived, and drunken insights also featured prominently (you might say expressionistically, sticking with the art metaphor). There were plenty of pieces missing, too, like with the broken mirror. For instance, what was their poetic movement all about? And what fueled their romance for the road? Some er somewhere said this is a book that fetishizes the obscure. That’s a great way to sum it up.While reading this, I was often reminded of On the Road, (though at 600+ pages it must have taken Bolano longer to put together than Kerouac’s famously rushed effort). It also struck me that how much you enjoy travels with free spirits depends on how much you like them as people. I was prepared to like Belano, Lima, and their poet friends plenty, but in the end never felt like I knew them well enough. Another irony that I couldn’t help but think about was how a book that focused so much on poetry didn’t feature any examples. In fact, the prose wasn’t very art-worthy either, though that may not be a fair comment to make about a translated work. It’s also possible that I missed one of the points: that part of being in this avant-garde offshoot they called visceral realism (=infrarealism ) is to fly in the face of art properly conceived.

Maybe it’s better to letAfter reading something written so well, it’s a disappointment having only my own less eloquent words available to praise it. Maybe it’s better to let Banville’s passages sell themselves. I’ll get to those soon, but first a bit of context. The book, I learned only today, is a Roman a clef -- more or less a true account of the infamous Cambridge spies disguised as a novel. The focus is on Victor Maskell, a composite figure based primarily on real-life Anthony Blunt. It’s structured as a memoir by Victor in his mature years reflecting back on his days as a would-be ideologue in the socialists' camp (stoicists', really), an intelligence officer in WWII, a spy for the Russians, a renowned art historian, an uninvolved family man, and a fancier of men. Finding conflict in a life like that was no challenge. Breathing life into an inherently cold fish was. Victor was undeniably complex, but there was not a lot of empathy to endear him to anyone. The pleasure in reading the book was not in witnessing any ultimate humanization, but in the language and intelligence of the author. Here are some samples. Judge for yourself. Illustrating one aspect of the man Victor was: “[T:]he crowd was so large it had overflowed from the gallery, and people were standing about the pavement in the evening sunshine, drinking white wine and sneering at passers-by, and producing that self-congratulatory low roar that is the natural collective voice of imbibers at the fount of art. Ah, what heights of contempt I was capable of in those days! Now, in old age, I have largely lost that faculty, and I miss it, for it was passion of a sort.”And another, as mentioned by a friend: “The trouble with you, Vic, is that you think of the world as a sort of huge museum with too many visitors allowed in.”Victor comparing his Irish upbringing with that of a Jewish friend: “[W:]e shared the innate, bleak romanticism of our two very different races, the legacy of dispossession, and, especially, the lively anticipation of eventual revenge, which, when it came to politics, could be made to pass for optimism.”On his evolving views, speaking about: “the American system itself, so demanding, so merciless, undeluded as to the fundamental murderousness and venality of humankind and at the same time so grimly, unflaggingly optimistic. More heresy, I know, more apostasy; soon I shall have no beliefs left at all, only a cluster of fiercely held denials.”Victor reminiscing with old friend, Nick: “’Do you remember,’ I said, ‘that summer when we first came down to London, and we used to walk through Soho at night, reciting Blake aloud, to the amusement of the tarts? The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction. He was our hero, do you remember? Scourge of hypocrisy, the champion of freedom and truth.’ ‘We were usually drunk, as I recall,’ he said, and laughed; Nick does not really laugh, it is only a noise that he makes which he has learned to imitate from others. […:] ‘The tygers of wrath,’ he said. ‘Is that what you thought we were?’” “How to Write” books tell you to use adverbs and adjectives sparingly. When you’re John Banville, though, and know all the right ones, maybe the rule shouldn’t apply.

You know the basic outline from the start (Cain and Abel in the Garden of Eden). Then you see the colors fill in, with the light and dark hues (good and evil) starkly contrasted. The canvas in this case is big, and when you take a few steps back to consider the whole, you realize there’s plenty for the eye to take in. The colors are vivid, coming from all parts of the palate. You also notice, stepping in closer again, that certain sections are even artful, with blending at the borders to make it seem real.I suppose if you’re literal-minded, Biblically speaking, this is one of the oldest stories known to man. Brothers can differ. Parents can play favorites. The evil, out-of-favor brother can act out of vengeance. A good teller of tales, though, like Steinbeck, can make this hearty grist for the mill. Adam Trask and his half-brother Charles were rivals. Their father, against his nature, preferred the weaker, more sensitive Adam. That was brother conflict number one. Number two came years later when twin boys begat by Adam (maybe?) and bad-to-the-bone Cathy (more on her in a minute) played out a similar battle between good and evil. But whence cometh evil? Steinbeck, to his credit, was interested in cause and effect. In the case of the second rivalry there was that subtle blending I mentioned, too. Good morphed into self-righteousness and evil seemed not so bad once fully explained. On top of that, the most enlightened and likable influences in the book, Samuel and Lee, introduced the concept of choice into the mix, telling us that evil does not have to play out deterministically true to form.In a long book like this, Steinbeck had plenty of time to draw detailed characters. The aforementioned Cathy was as venomous a woman as you’ll ever find. You know the old cliché of the prostitute with a heart of gold. Well hers was all bile and pus, with no discernable reason for it other than hatred self-made. Adam, who first saw her as pretty and wounded, was lucky to have survived, though in the traumatized state she left him in he didn’t survive much. Lee, the faithful Chinese-American caretaker, ran the house, and raised the boys with far more wisdom than most. Their friend Samuel was a luckless but well-liked presence in the Salinas Valley where they all lived. He was smart, kind, philosophical, and funny, with an Irishman’s way (Blarnified, at times) with words. His discussions with Lee, his intellectual peer, were some of the high points of the book. Samuel’s children were given full treatment, too. Even a grandchild by the name of John Steinbeck appeared once or twice. This, to me, was a near-great novel. There was plenty of conflict to keep things moving, even if not all of it seemed true to life. The blending I keep mentioning set the stage for moral ambiguity, which was good, but it seemed a tad abstract, like I couldn’t quite connect it to real people. Still, the painted-in regions pieced together by a keen-eyed observer like Steinbeck can produce work that’s well worth considering. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,not set,"Sep 11, 2009","Aug 25, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden

Hans doesn’t feel completely at home in any of his worlds. He confesses to being lost and clueless. The more you read, though, the more you don’t believe it.

The most vivid one involved a larger-than-life Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon. Chuck had a missionary’s zeal for cricket, an immigrant’s hope for the future, and a wheeler-dealer’s sense of compromise between legality and success.

The way I see it, the steps involved are:* State up front what the themes are, but disguise at least a few of them with cryptic labels that portend greater meaning to those who venture further. Who wouldn’t read on when enticed by the promise of the lowly hedgehog’s secret for success or how Admiral Stockdale’s paradoxical key to survival as a P.O.W. can be applied for corporate gain?* Supply lots of lists, charts, and visuals. Venn diagrams are especially good, it seems. The confluence of 3 good traits at the virtuous center constitutes a synergized sweet spot for those clever enough to recognize it.* Make common sense bromides sound less trite. You can’t just say, “Hire good people.” It’s better to say you have to get the right people on the bus, and further, that the right people have to be in the right seats. The bus connotes movement, you see; progress towards a common goal. Choosing the perfect metaphor is part of what separates the business-writing cream from the chaff.* Common sense is good, but for variety, a few counterintuitive insights should be included, too. These can give the savvy reader an extra edge. Even the cagiest adversaries (among those outside the circle of 3 million purchasers privy to the book’s ironic findings) would not figure out such things as the importance of humility among top-tier leaders or that “stop doing” lists are more important than “to do” lists.* Bulletize. Summarize. Rinse. Repeat.As I get off my weisenheiming horse for a minute, there probably are some useful concepts here. This was assigned reading in the office, and it does seem to have improved management focus. Plus, we’ve now established a common language regarding the basic tenets (even if certain phrases are said with a smirk--hedgehogs on buses entering the flywheel will know what I’m talking about). I’m no expert, but it’s probably good for its type.What I can’t decide is whether the book’s research methodology was effective or not. The basic idea was to construct a sample of consistent outperformers and another sample of peers that at one time looked similar, but ultimately languished. The researchers then asked what traits separated the two samples. I sympathize with how nebulous the differentiating factors would be. There’s an inherent squishiness to them, and judgment could cloud the data. It’s a difficult task. At the same time I think it’s fair to criticize the method for its backward-looking nature. In trying to discern cause and effect, something more along the lines of a lab, where various differences could be tested against a control group before knowing the outcomes, would carry more weight. I’m always a little suspicious of studies like this. If, for instance, the true driver of success was simply a fortuitous set of circumstances (right place, right time, right regulations, right trend) then it may appear, after the fact, that it was the right people in the right seats on the bus.

Young Edgar, bright and observant, describes Jewish family life as he knew it growing up in the Bronx in the 1930’s. E. L. Doctorow (E for Edgar) presumably didn’t stray far from his own experiences to write this. The boyhood sketches spanned the whole decade, ending the year of New York’s iconic Fair when Edgar was 9. It was told in a voice that combined a kid’s sense of wonder with an adult’s more artful way of putting things. I thought part of what made the narration so effective was how detailed but natural the day-to-day snippets seemed. They were over-described and sensationalized in the way you'd expect and even hope from an enthusiastic child. His portrayals of the radio shows, movies, music, the pre-war political scene, bigotry, the depression economy, sports, and the precursors to carnal knowledge were all the more vivid from this young, zealous source. And that was just fine with me. Now I have something other than Radio Days to go on for a mental image of the times.Edgar’s parents fell somewhere in the vast middle ground between Norman Rockwell and dysfunction. If anything, given his father’s proclivities, they leaned more towards the latter. Time did not always do its job to soften the painful memories. With a dad who was flawed, Edgar’s older brother was often the better role model. Like their father, brother Donald was clever, aware, and good at working angles, but unlike the old man, he was also responsible. Their mother was solid and dependable, though she was losing a bit of her spark. She didn’t have much to bring joy to her life, and had a mother-in-law to detract from it. I make this seem like a pretty grim scene, but there were plenty of warm undercurrents, too. The overall tone was more nostalgic than anything else. One of the vignettes was about putting together a time capsule. In a way the whole book seemed like stories told by an old guy rummaging just such a trove. And always with the context to appreciate them.Four stars bordering on five....more",Notes are private!,1,41,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2009","Jul 16, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24910.World_s_Fair

Did Richard III really order his young nephews killed in the Tower of London, or was he unjustly implicated as part of a massive smear campaign? If you’re Alan Grant, the recuperating Inspector from Scotland Yard, the answer becomes increasingly clear. Grant took the case to begin with because he was bored and bed-ridden and couldn’t chase live, motile bad guys. He became interested in Richard based on a random set of pictures a lady friend gave him in the hospital. In perhaps the only dubious part of the plot, Grant fancied himself an expert on faces, with an unnatural ability to divine guilt or innocence from them. With Richard, he saw the look of sound judgment, not monstrous intent. From there, he began building a proper case, piece by logical piece.Somewhere along the way, the same friend who got him started with the investigation put him in contact with a young visiting scholar at the British Museum. As a tool for tracking down relevant archive material, the guy was better than Google. The detective work inherent in good historical research was one of the most enjoyable parts of the book, I thought.I also liked how Tey cast large shadows of doubt on the established historical accounts. It was easy to believe that some were written as propaganda commissioned by Henry VII, the first of the Tudor Kings, who felt a need to discredit Richard and the whole Plantagenet line. It was also true that Richard had nothing to gain politically by killing the young princes. They were never in line to usurp his role. Most telling, though, was how all accounts of Richard’s murderous scheme were written well after the supposed fact. Even the trumped up charges in the Bill of Attainder that Henry brought against Richard made no mention of it, and no chronicles written at the time said word one about the deaths, which very easily could have happened after Richard’s own death. Reactions to Tey’s book were interesting. Ricardian societies popped up proclaiming his innocence. Other notable books adopted the same view. Richard’s case was even tried by the Supreme Court in a mock trial. They found him not guilty. According to Wikipedia, the title comes from a line by Bertolt Brecht: Truth is the daughter of time, not of authority. That’s not a bad take-away point.

He’s a man in his fifties, English, a quasi-academic, and one who appreciates the art of language and the tenor of personal relationships. Unfortunately, he’s lost his dear wife, an esteemed stage actress named Ruth, to cancer. In addition, other events that prove that trouble comes in threes conspired to throw him for one hell of a loop. Prior to her death, Bill had a job managing Ruth's career. It was a career that more or less managed itself. His current post as a fellow at a prestigious university was due, in large part, to a substantial sum that his step-father had gifted the school. Bill did have an interesting project, though. It involved a set of notebooks that Matthew Pearce, an ancestor, had kept in Victorian times. Religion was ceding ground to Darwin. This brought on a very rapid evolution in Matthew; not a fortuitous one given his father-in-law’s position in the clergy. Though Matthew’s upheaval was more self-induced, it does tie in with Bill’s own. In the end, Bill has told much of his story from early days obsessing about pretty ballerinas onward. But it’s difficult to know what he’s truly sorted out. He’s better at asking questions than answering them.Now meet Reader X. He’s a man in his fifties, American, a faux-aficionado of life, and one who appreciates several of the same things Bill does. Fortunately, Reader X’s dear wife is still very much alive and, among other things, supplies him with fine books. She knew, for instance, that Graham Swift had written one of his favorites, Last Orders, and wanted him to enjoy another one like it. A few chapters into this new one, Reader X was struck by how adept Swift is with language. Are the English simply better at it? Maybe his sample of classics and Booker Prize-winners biases him to think so. After a bit more of Ever After, though, Reader X became almost too aware of the literary garnish and began hoping for more meat. Last Orders was so good at varying time to back-fill the story of old friends. Ever After made effective use of the same device, but ended up wearing our reader friend out, what with Matthew’s ponderous struggle for meaning and Bill’s own contemplative load. While pat answers to difficult questions can stretch credulity, Reader X felt like a few more hints about reconciling harsh realities might have been nice. Then again, maybe Swift was less interested in self-help and more interested in existential angst. Reader X will just have to get over it.3.5 stars rounded to 4....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2009","May 29, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/855937.Ever_After

He recently returned from the Mayo Clinic with less than full assurances, has seen his second wife leave him under odd circumstances, and has taken two steps forward and one step back (or is it one forward and two back?) with his first wife and their two grown kids. Frank has plenty to mull over. But then Ford offers up quite an assortment for readers to chew on, too. 1) Is there such a thing as a life too-well-examined? (Frank is as reflective as they come, but his insights are so interesting, we rarely begrudge him his self focus.)2) Is the Permanent Period that Frank described himself to be in, ""when few contrarian voices mutter doubts in your head, when the past seems more generic than specific, when life's a destination more than a journey and when who you feel yourself to be is pretty much how people will remember you once you've croaked -- in other words, when personal integration . . . is finally achieved,"" de rigueur around that age? 3) Is awareness of one’s own foibles a helpful step in dealing with them? (Frank is full of admissions like the following to fuel the debate: “It’s loony, of course, to think that by lowering expectations and keeping ambitions to a minimum we can ever avert the surprising and unwanted. Though the worst part, as I said, is that I’ve cluttered my immediate future with new-blooming dilemmas exactly like young people do when they’re feckless and thirty-three and too inexperienced to know better.”)4) Are great writers like Ford just naturally better at dealing with deep, personal issues—things like Frank’s suppressed despair from a loss years ago? (This was a very effective scene made all the better by a rare show of emotion that Frank himself, in the first person account, didn’t see coming.)5) Speaking of great writing, could this be Ford at the height of his powers? (All the prizes went to Independence Day, the second in the series, but I think the prose in this one is even better—-long and lush sentences, words flowing like music, acoustically pure.)While I wouldn’t consider Frank a role model, he comes by his opinions honestly. Did I pay more attention because I’m getting close to his age? Is his search for meaning less clichéd for its lack of a spiritual basis? Does his contemplative inner life make him an island? He’s a complex character; these are questions to weigh with him in mind.About two-thirds of the way into the book, it occurred to me that there was a lot Frank needed to wrap up before the trilogy’s end. I consciously slowed down so I wouldn’t miss any bit of how he did it.

The prof was as dry as they come, the progression from one ism to the next seemed more a matter of names than ideas, and I took it pass-fail (disincentive enough in those days). So Sophie’s World was a much-needed education for me. It’s structured as an extracurricular course in the history of philosophy given under mysterious circumstances to a 14-year-old Scandinavian schoolgirl. I may flatter myself to say it, but the course was pitched just about right for me. It was a few months ago that I read this, and I probably forgot many of the names, schools, and settings associated with the concepts it covered, but I remember being into it at the time. So as a primer, it worked reasonably well. Certain sections did make you think.  What worked less well, I thought, was the story of Sophie and her private teacher that later became a meta-story involving a Norwegian girl Sophie’s age and her absent pedagogue of a dad. Even the characters meant to be real didn’t seem real. Maybe the mystery of who transcends the imagination passes as whimsy for a Norwegian philosophy teacher like Gaarder. It might have been a clever device, but there were too many reminders that the guy is not a true novelist.As an aside, now that I think of it, I did have one other exposure to philosophy before reading this book. It was that song by the Pythons. If you’ve forgotten the one I mean, here’s one of the verses.John Stuart Mill, of his own free will,after half a pint of shandy was particularly ill.Plato, they say, could stick it away,'alf a crate of whiskey every day!Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle,and Hobbes was fond of his Dram.And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart:""I drink, therefore I am.""With such a fine example to follow, and with a newfound interest in philosophy spurred in part by this book, I offer a few lines of my own.It’s said Bertrand Russell would put up a tussle Whenever the barman called time.And old Monsieur Rousseau was crazy for cointreauHe drank it with squeezes of lime.For wine by the cart, you couldn’t beat SartreUnless you were Thomas Aquinas.But Spumante bubbles caused no end of troublesFor Senhor Spinoza’s poor sinus.Drinking and thinking -- a prime Pythonesque pairing.

In rare cases a data-plying vector-head like me might talk about how some big swinging member at the trade desk got eviscerated when he messed up his numbers. A story like that can be marginally interesting if told in a gory way. But as relatable tidbits go, that had pretty much been the full gamut. Now, with Freakonomics, we dare to dream of audiences appreciating a new set of number-based anecdotes. They came up with examples where their quantitative forensics would yield something clever or fun, often exposing ironic, counterintuitive, or sordid behavior in the process. I suspect the less these examples had to do with economics, the more interesting they seemed. Be that as it may, it was gratifying to see that the modeling techniques quants rely on (like multivariate regression) have been brought to bear to tell these tales.The Freakonomics formula is a smart one. It starts with sound research on non-traditional topics with results that were vetted in academic journals. That was Levitt’s part. Co-author Dubner is the writer. His job was to provide context, explain how results were uncovered, and sell us on why it’s all so cool. And who wouldn’t be at least mildly intrigued by patterns that show how teachers in Chicago cheated to raise their students’ test scores, and how that links them with Sumo wrestlers in Japan. They cited another example discovered in April of ’87. Evidently that year 7 million children in the US simply disappeared off the face of the earth. This was fully one-tenth of the dependent-age population. They speculated that maybe, just maybe, the new requirement from the IRS in ’87 to include a child’s SSN on the form had something to do with the massive decline in dependents.The authors were careful to explain the methodological difficulties in making data confess. Researchers of this stripe are rarely given the luxury of a lab, where one variable at a time can be changed, holding everything else constant. Ceteris is almost never paribus in social science. I give the authors credit, too, for their interpretation of results. For instance, they explained how the old cliché in real estate that your first offer will be your best may have a lot to do with the incentive structures of the seller’s agent. Say they’re slated to get 3% of the sale price. If it’s a matter of getting 0.03 x $300,000 right now and no longer needing to show the home versus holding out for 0.03 x $310,000 at some unknown point in the future, the usual counsel is to take the first offer. They’re only foregoing a potential $300. The homeowners’ incentive is very different. Say they owe the bank $250,000. For them it’s a matter of netting $50,000 or $60,000. Not surprisingly, the data show that realtors selling their own homes keep them on the market for longer and get a higher percentage of the true value.Some of their findings generated controversy. Read their account on the legalization of abortion and subsequent drop in crime rates 20 or so years later if you want an example. They were careful not to engage in moral calculus, but they had to know they were playing with fire.

The temptation would be even greater somewhere lJudging from the traffic tie-ups you see, I’m not the only one who slows down to gape at a car crash. The temptation would be even greater somewhere like Beverly Hills with a Ferrari involved. I suppose reading this book would fall under a similar rubric: gawking at a star betided by tragedy.By nearly all accounts, mine and the MacArthur’s included, DFW was a genius. This is all the more obvious given the essay format—-a good way to highlight his gift.* He saw big pictures, as his social commentary and cultural critiques made clear. He could also drill down to subtle human quirks which, though remote, are still recognizable (after he pointed them out). I’m sure his genius extended beyond my comprehension of it, too, especially with his more philosophical musings.** Though one of his goals was to lead readers to “aha” moments of insight, he never talked down to anyone to get there.The subjects were varied, covering topics like tennis (as a regionally ranked junior player he knew the sport well), television, the Illinois State Fair, literary theory, and cruise ship excursions. You get the feeling he could write about anything, though, and it would all be brilliant. He could vary his tone, too, alternating between professorial, sardonic, insightful, and funny. I guess in popular parlance you’d call him a hipster, but he seemed a little less edgy and a little more caring than others of that ilk. Now that I think about it, I shouldn’t even try to categorize such a multifaceted and unique individual.One passage in the book struck me as particularly good. From what I’ve seen, it was one of his recurring themes. It has to do with irony and irreverence as a rhetorical mode. Turns out, fun as it may be for a time, he views it all as ultimately unfulfilling. With an ironist’s repertoire of criticism and destruction, there’s rarely anything constructive to “replace the hypocrisies it debunks.” Consistent with that, in an interview I just read he spoke disparagingly of all the arch, pomo attitude there is these days. So why did he do it? To be honest I really didn’t read this looking for clues. It’s hard not to think of his fate, though, when he talked so honestly about despair, and fighting the urge to throw himself off the ship that he otherwise wrote so playfully about in the title piece. I suppose depression and bad chemistry were the clinical reasons, but it’s natural to wonder what within his outlook he might have revealed to tip his hand. Did he simply think too much and in increasingly inward ways? Was he too keenly aware of how different he was? Even his friends may not know. What I do know is that they miss him. That includes friends he never met; those he connected with through his works. *We might also conclude that the essay format is a way to see the curse of his genius, too, with hints of alienation in a world of average intelligence and a hyper-awareness of flaws including his own.**When an essay jumps right in saying that “In the 1960s the poststructuralist metacritics came along and turned literary aesthetics on its head by rejecting assumptions their teachers had held as self-evident and making the whole business of interpreting texts way more complicated by fusing theories of creative discourse with hardcore positions in metaphysics,” you know you’re in for a challenge.******You get really used to footnotes in a DFW essay. Maybe it’s just the way a really smart person’s mind works—-they can go on for hours with the asides their active noggins flit to, discursively disrupting the linear flow but in interesting ways. You get a lot of long sentences with him, too (I say hoping it's without irony as I flatter him with imitation in yet another nested aside)....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,not set,"Nov 21, 2008","Oct 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6748.A_Supposedly_Fun_Thing_I_ll_Never_Do_Again

Of course, the fact that it’s set in Norway is what triggered this thought. But there are other parallels, too: a kind of natural beauty that applies to both the writing and to the scenery described, episodes of darkness that depict the narrator’s melancholy as well as the long winter nights, and stoicism in the face of it all, with hints that more may be going on than is often expressed or observed.Trond is the central character. We hear his practical observations and poignant reflections as a man in his late sixties. He also tells us about the summer of 1948 when he was 15 years old and living in a cabin with his father. It’s a coming of age story with a having come of age perspective to boot. Both parts are done well. The alternating viewpoints are effective, never contrived.There are enough big events to drive the plot forward, but there’s plenty of thinking about it all, too. That’s a pretty good trick for a book less than 300 pages long. In it we get a real sense of the complicated feelings Trond has for his father. We also see how certain things are just inherently hard to discuss.

Her worshippers were researchers in a lab studying possible cures for cancer. The Way, the Truth, and the Light were the cause and effect relationships in the biological world that could be supported or denied by way of experiments. Some were attracted to this “church” for the chance to proselytize. One of the co-directors of the institute was an accomplished glad-hander and self-promoter. He was most fulfilled as a crusader for the cause, and proof of his virtue came through professional recognition as he trumpeted results and chased after scarce grant money. His partner at the lab was more of a pure scientist, a gifted and principled researcher. Verity itself was her Holy Grail. Faith, as practiced by the institute, directed as it was towards the scientific method, sustained them for a while. Like all religions, though, purity gets compromised when people are involved.The fly in the ointment here (to use a trite, but medical-sounding metaphor) was how all-too-human motivations might have gotten in the way of their results. We’re left wondering whether an important discovery and subsequent doubts cast on it were in any way driven by deceit, sloppiness, jealousy, romantic complications, and/or willful blindness. Goodman sounds very realistic in describing the lab and its issues. It must help that her mother was a biology professor and her sister is a medical researcher. She also does a great job conveying the brilliance of her characters. One presumes she’s a pretty smart cookie herself to do it so well. That said, though, I do have one criticism. There was a key element to the plot that she evidently wanted to leave somewhat ambiguous. The problem is that this was at odds with the omniscient narration that had been so forthcoming about where her characters’ heads were at everywhere else.

What I appreciated most was the rich contrast in character attitudes. Is it better to be an optimist offering the benefit of the doubt even if naively, or a pessimist giving the detriment of the doubt even if unfairly?Two of the main characters were artists. This gave Russo the chance to use their works to help interpret the story. It also brought analogies to mind. What kind of pictures would the author draw if he ever traded his keyboard for a sketchpad? I suspect he’d start with simple figures, then flesh them out with enough realism to see their true essence. Closer examination would reveal subtleties of tone and texture, with nary an affected flourish. Russo’s writing is always clear and unobtrusive. His greatest strength, though, is his insight into people and how he leads us to know them, too. He’s so good with the psychological descriptions that you may wonder whether the “show, don’t tell” rule was meant only for lesser lights than him, i.e., everyone else.A large part of the book focuses on two young guys who serve as the archetypes. They grow up in a fading industrial town in upstate New York – a crucible Russo’s readers know well. This town has the East side, West side, rich side, and black side. To be honest, the locational determinism was overplayed this time. Other influences rang true, though. For instance, Lucy (as Lou C. was dubbed by his classmates) was very much his father’s son. He had the same kind heart and magnanimous outlook as Big Lou. People-pleasing is the default when you’re averse to confrontation. Bobby, his counterpart, was much harder and braver; and wise to the ways of the world. Backing down was never an option for him. Lucy and Bobby had distinct biases, but were often perceptive about the people around them and, more importantly, even if intermittently, about themselves. If you could combine them to average out their extremes, you’d get a pretty decent meld as a result.The two main women in the story, Lucy’s mom and Sarah, Lucy’s girlfriend and friend of Bobby, were interesting, I thought. It was as though they were the judges in the contest between competing personality types and viewpoints. Fortunately, Russo gave them real lives and appealing traits so that you cared what judgments they made.I rate this one 4.51 stars, rounded to 5. Russo is almost always near the top of my list.

He was low man on the totem pole at a provincial English university where the one on top, Professor Welch, was a quirky twit of a man —- absent-minded and egocentric with an excess of class prerogative. Jim was not so lucky in love either. The woman he was with, a fellow academic, plied whatever feminine wiles were available to one with a rather plain appearance. Christine, the more striking young lady Jim met and liked, was spoken for by Professor Welch’s son, a pretentious snob and complete lout. Jim himself was not dashing, he lacked ambition, and he had a penchant for the bottle that could get him in trouble. He was likable, though. Amis blessed him with a keen, sardonic wit and an ability to see through the BS. Jim would be a great model for a Judd Apatow movie: the slacker with a brain trying to get what he wants without stepping on any but the most deserving toes.

It was published in 1954, an era when protocols were more proper and snide remarks were often just unspoken asides. At the same time, a certain political incorrectness seemed de rigueur, especially regarding women. This was also a period when the English equivalent to the G.I. Bill was in place and Amis knew from his own experiences as a university lecturer that cultural dynamics were changing. Lucky Jim was viewed as a victory for the common man.

I wonder if that was a large part of the critical appeal. The plot itself is interesting enough as fat, nerdy Oscar longs for a life with more spice. Cultural identity plays into his personal discord as Dominican Oscar, who grows up in Jersey, lacks the macho playah persona to fit the stereotype. Other characters get a big share of the storyline, too. In fact, there was so much tracking back to describe the lives of Oscar’s sister, mother, and roommate that I wasn’t always sure it would get back to Oscar. In a way the Dominican Republic itself was a character, and one that featured plenty of conflict. It was depicted as beautiful and lively, but also corrupt and violent. There is absolutely no doubt that, Rafael Trujillo, the dictator at the time Oscar’s mother grew up there was bad news--an egomaniacal sociopath, sexual predator, and fuku progenitor.  Fuku, which means curse, is just one of the many Spanish words you get in this book. I suspect, too, it’s often not the classic Castillian version we're getting. For instance, it stands to reason that parts involving hoochie mamas include idioms. I’d read somewhere that Diaz wanted language that was sometimes inaccessible to mirror the experiences of his characters.The book featured two narrators, Oscar and his college roommate Yunior. Both were writers. When an author features a writer, I often wonder if he has a greater than usual affinity for that character. In the case of two writers, maybe Diaz relates to both despite big differences. Yunior was machismo personified, though he did have moments of deeper reflection that played against type. Oscar was the one with more artistic sensitivity. I found myself liking him despite a lack of overlapping interests. His fantasy, sci fi, and comic book references mostly escaped me. My only real disappointment with Oscar, though, was his de facto conclusion about the most important thing in life and the trade he was willing to make for it. I won’t say more than that. I didn’t think Diaz did much to prod the intellect, but he did offer interesting profiles and plenty of cultural subtext.

Take a larger-than-life figure known to all, make him larger still, and overlay his story on top of one with little fame but deserving of more. The acclaimed character was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who turned out to be even more intriguing than his detective stories would suggest. From early days in Mam’s kitchen listening to chivalric tales of adventure, to heroics in sports and at war, Arthur liked thinking of himself as an honorable knight of the realm. Sherlock, if anything, is downplayed in this account while the events ultimately connecting Arthur to George are brought to the fore. Without tripping the spoiler alarm, I can say that George had a more stolid, less imaginative life growing up in a vicarage. His small bit of fame made quite a story, though. And thanks to Arthur, post-Victorian England came to know it. And thanks to Julian Barnes, we’ve come to know it, too. Barnes made the telling seem so effortless. He evoked the more formal era, but in a readable way. What’s more, he gave the characters plausible words and thoughts. It was well researched, clearly, often using personal letters as sources. The only reason I take a star away from an otherwise fabulous book is that an extrapolation in George’s thoughts at the end didn’t ring true for me. I strongly recommend 99.8% of this book, and I thank the astute Anglophile I married for recommending it to me....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"Feb 08, 2008","Jan 16, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45369.Arthur_George

To my eye, Stein has plenty of lit cred, too. In fact, you might come away thinking that he'd have all his charges writing literary fiction, with maybe a little Raymond Chandler thrown in for conflict and economy. But then he does say that good genre fiction and even non-fiction can benefit from the elements he covers. So what are these elements, you might ask? They're really too numerous to list. Beyond that, many will just strike you as obvious when stated in summary form (e.g., engage your reader right from the start, throw out superfluous adjectives, or the ever-popular ""show--don't tell""). The beauty, as usual, is in the examples. For those who recognize that writing is hard and are looking for ways to make it read easy, I give Stein a full nod.

An exception may occur if your friend is way more of an expert on the book’s topic than you are. In this case, said friend is a Roman history buff. To him, a book that assumes you already know the cast of characters in late antiquity, who conquered who, and how it all plays out in the end is just fine. That leaves more time for the smaller tiles of the mosaic instead. Unfortunately for me, a book with “Idiot” or “Dummy” in the title would have been more my speed. Too many pages featured some emperor’s son I’d never heard of leading the people of a region I don’t recognize in concert with some celebrated general beyond my ken against some nomadic horde I only know from crossword puzzles in a battle fought at some place that no longer appears on maps, known now as some other place I can’t locate, with gold to the victors measured in some unit no longer used, all resulting in the spread of some new branch of religion that differed from the old in some esoteric way.  Now that I’ve got that off my chest, I’ll concede that certain parts did interest me. For instance, did you know:- Justinian’s wife, Theodora, an important figure in the Orthodox Church, spent much of her youth as an actress dallying in brothels.- In battles at that time, catapults and battering rams were much less important than shovels. Tunneling under walls and building trenches to protect flanks were often keys to victory.- Constantinople (known earlier as Byzantium) was a bigger deal than Rome for a time.- Political factions were formed in the Byzantine capital, the Blues and the Greens, on the basis of which chariot racers they supported. - Roman middle men in the silk trade would keep some of the better samples they’d purchased before to sell back to the Chinese, and for a while kept prices lower by pretending they had their own high-quality source.- As a prime example of The Butterfly Effect, a volcano erupted, its ash lowered temperatures throughout much of Europe, a certain fast-to-adapt microbe carried by fleas infected rats that thrived in areas where grain was traded, the Y. pestis bacilli jumped onto humans in these densely populated areas, the resulting pandemic decimated large populations, Muhammad won a key battle over a plague-ravaged enemy enabling the spread of Islam, and Europe took its current atomized form, the empire having been disintegrated due in no small part to the demon bug.Tidbits like this were at least partial compensation for the dry and scholarly bits....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Oct 05, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/469493.Justinian_s_Flea

Taleb goes to great lengths to point out how some of the original assumptions made in investments and finance have blown up in people’s faces. Yes, unusual events do happen more often than a normal distribution suggests. Yes, relationships among securities can change in meltdown scenarios. And yes, people are regularly fooled into thinking luck is skill. However, some market participants are clear-sighted enough to see those shrouded risks for what they are and make better assumptions about how they should be traded off against expected returns. These more enlightened investors don’t get the print, though, since they’re not the straw men Taleb can knock down.Don’t get me wrong. We all like debunking stodgy, established wisdom when we see the holes. If you’re like Taleb, though, and see only holes, what you’re left with is nothing. What might there be in its place? Some models, when tweaked, are still useful.In a brief moment of modesty, Taleb confesses to psychological weaknesses that can lead him to mistake noise for signal. He seems rather smug about it all, though. It’s like he figures his ability to recognize himself as a fool puts him on a higher plane. For the most part, his ego is openly displayed. It’s also coupled with an axe to grind – an aggressive combination. His fund has consistently underperformed (though he would counter that he’s positioned just right for the coming holocaust). His investment strategy boils down to buying lots and lots of insurance contracts against rare occurrences that he thinks will be slightly less rare. (In actuality, he buys stock options, but the insurance metaphor illustrates the point.) The problem is he’s so firm in his belief that the insurance companies have underestimated risks that he thinks all premiums are too low. However, those selling options, armed with models that account for rare events appropriately, will charge more than enough to cover those risks.Who will be fortune’s fool? Time will tell, but a provocateur like Taleb will in all probability be better known for his quasi-epistemological exposition on unanticipated variability than for any true investment success....more",Notes are private!,0,106,1,not set,not set,"Sep 03, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness

Billy, the book’s main character, survived the firebombing just as Vonnegut did. Both recognized the good fortune of their underground prison vantage point when the flames incinerated the city above. Both had plenty to cope with, too. In telling Billy’s story, Vonnegut connects several themes. Not surprisingly, “war is hell” is one of them. Some of the other points set this work apart, though. For one, there's a feeling among many of those involved that you might as well just resign yourself to--or disengage yourself from--your situation. There’s a strong sense of the inevitable. (I don’t imagine prisoners feel much power to change the circumstances of their war.) I suppose you could label this work science fiction, even though the elements that make it so are clichéd and simplistic. The sci-fi angle is one Vonnegut uses to good effect, though. It points out how otherworldly a war scene can feel, how memories can be real enough to throw the time continuum out of synch, and how some superior intelligence in the universe can explain, almost deterministically, why things are as they are and people do as they do.Does Vonnegut himself believe in free will? If his brainy little space creatures serve as proxies, I’d say no. Something tells me he has a more active, moral role in mind for humankind, though, and this book was meant to suggest that by counterexample.

Despite the accolades I didn’t know what to think going into it. For one, I imagined the language would seem a little dainty and old-fashioned. For another, it was mostly set on a vegetable farm – not exactly promising. The first few pages scared me, too, with talk of bustles and complex, compound feminine emotions like exhilarated wariness.

In fact, if a single word could describe it, I’d probably just call it beautiful.

It makes you appreciate what a complex organ the brain is when you see all the different ways that impairments can manifest themselves. Sacks is at his best when he's describing the most unusual quirks. The first chapter -- the case that gives the book its title -- is a good lead-in to the weird behaviors that follow.At the time the book was written, these disorders must have seemed even more unusual. However, by now, most everyone knows about Tourette's syndrome, inability to recognize faces, and savants with amazing abilities in music or math. In fact, there was one example where autistic twin brothers saw a box of toothpicks fall to the floor and almost instantaneously said, in unison, 111. Of course, this is a scene out of Rain Man. The movie must have borrowed from the book which predates it. What struck me most, though, was how brain science could seem so clinically precise yet still so remote and inscrutable. At one moment the author may say ""similar hyperosmia, sometimes paroxysmal, may occur in excited hyper-dopaminogic states,"" and in another offer ""globular clusters and nebulae of numbers whorling and evolving in an ever-expanding mental sky"" as explanation. Huh?Some may say that the more we understand of brain mechanics, cause and effect, chemical reactions, and modelable outcomes, the less room there is for things like free will and human spirit. This can be a depressing thought. Where's the romance in robotics? I still like to believe in something that proxies for a soul, though, even if it does reduce down to just hardware, software, and inputs. At least what each of us has is unique, and that's special enough. (Thanks, Susan, for your thoughts prompting this topic.)A book like this that helps us understand how the brain functions by showing how a damaged brain malfunctions still leaves a lot that's unexplained. In my view, neurology is asking new questions at a faster rate than it's answering old ones. I like it like that.

The good people in this case are Calvin, the writer, and his dearly departed wife, Alice. As you might expect from a loving tribute, pedestals and pathos are intrinsic. The earnest Trillin, smitten to the core, did his best to make her real, but still may have crossed into too-good-to-be-true territory. In a way, I had hoped for as much. Devotion suits him. Other things I’d read made him seem like such a pleasant fellow: humorous without trying too hard (in contrast to, say, Dave Barry), ironic without seeming smug (unlike many post-modern types), and self-deprecating without being disingenuous (unlike me, for instance (I say with what I hope is the right kind of irony)). In a piece like this, he had to veer a few degrees away from his usual drollery and light touch. He still came across as a mensch, but a sadder one given his loss.To hear him tell it, Alice was too good for him. She was smart, attractive, classy, and kind. He mentioned how when he first met her at a party, at the apex of his own charm and wit, she seemed to him to glow. In the scant seventy some pages that followed, he shared a handful of stories about their family life together. They were, to use the most precise word I can think of, nice – simple and spare with no hint of pretense or deeper understanding. I just wish there were more.

He’s witty, full of good stories, and can appreciate the smaller pleasures the world has to offer. His writing suggests that it’s better to be warm, amusing, and inclusive than edgy, preposterous, and bigger-than-life. This book ties together anecdotes and observations from various trips he, his wife Alice, and their girls had taken through the years. Local cuisine was often a focus. My own wife and I liked Alice’s criterion for judging the gelati in Italy. (Crema is the perfect numeraire.) I also thought Trillin’s tip for fitting in at a Paris café was useful. (It involved staring abjectly into space muttering, “Quelle ironique.”) As a family, they enjoyed staying in the same out-of-the-way town in France every summer, indulging in local pleasures such as table-top foosball. Reading Travels with Alice we see the virtues of a more laid back approach to life, sans glitz.

See if you can guess who it is from the clues.Tragedy struck at a young age when villainous men took all that was dear to him. As he grew older, he drew strength from his vow to get even with those who had caused this death and despair. With a focus and will beyond all human proportion, he readied himself for revenge. His immense wealth gave him the means and the influence needed to carry out his plans. He was physically strong and a master of weapons, with nary a trace of fear. At the same time, he was a man of impeccable honor. His sense of justice, though inordinate, was never less than fair. By disguising his true identity, motivations from his other life remained hidden. With his shrewdness and stealth, perps rarely saw rectitude coming their way. I suppose it's as we’d expect in a tale such as his that good would be pure good and evil pure evil. Good may have had moments of doubt, but any inner turmoil would give way to the real conflicts: vanquishing bad guys. So, can you guess who it is? Turns out it’s The Dark Knight himself, Gotham’s own Caped Crusader. For any of you misled into thinking it was the Count of Monte Cristo, I suppose that’s understandable.I’m rating this somewhere in the 4 to 5 range. It’s a great story with lots going on to keep the pages turning. There were recognizable human traits on display, too, even if they did veer towards the noble and sublime at one extreme or the no-good and slimy at the other. It may not be fair for me to downgrade it on literary merit or lack of roundedness since the transcription I read was abridged. But hey, at least it wasn’t the Classic Comic Book version. Nor was it the one Bob Kane did for DC Comics, though my view may have been colored by his like-minded hero....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,not set,"Jul 31, 2007",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/522110.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo

It all portends a memoir that is sad, funny, smart, and honest. He shrewdly pre-empts criticism about his self-obsession by professing to be self-conscious about it – a kind of meta-awareness that’s somehow more appealing. It’s clear before the book begins that he’s got that Gen X hipster axe to wield for sarcastic, irreverent purposes. Since he playfully/helpfully includes a key to the book’s metaphors in the preface, I thought I’d explain that my use of “axe” is meant as something to grind and also as something to swing as he hacks his way through the bonds of literary convention.The story itself is about how he, as a young twenty-something, had to face the death of both parents within a few months of each other and then raise his 8-year-old brother. He’s a very protective stand-in, but not a conventional one. At times he’s mature and mindful, and at other times the slacker dude persona wins out. This much is clear, though – he truly likes his little brother. Eggers’ other storyline – how he and some friends published a humor magazine for their own demographic – showed him to be inventive and edgy in a fittingly self-indulgent way. He played with a few devices to dig deeper into his own psyche, too. These revelations (by way of other people who had somehow managed to see his soul) were risky from a writing perspective, but worked pretty well I thought. It was like creating a Dr. Melfi to interpret Tony Soprano, but without the bother of making it realistic. When it was all said and done, I liked the book. I’m not entirely sure I’d like Eggers himself, though, in large part because I don’t think he'd like many of us.

That by itself justifies a minimum of 3 stars. He turns a phrase as well as anyone in modern litFirst let me say that this Franzen guy, he can write. That by itself justifies a minimum of 3 stars. He turns a phrase as well as anyone in modern literature, with a style that is both artful and incisive. His brainpower is on display just about every page. In a way, though, that’s part of my frustration with the book. When someone as clever as Franzen is sharing insights, you might hope for some traits to borrow or views to adopt from his characters—something to include in your own eclectic portfolio. But the Lamberts (the family he profiles in the book) lack the people skills that could redeem them. They’re relationship nitwits, in fact, especially with each other. It’s like they can’t see one move ahead on the chessboard of human interactions. It’s apparently a mystery how pointing out each other’s warts can lead to hard feelings all around.Despite the corrections each is meant to have made, they show precious few signs of growth. Alfred and Enid, the elderly parents, are less developed probably because Franzen can’t imagine much depth for their demographic. Alfred has failing health, both mentally and physically, and was never very engaging even before. Enid is defined by her idée fixe—that a Norman Rockwell Christmas should be the family’s loftiest goal. The adult kids fall well short of the happy ideal. Gary is financially savvy, but in a sad trap partly of his own making with his wife and boys. Chip, who I’m guessing is the one Franzen relates to himself (intellectual, idealistic, and in a funk due to bad luck, not bad intent) is given some hope, but we’re never sure how real it is with him. Denise, the baby of the family, had a bumpy ride, too—up and down with relationships (mostly down), her career, and her empathy quotient.The many flaws are not entirely far-fetched, though. On a bad day you might imagine going part of the way to their dyspeptic extremes before impulse controls contravene. The author is wise in that cool, disaffected, modern American way about the assholishness of the world. I’ll add another star to the rating for his snarky elan in revealing it. I like character studies, in general, sometimes including characters I dislike. Besides, I don’t want to seem so middle-aged, middlebow, and Midwestern that I missed the point: that of the hipster’s “tragedy as farce”....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,not set,"Jul 22, 2008","Jul 31, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3805.The_Corrections

Alessandro ends up getting off as a kind of protest and faces a distant journey on foot with the impressionable young man who’d been left behind. Along the way, Alessandro tells him (and us) quite a story. It’s filled with events and perspectives prior to the war that hint at the kind of soldier he ultimately becomes. Then it’s off to the Great War itself with all the context you would ever need to see it for what it was.Had the lone theme of the book been “war is hell”, it still would have been very good. We’re made to care about these guys, which is the key to hating whatever can snuff them out. But Helprin expanded way beyond that. I tried to figure out what made it so much better than other books of its type and concluded that it had a lot to do with Helprin’s confidence. He knew his research was good so that Alessandro’s many duties as an Italian soldier seemed genuine. Surviving the front lines, climbing the Alps, chasing deserters, awaiting a death sentence, recovering in a hospital--it all seemed very real. At the same time Helprin mixed in some elements bordering on the surreal, almost silly, but all to good effect. There were even a few laughs, which are not easy to fold into a work like this. What impressed me most, though, in this vein of self-assurance was how Helprin gave this courageous, war-hardened man a heightened sense of aesthetics and love. An intellect like Alessandro’s, which was well-schooled and constantly at work, would come across as stilted in most any other writer’s hands. Thankfully, Helprin knew he had the chops to make it work.This is one of my wife’s favorite books of all time. Now I know why.

He gave his characters enough life to care about them, too, which I don’t imagine is always the case with stories of this sort. I have to say I also came away with a greater appreciation for historical fiction, in general. It’s such a painless and effective way to learn things you may not have known much about. Plus, if the writer is as good as this one is, the story itself can be artful and involving. It comes as no surprise, Susan, that you’ve been right all along about books of this stripe....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Aug 2007,"Jul 30, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/253555.The_Foreign_Correspondent

That explains my yet-to-be-published collection of fan fiction, unauthorized sequels, and twists in perspective. I first discovered this talent/affliction as a boy when I imagined a fourth little pig who leveraged himself to the hilt, built a luxury skyscraper, and, with YUGE block letters at its base, labelled it Pig Tower. The Big Bad Wolf, as a professional courtesy (and quite possibly with the promise of kickbacks), agreed to a huff and puff waiver. As a teen I wrote a follow-up to Kurt Vonnegut’s classic that I called Slaughterhouse-Six. It was set in a mirror image world where war was devastating the planet Tralfamadore. Fortunately, the protagonist, Libby Mirglip, survived the bombs and lived a varied if not full life after the conflict. She was aided by alien visitors from planet Earth who showed her, through their own less enlightened example, what not to do. I’d prefer not to go into the details of one my more recent works, Fifty-two Shades of Grey. If it’s ever published, it’ll be under an assumed name, or maybe names – I’m toying with the idea of S. and M. John. BTW, I saw that some other joker stole my basic idea and technically beat me to the preferred number fifty-one.This brings us to my latest, Catch-23. Since I’ve already done an absurdist post-war account of tragedy/comedy with Slaughterhouse-Six, I wanted to steer clear of such a heavy/humorous theme this time. Instead, Catch-23 is the story of a local seafood restaurant on 23 S. Washington St. in Naperton, Illinois. They became famous for their Shrimp Yossarian. Then a new executive chef upped the number of times customers would fly through the doors by offering Skate Wing Schnitzel a la Scheisskopf, Major Major Mahi Mahi, and Stuffed Oysters Orr-style. Naperton’s whore gave the story some much needed spice. (As with any fan fiction, references will only be appreciated by those who know the original.)Oh, and hey, there is a catch here. Against your better judgment, you continued reading each ridiculous example in this exercise of “one more."" Making it this far means you’ve read “one more” paragraph all the way to the end. The catch is that you must be crazy enough to perceive this as a payoff....more",Notes are private!,0,132,1,not set,Jan 1979,"Jul 30, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/168668.Catch_22

In time, a fan is rewarded for picking up on subtleties, aspiring to be among the cognoscenti. Then in the more mature and philosophical stages the proselytizing begins and the sport may even become “a metaphor for life.” With an objective step back, though, Gods and heroes become mortal. Joe McGinniss is a football (a.k.a. soccer) fan who has been through these stages. He does a great job describing how emotionally all-consuming il calcio can be to its many devotees in Italy. The die-hard AC Milan supporter in the preface was a vivid example. Joe’s status as a passionate fan may also explain his blinkered self-absorption. For example, he second-guesses the coach at every turn—-something I suppose a true partisan may feel is his right and duty. What started as pure delight that someone as perceptive and witty as Joe was writing about his exhilarating days deep in Italian football later became a slightly disappointing realization that Joe is an even bigger fan of Joe. He wants us all to know that he quickly learned the new language and became one of the boys. Then, when their laundry got dirty, he shows us how sparkling clean his own was in contrast. The story is so compelling, though, and the personalities so well drawn that the negatives fall short of tipping the scales.

Certainly you’d have to say he’s quirky, in a wordplayful sort of way. His eccentric use of metaphors is like a Catskills comedian’s use of one-liners – it’s a big part of the act. There’s usually some substance to his writing, too. The social commentary is often straight from the flower power perspective, but he’s more insightful than most when it comes to articulating a view. He was an art major in school and did graduate work in religious history before becoming a journalist. Maybe I find him interesting because I have such a different background. The less structured thinking in a book like Jitterbug Perfume is a good antidote to econometric analysis texts.It was a long time ago that I read my favorite Robbins books, but I think I’d still appreciate the humor, the artistry, and the full twisting verbal layouts in the pike position. One of the themes I remember from this particular selection was summarized in one word: “erleichda” (meaning “lighten up”). It was a lesson worth learning after dealing with Boston traffic to and from my first job.Robbins may not be everyone’s cup of tea.

Nobody's Fool has several of the best characters of all time. Sully is hard to beat as a likably flawed, smarter-than-he-seems survivor in a seemingly small world.

Even so, Lonesome Dove continues to hold a spoIt was quite a few years ago that I read this epic tale, and I’ve read a lot of great books since then. Even so, Lonesome Dove continues to hold a spot in my top ten. I’m thinking as a tribute to this longstanding favorite that I should do something different. So this will not be a run-of-the-mill ; it’ll be a meta- instead. I’ll be distilling the wisdom of the crowd in a kind of ensemble piece, finding repeated observations from the book’s top ten Goodreads s to emphasize its best qualities even more. Before I get to the content itself, let me first mention that this sample was biased to the upside, with an average rating of 4.9. As “like” dispensers, we’re attracted to enthusiasm, and in my mind this book warrants every bit of that. Goodreaders like colorfully worded diatribes, too, but that’s irrelevant here. Hardly anyone rated this book below 4 stars. The other thing I’ve noticed about some books is that positions at the top of their scroll often reflect the overall popularity of the ers themselves, which may or may not speak to the content of the s. Several of those on a par with John Lennon (who in 1966, by his own informal polling, had surpassed Jesus Christ) may simply attach a gif, write a catch phrase or two, and call it a day. I saw nothing like that for this one. I figure that’s a sign that the substance of this book matters—it’s worth a full discussion. So here are the common elements that I gleaned.You’ll fall in love with the charactersSix of the ten s mentioned this explicitly. For good reason, I say. McMurtry gives us plenty of time to walk in their boots. It’s not just with the two main characters either, former Texas Rangers Augustus “Gus” McCrae and Woodrow Call. As one er noted, the secondary characters were rounded out too. Deets, Pea Eye, and young Newt were unforgettable members of the Hat Creek Cattle Company. Gus, the loquacious tale-teller and true-blue friend, along with Call, the taciturn leader and man of principle, were clearly the stars, though.What a journey!Five ers made a point of mentioning how arduous a task it was to drive cattle from Texas all the way up to Montana. The many hardships along the way were a big reason for the next common theme that the top ers mentioned:It’s longThe Pocket Books edition I read (a misnomer unless your pockets are really big) weighed in at 945 pages. A large percentage of it covered the drive, with perils abounding. The weather, the land, and a nasty piece of work called Blue Duck all contributed to their travails. Three of the five who mentioned the length, though, also pointed out that it was paced well. The dialog, the entertaining anecdotes, and changes in perspective all helped keep the pages turning. Only one person said they thought it could have been improved with more stringent editing. Great storyFour ers provided a plot summary and mentioned how engrossing it was. The adventure began when fellow ex-Ranger Jake Spoon was talking up the largely unsettled land up in Montana where an ambitious bunch could do well for themselves as ranchers. Call took the bait. Gus, the dutiful friend, had an ulterior motive for going named Clara, a love interest in Nebraska. Another woman, the young and attractive Lorena, was the central figure in several side stories. Other subplots involving frontier justice, pigheadedness, and random bad luck were worth telling too.I laughed, I cried, I ____Those weren’t the exact words that four of the ers used, but that was the gist. As for the blanks, one said “got pissed off,” another said something to the effect of “soiled myself,” and yet another said “felt their indecisiveness.” I might have said “prayed to the God of Western tropes for a little mercy.” But let’s not lose sight of the laughing and the crying. A great writer like McMurtry knows how to make us do both.Gus gushingsThree ers stated explicitly that they loved Gus. I can see why. He was a rare combination of wise and impetuous, hedonistic and dependable, and he was a straight shooter in every sense. You couldn’t imagine a truer cowboy philosopher king.Prize winnerThis won a Pulitzer in 1986 as was noted in three of the s.Led to a great mini-seriesThree more s mentioned the popular and critically acclaimed mini-series that stemmed from the book. This was one of the best adaptations at a time before screenwriters had really mastered the art. It helped to have such a great cast: Robert Duvall as Gus, Tommy Lee Jones as Call, Danny Glover as Deets, Diane Lane as Lorena, Anjelica Huston as Clara, and plenty of other name brand actors. It ended up winning seven Emmy Awards.You don’t have to like Westerns to like thisHad this been a standard format , I’d have been tempted to lead with this. Two of the top ten did mention it, so I’m glad this important point has been made. It’s not that the book tries to distance itself from its Western roots. (You still taste dust and you still care about who's wearing the white hats, the black hats, and ones that are varying shades of gray.) It’s more that it expands upon the genre and executes it all to perfection. Picture from the mini-seriesI was a little surprised to see that only one , and it was a good one, included a movie still. I suspect in a lot of minds now, the thought of Gus and Call are intrinsically linked to Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Maybe this goes with what I was saying before, though, that a classic like this lends itself to words more than images to express the deeper impact it has as a book.Special thanks to Melissa ♥ Dog/Wolf Lover ♥ Martin, Aaron, Brina, Bill Kerwin, Kemper, Matthew, Arah-Lynda, Joe Valdez, Em Lost In Books, and Fabian for participating (unwittingly) in this .

To hear some people describe it (even people I usually correlate well with), this book is a laugh-scream riot. Hopes grow even higher when you hear the story about Toole’s mother who, after his suicide, finally gets the thing published, then sits back to watch the prizes pour in. What I viewed as a miss may have been because the bar was so high. It could be, too, that I’m just not predisposed to dysfunctional characters, all bloated with self-importance. The protagonist (or antagonist depending on how you see him) is Ignatius J. Reilly. He’s decidedly offbeat, which is all well and good, but I just didn’t think he was funny. Not all guys with yinged-out hair are brilliant physicists either, much as we might surmise.That’s just my opinion. Plenty of people disagree. It was a long time ago that I read it, so factor that in as well. Maybe guys like George Costanza have now gotten me used to whiny, self-centered anti-strivers as sources of humor.I sometimes wonder why certain works are so polarizing. In this case I think lots of people saw a big misanthropic id running roughshod and had to laugh. Others of us were just annoyed. (Do I sound like a terrible curmudgeon right now? I just did a check on my sense of humor and found that it generally goes for sarcasm, irony, and even shtick. Must just have been this brand where I didn’t.)...more",Notes are private!,0,108,1,not set,not set,"Jul 30, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/310612.A_Confederacy_of_Dunces

I've since come to view it in a different light, and now believe it's one of the finest books ever written.April 1It's funny how things can change. I recall really liking this book the first time I read it back in about 8th grade. Maybe I should have just left well enough alone. It was a pleasant memory from my youth. Why spoil things by picking it up again as a more clear-sighted (some might say jaundiced)adult? I probably wouldn't view my favorite book from 4th grade, The Secret Weapon, the same way either. The intense drama of a glue-fingered benchwarmer called in at the end of the big game to catch the winning touchdown might seem shallow and contrived to the current me.I realize I'm swimming against the tide here, but how many of you have reread this supposed masterpiece in your more mature years? With that perspective, I can't be the only one to see Scout as the rather obvious wish-fulfillment of Harper Lee. Reading since infancy, brave as any boy, inherently fair-minded, a noble spirit well beyond her years... C'mon, Harper; you've got to give her some flaws mere humans can relate to. Now Jem, in comparison, was a run-of-the-mill dullard. As written, he's not necessarily going to grow up to be the depraved male in a Lifetime movie, but it's clear that Ms. Lee doesn't much care for this kid with the penis. And Dill? How can we not think of him as the future Truman Capote, fat and affected?My real problem with the book, though, now that my blinkers are off, is the pure perfection of Atticus. His progressivity knows no bounds. You're going to tell me that a lawyer is capable of empathy and integrity?!? And where is the complexity of context, you might ask. Wouldn't this son of the South, to be at all realistic, have wrestled a grudge match against himself, his Doppelcracker, if you will? Even modern-day hacks know to include that much conflict. Clearly, Atticus is a balm to assuage white guilt for a nasty racial past, but I wonder if that by itself qualifies as clothes for the emperor. Ironically, people who are happy to applaud the courage Atticus displayed in standing against popular sentiment will likely castigate me for doing the same.Whenever you take an extreme view (and I know I have; even defying Oprah, for chrissake), you have to wonder what that says about you more than it does about the work under . Maybe had this been March 31 or April 2, I would have felt differently, but today I felt a strange need to rock the Goodreads boat. Did anyone fall out?

I seem to recall reading at least some of it before resorting to the Cliffs Notes. The guy stole a loaf of bread, right? I can't remember what happened when Javert caught him. Presumably, from the title, punishment. ;-)Seriously, this was an eye-opener. Dostoyevsky lived a while ago in a place far away, but he had insights into human nature (even complex, philosophical aspects) that seemed more sophisticated than I would have thought possible. I suppose that’s a common conceit. Each new generation believes itself to be the first to consider the subtle workings of the mind until classics teach them otherwise.[Note: I inserted the reference to Les Miserables as an admittedly poor attempt at self-effacing humor. I know all about Jean Valjean from Classics Comics.]...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,not set,"Jul 30, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7144.Crime_and_Punishment
