I think it's really interesting how Judd spruces in (what I assume are) his own perspectives on being an author (I don't remember the exact quote but there's something about how honesty is the most crucial factor for writing, for example), and while the story's a bit depressing, it definitely offers some insight into what might be considered as important for writing as a career. Maybe I'll have to think about some of this in my own writing, although I don't know if I agree with all of it.Plot was really cool, but I did feel that the characters themselves lacked a bit of dimension. Like, I wanted to get to understand the narrator a bit more and really empathize with him, but I felt like I couldn't just because of Judd's style of writing. There were some details that I felt should've been replaced by or added to with emotion, as I think that definitely could've helped. The ending was also depressing, although it kinda fit the rest of the book.As for the annotations though, this is I think the first annotated book I've ever read! Thanks Violet! So much fun and I loved how it wasn't only my own thoughts on the page as I was reading. Really helped to get another perspective on the book as a whole, which was a very cool experience. This also means if I ever annotate another book, I think I gotta improve my own annotating skills......more",Notes are private!,1,5,1,Apr 2024,"Apr 06, 2024","Mar 02, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1126169.The_Devil_s_Own_Work

Kinda felt like we were in a discussion with the tone, which I really loved and made for a nicely-paced read. He also makes his perspective on writing pretty clear. A few key takeaways I noted: - Story first, characters second, everything else (themes, symbolism, etc.) afterwards - Planning a plot beforehand is a near-surefire way to fail, instead the writing should come naturally which will also make the story, characters, etc. more natural (I'm not sure how much I agree with this, but I'll think about and try to write with this in mind, see how it goes) - Create a writing schedule - Lots of writing and lots of reading are required to make a good writer (this one's obvious) - 2nd draft = 1st draft - 10% - Place honesty above all else - if you're not writing honest to what you're feeling/imagining (if you're forcing something that isn't true to what you're imagination says), it's not going to turn out greatI also put in a few sticky notes for any potential future reference of things I found interesting. There was one quote I especially loved in which King pictures imagination as a muse living in your basement. It's probably not the most elegant metaphor, but idk it kinda stuck with me:""[The muse] is a basement guy. You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor... while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you... He may not be much to look at... [but] the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. There's stuff in there that can change your life.""...more",Notes are private!,9,3,1,"Jan 21, 2024","Jan 27, 2024","Jan 21, 2024",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10569.On_Writing

The plot line itself is quite crazy, with some elements of magical/horror fiction artfully woven with historical interpretation, a nonlinear plot, seamless transitions between character perspectives (sometimes too seamless), very human emotions (sometimes hard to understand, but that's what makes us human), and so much more.Definitely the most challenging book I've read (even the basic storyline can be confusing at times), but really worth spending time on.

It's much more of a character study, and of a character who's extraordinarily set in his ways as a butler. The characters, Mr. Stevens, definitely has some opinions I don't agree with, and it's certainly frustrating at times to listen to his thoughts and unyielding perspectives, but it's an interesting read nonetheless. The voice in this book is very clear and unique, falling directly in line with what a mid-20th century butler probably sounded like, and as a result some of the vocabulary is pretty funny (joke = witticism, for example). I also think it's very interesting how Ishiguro manages to take what would usually be considered a background character and bring his life to the forefront, taking into account his recollections, memories, emotions, suppression of emotions, and more. Sometimes, he'll go on long tangents about the smallest of things for several pages, but I think it all contributes to the charm and realistic take of the novel.About halfway through the book, I might've rated this slightly higher than a 4.1, but the ending doesn't seem like much of an ending. I get that it's realistic for the character, so that's a positive, but it didn't seem to conclude the novel. Ishiguro could just have well wrote another 150 pages, and it still could've been interesting.Anyway, I'd recommend it if you're into character studies, 20th century England, deep reflections, unique voice and perspective, and/or a character who can't make a good joke for his life....more",Notes are private!,6,2,1,"Aug 22, 2023","Sep 02, 2023","Aug 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28921.The_Remains_of_the_Day
