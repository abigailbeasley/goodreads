Who is producing all these guns and making them available to every person who can put on a uniform, legit or not and swagger around with their big guns.

No way to tell if these guys were legit or not, and considering how much corruption there is does ""legit"" count for much? I've been on both sides of the opinions on illegals but one thing I notice is that Mexicans (legal or illegal I don't know) work hard and at jobs that are more taxing, say roofing, road construction, cleaning and child care. The other thing I think about is that the land wasn't originally ours. Life is hardly fair but remembering to be compassionate and putting humanity before rigid rules is what seems right to me.

So how come they turned out so different? That is the question that Wes Moore, the author, is trying to answer as he feels his story could have been the other Wes Moore's story and vice versa. He spends quite a bit of time visiting the other Wes Moore in jail and they share and compare their lives. Even though there are many similarities between their lives I feel like there are some significant differences. Wes the author, left Baltimore with his mother and siblings when he was still an adolescent boy. They went to live in the Bronx with his grandparents. Wes's father had lived with his family until he passed away from a sudden illness when Wes was three. Wes's parents and grandparents were all college educated. His grandfather was a Presbyterian minister and his grandmother was a school teacher. They owned their own home in the Bronx. The Bronx wasn't much better than inner city Baltimore but Wes had a great deal of family support. His mother put him in a white school outside of the Bronx which created quite a lot of problems for young Wes as he didn't fit into the neighborhood because of his school and he didn't fit into his school because of his skin color and his neighborhood. Still, it was a different experience than always being in his neighborhood and never experiencing anything different. Also his extended family were close and they visited Jamaica when he was a child (quite a few times I think). When he was getting into trouble his family made the difficult and expensive decision to send him to military school which changed his future in a huge way. He became a leader of men and has been on a straight path ever since from what I understand. The Wes Moore who ended up a convict never left Baltimore, his mother had wanted to go to college but when the Pell grants were stopped she didn't have the money to go. His father was never part of his life. His older brother became a feared drug dealer in the neighborhood and Wes admired him greatly. Wes, in his turn became a drug dealer although never a drug consumer. He had good organizational and leadership skills and the money from dealing and running a crew was a lot of money. He fathered four children with two different women by a very early age, 20? His second woman was a drug addict and he could see how destructive it was to someone he loved. He wanted out of the drug trade so he went through the Job Corp program. He trained as a carpenter and did very, very well. But afterwards, after a year of working minimum wage jobs and trying to support his four children and their mothers and his own mother, eventually the pressure was too much and he fell back into old ways. This was how he came to be part of a robbery with his brother and two other men. This robbery resulted in the death of a policeman. Life in jail was inevitable for both brothers.So, the neighborhood and culture has a huge effect on the children but so does family and education. No question in my mind that both mothers tried their best and loved their children fiercely. I appreciate this book for furthering my education and helping me to understand cultural differences. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 09, 2023","Oct 15, 2023","Oct 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7099273-the-other-wes-moore

This was footage produced by Robert Flaherty in the 1920's. It was meant to show the life of the Inuit but it was, essentially, fiction. While Robert was filming this he had an affair with his lead female Inuit girl. This produced a male child, Josephie Flaherty; a child that Robert Flaherty knew about but never acknowledged, and Robert Flaherty never returned to the Arctic. When Josephie was a man, in 1953, the Canadian government, for reasons complex and unreasonable, decided to move Inuit ""volunteers"" and their families to the High Arctic. This is not normal Arctic. This is like a massive ice sculpture, with severe winds, crashing ice bergs in the water, very close to no vegetation, and almost no land animals to hunt making it necessary to go on to the very unstable and dangerous sea ice to hunt sea mammals. The people had never lived in such an environment, they were used to the Arctic, not the High Arctic which was a different world entirely. They were severely under equipped in every way: clothing, shelters, stoves, lighting, sleds, dogs, building materials etc. And it was completely dark for 5 or 6 months of the year.They were simply expected to be able to handle this because they were Inuit. There were small children, even babies. The people had been told they could return after a year if they didn't care to stay up there. That didn't happen, they were not allowed to return to their homeland. All suffered, a significant number died. Josephie was one of the people who, with his wife and kids, went to the High Arctic. It is Martha, his six year old who was hunting with her father at that age as he had no other helper or partner to hunt with, who later went south and became an activist for her people. This story is very important; historically, politically, socially and ethically. In my opinion, everyone should read this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 27, 2023","Sep 24, 2023","Aug 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/577243.The_Long_Exile

In the incident covered in this book, a shipment of monkeys sent to the U.S start becoming ill. As more and more monkeys fall ill the staff at the monkey house are becoming concerned. What is wrong with them and is it contagious for humans? Their organs are dissected and examined under microscope - oh sh*t, is Ebola Zaire? It sure looks like and reacts like Ebola Zaire. It is a hot Level 4 virus and a deadly threat to the human population. So the army takes over eliminating the monkeys and running all aspects of the bio-containment that does not involve actual sick people. The U.S. military in its usual clunky style throws all at it and finesses nothing. Luckily the virus was slightly mutated and was terribly contagious and deadly for monkeys but didn't affect humans at all.

There are two brothers, one of whom escaped most of the experience of the war, the other brother who was not able to leave until after the war. Brother one arrives in England with his wife and they move into an apartment. They have a baby girl and are extremely protective. Basically they never leave the apartment, the building's interior is their world. Their daughter has a wider world as she goes to school. Her education is the paramount importance of her parents. They see education as her ticket to success, as many parents do. The daughter thinks her parents are her only relatives but one day a man shows up at the apartment door and tries to give her chocolate. Her father and the stranger get into a loud argument, the stranger is not welcomed and warned never to come again. No explanation is offered to the daughter. Years pass, history happens. One of the things that happens is that a slum landlord is in the news for his crimes, is prosecuted and goes to jail. It is the man who had come to the door.

What happens in the infant brain if loving interaction is occurring, what happens if it is not. And how is the time of infancy related to the later mental health and behavior of the growing child and adult. Although I think I basically knew most of this I did not know it in such forceful and convincing detail. I wish every pregnant person could be taught this information and every parent should have enough support to be able to provide the best environment for their infant. As I see the news everyday and the daily abuse and murder of babies and small children I think we are just going backwards and I am not sure why although the isolation of COVID did a lot of damage. Since most women will become mothers shouldn't girls be taught infant care and infant brain development? Shouldn't boys be taught as well since they will most likely become fathers? Education and psychology seem very ""I"" based. When the focus is directed outwards it is towards skills that may or may not be used by an individual in their working environment. Rarely is the education toward parenting and infant development. Parenting classes are most often used too late, after a parent has been found to be doing a poor job, has come under scrutiny by child protective services and so has been ordered to take a parenting class.

I was six years old but I spent a lot of time in N. Edwards because my grandparents lived out there and owned a restaurant there called The Little Red Barn. I remember hearing the sonic booms and remember the feeling that I was somewhere special with the jets and pilots and all. What happened to Chuck Yeager must have been talked about by the adults around me but I was too young to understand. I can't believe he survived it and kept flying. God bless Chuck Yeager and all the pilots including the astronauts. Kind of through osmosis maybe I took great pride in our Moon Landing and have never forgotten the excitement of that day. Patriotism was built into me early and I think my time in N. Edwards and my grandparents association with the base and the pilots had a lot to do with it. Now that I have a lot of names of pilots from that time I am going to go through the guest book of the restaurant and look for the signatures. And now every time I fly and hear the drawl of the Captain I will be thinking of and thanking Chuck Yeager and his fellow wild boys, all the pilots. God bless America. It's not logic, it's love.

The main characters are Nicolas and Nouschka, motherless 19 year old twins who were famous child performers and whose father is a famous poet, singer and activist.

Texas was the last state, in the Confederacy, to legally comply and that law was signed on June 19, 1865.

As a reader I was really unhappy with how little help we, as a society, give teens who are committing crime. There is injustice in the justice system with the system going after the weakest, poorest and most marginalized among us. It appears that we want to put as little money into education, early childhood programming and behavioral programs as possible. We prefer to spend the money on incarceration. However, most of these young men had supportive mothers or teachers or someone in their life who was trying to steer them on a right path. The hatred of whites made me sad and fearful, being white myself. The crimes that one young man detailed were in the neighborhood where I am in the process of buying a house. Kind of tied my stomach in knots. I thought these young men were talented, intelligent, good writers and I'd say artistic as well judging by signatures. I also think they chose a lot of their criminal behavior. Well, one of them seemed mentally ill, perhaps he had suffered traumatic brain injury from the abuse he went through. I can't really put myself in any of their shoes but I hope each of them is doing well now, have given up crime and are teaching their children to get along in the world with education, pride in their cultural heritage, compassion and love for all life....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 22, 2021","Sep 22, 2021","Sep 22, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2704568-through-the-eyes-of-the-judged

Pooka.Let me try to explain why this book wasn't for me. Wife is unhappy with urban sprawl in Taos NM where she lives with her fellow writer and backpacker husband, their dog and their Bengal cat. She gets an idea to sell the house and their belongings and move into an RV and travel. Husband seems stunned but agrees. She goes into the woods to talk to Grandmother tree and has a heart to heart, looking for signs. The sun shines down and reveals she is sitting in a giant spiderweb. She takes that as a positive sign. I'd be running saying Grandma said Hell No, scrap the RV plan. They sell their house and most of their stuff. They drive this large RV towing their car. It is a stressful life with the driving, setting up and breaking down camp, figuring out where to park this behemoth every night. 2 adults and 2 animals in an RV doesn't allow for much privacy. They hike separately because they are always together in the RV. Husband starts drinking, moodiness is tainting the free vagabond lifestyle. Dog gets sick and has to be put down. They get another dog, still have the cat Pooka. Husband takes off in the car one night, returns a few days later. They travel some more and wife continues her rambling monologues of signs and portents in nature. Husband doesn't say much but he becomes unwilling to read her writng anymore. So I was reading a book about a couple in a dying marriage. That isn't fun. The reason I am thinking about Pooka is she gets left behind with the dad while mom takes the dog and continues traveling.

I was in Gainsville with my son who was a recent graduate of Levin School of Law. He told me she was almost certainly guilty but she would not be convicted. He was right. But why was he right? That question has remained in my mind for all these years as I would have guessed that she was guilty and would be convicted. I read this book hoping I might get an answer to that question but I didn't. Was it the jury? Was it the circumstantial case? Was it the Prosecution? Was it the Defense? Was it Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the dining room? What happened that a conviction was not secured?I don't know. The Defense was bombastic and not sticklers for protocol, the Prosecution was on an intellectual and proud high horse, the defendant was cool as a cucumber and didn't look like whatever guilty looks like, and little Caylee was found too late for her body to reveal much about what had happened. Still, I thought for sure the jury would convict her of something besides lying to the police. All the circumstantial evidence was very incriminating. Although the prosecution of Casey did not result in conviction I am sure that ultimately there will be justice. With every effort made to secure truth and justice we now have to let it go and let God and nature take their course to re-balance things. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 23, 2021","Jan 23, 2021","Jan 23, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12460899-imperfect-justice

I think the world today understands that much better than it did 30 years ago, or maybe it is just me, not sure. In my recall of this book Paul was a much more sympathetic character. Here we see what leadership can do to a person, how the wheel of time turns things, much like the hooks in the worm, pain and all attendant emotions causing the changes that pull us again and again into savagery. Paul was, by genetics and upbringing, a leader, which involves a certain amount of clear-eyed cold heartedness. He wasn't the sympathetic character I recalled from my first reading. 30 years ago my reading was a much more innocent experience; I enjoyed the imagery and adventure. This time a lot more caught at me and I was uncomfortable, it was all too close to home. It was set on Arrakis but it was all too much about human problems. I'm angry about Little Leto. That was unnecessary (in Dune, it may have been necessary for future books in the series). Even though Little Leto is fictional I find myself angry at Frank Herbert for what he did there.

It is long, the writing is unwieldy and sometimes incomprehensible. I felt like the author had too much material to organize properly, or she got bored with writing this book. On the other hand, I learned a lot about the people involved and the sequence of events. My understanding is that we are no different from the people that lived in Salem Village and Andover in 1692. We are vulnerable, petty, jealous, fearful, religious (of whatever denomination), superstitious and capable of accusing others to protect ourselves. We are part of history and people are swept up in the events occurring in their world and tumbled around as their world convulses around them. I am a product of my time in history; Witches, broomsticks? More likely children's revenge and then a sickness of fear as the wave of history grabs the story and pushes, many getting crushed in the process. I could say, based on my moral code and modern beliefs, these people were wrong and these right, but mainly its just people caught in something that was bigger than they were.

I did try to be kind but failed in many ways. So a couple of months ago, which is two to three years since I last saw Yiscah, a neighbor of mine told me she had this book and did I want it. I wanted to honor Yiscah by taking her book and reading her story, the least I could do after being a somewhat close minded member of the Seattle community. After reading it I have compassion for Yiscah, I always did actually but was so conflicted and confused because she was also living a religious life and I just didn't know how to reconcile it all. I thank her for sharing her very personal story, her struggles and the pain she went through before her transition surgery. Much of the book is so personal that I don't feel I can comment, but I did feel great compassion also for her wife and particularly her children. But again, that is their life, not mine to comment on. What did upset me is the threat she received, aimed at her children, from a prominent Rabbi in Israel. That is appalling to me. She received a great deal of negative judgment, which while unpleasant, is perhaps somewhat understandable. But threats against her children? Never, no way to justify that, understand it, spin it. That is just wrong.Also, nothing by accident, right? As it turns out there are very good reasons that Yiscah's life intersection with mine was important, and why her book is important to me. I am meant to learn from it, as a gift of learning and understanding that I need.

Chen ends up with ""a little secretary"" as part of the perks of doing the translating. Yu is helped with his investigation by his intelligent and hard working wife. Several things were bothersome to me as a reader; the little secretary and all the little perks like a heating unit for Chen's apartment, made me nervous. The turtle that was given as a gift to Yu and his wife also bothered me. Something creepy about these gifts, everything had a price and it was going to come due sooner or later. This is stated quite clearly in the line, ""What will come, eventually comes"". The book is full of gorgeous poetry, some of the most beautiful I've ever heard, and meaningful Confucianisms.

Everything was about to change drastically, but hadn't yet. Gloria is a very smart girl but her personality is a construct created after brutal mistreatment at boarding school. She has a ""secret watcher"" who tells her what to do and say in stressful situations. She wears her beautiful clothes and make up to create illusion. She is very successful in many ways. The last year of college and the summer after she graduates from college are very difficult times for her. She betrays the young man who loves her, she puts herself in danger repeatedly, she fails to confide in her parents when doing so would have made sense. Her inner world is dreamy and confusing, it is hard to know who is real and who is made up to protect Gloria's fragile personality. She has to decide if she is going to take the easy route of marriage to a rich suitor or if she is going to fulfill her academic goals by going to Columbia for post graduate work. My favorite character was her thesis professor, I loved what he had to say about disguises. I was also able to relax when Gloria was with him as he was a safe person and his mind matched hers so well. See, I spent a lot of time worrying about Gloria. When she finally gets the courage to defeat Mr. Dougherty, her method of doing so and the link to the poetry; well that was pretty magnificent. It took me a long time to read this book, I was often upset by Gloria's decisions or something that happened to her and I would have to put the book down so I could relax away from Gloria. The author succeeds in making Gloria more than a character in a book; whatever the reader's personality, the places of likeness between reader and character make Gloria live in her reader....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 31, 2019","Aug 10, 2019","Mar 18, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/335099.Gloria

Gene manipulation is a way of life by this time in history, it is now actually, but even more so in MA's envisioned future. Crake the genius envisions the future, Oryx takes care of the gentle race being raised to take humanity's place. This book is weird, are you getting that?

How many pills do you take before you go to sleep? You trust the manufacturers, right? Should you? And how about the beauty industry? Yikes. Well, our Jimmy writes the ad jingles, the ad hooks that bring the people to purchase. Oryx gives out drug samples. Crake is the game Grandmaster. Do Oryx and Crake believe in what they are doing?

But then we add in a murder mystery, which while based on a true case, felt very much tacked in, rather than part of a seamless story.

Which is bad news for North Korea, and the world.This book is about a very unlikely and fortunate escape from one of North Korea 's notorious political prisons. Shin was born into this nightmare world; a place without love, loyalty or respect for human life. His life was trying to get enough to eat and snitching on others to earn favor from teachers and guards.Shin did escape and survive. Despite PTSD and severe readjustment problems he has become a well known speaker, author and human rights activist. In 2015 he changed quite a bit of his story and, I think, damaged his credibility. Still, while the details of his story may be fabricated, North Korea is not.

The majority of the book is written in story form; the setting is Russia, the time is the early 1800's, the event is the War of 1812, the historic personalities are Napoleon and Emperor Alexander (and many others associated with the government, royalty in Russia and armed forces in Russia and the French Forces), and the story personalities are the Rostov family and their relations and friends in Russian Society. The story is written on a level that I think most readers can comprehend, and although long it is never particularly difficult reading, it is often enjoyable and always interesting. I wish he had written about every war as I got a very clear picture of the sequence of events in the War of 1812 and I'd love to hear what he would have to say about other events in history. Tolstoy is a master writer with a wicked sense of humor, a sharp tongue, an eye that sees much, and an intellect so abundant that it must have burdened him at times. The only part I really had trouble with was the epilogue. It almost entirely consists of his ideas about free will and cause and effect.

At least that is what I get from reading Annie Proulx. I've never been to Wyoming myself, I would like to see and experience it even if my experience only goes tourist deep. My favorite stories were the one where the man thought his horse ate a cowboy, and the one of the beautiful, scary spurs. All the stories were amazing though, so visceral. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 04, 2021","Jul 04, 2021","Mar 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27999.Close_Range

Eggs!! Ok in Dr. Perlmutter's book he really talks up eggs, loves them, they compromise a large part of his diet. But they are a no no in my own personal pantheon of forbidden foods. Between this book and my own list of reactive foods, well like I said, I am a hungry mungry. I'm not even doing all that well at it, I have to eat too much dairy to make up the lack of carbs. I'm sick of chicken, steak is nice but there are only so many salads with with steak, chicken or salmon that I can enjoy. Why can't I just live on Lay's and coffee with milk? There is my ideal diet. Oh, and pizza, yeah pizza for sure. Maybe some cookies.

And it looks like the music industry moguls wring the artists for every penny they might possibly be worth. Altogether an ugly business when it should be an industry of happiness. Music improves life, it improves mood, it gets people moving and having fun. So why is the process of creating music, performing music and recording music accompanied by gross excesses and huge rip offs? I don't know, but it was unpleasant reading. Don Felder was a guitar player with the Eagles and this is his autobiography. He isn't a hateful character but he isn't a sympathetic character either, to me.

I still found the funny parts funny, but probably not as funny as the first time. This time I was thinking about the author wondering if he was a combination of the lawyer Bloom and the volunteer Herbie G. The first time the book was a phenomenon, this time I was looking for the man behind the curtain. It is basically about how the State and the white people rip off the Spanish speaking subsistence farmers by legal trickery to get the water rights and once they have the water rights, well they've got control and basically the whole ball of wax belongs to them and the brown people are hired on as minimum wage workers on the establishments set up by the white people. There is a certain status quo, with rumbling undertones. Then Jose goes and diverts the water illegally and waters his land and plants a bean field. That bean field becomes the symbol of the fight between those who have been ripped off and those who have done the ripping off.This edition of the book also contains an afterward by the author which was very interesting and worth reading.With this lukewarm  you might wonder why I read it again. Well, I remembered being totally charmed by Amarante Cordova. And I was rooting for Joe Mondragon all the way. As a reader I was invested in that beanfield. The characters are memorable and oh so flawed just like we all are in real life. The memories of those characters is what drew me in again. I would love to read the author's other books.

Margaret Atwood has a knack for catching and telling the fundamental truth about things, even as this book was about the unreliability of memory and the slippery nature of truth.Grace Marks is an historical figure, a girl of almost sixteen years, who was convicted of murdering the people she was working for. Because of her age, the violence of the crimes, and the suspected sexual scandals this became a case of interest back in the 1850's when it occurred, and with Margaret Atwood's book, the case is again in the public eye. Grace's supposed paramour, the person who carries out the killing is hung for his crimes, Grace is given a life sentence. But who influenced whom? did she seduce him and convince to commit these crimes? or did she not object to his actions because she was afraid of him? Who was telling the truth? Is Grace's memory reliable? Is her amnesia reliable? Was she a confused child or a cunning killer? A doctor tries to figure it out by daily interviews with Grace.

Everyone is aware of it and feel sorry for the young man's poor wife, and wonder if Arlena's husband is aware of her philandering and how he feels about it.

His ne'er do well brother wants to find out who killed him and avenge his brother's death. John had money and secrets that his son was aware of but his wife was not. John's son dedicates himself to the fish after his father's death, but then he doesn't. The brother goes off the rails, the son goes off the rails, the wife spins in confusion, the police spin in confusion, there are some other murders because some people are crazy and some people are acting out. There is som commentary on immigration. I will say this though, the ending had a nice bit of what goes around comes around....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 24, 2018",Jul 2018,"Jun 24, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/491922.The_Princess_of_Burundi

And to hide and help Jews was terribly dangerous but there were many Polish people who risked their lives, the lives of the their family and neighbors to get Jews out of the ghetto and into safe houses. I think one of the most telling scenes in the book is when the German officers come to the devastated zoo and hold a New Year's hunting party killing the remaining helpless zoo animals. And then there was that German guard who liked to shoot children sneaking out of the ghetto to get food and bring it back to their families. What happens to soldiers in war, what happens to people. Is it that the inner nature is let loose? Some people choose to become killers (above and beyond the obligations of a soldier) and others choose to save lives.

Jack and Emilia marry and she has a baby girl who dies at two days old. Emilia, understandably, is now like a crazy person. I know grief is ugly, it comes out in angry and bitter behavior.

His writing is interesting in a way; the sentences are often as long as paragraphs, chopped up with the thoughts of the characters going back and forth in indecision and emotion. I read most of it out loud to make sense of these sentences. But even catching everything, well maybe catching everything, he was writing, the story itself didn't make sense, at least to me. A young, inexperienced woman is hired to be a governess to two orphan children aged 8 and 10. It is the Uncle who hires her, and I believe he seduces her if I understand correctly, and sends her off to the country house with instructions never to bring him problems about the children. The children are beautiful, this is repeated many times, she falls under their spell, at first seeing innocence but later seeing manipulation, she sees ghosts, that no one else sees, but believes the children see them as well, which seemed to me delusional, the boy gets kicked out of school and she never asks why or follows up or reports to Uncle, excuse me but the no tell policy was inexcusable, or tries to get him into another school. When the boy himself asks about it this precipitates the great crisis of the book because it meant something very significant, I don't know what. Was I supposed to find the children creepy? They were in a way, but don't children sometimes realize the power they have to frighten adults? I think so. They also know they have power over adults through our love for them. In this book we have, seemingly, an immature adult who is seduced not only by the Uncle but by the beauty and cleverness of the children. The ghost angle is a head scratcher, but I think we can say with certainty that governess goes off her rocker and she becomes scarier than any ghost....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 27, 2018","Apr 28, 2018","Apr 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12948.The_Turn_of_the_Screw

I got stuck for a long time on creating a space to paint. I live in a small apartment, I had to use the dining room table, which is in the living room, there was no other space. I couldn't figure out how to contain the paint when emotionally painting. My husband tried to come up with ideas but they were all complex building projects and nothing happened. I was also going out of town a lot which was another problem because consistency of painting is necessary. For a solution I bought a kid's pop up tent and put it on the table then put the paper, paint and brushes inside. I would put my arms and head in there and could paint with more abandon but it was hard to reach the far edges of the paper unless I turned it part way through. I also had trouble not splattering paint just for the fun of it. You aren't supposed to be flinging the paint, but it makes such interesting patterns. Also you are not supposed to be interested in the outcome until the paint drys. As for drying them, they were all over my living room floor to dry. Not ideal. And I had to clean it all up and put it away each time which broke into the documenting and relaxing time which is supposed to occur. So, I had problems. But I still had fun, enjoyed the painting. I think it might make more sense as an intense class where everything is set up and stays that way, and an instructor can help interpret.

The only part that relieved the tedium was the part about the reaction of the public and media to the DNA testing of the blood on Kasper Hauser's underwear-page 112.

Then, of all things, there is a discovery after the book has gone to press and it concerns the DNA results of Kasper Hauser's underwear - page 289. Poor Kasper Hauser was murdered, stabbed in the chest, and the blood ran down his abdomen, we think, but then maybe not. The bigger mystery is this, why was Kasper important enough to be murdered?? I didn't buy the ""Evil Vagabond"" theory. I thought the theory advanced by Dr. Hesse, that Kasper suffered from epilepsy and epidermolysis bullosa, made the most sense. Of course the growing up in the dark shed story was confabulation. But none of the theories make sense of why someone sought him out to murder him.

It was easy reading and was interesting until the chapters on Communism and the future of China. That got a bit boring, for me, although it was integral to the story.

I guess you could say it puts a human face on both patients and practitioners. It also shows an incredible naivete on the part of practitioners; don't they research their clients beforehand? Maybe not in the 1990's when the book was published, but I'd imagine now that a potential client is researched before the practitioner takes them on. The main story is about a therapist who takes a client who has no good intentions towards him. She is trying to seduce him in order to destroy him. Another therapist is being conned. Both therapists have to help their clients and deal with the temptations set in their paths.The ending, although somewhat unrealistic, offered some redemption of both therapists and patients.There are some really good thoughts and insights in the book. Here is one that I thought very true:""Again and again, in his analytic work, he had noted his patients' extraordinary thirst for his attention--indeed, the need for an audience is a major unsung factor in prolonged interminal therapy. In work with his bereaved patients, he had often seen them fall into despair because they had lost their audience; their lives were no longer observed""...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 04, 2017","Dec 11, 2017","Dec 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21030.Lying_on_the_Couch

While academically capable for the most part, I was socially awkward, or as they would say today, my social IQ was kinda low. Drugs helped with that and also gave us teenage drug users a group to belong to. Unlike Alice, although I tried a wide range of drugs, I never injected anything and never felt like drugs were so amazing. I never became addicted to anything and when I found a different group to belong to I gave up drugs without a backward glance. I'm lucky I wasn't Alice, I could have been if my body chemistry had been different and/or I'd become addicted to something. I survived my teen years, Alice didn't.

I had intended to pass this book on once I finished it but found that I want to keep this one, it has importance both historically and psychologically. It was written by John Okada, a Japanese American who served in the U.S. military during WWll, but his subject matter is a young Japanese man who was two years in an internment camp as a Japanese American and then two years in prison for declining to declare loyalty to the U.S. and refusing to serve in the U.S. military. The young Japanese men who had done this were called No-No Boys. When the book opens our No-No Boy has just returned to his home town of Seattle. He immediately encounters hatred from the Japanese who served in the military, he is scorned in his community. The person who is proud of him is his mother, the person who most strongly implanted his identity as Japanese. His parents are both Japanese, living in American for many years but never intending to stay, two boys born to them in America. The younger brother hates him for what he has done and joins the U.S. military on his 18th birthday. The mother is delusional, thinks Japan has won the war and the supposed defeat of Japan is just U.S. propaganda. Ichiro, our No-No boy, knows better but his mother will not be convinced, she has become mentally ill with cognitive dissonance. Father tries to placate everyone and drinks himself senseless. Ichiro is lost, in deep identity crisis and self-hatred, problems which play out in his actions and interactions in the story.

At age sixty-two she is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. She was an active and fit woman to begin with but of course she fears what this means for the future. She is already an active cyclist and then she finds out about research that shows cycling done at 80-90 RPM for a sustained period (High cadence pedaling) of an hour 3 times a week relieves the symptoms of Parkinson's. The beginning is rough with medication adjustments (I understand, I am also on the generic of Mirapex) but her determination and activity level are intense. At one point she says, no one would look at me and think athlete. Really? I am reading about her and thinking athlete. Anyone who can bike 70 miles a day is, imo, an athlete. I don't ride. I was clumsy even when I was young, and would get out of breath very easily. Well now we know I have a neurological problem and asthma, but I'm trying to say I couldn't ride a bike once I reached my teens. My best bike riding memories involve a Shwinn bike with a banana seat, and handlebar streamers. So our non-athlete Nan not only bikes across Iowa on several summer RAGBRAI trips, she also climbs Mt. Kilimanjaro, and climbs in Nepal and Peru. Challenging, but she has tenacity and grit. She also has a wonderful husband, it is really rather romantic.

Not sure I got it ALL sorted, but probably the bulk of this fantastical book I put into a framework of reality.There is this young woman who is crazy, or she seems crazy. She has some eccentric female relatives, an abusive male relative, a twin sister who has passed away, and a couple of male romantic interests. The story twists and turns in and out of reality and the reader is left to figure it out as best they can. The setting is Salem and witches is a thing.

I used to watch the Sonny and Cher show when I was young, I never gave them much thought beyond thinking Cher was beautiful. My most vivid images of that show are Cher on top of the piano, vamp, and Sonny and Cher holding their little girl's hands at the end of the show.Reading this book was kind of a shock. I had no idea that Sonny was married and a father of a child he never took care of, when he started his relationship with sixteen year old Cher. Sonny was twenty-seven and was regularly cheating on his wife, Cher was someone he fell in love with, more serious than his other dalliances or the relationship he had with his wife and first child. But she was sixteen!Different times. Sonny writes songs, Cher sings. She has trouble singing before an audience so she sings to Sonny. ""I Got You Babe"" comes out and they hit the big time. Because he starts the book recalling singing I Got You Babe on Late Night with David Letterman with Cher in 1987, I watched it. More than ten years since their divorce and the chemistry was still there. Cher's voice just blew me away. Awesome, completely awesome. Sonny looked uncomfortable singing to Cher and she looked like she was looking for approval from him. As soon as he took her hand and kissed it she moved in closer and looked both grateful and happier. She can say that he was a terrible husband but watch the body language and see what you think. They each have their reasons for doing what they do but in the end Cher forces the break up. I don't know how much happiness Cher finds afterward. Sonny finally finds happiness again with his fourth wife and the two children he has with her, and in his political career as Mayor of Palm Springs and later as a Congressman. Some random thoughts:I recall seeing an anti-marijuana film in the early 1970's that Sonny Bono was in. In my recall he was wearing a robe but when I watched the film (it was even stupider than I remembered) he was wearing some sort of satin pajamas.I liked his nose better before his nose job.He was a Scientologist? He mentions learning, from Dianetics, that he shouldn't go out with a girl who was involved with someone else. Wasn't obvious to him...Anyway, I actually enjoyed reading the book; some nostalgia, some celebrity gossip, some watching old Sonny and Cher performances, loving the clothes, missing the 60's....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 26, 2017","Jul 29, 2017","Jul 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/254859.And_the_Beat_Goes_On

So I was receptiveI'm one of the few people who did not know much about Lance Armstrong except that he raced bikes and there had been a drug scandal. So I was receptive, ready to hear what he had to say.He comes from Plano, Texas...but before Plano he lived in Oak Cliff, the same community that Stevie Ray Vaughan comes from. Frisson.Then reading about his daredevil stunts on his bike as a teen; racing stoplights and not wearing a helmet. I recognized those stunts, the stunts I didn't hear about until later but still made my hair stand on end. I have a son who rides a bike. Like Lance, he was also hit by a truck, bike destroyed. Both Lance and my son escaped truly serious injury. Lance also experienced the death of another rider in a bike race, something my son experienced as well. I was relating to Lance and the biking.Then Lance gets cancer. As he puts it in the book, ""It had been a busy week, I thought to myself. I was diagnosed on a Wednesday, had surgery Thursday, was released Friday night, banked sperm on Saturday, had a press conference announcing to the world that I had testicular cancer on Monday morning, started chemo on Monday afternoon. Now it was Thursday and it was in my brain. This opponent was turning out to be much tougher than I'd thought. I couldn't seem to get any good news: It's in your lungs, it's stage three, you have no insurance, now it's in your brain.""Lance survives. He has such a bullish personality, he was going to defeat cancer just as he defeated anyone and anything that got in the way of his winning; winning cancer, winning bike races, winning women. The man was a bull, still is I imagine. He kind of fools himself that cancer has changed him, made him a better man. Sounds good on paper but really, Lance was a man who wanted to win and he would go all out to do it. He would use every tool in the arsenal. He trained like a demon, he wouldn't let it go, he was going to show the world what he could do. Everyone seems to hate Lance Armstrong now, but listen, drugs or no, the man worked really, really hard for those wins. Too bad he cheated, and now there are suspicions of his using motorized cheating as well. The sport was never ""fair"" and the Tour de France has a long history of cheating.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sho...Honestly, read about the history of this race. Put Lance into perspective. In some ways his history with women bothers me more than his cheating in the sport. Years ago, in Plano, Lance's first sponsor Jim Hoyt, became angry at Lance's behavior. Jim Hoyt wasn't wrong. Anger and a bullying personality, a need to win at all costs, greed for the wins, the accolades, the women, and lying about whatever he needed to lie about. I felt bad for his wife who stuck by him, loved him, never expected to be divorced. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 23, 2017","Jul 26, 2017","Jul 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2265.It_s_Not_About_the_Bike

In the beginning of this account he says, ""I should have heeded the warning twinge her words game me.....But something about her fascinated me--an odd combination of seductiveness and vulnerability..."" I'm sure every man she ever met said the same thing. Yes, the author should have heeded his warning twinge. She played him as she did every other man.Claudia Elaine Yasko was a mentally ill woman who confessed to three murders. She knew details that probably only someone who had been on the scene could have known. She gets arrested, implicates other people who then get arrested, but the case falls apart as it was all based on the confession of a diagnosed schizophrenic, Claudia. That messed up some police careers and did some damage to those others she implicated. Other suspects get arrested and confess to the .22 caliber murders (the three murders that Claudia confesses to are only part of a larger killing spree). Those suspects, their crimes and their trials are included in this book, but this book is about Claudia and the author's fascination with her and his determination to get to the truth of her knowledge about the three murders she had confessed to. Did he get the truth? He got seduced (mentally and emotionally), he got lied to, he got conned, he got lead, he got manipulated; did he get the truth? I finished this book feeling that the author wasted two years of his life talking to this crazy lady. How long would he have talked to this wacko if she had been old, ugly, male or otherwise unappealing. She lied, as a reader I had no way of discerning the truth, and in my opinion, the author had no way of discerning the truth either.

Douglas Petersen, scientist, husband of Connie and father of Albie, straight arrow, organized, hard-working, loyal man, is woken by his wife one night so she can tell him that she thinks their marriage has run its course. But they should still go on their family European vacation together. Their son is not exactly looking forward to this vacation. This sullen, dirty, ill mannered seventeen year old son drinks, drugs and sexes across Europe with his mother's approval and father's ill hidden disapproval. Connie, artist, wants to leave, possibly, her husband, but wants to go on vacation with him, while simultaneously mocking his organization and planning, and leading her son in this vindictive behavior towards his father.

For me, only one character was real and not a cardboard cut out or a life lesson or a moral teaching example. I am sure my sense of the author writing the book is suggested by the main character, a writer who wrote two biographical books and was attempting another non-fiction book.

Kara's decisions and conversations were unusual, to say the least; she didn't tell anyone she was being stalked, she went to California (from Seattle) to participate in a baking contest without her mother's permission just leaving a note, she behaves in a dangerous way with older boys she isn't interested in resulting in some inappropriate and scary sexual situations and ignores and is unkind to the boy she likes, she has a ballistic mental reaction when the results of the baking competition are announced, she hallucinates blood and teeth in her bowl of flour, butter and eggs, she sees her dead sister everywhere. She avoids a serious mental health evaluation by cleaning her mother's restaurant (hard physical labor) and by baking (concentration on something other than her own floundering mind).I think the book is supposed to be a moralistic tale for young Christian girls. It tells us pretty clearly to avoid premarital sex and potentially dangerous sexual situations, to look beyond a person's exterior, to work hard, to respect and honor parents and accept their discipline. It does this by having Kara bend these rules and then we see the consequences. Kellen, Kara's older dead sister, broke the rules pretty badly and didn't confide in anyone about her stalker and look what happened to her!Basically, stay off the streets and out of the arms of boys, keep away from marijuana, listen to your mother, and even if you don't like to pray, clean and bake to steady your mind and keep your thoughts wholesome....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 09, 2017","May 11, 2017","May 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18978515-from-where-i-watch-you

The ship that was to take Shackleton and his twenty-seven crew to the Antarctic was a beautiful ship called Endurance. They were heading for the Weddell Sea hoping to make landfall at Vahsel Bay and begin their overland journey from there. She left England in August of 1914, and Buenos Aires at the end of Oct. 1914. Shackleton estimated they would be ashore by December. He was wrong. There was ice in the way, lots of ice. Jan 24, 1915 the Endurance was stuck fast in the ice. They were only 60 miles from Vahsel Bay but they weren't going anywhere. The crew lived aboard the iced in boat until Oct 24th 1915 when she was crushed in the ice and the crew had to abandon her. It wasn't just the crew, it was also about 50 dogs and a cat, the carpenter Harry McNeish's cat. I had read Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar Bound Cat by Caroline Alexander. It was my introduction to Shackleton's Expedition. Endurance picks up where Mrs. Chippy's leaves off and tells the story of the almost unbelievable survival of the 28 men as they live on ice floes, eat seal, blubber, and penguin, and make a sea journey in little boats to find land. I am not explaining how wet they were all the time, how frozen, how alone! No way to contact anyone, no hope of rescue. If they were going to survive they were on their own. The stunning thing is, they did survive, all twenty-eight of them. There is another book I would like to read now called Shackleton's Forgotten Men: The Untold Tragedy of the Endurance Epic. These would be the men who were to cross Antarctica from the other side and leave food caches and meet the first group at the South Pole....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 07, 2017","May 09, 2017","May 07, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/139069.Endurance

He goes off to mark more of his life in bullet holes, leaving his baby with her maternal grandmother. When he feels he has accomplished all he needs to accomplish he goes back for her. She is still a very young child and lives an outlaw life with her father. Together they mourn the wife and mother they lost. Together they face everything.

But he finds that his world is lit from within and he does not feel blind. He is a an imaginative child and very intelligent. He learns braille in a few months and goes back to school in his grade. He perceives people better than most other people do as he can tell so much about them from their voices. He has many friends and does very well in his studies. All proceeding well until France is occupied by the Germans during WWll. Jacques is 16 at this time and he starts a resistance group to get information about the war and what is going on out to the people. He has a lot of boys working to distribute thousands of papers. He is successful but eventually they stagnate and need to join forces with a group that has better access to printing presses. They join up with Defense France and this works for awhile until they are betrayed. Jacques had had a bad feeling about this particular recruit but three other people approved him and Jacques went along. Unfortunately this eventually led to the arrest of Jacques and most of his friends and people he worked closely with. Jacques was eighteen at this point. He was taken to prison and eventually to Buchenwald.I guess it was a day for Holocaust remembrance in our family. And appropriate for the time of year. Holocaust Remembrance Day was April 27th, April 30 was Israel Memorial Day and Israel Independence Day is May 2. While I was reading this book, my daughter was working on a project about the holocaust. My husband brought her down the Holocaust museum in Seattle and he had our special needs twenty-one year old son along. This son lists the fun things they did today, including Safeway and the Holocaust museum, but then he adds that he saw a picture and that Hitler was a horrible person and he killed Jews and how could he have done that, he was so mean. We each process and try to understand the magnitude of the horror on our own level. Jacques was a Christian, he was working in defense of France and of the free world. He knew what was happening to the Jews and to non Jews who were arrested and was horrified by it. He worked to stop the evil and build up people's strength and optimism by educating them to what was going on. I think it is important to note that the Holocaust wasn't just about the Jews. There were six million Jews killed in the holocaust and five million non Jews. Eleven Million people killed!! G-d help us all.Quoted from the book:""From the two thousand Frenchmen who went into Buchenwald with me at the end of January 1944, about thirty survived. According to the account made after the war, during the fifteen months of my stay, in the camp itself and in the commandos which were its direct dependencies, 380,000 men died: Russians, Poles, Germans, Frenchmen, Czechs, Belgians, Dutchmen, Danes, Norwegians, Hungarians, Yugoslavs, Rumanians. There were even Americans, thirty-four of them, all officers, brothers-in-arms who had been parachuted into the Resistance in Western Europe. There were very few Jews in Buchenwald....There were sent to Lublin, to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Theresienstadt for quick extermination.""And when the Germans knew the war was lost, ""The SS command offered an alternative to the Buchenwald prisoners. They could either stay in camp at their own risk and in great danger, or they could leave within two hours on the roads to the east, escorted by SS guards.......On April 16th we learned through official channels that the eighty thousand prisoners who had gone off on the roads on the tenth had been machine-gunned en masse by the SS, at a place sixty miles southeast of Buchenwald. They said first there was not a single survivor. We learned later that this was wrong; ten were still alive.""Jacques ends this book with these words, ""....joy does not come from outside, for whatever happens to us it is within.....light does not come to us from without. Light is in us, even if we have no eyes.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 26, 2017","Apr 30, 2017","Apr 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18249406-and-there-was-light

His cellmate is a Russian deserter named Kolya, also just arrested. They expect to be shot in the morning but instead are given the job to bring a dozen eggs back as the Colonel's daughter is to be married and a wedding cake is needed.

It was published in 1793, and it is a marvel really, both as social commentary and a demonstration of the manners and speech patterns of yesteryear. I loved saying these long and complex sentences aloud, somewhat to the distress of my family, although the cat didn't mind, thank you. I thought the author was very droll and amusing. She pokes fun at the social posturing of the well born and wealthy, she sympathizes with the poor, she criticizes debtor's prison, she lays out the dangers for young people of leisure with gambling and excesses, she talks about the choices for younger sons which were mainly the clergy or the military, business was deemed vulgar. But mainly this book is about marrying for love or advantage. Orlando Somerive is a second son in love with an orphan niece of a domestic in the Manor House of his great Aunt. This great Aunt is very wealthy but estranged from her family as cousins married down. She is the last of three unmarried sisters and is planning to leave her money and properties outside the family. But she develops a love for Orlando who is the only welcome family member invited to the Manor House. Orlando is playing a dangerous game however, making nice to his Aunt while sneaking to see his love Monimia who is locked into a turret much of the time!There is a lot of family drama back at the Somerive family home; oldest son is a dissolute gambler, oldest daughter refuses an advantageous marriage and marries instead the nephew of her suitor, running away in order to do so. Father is sick, mother is heartbroken, the family wants for money, what is going to happen? There is a lot of hand wringing and much crying.Back at the Manor House there is a lot of hand wringing and much crying as Orlando and Minimia try find a way to a future where they can marry, or at least see each other without sneaking through the house in the dead of night.Orlando makes the decision to join the military so he will have a respectable position and a commission. Contrary to what he had been led to believe, he is sent to America. I think it is evident that the author didn't know nearly as much about America as she did about England. This part of the book reads somewhat like boy's adventure story complete with tomahawk wielding Indians who capture and keep prisoner our Orlando. Although she criticizes the slave trade, she has a pretty unmitigated racial prejudice against the Native Americans. The one nice thing she says about a Native American warrior is nice out one side of her mouth, and then contains a racial insult out the other, ""The secret sympathy between generous minds seems to exist throughout the whole humankind; for this young warrior became soon as much attached to Orlando as his nature allowed him to be to anybody;...."" My guess is that she was sympathetic to black people because she knew black people in England, but I would think she had only read about Native Americans and had no experience of them herself. Orlando is a sympathetic character with good manners, a kind heart and a strong moral sense. Why he turns into a puling, sneaky child when he meets back with Monimia is a mystery to me. But I get ahead of myself. Orlando is finally returned to America, in rags and penniless. He gets home, and, there is no home! His great Aunt is dead and all his family is missing. Strangers are living in the Manor House as well as in his family home. And people are living high on the money he is almost certain his Great Aunt left for him. The rest of the story is taken up with Orlando's Quest for his Monimia, his family and his inheritance. And his maturity. Expect that it will all work out....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Mar 15, 2017","Mar 30, 2017","Mar 15, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/665990.The_Old_Manor_House

I want to walk it, I need healing, I am bereaved, living off medicines, habits, the support of other people, my blood pressure cuff, my CPap machine. I understand Cheryl's need to do this, herself, to carry that pack herself, to do the hike herself. Let the pain of the trail heal the pain of bereavement. I've done crazy things before, what if I just tossed the medical stuff, packed a pack and started walking?A lot of people were critical of her unpreparedness (her pack weight, her lack of physical training for the trip) and her self-destructive behaviors. I didn't feel critical of her. It was her journey, emotionally and physically, her choices, her feelings, her mistakes, her healing. She is sharing with the reader. Every person on their journey through this world makes mistakes, acts irrationally, carries too much weight and is unprepared. I wouldn't make the same choices as Cheryl; I wouldn't walk it alone, I would attempt to physically train, I would do some day trips, week trips, you know to see how things went. But I would still have to make some decisions that went against conventional wisdom in order to try this. Is never taking chances better? Is it better to live chained to your fears, sorrows and helplessness? What if the trail kills you? Well, something is going to kill you eventually anyway. I don't want to fall off a mountain or get mauled by a bear; but I also don't want to get in a car crash or die of a life of sedentary excess. We all make choices and the best considered choices can have unintended negative consequences, and the rashest and most ill considered of choices may have a positive outcome. The most difficult part of the book for me was nothing to do with the trail, her mother's illness and death, her family troubles, her infidelities, her drug use; it was the shooting of the horse Lady. That shocked and hurt me in a way that the rest of her story never even touched. My favorite part of the book was when Cheryl hitches a ride with Spider, Lou, Dave and the dog Stevie Ray. I love what Cheryl says about Stevie Ray Vaughan's music, in particular Love Struck Baby, Pride and Joy, and Texas Flood. I have read that section at least half a dozen times.

Rape doesn't get a lot of acknowledgment as the horrifying crime that it really is. There are prevalent attitudes in society that a woman ""asked for it"" or she put herself in a compromising position by the party she attended or the liquor she drank or the boy she want out with or the clothes she wore. I've heard the attitude that it is only the ""feminists"" who are making a big deal of rape and that a lot of it is intended as entrapment of men and boys. I also think that porn promotes the idea that women want to be forced, and if they complain about it afterward it isn't because they didn't like it at the time. Rape is also a very under reported crime as it is humiliating to report it and to go through whatever questioning and proof will be needed. I don't know if it is just our religious training or what it is, but we all, men and women, tend to blame ourselves for anything bad that happens to us. When a woman blames herself for her own rape and she is ostracized or treated as a liar or complainer; that is a pretty devastating combination. So this book is murder mystery ""entertainment"" with a solid dose of what it means to be a rape victim. And what happens if the person who is accused turns out to be the wrong person. The author kind of turns the whole situation around and looks at it from different angles.

There is a character guide but because I couldn't pronounce the Russian names, and all of the names had many variations, I was constantly flipping back to that character guide.Once I understood who was who, for the most part, I found myself intensely disliking Dr. Zhivago. The cover of this book calls it a ""love story for all time"". Really?? Which woman would that be? His legal wife Tonia? His married mistress Lara? His common law wife Marina? He not only cheated on his trusting and loving wife, he eventually deserted all three of these women, betraying all in spectacular fashion. And his kids? All I can think is, Love is as Love does. Dr. Zhivago was more interested in writing than in his children and the women who loved him. But Dr. Zhivago was also a broken man after his experience with the Partisans and maybe he could no longer be held accountable for his actions. Russia was ill with lies and a catastrophic collapse of society. I thought it was false as a love story, and the philosophical musings left me cold. His political insights were brilliant, scary, full of what I perceived to be truth. For incredible descriptions of Russian countryside, and an understanding of war and the Russian Revolution that will slam you in the head it is so vivid and profound, for those things the book is worth reading.It is hard to rate this book as it was so difficult to read and I looked forward with eager anticipation to being done with it.

I didn't like the drug use, the character's personalities, the rabbit, the neighborhoods, the house, the Stager, her staging, the memories, the adultery, the house. I said ""house"" twice, and there are two houses. #1 house in a rich neighborhood of Maryland, victim of destruction wrought by rabbit and child, and a place of terrible smells.

It is possible if I read Alice in Wonderland today I wouldn't like it either. I prefer my reality un-drugged. I suppose it all is supposed to mean something; like let in the truth and the light will shine, let's get the skeletons out of the closet and dissipate that smell of secrets, let's stop trying to be someone else and find our own identity. Here is a lesson to take from the acting father, drug addict, cuckholded Lars, as repeated by his brat of a daughter Elsa, and given as advice to Lars by the bitter, sarcastic, spleen-stealing male rabbit Dominique: RE-CALIBRATE. And not while you are under the influence as your calibrations are going to be off. That part is my advice.And you might want to be sure of your Stager.

We can all Google how many people were killed during the Stalin years, and it is estimated to be as high as a staggering 60 million, but this quiet book explores the juxtaposition between people trying to live normal lives and the constant fear of saying or doing the wrong thing. Women still became pregnant, children played, people got sick and needed medical care, people needed to eat, work and live. But the fear was pervasive and with excellent reason. If you have read 1984 by George Orwell you will understand the terror that people lived with by the parallels between the totalitarian regime of Stalin and the totalitarian regime described in 1984. People were terrified and through fear inspired by murders, tortures and beatings, would confess to anything and implicate anyone. (The building called Lubyanka has a gruesome back story as well, before it became home of the Soviet secret police and a prison. But that isn't part of this book.)This is the fictional story of a teacher who becomes an archivist in Lubyanka after losing his position in the school for his part in the deposition against a fellow teacher. The archivist is having a hard time with his job of burning all of this literature and poetry deemed counterproductive to the revolution. He illegally saves some of the work of Isaac Babel after interviewing the author, who was imprisoned in Lubyanka, to find out whether an unsigned short story was his work. The archivist knows his time of freedom is ending, that he will be arrested soon.

Of course I've read Angela's Ashes, and I read his brother Malachy's autobiography, I knew Mr. McCourt had become a teacher. I STILL found this painful reading; this is Frank McCourt and his past is present in his writing, in fact he spends quite a bit of classroom time talking about his miserable Irish childhood. He tells us he talks about it, he doesn't actually spend very much book time talking about it. But the subject tends to fascinate his students, and the kids enjoy storytelling more than they like school assignments. So even as Frank McCourt entertains us with his stories of teaching in New York high schools, he also tells of us his insecurities and self-criticism, his failures and his sins. All of that self-recrimination rang in me like a struck bell. Frank McCourt is funny, successful, he is a survivor. This book didn't hurt as bad as Angela's Ashes, I cried for about a month with that one, but still; I am feeling pain and I don't want to. I suppose there must be some pain in me that matches with the pain in Frank McCourt that is causing this resonating vibrato of pain.The book is certainly not all sorrow; as I said, he is funny and really is a masterful teacher in a non-traditional manner.

The main character, Ellen, is beautiful, talented and educated, but poor. Her mother came from a rich family and had been kicked out of the family when when she married her poor scholar husband in a case of true love. But tragedy strikes and the poor scholar husband dies in a freak accident. This means going home to the mother's family and hoping for a welcome. Mother's sister, Daisy, welcomes her and her daughter Oriana, Ellen's cousin, is thrilled to have a pal. But not so Daisy's husband. Always a fly in the ointment. Stuff happens and Ellen and her mother, Connie, leave. As it happens, they are given refuge by a dressmaker who has a rake of a son who is soon after Ellen. More stuff happens. I don't want to give everything away, but it does have a happy ever after sort of ending if convenient deaths don't bother you.

Here it is, first page, 2nd paragraph: ""In Jenny's opinion, her breasts were too large; she thought the ostentation of her bust made her look ""cheap and easy.""Sex is the central subject of the book, but I've never read a less sexy book about sex. Jenny is a nurse who does not want a romantic relationship, she wants no husband, but she does want a child. She conceives her child in a one time act with a patient who dies not long afterward. She doesn't reveal the nature of the child's conception nor the name of the father for many years, although she does name her child Garp after the father. She raises him on the grounds of a boy's school where she is the nurse. Garp becomes a student, a wrestler, a writer and a lusty young man. He marries his wrestling coach's daughter and they have two, eventually three, children. Infidelity interferes in their domestic happiness and has terrible repercussions. Garp doesn't fully recover, none of them do fully, but Garp says that his life feels like an epilogue after the terrible tragedy occurs. They go on, nonetheless. As a reader I didn't really go on, the rest of the book feels like an epilogue to me. I relate too much perhaps. In my own mind, I am in the epilogue state of my own life.The book is well written though, I already knew John Irving could write. In this story Garp is a writer and numerous pieces of his fictional fiction are included in the story. My favorite was the first chapter of The World According to Bensenhaver. I liked Police Inspector Bensenhaver and could easily have seen a series of detective novels based on his cases.And I liked the justice done, the victim saving and avenging herself, the detective's approval and emotional support. I probably would not have liked the rest of the book as described, but didn't think the first chapter was the trashy horror that all the publishers thought. I also thought if was incredibly gross of the publisher to use the tragedy of Garp and his family to sell this book.The feminist angle was boring, all the transsexual parts were boring. Again, probably because in those cases I don't relate. I did love the ""Under Toad"". I know exactly what that is and I am making it a part of my own lexicon. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 27, 2016","Dec 31, 2016","Dec 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7069.The_World_According_to_Garp

A married woman is having an affair and decides she wants a divorce, not because she wants to be with her lover, but because she is unhappy. Her husband, a chronically angry man, doesn't like this and responds with sarcasm and negativity. Then he goes away, meets a healer and becomes a different man. He isn't angry, he is nice and polite; completely loses his sense of humor and his edge. He brings the healer home to live with them. The healer and the husband start trying to save the world by giving away worldly goods, money and food. Then they get the bright idea of asking all the neighbors if they have a spare room that they could house a homeless teen in. The wife doesn't know which was worse; her mean husband or her seemingly lobotomized husband. But she is the constantly indecisive one and was driving this reader crazy with her drivel. She had an obsession with ""being good"" which is why she became a doctor. She is a liberal in her viewpoints, but when it came to giving away to all those in need she comes out with a more honest response. As far as doctoring, she felt herself somewhat of a failure. She reminded me of most doctors that I see; unable to help the patient and angry when the patient keeps coming back.

He sees a convict in a leg iron, an escapee from the convict ship, who promptly terrorizes Pip into giving him the bread he has and extracts a promise from Pip that he will bring food and a file to him the next morning. Pip steals the food and the file from the house and gives it to the convict as he promised to do. Pip lives with his sister who is unkind to him, and his sister's husband Joe who is very kind to him. He might have stayed and been a blacksmith like Joe if not for the circumstance of meeting Miss Havisham and Estella. Pip starts thinking his family is common and wants to distance himself, and things get worse when Pip gets an anonymous patron and has great expectations of wealth and being a gentleman. He is also head over heels in love with Estella and she is terrible to him, playing on his insecurities and his love for her. Pip now deserts his family and lives in London. What eventually happens is that Pip matures and becomes a decent person. I felt the message of the book was a warning to young people to appreciate what they have, to repay kindness, to be thrifty etc. In a young person's immaturity they might make similar mistakes to Pip's mistakes.

But the energy between main characters Abby and Jack is good. I think that characters lived up to their particular slot in the book whether wife beating drunk or always looking out for #1 small potatoes criminal lawyer or clever psychopathic killer.The story goes like this; Abby works as a lawyer during the day, her time off is spent writing. She writes an excellent book but thinks that women authors, especially if they are over thirty and previously published, don't get the kind of attention and publicity push that young good-looking male writers do, especially if said young male is a first time author, a new discovery. So Abby decides to hire a good looking actor, give him a pen name, and pass him off as the author of the book while holding the copyright herself. She enlists one of her best friends, fellow lawyer Morgan Spencer, to help her. She finds her actor but ends up with his older brother instead, a guy named Jack who is a frustrated writer himself. Jack has the looks, Jack has the charm, eventually Jack has Abby. Morgan has a problem with that. Jack tells her one thing, Morgan tells her another. Who to trust? OK, just as note here.

I had been trying to find the words to express that, trying such things as ""the author's voice is flat"", but it wasn't that exactly, it is the understatement that is the key to Hemingway's writing, and it is the voice of understatement that is so captivating and depressing at the same time. You can't get away from the futility of life in this book, even through his happy times, it is still there. He is in the army and has friends, he is wounded and in the hospital,; he is in love, expecting a child; through it all he drinks a lot. In the end he loses everything, nothing to do with alcohol, everything to do with life just beating a person down. He tells us in the book that life will kill you, quickly or slowly, probably more quickly if you are a brave and strong person who will not break then life will kill you quick. If you break and break and break and are full of partially healed breaks, an old person full of memories and bitterness, confusion and resentment, then life will kill you more slowly. Reminds me of that line from The Princess Bride, ""Life IS pain your Highness"". That is what I think Hemingway is telling us, Life is Pain, it breaks us, it kills us. It is interesting to me though, for a man who wrote a rather negative book about war, he sought out a lot of war zones in his life. That made me think more about the way he writes about his friends and his job in the army, his feeling of place, his positive sense of self that came with being in the army. When he loses that he still has his girlfriend but even she questions if she is enough, doesn't he need things to do, men to be friends with.

A bluesman, a guitar slinger, small black man; he realizes who the evil is and that the evil is not wholly human. Bluesman eliminates evil in a gnarly fight, and then is murdered himself by some redneck bullies who like to say words like ""boy"" to old black men. Two of those in the redneck group are pretty bad men, beyond their kin. But it doesn't end there because evil never dies, it just waits. And it is coming back!With all the episodes of Supernatural out there, they should have known to salt and burn the bones!But no. Instead of the Winchesters to the rescue, we have a delightful (and I mean that) trio of characters: Crow, a man whose brother was murdered by the evil thirty years ago; Val, the love of Crow's life; Iron Mike Sweeney, superhero, a teenage boy whose home life leaves something to be desired.It was a good book in its way, but I wasn't in the mood for the gruesomeness, nor up for the idea of evil rising again....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 16, 2016","Nov 11, 2016","Oct 16, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/125965.Ghost_Road_Blues

It wasWhen John Steinbeck was fifty-eight years old he decided to travel the United States, in a truck with a camper built on the back, with his dog. It was 1960 and Mr. Steinbeck felt that he no longer knew the United States, that it had changed and he wanted to know the people and the national temperament, and of course to write about what he found. He was born in 1902, so certainly the country had changed a lot from when he was a young man to 1960. He had lived through both World Wars, the Great Depression, and in 1960 the Civil Rights movement was getting underway and the country was on the verge of changing much further with the Vietnam War and all the social changes that took place in the 1960'sSo here is Mr. Steinbeck, with his dog Charley, driving through the country, stopping and chatting with people, offering them coffee and liquor, just being sociable. He is a very, very intense personality and the book is much more about Mr. Steinbeck himself and about Charley, than it is about the places he stops. I personally liked this quite a bit, I found his mind very intelligent if somewhat gloomy. He was lonely for his wife and home much of the time. This is a book that I would read again because I don't think that I absorbed it all. I don't really want to read about his experience in Louisiana again, with the women shouting horrible things at the little black girl who was being integrated into the white school. It reminded me of the Westboro Baptist Church, and it was most unpleasant. I think his assessment of the situation was right on, but then I agreed with much of what he said.

First off, the ruse the PI uses to talk to people in the village is just stupid. He pretends he is writing a book about superstitions, but he never questions people about superstitions, just about recent deaths. Then he mis-remembers a conversation that causes him to look at the wrong suspects. As a reader who either remembers or who can look back at the conversation, it just makes you feel the detective is thick. The most boring part of the book has to be when he goes through each suspect and victim seeing if they tie together. I wanted to tell him to make a spread sheet, solve it already and leave us out of all his ridiculous musings. Reasonably good ending though, saved it from being utterly boring.

This book is about adoption, specifically in the years betI thought I had written a  for this book but evidently I didn't save it or something. This book is about adoption, specifically in the years between the end of WWII and the early 1970's when both birth control and abortion became legal and widely available.I am one of the babies who was given up for adoption by a teenage mom who hid her condition from everyone except her mom, the birth father and her best friend. I found her when I was 30 and she was 45, married and mother to an additional four children. Her husband never knew about me and has since passed away. What I can tell you is that lost years can never be recovered. Strangely, although I have a relationship with my birth mother and am so grateful for that, we have never discussed what it felt like for her to give me up. We love each other now and that seems to be enough for both of us. My relationship does not extend much beyond her to the other members of the family. My adopted sister and brother have found the same thing to be true with their birth mothers. It is impossible to go back. You can't be the infant and they can't be the teenage girl who just gave birth. In some ways that is hard to accept and causes a renewal of the grief before a relationship can begin in real time. The book had a very strong impact on me. Even knowing my birth mother for 25 years I was not disabused of the idea that the girls had a choice, a real choice. I was always told that ""your mother loved you so much that she gave you up for adoption because she knew she couldn't care for you herself."" I believed that. Now I wonder why I believed it so thoroughly for so many years. I have children, I know how fiercely I loved them from the time I knew of their existence and how devastating it would have been to give them up. I have even been bereaved, well I am bereaved, it doesn't go away, so I know how it feels to suffer the loss of a child. I don't understand how I could imagine that it would be different for my birth mother, or any birth mother, to give up a child. What I faced in this book is the reality of the stigma, shame and blame heaped on these teenage girls, and the grief they suffered when they were forced to leave their babies. Well of course they suffered! And why are there so many adoptees who search for their mothers? It is a bond created by DNA and the 9 months in the womb. Adoption is not without consequences for mother and child, and father if he wanted his child and was never given the chance to be the parent.That is not to say that adoption has no place; many children are born into truly untenable situations with drug addicted or abusive parents who are not capable of parenting. These children need to be safe and loved so adoption is the best answer in many cases. However, this adoption boom in the 50's and 60's had everything to do with being shamed by the evidence of teen sexuality. Most of the families could have given the girl their support and helped her emotionally and financially to parent her child. It was particularly sad when a young couple, near adulthood, wanting to marry, were forced to give up their baby because one set of parents or another would not permit the marriage. But really it was sad in every case as child and mother were forced to separate by social workers and religious workers who did not understand what they were doing.I think abortion has the potential for as many complications for the mother in terms of loss, grief, trauma and regret, as giving up a baby for adoption. And of course, the baby never gets a chance. I think this is an important book and recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 28, 2016","Aug 28, 2016","Aug 26, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/116477.The_Girls_Who_Went_Away

Joey Wheeler is thrown off a cruise ship, off the coast of Florida, by her husband on the their second anniversary cruise. She survives the fall and starts swimming. Guy in a boat finds her delirious and clinging to a bale of pot. He takes her in, hears her story and instead of going to the police the two of them plan a wacky revenge. Joey would like to know why her husband, Chaz, threw her off the ship.Chaz is a biologist working as a water quality specialist for a big agricultural company in the Everglades. His job consists of lying about the amount of phosphorous in the water. When his wife is reported missing and assumed fallen overboard and drowned, this brings a lot of unwanted attention from the police who are rightly suspicious of the circumstances of Joey's assumed death.

Ron Williamson is a small town baseball star in high school. Later he plays in the minors for the Yankees. But he is moody, drinks too much and chases women more than he plays baseball. He gets accused of rape twice, so when a young woman in his neighborhood is raped and murdered Ron becomes the #1 suspect along with a friend of his. It makes sense to look at someone previously accused of rape. The problem was the evidence. The evidence does not support the theory that Ron Williamson committed the murder but the cops believe they have their man and don't pursue other suspects, including the man who was last seen with her. Ron's moodiness becomes full blown mental illness, the justice system grinds on and eventually Ron, insane and not receiving proper health care, is on death row. The cops refuse to accept that they could be wrong. It isn't until DNA evidence technology advances to the point where matches can be made or eliminated that Ron and his friend go free. It is a long haul. The process pretty much takes Ron's life even though he doesn't die on death row. I was amazed by how hard his sisters worked to support him financially and emotionally through all of the years of accusations, incarceration and mental illness, especially his oldest sister Annette. The justice system pretty much chewed him up and spit him out, but he was blessed with a wonderful family, many fine legal people on his team who worked to save him, and some really good friends. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 17, 2016","Jul 17, 2016","Jul 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5345.The_Innocent_Man

He is adopted by the Cheyenne Indian Chief of this small band of Cheyenne. He lives an Indian life but never forgets he is white. In the midst of a battle with whites, while in his young teens, he defects the Indian tribe and rejoins the whites. He is adopted by a white couple, eventually leaves them, marries a Swedish woman and they have a child. Things being what they are, life turns and his life is thrown into chaos when his business partners cheat him and his wife and child are carried off by Indians. Eventually, through various life circumstances, he rejoins the Cheyenne and marries again, has another child. Life turns, he loses them too. And on it goes. He sees some of the worst as an Indian when he is present at Washita. He lives through Little Big Horn as a white man. One thing that I really like about this book is that it does not sugar coat either side and has a sense of humor about both, and best, the Indian Nations are given dignity; they win, they lose, they win, they lose, life turns and it turns and it will turn again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 04, 2016","Jul 11, 2016","Jul 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50667.Little_Big_Man

He starts out selling bagels and coffee, then starts selling theater tickets. Later he acts in the music halls and then starts his own Nickelodeon theaters. He is clever, he makes money, and he loves the idea of moving pictures. He makes it all the way to millions of dollars, a big studio in the Los Angeles area and the beginning of the talking movies which was in 1927.Sadly, he was never appreciated by his family. His mother is a terrible character, written in such a gross stereotypical fashion that towards the end I just skipped the scenes that had her in them. His whole family was just a mess of Jewish stereotypes and it made for unpleasant reading. His brothers were thieves, two sisters married worthless bums, one sister was a spinster, the mother was a shrew. Most of them couldn't get enough money and never contributed. Max was the only one who made money, was generous and liked to help people. The people he should have been able to trust betray him for complicated reasons of their own. It would have been disturbing and upsetting if it wasn't fictional.As a book it was kind of long-winded and, well me being me, I would have preferred to read histories and biographies of the real people who made those early moving pictures....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 16, 2016","Jun 23, 2016","Jun 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2408334.Max

Although he carried a gun he used it as a prop to convince those he was robbing to do as they were told. With his costumes, his charm and professionalism, he almost made bank robbing seem like a legitimate career. I couldn't help but like him. I'm not the only one; cops and criminals respected him, banks had good reason to fear his intelligence and diligence. Prisons had a hard time holding on to him, he successfully broke out of prison three times. He worked as hard at robbing banks as any dedicated person works at a job that they love. There is something about him, the way he stands up to the banking and financial systems that pretty much grind most of us down, that made him an American folk hero and has won my grudging respect and admiration. I wouldn't want my sons to follow in his footsteps, but I liked Willie. Willie suffered a lot in his life, most of the time he was not enjoying the spoils of his robberies. He never had what one might call a normal life. There was a period of his life when he would anonymously donate to have old people with no family buried properly. Who knows, but I'm thinking that Willie was probably not a candidate for hell. Wily, canny, intelligent, book-loving, bank robbing Willie Sutton was a criminal that maybe we all have a little of in our heart. I'm hoping Willie looks after Colton Harris Moore- the Bare Foot Bandit, in a guardian angel sort of way. Colton is a young man who didn't have many chances in life, like Willie, and committed non-violent acts of robbery in a charming way that made him a bit of a folk hero like Willie.

They suffer from 'living in a village neurotic syndrome' meaning they are bored and worried about the ""littleness"" of their lives. On the advice of and following the example of the Scottish grandfather who sent his son Archie away to school, they also send their nine year old son away to boarding school which gives young Thomas more problems than just the village malaise that effects the adults.Then the same very proper Scottish grandfather, who is very close to his son Archie, falls in love. Archie doesn't like this, he feels left out. When the new woman, Marina, comes to the house to meet everyone; they all fall in love with her. Then the grandfather dies and the whole shebang goes all Prince of Tides. We are supposed to buy the premise that Archie having an affair with this woman was just what the family needed to wake it up and send it out of its complacency. My opinion of that premise? Utter and complete rubbish. And the way that the wife Liza is portrayed takes her from competent and happy wife to making her a ghost of her former self, a woman who no longer believes her skills and love are worth much, her husband views her as a pitiful person. We are supposed to believe that the marriage will be better after the upheaval.

First of all, what is the ""Beat"" generation? I always thought it had something to do with music! Or the Bohemian lifestyle. I was surprised to find out that it refers to a group of authors, including Jack Kerouac in the core group. Here is the Wiki definition:The Beat Generation was a group of authors whose literature explored and influenced American culture in the post-World War II era. - def from WikipediaAs I was reading this book I was becoming aware that the 1960's started in the late 1940's with the Beat generation. Everything was ""kicks"", sweet little ""gone"" girls, and the booze? it never stopped flowing, lots of marijuana too and benzedrine. ""...compulsive psychosis dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence."" It was all couched in this search for the truth of life, the true experience of life. They travel all over looking for the authentic experiences of life. They seem to find their own backgrounds and their own selves inauthentic, or at least emotionally hollow and constantly needing to be filled up. Haven't we all been there to some degree? Isn't that why we listen to music, travel and ingest mood altering substances? It is an emotional yearning.But these guys? They take it way beyond. They are hedonistic, wild, irresponsible to the point of criminality. And they seem to me to be such sad and empty people, trying to fill up with noise, booze, drugs, girls, and constant motion. Maybe we all are, except now we are trying to fill up with FB, everyone always on their phone, being present anywhere but where they are. The writing is authentic, it is American to its core. It makes me feel love, nostalgia, disgust and anger; love for my country, disgust at the irresponsibility of the actions of Jack and his friends, sorrow for their emotional wreckage, anger at the damage done to the generations influenced by this book and the cultural change it wrought to drop the moral code and seek the kicks, shock at the ignorance of east coast intellectual liberals with their dreamy eyed vision of the indigent and indigenous peoples and their assumptions of these people's simplicity. There is a lot to rant against in this book, but then there is the nostalgia for the road, to just drive off without plans and see what we shall see. A classic book indeed, the Beat Generation, to a large extent, created the 1960's and the reverberations continue to this day. I was born in 1957, my whole life was influenced by the Beat Generation and Jack Kerouac. I didn't know it though. I was a teen with a soul that vibrated in time with the likes of Jack. I went after the wild times and all that went with it. To some extent it was the culture, but some of the kids went for academics, sports or Prom Queen. I didn't. I can blame the Beat Generation for the culture but not for my own personal choices, not totally anyway. The culture changed, I changed and became a more responsible person than I had been. Doesn't this book give us something to really think about in regards to culture, how it comes about, and people's choices within it? Some people did not like the writing in this book but I thought it was brilliant in its way. Didn't anyone else want to cry when Dean walked away that last time? Didn't everyone feel the pain of little lost boy Dean always looking for his father in the bars and streets he used to frequent?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 13, 2016","May 17, 2016","May 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70401.On_the_Road

At first I thought maybe he is poking fun here  ""I believe that I divine your next statement as clearly as I would see this train, were I standing miles ahead of it and upon a flat track"" at the original Sherlock Holmes stories, but no, this story is as serious as any of the originals. It is, perhaps, as good as the lesser of the originals but, I'm sorry, this is only opinion, not as good as the great originals. So why was he writing it? That is revealed in the afterward.Caleb Carr was, so the editor says, very interested in the story of the murder of the Italian Secretary David Rizzio, in Holyrood Palace in 1566. I wish he had written one of his own books about it, fiction or non-fiction, but in his own way, not as a Sherlock Holmes story. History is fascinating and I would have voted for more history and less fiction.Just as a point of personal interest, one of my sons built a large-ish (more than twice his own height) trebuchet....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 07, 2016","May 09, 2016","May 07, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/149170.The_Italian_Secretary

I got sick of the sickos running this ""multi-national business park"" called Eden Olympia. What kind of a future were they creating? There were no kids in the book except the shadow kids we hear about being used for sex. There were so many films of crimes, both of sex and just beating the life out of ""Arabs"" and ""immigrants"" that it felt like a sick version of the Nixon White House and the Watergate scandal. Sorry for insulting Nixon and his White House; they were nothing compared to Eden Olympia. But there are some parallels with taping and filming and with the official sanctioned government thugs. In Eden Olympia the author calls these bands of executive thugs out for some fun 'the bowling team' because they wear matching leather jackets. Evidently beating people up really cleanses the psyche, releases tension and keeps them safe from viruses. David Greenwood was a British doctor working at Eden Olympia. One of those sainted types; loved by everyone, working so hard, giving his all to both the population in Eden Olympia and the poor immigrant orphanage outside Eden Olympia. One day he goes nuts and shoots a bunch of people. What a crazy aberration! Enter Dr. Jane Sinclair, hired to replace Dr. Greenwood, and her, at loose ends recovering from an injury, pilot husband Paul. They are moved into Dr. Greenwood's former home. Dr. Jane goes to work (she does? she is a paediatrician and there are no kids in Eden Olympia. She doesn't even get to volunteer at the orphanage were Dr. Greenwood worked, as all those ""nubile thirteen year old girls"" have gone elsewhere) and Paul lounges around the pool wondering about Dr. David Greenwood and his motivations for the murders.I never hear of anyone ever actually doing any work although there is plenty of talk about the terribly long hours and the need for recreation to satisfy the beast within. No one in Eden Olympia wants to play games with balls. Noooo, here they want to let loose the raging beast. It is all OK because the Doctor in charge of mental health in Eden Olympia prescribes these activities as therapy. In the meantime, Dr. Jane is spending time with her prurient neighbors and her husband is channeling Dr. David Greenwood. Read it if you want, I don't recommend it.The author does have a way with words. I was trying to read the book and ignore him at the same time, but he did amuse me sometimes. ""It could be racist, or some mad animal rights thing. Fanatical Greens always veer off-course, and end up trying to save the smallpox virus. On the other hand--""""Everyone works hard--it proves nothing. People are impressionable, they snatch powerful emotions out of the air.

The author does not ignore the difficult aspects of the traditional life of subsistence hunters, which if the hunting is not good can mean starvation. Starvation can lead to the deaths of those who contribute the least and need the most, the children and old people, eating the dogs and even eating the people who have died. I don't know the extent to which the violence, domestic abuse and sexual abuse, which the author tells us are all too common today in the Inuit villages, existed in the time before the culture started to change due to alcohol and the introduction to modern life. The traditional life wasn't an easy life, that is without question, but it had beauty, organization, purpose and history. Now much of that is lost through a kind of purposelessness. As the author's friend, Hans Holm, states,""It is easier to be a loser now because they have exchanged some of the old ways for the Internet, the snow scooter, and, of course, the booze. So if you aren't technically trained or have only enough money for beer, then you have an excuse to fail. That was not possible before. Failure meant certain death. Now, too many people are not living in the old ways, making it with just a knife and a string and only eating seal.""On the other side of the emotional spectrum, I find myself wishing to go to Greenland, to see and experience it, to ride a dogsled as the author did. I don't know about eating raw seal (apart from the kashrut issue), I would imagine that takes some serious getting used to. I could see myself having some problems; I'm too cold, there are seal guts and dog shit everywhere (actually the pictures of northern Greenland Inuit villages are very attractive), THAT'S the toilet?! I can't understand a word anyone is saying!! Nevertheless, my brain and heart are responding in a positive way to the idea of going to the northern Eskimo villages of Greenland. The author's descriptions created a longing in me for this. And looking at pictures on line made it even more so.There is so much to this book; politics, questions about the future for the Eskimo people, global warming's effect on the Arctic, the animal populations, global pollution.

I used to host a Parsha class in my home some years ago although it was taught by a Rabbi. Sarah's Table is idealized, at least compared to those groups I have belonged to, but not so much that it is unreal. What I mean by that is at Sarah's Table there is always an abundance of delicious home cooked food, the women all get along and seem close to each other, no one complains (well there is one token complainer at Sarah's table), takes the group off topic or expresses negativity. All the women have problems they are struggling with but everyone's attitude toward their problems is very pious. A lot of Chasidic women are like this, it is true, but this is an idealized version that leaves out the gossip, cliques, petty disagreements, complaints and other negative behaviors that are part of most women's groups and only the most determinedly pious are able to avoid.I enjoyed reading it although it is a little boring.

Miami defense lawyer Roy Black shares four of his cases with us, each case quite different than the others. The first is about a black 20 year old shot in an arcade by a Spanish cop. Miami goes crazy; we'll burn the city down if he is acquitted, we shall overcome etc. Roy Black wades into the furor and wins an acquittal. There are some riots but Miami doesn't burn, it is still there. The next case involves the cold blooded murder of two people by a man who is found cowering in a hole with the money he stole from the people he killed. We hear about the mental illness of the defendant and the life he had as a child and the severe beatings he was given which may have given him brain damage. Roy Black gets him acquitted. The third case involves a young man who shoots his girlfriend, leaves her body in her car at a drive through ATM. He claims it was an accident and he was so upset and he couldn't find the hospital ER and he just panicked. Roy Black gets him acquitted. The fourth case is a federal case against a Cuban banker accused of laundering drug money. Terrifying the power the federal prosecutor's office has. And all the drug dealers they give reduced sentences to in exchange for information. As Roy Black says, powerful inducement to lie. Roy Black gets him acquitted but the government goes after him again and this time won't let him hire Roy Black! This is what Roy Black says about being a defense lawyer.""When most people see me on the nightly news, I am striding into a courtroom beside a person who has been charged with an awful crime: murder, money laundering, rape at a historic mansion. Time and again I hear friends ask me, ""How could you defend him?"" Or: ""Certainly he must have done something or he wouldn't have gotten in trouble, right?""The answer is one that comes out of hard experience in the courts. Ours is an adversary system of justice. This means we determine truth through testing both sides of the story at a trial, not by means of a sixty-second news clip or a talk-radio rant or the latest CNN poll. We have INALIENABLE RIGHTS, meaning ones our government can't take away. Rights are not self-executing. The don't exist unless you have a lawyer to enforce them. Article 125 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. issued by Stalin in 1936 provided that ""the citizens ...are guaranteed by law a) freedom of speech b) freedom of the press c) freedom of assembly including the holding of mass meetings and d) freedom of street processions and demonstrations."" But these were just so many words, because Stalin did not provide for attorneys independent of state control to speak for those rights vigorously. He did not offer his people our crucial Sixth Amendment, which allows the accused to ""enjoy...the assistance of counsel for his defense."" Lawyers are the ones who transform abstract rights into reality.""I recommend this book.Upgrading my rating of this book because it is intelligent, thought provoking and stayed bright in my memory while so many other books were quickly forgotten....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 29, 2016","Feb 06, 2016","Jan 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2023007.Black_s_Law

The start of this book finds him walking the Cornish coast; filthy, unshaven, just walking, walking, walking in a world of hurt and grief.

A couple of themes run through it; grief and the process of moving on, or not; sexual promiscuity and whether that is a strength or a weakness, a preference or a sickness and if a sickness, when does it cross the line into sickness; the relationship between fathers and sons and the difficulties in growing up and meeting the expectations of parents; the gulf between the the social classes and whether that gulf can be bridged or not.

Two little girls meet in a cemetery and become best friends. They also become friends with the gravedigger's son who is of the same age. Swirling around the children is the drama of the adults in their lives. The story begins at the time of Queen Victoria's death and ends after the King Edward's death some 9 years later. Life ends and life goes on; it is all very sad and inevitable. Too close to my own broken heart. Every character is flawed and makes mistakes, sometimes with terrible consequences. Some make decisions that would not be my own.

It was published in 1999 when the Taliban was first coming into power. It is interesting, although it is sort of the hunky-dory version of his trip across Afghanistan by foot, horse, truck. He has a guide for some of it but mostly he is an Englishman with rudimentary Persian (at least in the beginning) traveling on his own and getting by on his wits and his trust in fate. It is interesting for sure.Then after I finished the book I wrote the rest of this :What I mean by hunky-dory, is it seems he makes an effort to tell us the good things and put all of his experiences into some kind of positive light. The more unpleasant things are briefly mentioned, usually with a self-deprecating sense of humor, so one kind of dismiss them. I think that this is because there is so much negative opinion about Afghanistan already that he is trying not to add to it.I found the book became more intense as it continued, and sad. I found myself repeating what one of the residents of Afghanistan says, ""Why Afghanistan?"" One can't help but feel heartbroken at the destruction of Afghanistan. He published this in 1999. People were hoping that war would end and that the Taliban would just disappear or something. No such thing, right? Why did we declare war on Afghanistan after 9/11? What a betrayal of a country that thought we were allies! The Taliban were giving refuge to Osama bin Laden, but to declare war on the country? The US evidently had a significant role in arming and supporting the formation of the Taliban. The people who perpetrated 9/11 were Saudi. Did we declare war on Saudi Arabia? No we did not. Maybe that would have endangered the flow of oil. Oh, I am plenty confused. But I am heartbroken for the people of Afghanistan. The Russians, the British, the U.S., the various groups vying for power within the country, the Taliban. Will Afghanistan ever see peace? So this book is written by a unaffiliated British traveler to Afghanistan. Some of his writing is brilliant, very funny. Some of the political and religious opinions he expresses are slightly confused as he tries to avoid taking sides or expressing strong opinions. I bookmarked a lot to share but in the end I just can't, I'm not even sure it matters. The book takes an emotional bite out of the reader and like the author at the end, I ""began to weep"". ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 18, 2015","Dec 26, 2015","Dec 18, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/161712.An_Unexpected_Light

She could see through a lot of the cultural trappings while still wanting to be part of it all. But being part of it didn't seem to be a choice she could make. She could see the futility which is never good for a person's mental health. She is a high achiever; one of these girls with excellent grades and many awards. But she feels socially inept and unattractive. When people did like her she could see all their faults and couldn't like them back. The only person she liked was her snarky, bitchy, slutty friend who was always getting her into trouble, usually involving alcohol and men, although Sylvia didn't sleep with the men. She seemed to find everyone either ridiculous or disgusting. There is a possibility that she was raped while she was in New York. Putting together several scenes in the book and the aftermath, I think it is a very strong possibility.When she is 19 she has a breakdown and tries to commit suicide. She is committed, given shock treatment, and seemingly recovers.That is the point at which the book ends but I looked her up to see what happens next. She works, she teaches, she marries and has two children. She is also sick a lot and her marriage falls apart.Sadly, she does kill herself eventually, after the book is published. She may have been upset by the s the book was receiving. She was so smart but full of self doubt, a difficult combination. But I think she probably never truly gave up the idea of suicide completely. like leaving her options open. After her husband's infidelity (that may be plural, I don't know) and their separation I would imagine it beckoned, this suicide option. She did contact a psychiatrist evidently but didn't alarm anyone. This time she successfully hid what she was thinking and kept working and caring for her kids until she succeeded in her suicide. Why a suicide picks one moment and not another only the suicide knows. I was glad that she protected her babies from the gas she used to kill herself, but it didn't protect them from growing up without a mother. Her husband's mistress also commit suicide and killed their child as well. From what I read it is thought to be a copycat suicide of Sylvia's. Sylvia's adult son also commit suicide. He suffered from depression like his mother. From what I've read about suicide in general there may be genetic predisposition, copycat suicide, and just the phenomenon of suicide passing through families, friends and communities like a contagion.If I made any mistakes in this , getting something wrong about Sylvia's history or personality, I apologize. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Dec 2015,"Dec 03, 2015","Dec 01, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6514.The_Bell_Jar

It is a lot of fun to read. Personally, I don't drink beer or any alcohol. My last beer was probably in high school during the mid 1970's. I think it was Coors. I also don't watch sports, so I am unfamiliar with beer commercials. If you had asked me, before I read this book, for a beer slogan I probably could have come up with ""This Bud's for you"". So I am someone who really does not know beer. But that didn't stop me from enjoying this book, it is interesting reading. Statistics wise it doesn't look like things are so different now than when the book was published in 1997. Excluding microbrews, you still have Budweiser at the top. Bud Light is the best selling beer in America, Budweiser is third best selling, and they are still fooling around with ICE and lime flavors. Coors Light is the second best selling beer and Miller Light is the fourth best selling beer. Corona comes in fifth. On the list of the top twenty we still see Michelob Ultra, Heineken of 3 types, Miller High Life and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Lots of microbrews around which sound interesting. And even gluten free beer which doesn't have all bad s. Interesting world of beers out there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 29, 2015","Nov 30, 2015","Nov 25, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/745119.Beer_Blast

My own experiences with Starbucks coincide with what the author tells us. When my son passed away in 2004 I struggled to control my depression. I was often in Starbucks, drinking coffee and crying. I was given extra free shots of espresso and even free cups of coffee as the staff tried to do what they could to ease my pain. When traveling with my special needs son, who has to eat on a schedule and a special diet, we have always been able to take our own food into Starbucks and sit at a table and eat. I usually tried to buy at least one drink, but we were never challenged if we did not. And yes, Starbucks is renowned for their clean public bathrooms! In Times Square and have to use the bathroom? Find the Starbucks of course. Starbucks is, to me, a cultural comfort. I was so surprised when I went to New England and all they had were Dunkin' Doughnuts! My GPS could locate them all! And I wasn't looking for them. My experience of Boston was getting lost, nowhere to get gas, nowhere to park, and nowhere to go to the bathroom. I squirmed in discomfort in Boston. I needed Starbucks!!On the down side, with the book, not with Starbucks, is the author's affair. It gave me what I call ""bad brain"", meaning a depressive sinkhole. Maybe other long-term married women in their late 50's didn't feel the horror of it. He becomes impotent with his wife but has no problem with a younger and most likely better looking woman. Maybe other women can read that and not feel threatened, not feel ugly, useless and undesirable, not feel redundant, not feel that their husband would probably prefer a younger and better looking woman. We value youth and beauty in this culture. It didn't help that the author came across as a nice guy. Maybe he had cheated before this but it only came to divorce because he fathered a child with the woman he was cheating with. I don't know. But, like I said, it gave me a case of ""bad brain"". I couldn't forgive Mike for it. I was happy when he got his job at Starbucks and that he had success with it. I wanted that for him with most of my heart.

As a book, it becomes somewhat repetitive as Mark tells us many times how much he loves Sprite and how he is suffering both the potential loss and then the actual loss, and how he second=guesses the decisions he made in regards to Sprite's health care and the decision to put the dog to sleep. Mark agonizes, I sympathize. That doesn't make it a great book. It is simplistic in its grammatical construction and short on substance. The substance is Mark Levin has a broken heart. As someone who has suffered a broken heart over the accidental death of one of my children, well I understand a broken heart and that it does not act logically nor respond to the dictates or logic of others. But there are only so many ways to say I am bereaved, and only so long that your heartbreak will hold the attention of the reader. So I sympathized but found my attention drifting as I wondered about his good friend Rush Limbaugh, and I pondered the ethical pros and cons of putting an animal to sleep.  I only caught a couple of Rush Limbaugh's shows back in the 1990's. I remember his slying saying that there was a new dog in the White House and up came a picture of Chelsea Clinton who must have been about 13 at the time. I thought that was so cruel that I never watched another of his shows and I haven't liked him since, although I read another book where a good friend of his talks about how kind and thoughtful Rush Limbaugh was to him in his time of need. I can't remember who that was now. No matter. So I am willing to concede that Rush Limbaugh can be a good friend, despite his cruelty to a young teenage girl on National Television.  i felt the pain and guilt of Mr. Levin in putting Sprite to sleep. How easy we use that euphemism, ""put to sleep"". i can't judge, but i hope that decision will not be mine to make, ever. I'm pretty sure I would not choose to put to sleep. When I was a young child our cat was nearly cut in half by the fan belt of our car. My dad was going to shoot him but we all screamed so much that my mom rushed him to the vet. Eight hours of surgery and weeks of recovery saved his life. He lived until I was in college when he finally died a natural death from cancer. i just don't know that we have the wisdom to know when life should be ended.  These were some of my thoughts while reading about dear Sprite, his good friend Pepsi, and the Levin family who loves their dogs. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 11, 2015","Nov 14, 2015","Nov 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/994192.Rescuing_Sprite

I lost a son, I understand completely.But, OMG, the weirdness of seances, with the levitating tables, the floating musical instruments, and worst and weirdest of all, the ""ectoplasm"", which, according to Google definitions, is ""a supernatural viscous substance that is supposed to exude from the body of a medium during a spiritualistic trance and form the material for the manifestation of spirits."" It says ""any orifice"" so I guess the mouth, ears and nose are common orifices from which to exude ectoplasm. Margery's orifice of choice was often her vagina. Well, never mind that because the ectoplasm thing is the fakest part of a common con, imo. Are all mediums frauds? Or are there genuine mediums who can contact the dead? It is an interesting question. I once went to an event for the families of the victims of a multiple shooting tragedy. My son didn't die in this shooting, but he did die and he kept coming through the strongest for this medium who was at the event. Well that sounded just like him and I was shaken. Was that true? I don't know. So, this question about mediums and contacting the dead? That is the question that a panel of scientists and experts are given to answer for Scientific American. The panel includes Houdini who is quite certain that all the mediums are fraudulent, as he has been in the magic and illusion business all of his life and knows all the tricks. The panel interviews and attends the seances of a number of mediums but the medium who they really can't figure out is ""The Witch of Lime Street"" given the public name of Margery, although actually her name is Mina. She is quite an interesting character, a very charismatic and seductive character. Most of the men go into a deeper trance than Margery and believe her. Houdini doesn't believe her, although he is drawn to her, but he sets out to prove she is a fraud and that all mediums are frauds. Show time! For whatever reason, I was very fond of Houdini and felt protective towards him. The hatred expressed towards him from the people who are in the spirit movement was shocking. They are vicious in attacking him as a Jew, and enjoy predicting his death. It was really sad to see. Houdini is usually the gentleman and never a complainer. He went after the mediums with a vengeance because he couldn't abide the fraud, but could he prove that Margery was 100% fraudulent?

Dragonfly in Amber is the second book in the series. She is, in this book, married to a Highlander named Jamie Fraser.

It wasn't good enough to be entertaining, and had nothing much more than the storm scenes to recommend it.The writing reminded me of Stuart Wood, with the recounting of meals, drinks, music listened to, macho posturing of sexual conquests, and a creepy sexual interest in teenage girls. This book was better than a Woods book, less of the F- word, more to the actual story; but still that same vibe that the book was written by an older guy writing a younger man's life and and older man's fantasies. The story is about a guy named Joe, a con man and thief, who makes rich women fall in love with him and scams them out of their money. He nearly gets killed but he goes right back to scamming. This time however, he isn't going to follow through as the woman is paraplegic and he doesn't feel good about stealing from her. Instead, he falls in love with her, rescues her from evil's clutches and then disappears from her life.

At first it is aThis is a very powerful and disturbing story about a group of British school boys, aged about 6 to 12, marooned on a tropical island. At first it is a big adventure but as the time passes it becomes less an adventure and more a nightmare.The boys choose as their leader a good looking, charming and decent boy who tries his best to get them organized to keep a fire going so the smoke might be seen, build shelters, hunt food and keep a society of rules and order. Trouble is visible right from the beginning with another boy with leadership abilities, a brutal and intelligent boy who craves to be in control. So there you have your tug of war between good and evil. I will call these two leaders 'light' and 'dark'. Just like creation right? OK, so dark leader wants to hunt, and he takes 'his' boys and they are the hunters. Light leader doesn't mind this but he is having trouble getting 'his' boys to work, they want to play all the time. Dark leader is having trouble killing the pigs of the island until he puts on paint, then, masked, he is able to kill. Trouble explodes between the two leaders when the hunters, who are in charge of the fire as well, let the fire go out while they are hunting. Missed opportunity for rescue perhaps. Dark leader is angry and gathers 'his' boys more tightly together, paints them all and they go out for a hunt. They kill a nursing sow most brutally and rejoice in the killing, performing dances re-enacting the kill. Dark leader, through his ability to offer food, disguise, hunting and dancing, is able to gather all but five of the boys to his side. He sets up a different camp and, ..... I don't want to say more, it just gets ugly in a way that is inevitable and tragic. I was reminded of The Hunger Games but this was more to the point of the condition of the world and what happens to us in the constant struggle between light and dark, how, in our struggle for survival, we pick our leaders, and how otherwise good people end up doing evil things. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 17, 2015","Oct 18, 2015","Oct 17, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies

This story is fiction, but the place and the war going on are not fictional. The setting is Bougainville Island in the early 1990's after the blockade. The rebels are in the jungle, the red-skins (from Papua New Guinea - as far as I could tell from reading about this conflict on Wikipedia) were fighting the rebels and the villagers were caught between, unable to get off the island and victims of both the rebels and the redskins. We meet Matilda and her mother living in a small village on the island, and living among them, a white man married to an islander. The white man is a bit of a mystery and a spectacle, but he reaches out and offers to teach the children. He does this in the most extraordinary way; by reading Great Expectations by Charles Dickens aloud to them. The children, especially Matilda, are caught up in the story and learn a way to leave their lives temporarily through the words of a book. The white man's name is Mr. Watts but he becomes Mr. Pip for the red-skins who are demanding to know who this Pip is. Pip is the character from Great Expectations but this explanation is not believed leading to terrible consequences. Mr. Watts also invites the parents into the classroom to teach what they know. It is a remarkable classroom.I was slow in reading this book because I was afraid of the inevitable violence. Long after everything is over and Matilda lives in Australia she goes to find out more about Mr. Watts. It is surprising to learn what she finds out and the understanding it brings to the whole picture of Mr. Watts.

I have been to Masada and like everywhere in Israel, the past lives and breathes. The past is the past but it is also the present, you can feel it. It is incredibly powerful and very moving. For me, the most powerful experience on Masada was watching a scribe work. The Roman Empire is gone, the Jews are still here. Kol Hakavod! Chazak! Chazak! Venischazeik! (Be strong! Be strong! And may we be strengthened!) For anyone who does not know the story of Masada; Jews had taken refuge on Masada as the Roman Empire took Jerusalem and enslaved/and or killed all the Jews of the lands they took. When all the other Jews had been conquered, the Romans of the 10th Legion gathered to take Masada. When the Jews, who had fought very bravely, knew that the battle was over and they were to be enslaved or killed, they made the decision to take their own lives. It was done systematically by slitting the throats with the last person slitting his own. I can 't judge that, I don't know if they did right or wrong or what I would do in that situation. I can only love them, grieve for them, and carry them into the future. As for the fictional story; I have a very serious problem with adultery and this story has quite a bit of it. It made the reading bitter for me. Also, the story contains idol worship and witchcraft by a Jewish character that she calls the Witch of Moav. I don't know the history of these things in Judaism and was a little uncomfortable with it and confused by it. Idol worship is strictly forbidden by Jewish law and I think that bird bone divination and the casting of spells are considered witchcraft and are also forbidden. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 07, 2015","Oct 12, 2015","Oct 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10950924-the-dovekeepers

This stony treasure had survived six hundred years of wild Scottish history, including a crucial battle fought on its doorstep, yet it took only one drunken rake to piss it away. Hugh's life achievements amounted to a list of perfidies: demolishing Stackpole; selling Golden Grove and all the Welsh land; brutalizing his first wife; rebuffing his extended family; discarding friendships like used tissues; indulging in fabulously injudicious sexual adventrues; destroying his health; and then revealing his most wretched act only after his final exit.""His second wife is a total complete horrible bitch. The only thing good Hugh ever did was to marry his first wife. She must be the reason that his son Colin turned out as good as he did.

The child was well cared for, very well educated and showed no sign of abuse or neglect whatsoever. Her father was a Vietnam vet and was proficient in living off the grid. The police were kind enough to let them stay together (I'm not sure if this lifestyle was illegal or just eccentric - do homeless people in cities have their kids taken away from them?) and a place was found for them to work and live.

The prominent personalities, the machinations, the in-fighting, the corruption, and the alliances in our new government, the interpretations of the Constitution and Law and how these things played out in our new country, told through the story of the early Sedgwick family, made for fascinating reading. The story kind of goes downhill from there as the personalities in the family become less influential in American history and diluted as personalities in general. The story John Sedgwick is trying to tell is the story of the strain of manic depression that runs through his family history and through his own veins. But being a woman nearing sixty, the story I kept hearing was the one of the women who were no longer loved once they reached fifty or so, whose husband's left them alone on one pretext or another while they gallivanted around for politics, war or work and enjoyed themselves while their wives pined and wasted away; unloved, depressed and often eventually mentally ill. Oftentimes for the women this was preceded by the grief of losing children. That was incredibly sad to me. Not that the men didn't suffer from mental illness, many of them did to one degree or another. Manic behavior and dementia were not uncommon as men dealt with the stress of making money and maintaining status, while also having a predilection for manic depression. I was kind of tickled to run into Opal Whiteley again (I had read a book about her at an earlier time) and have a background in which to place Ellery Sedgwick as he was the editor of The Atlantic magazine who published her diary. It was like running into people that I already know. What I didn't like was the way the story seems to run too long. There were points when I was just tired of it. I also did not find the Sedgwick propensity toward manic depression truly that unusual, except for Francis and the terrible result his mental illness had on his children. What family history is ""normal""? I realize that a lot of them were under psychiatric care; but they had the money for the care and the connections to follow the latest trends in mental health. Overall it was interesting and I am glad that I read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 03, 2015","Sep 07, 2015","Sep 03, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/346982.In_My_Blood

Well this is a memoir, written some years after the death of her daughter Paula. It is sometimes written in the form of a dialogue with Paula. It has the feel of confession, apology and regret; not uncommon in memoirs written in later life. But Isabel Allende is such a firebrand, such a fighter, a real spitfire that she doesn't sink into it. She basically calls up her tough attitude and gathers her family and imposes both her will and her intense love to do her best to keep everyone together. As an author she can be very funny, but she is also a bereaved parent and that unbearable sorrow runs through the book like an underground river, occasionally surfacing but mostly just below the surface of Isabel's personality and writing.I can't say I enjoyed reading it as much as her fiction. Everyone's life is somewhat boring to other people unless it is written in the form of entertainment. Isabel is entertaining, but she is also explaining, confessing and purging.

The chances of his survival are super slim to none. While in the coma he experiences some interesting phenomena; a Near Death Experience. Despite all medical predictions and statistical chances for survival he comes back, functional and not in the vegetative state predicted if he did survive, and he has a story to tell.Do I believe that Eben is telling the truth as he remembers it? Yes. I believe in God and life after death, so why not this version? This was his experience and I don't judge it. His work as a neurosurgeon, status as a scientist and disinterest and disbelief in the spiritual aspect of existence before his NDE increased the dichotomy between his life and beliefs before and after and made his story more interesting than it might otherwise have been. The fact of the miracle of his survival is certainly enough to give a reader pause. That alone said something is going on here beyond a purely physical event.I do find fascinating the adoption part of Eben's past and how that played into, well everything about who Eben is. As an adopted child myself I do feel that there are parallels in my emotional experience of being adopted to Eben's experience. I wonder about those seven years between the rejection by his birth mother and his NDE. Those years seem key to his illness and his NDE. I guess I just want to understand Eben's psychology more than he offered here, and he did actually offer quite a bit.The only parts of the book I didn't care for were the parts where he promotes a meditation method and the organization that promotes and practices it; and the promotion of his own organization, an NDE non-profit. I didn't want to be sold on something or channeled into being involved in an organization. I just wanted to read Eben's experience. But maybe these promotions provide value to other people who have experienced NDE, although I always feel the ""that happened to me too"" factor can reduce any validity to an NDE story.

When he is a teenager he and his siblings go to Bosnia as there is a report that the Virgin Mary has appeared to some children there and has been giving them messages. --to me that sounds weird and possibly scary, but the good that came of this is remarkable. Magnus is very moved by this event, his whole family is. His parents, who already run a guest house, open their home and property as a religious retreat. Magnus becomes a fish farmer as an adult but doesn't forget his experience in Bosnia. Then when Yugoslavia splits into different states and war breaks out he feels called to collect and bring aid into Bosnia. This is the beginning of the aid that eventually blossoms into Mary's Meals. The idea of Mary's Meals is to provide one meal a day for children in school in very poor and developing nations. A lot of these children would never be in school if it weren't for these meals; they would be working for their families or sick/dead. Mary's Meals provides a meal for children in school thereby reducing starvation and giving children a chance to get educated so they can break the cycle of poverty and become a source for positive change in their countries. It isn't just aid either; Mary's meals are cooked by volunteers in the community where the meals are served, the food is grown locally if possible. It is program designed to give means to the community, not just charity. It really is marvelous. And the way it is run; humble, costs kept down, faith based with all faiths accepted. I like Magnus as well; he seems like a man who lives what he professes. I like also that the book stays away from political rhetoric and religious rhetoric. That is pretty amazing considering the places he works are often torn apart by politics and religion. For Magnus and Mary's Meals it is all about the kids, feeding and educating the kids.

It was fascinating learning what the vectors for passing the diseases to human could be, such as ticks, mice urine, rats etc, how the diseases are spread in hospitals by the lack of proper barrier nursing procedures and the re-use of needles, and all the symptoms of these diseases and how they are treated in developing countries under crude conditions and how they are treated in first world countries like the United States and England.

I didn't want to be involved in their personal lives and to start thinking about when their romance started and the reasons for their divorces etc. But the Sue and Joe and Joe and Sue...kept my mind there and without knowing what went on in Joe's marriage, besides his constant absence from home, I started feeling sorry for his first wife.

That stands for Not Quite Right. Gibby was in a car accident in which both her parents were killed and she was left brain damaged. That was three years ago. Now she lives with her grandfather and works in his cafe and goes fishing with him and picks up the egg delivery for the cafe. She also writes a newspaper that she researches herself and gets printed and distributed around town. When she finds the dead body of a prominent citizen on the beach she decides to keep this information to herself until she can publish her big story. She wants to make this amazing story so her mother in heaven will rest easy knowing Gibby is now QR again. Gibby has memory problems, half the time she can't remember that she even found a body. She has a friend named Billy who is a Vietnam Vet plagued with flashbacks, and is friends with a girl named Carol Lever who Gibby calls Clever. Gibby is often very insightful and witty for a brain damaged girl, she also has a problem with cussing and saying inappropriate things as a result of her brain damage. The things Gibby says and thinks are what make the book charming. I think what bothers me is that very serious subjects are brought up here: brain damage, infidelity, sexual assault, rape, incest, murder, corruption, PTSD, promiscuity, alcoholism and racism; but it is all written about in a glib and superficial way. It doesn't come off like the author doesn't care, on the contrary, but I was struck by dissonance.It is a sweet book and feel good book in some ways, with things eventually coming right in a totally unrealistic way.

I say it starts out ""almost normal"" but the story is scary from the beginning. One just doesn't realize how scary.

It has been seven years since that attack. Now the young woman works at a homeless shelter, she swims every morning, she has an older boyfriend with two young daughters and no interest in a long term commitment. One day at work she is given a box of photos, quite good photos, that were the property of a homeless man that the shelter had helped. The owner of the shelter thinks perhaps they can have a showing of the man's photos as a fundraiser and asks her young employee, who is interested in photography, if she can fix the damaged photos and print the rest from the negatives. Unfortunately there is a photo of a young woman on a bike on a logging road. So starts the search for who this man was and what he was doing with a picture that looks an awful lot like herself on her bike before the attack.The pictures in the book are quite good. How some good black and white photos taken, in real life, by a guy who became homeless, caused the author to come up with this story is a leap I can't quite make.

Rather brilliant in astronomy, hydrology and craftsmanship; not to mention the hunting and farming skills necessary to survive without grocery stores. #2 Not peaceful. Evidence abounds of human sacrifice as part of religion, and massacres that were part of warfare between indigenous peoples.  #3 Not innocent. They were as complex as all human being are, with the heights of goodness and creation and the depths of depravity and destruction.  It seems that the cliff dwellings were security dwellings; makes sense right? Hard to find, hard to access, easy to spot invaders. The complexity and craftsmanship of the cliff dwellings is something to be marveled at.  There is this idea that the cliff dwellings were suddenly abandoned. This doesn't seem to be the case though. Death by massacre, death by drought and consequent malnutrition, desertion by migration, and the inevitable downfall, decay, destruction and rebirth that happens to all civilizations seem to be the reasons that the cliff dwellings became uninhabited. There are lots of pre-Columbian cliff dwellings in Northern Mexico and huge swaths of indigenous people in Northern Mexico died of diseases brought by the Spanish Conquistadors before Columbus ever landed on the American shores. Some of these dead indigenous were almost certainly migrants from what is now the Southwest United States. The author sets out to trace the Anasazi, the cliff dwellers, the multi-ethnic indigenous people of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico. He takes us along as he walks, camps, climbs and explores the lands and dwellings of these pre-Columbian people. Travelogue and history lesson.

One of those men was then shot, Milo has disappeared with the envelope and Billy is left at the crime scene to try to help the victim and wait for the police.

She is always like, I'm just your teacher, when she was obviously so much more both in her mind and her student's mind.Then we have all the failures of the educational system including that f'd up Least Restrictive Environment law. Torey is spot on when she is skeptical of the law and says it is being implemented to save money. As the mother of a special needs son who needs a pretty restrictive environment to keep him safe, I fought against that law time and time again so that he could be in classrooms with a higher teacher to student ratio and a classroom that was restrictive enough to protect him and the others around him. We also have the failures of the social services agencies. I mean, wtf, they keep sending her back to her dad who is a drug addict and has been selling her since she was a small girl to pay for his drugs. Her uncle rapes her as a six year old thereby rendering her unable to have kids ever. Dad goes to jail on drug charges but as far as I can see from the book no one is ever punished for this child's physical (she has cigarette burn scars up and down her arms) and sexual abuse, and her neglect. The professional relationship of therapists, teachers and caregivers to needy children is a very difficult one. It is necessary to bond with a child to help her, gain her trust; but it is all only professional to the professional and when it is all over the child is saying but what happened? I thought you liked me and cared about me?I've seen that also with my son. His 'best buds' are these professionals who work with him intensively for years and when it is over, see ya! My son couldn't comprehend why people he saw 3 or 4 times a week and who were his ""friends"" no longer came over or called or shared his birthdays etc. Saying it was only my job is certainly going to cause a lack of trust and a skeptical attitude toward other professional ""friends"". So the whole system needs a serious re-think. Then there is Torey herself; won't commit. Love? deny, deny, deny. I'm too young to get married! I'm only your teacher! Sure. Wasn't it idiotic when she brings Sheila over to Chad's for 4th of July with his wife and kids? And she wonders why Sheila acts the way she does? She created the family fantasy of Chad, Torey and Sheila back when Sheila was six; and then she shatters the dream, then brings her back as a teen for a visit with Chad and his new family, including the oldest daughter named Sheila!! A total nitwit should have seen that was a recipe for disaster.I have decided to amend this  to say two things:1. If Torey Hayden had not intervened in this girl's behalf then things could have gone much worse for her. She was scheduled to be put in a psychiatric facility and was only put in school as a holding measure until a place opened in the psych facility. Torey intervened and the result was that Sheila was allowed to stay in school where she had two good years (or as good as they could be considering her problems) until her father moved them again and Sheila went through a series of foster homes when her father was in jail on drug charges.Torey had good intentions and did good for Sheila, although the book still reads like a confession of everything Torey feels she failed to do for Sheila.2. It is very unclear what is true and what is not in this true story. In the book Torey stays in U.S., stays single and has no kids. In real life Torey goes to Wales, gets married and has a child after her teaching experience with Sheila. She gets divorced and returns to the U.S. which is when I assume she looked for and found Sheila again. If Torey's story is so altered, how altered is the story she tells of Sheila?...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"May 28, 2015","Apr 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/106026.The_Tiger_s_Child

It follows the timeline of her grandmother's life but is written in short, vignette like chapters. It helps to give some explanation for the crazy upbringing that Jeanette Walls tells us about in The Glass Castle. The grandmother had a very full and interesting life starting in a dirt house, helping her father train horses and run a working ranch, teaching in one room school houses, marriage and divorce to a bigamist in Chicago, the suicide of her younger sister, marriage to Big Jim and running cattle ranches with him and raising two children with him one of whom is Rosemary, Jeannette's mother. Rosemary grows up to marry Rex and so begins Jeannette's wild upbringing. When I read the story I couldn't help but think that things might have been different for Rosemary if she had been allowed to marry the Indian boy she had a crush on, or if that was unrealistic, if she had been gently told that her interest in the boy could be his undoing (rather than being severely whipped for her interest) and if the ""do-gooders"" had minded their own business and the Indians were not their business, or if Rosemary had never been taken off the ranch and sent to boarding schools. Speaking of the Indian boy, that story of taking the ""do-gooders"" up to the Havasupai tribe was the most upsetting in the book. Fidel, the subject of Rosemary's crush, tells Lily and Rosemary ""You people think you're rescuing these children, but they just end up unfit for both the valley and the world outside. Take it from me. I was sent to that school.""Rosemary says, ""Well at least when you left, you didn't turn to stone."" (there was a legend that any Havasupai who left the tribe for good would be turned to stone)Fidel answers, ""What turns to stone is inside you.""In the end Lily feels that she failed in the raising of Rosemary and considers Rosemary the one child that she could not teach. But things were as they were; Rosemary and crazy Rex got married, and the rest is history as told to us by Jeannette in The Glass Castle....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 19, 2015","May 20, 2015","Apr 28, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6366437-half-broke-horses

What I liked best were the stories he told of when he was a young teen and first moved to his Uncle's ranch in Oregon and learned to be a ranch hand. That was really enjoyable to read. I also liked the environmental aspects of it. But there are some mental aspects of it that were, well, weird. Environmentally I agreed; I think hunting for sport is despicable, I think the killing of wolves and coyotes for sport or for profit is criminally stupid and cruel, I think using your land in an intelligent way as the author does and working with nature rather than against it is a fantastic accomplishment. But all that said, the author is strange. Basically he seems to fall in love with a coyote and get jealous when she acts like a coyote and goes off with a male coyote. He also moves out of the main ranch house (his wife is always vacuuming under his feet or something) and into a small cabin on the property. He doesn't say he throws over his family to become a coyote (he howls) but it seems that way. (My interpretation of his family life and his relationship with the coyotes could be way off base, I'm just saying that this is how it seemed to me.) And also, for a guy who thinks he is one with nature, he sure managed to royally screw up Don Coyote's life. Question: why when Don Coyote was shot didn't he check on the coyote and try to take life saving measures? Or if the coyote was dead, which he wasn't but the author didn't know that, why didn't he bury him? Don Coyote wasn't just a coyote to him, he was a friend. Leaving a friend for dead and going off feeling sorry for yourself is not the way you treat a friend.Like all autobiographical books I've read, I'm somewhat skeptical of the absolute truth of the thing. Nevertheless, I like him a whole lot more than his sheep ranching, coyote killing neighbors. And I have great admiration for his environmental successes on his ranch. From what I read, his daughter runs the ranch now (or did when that article was published) and the author continued his environmental commitments, moving to South Dakota and opening a wild horse sanctuary. He also taught writing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 20, 2015","May 24, 2015","Apr 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2342805.Don_Coyote

Francine Hughes, after fourteen years of spousal abuse at the hands of her husband, sets a gas accelerated fire around the bed of her sleeping, drunk husband who had spent the day drinking and abusing her.When you read the story the words are written as if a reasonable and innocent woman, who might otherwise have never experienced violence, was caught in a situation so horrible that the only way out was to murder her husband. Actually he was her ex-husband but he refused to leave.I had mixed feelings about the acquittal, jury handed down a decision of temporary insanity. It was pretty clear that if she didn't kill him he was going to kill her. But the self-defense excuse was not going to fly because he had been asleep when she killed him. I think it was self-defense and not temporary insanity, but the lawyer chose well in his decisions on how to best save Francine from a life in jail. The book also makes it seem like she was close to her kids and all they needed was the father out of the picture. So the story ends on a positive note with Francine walking free.But go ahead and read about her life after this book. She was partying and doing drugs, her kids were already traumatized by the abuse they had witnessed, and the horrible way their father died. A few years after the trial Francine marries a man who becomes a, well I guess you could say hard-line strict, step-father, physically abusive and, if the youngest child Nicole is telling the truth, sexually abusive. I think it might have been better for everyone if Francine had served her life sentence and I don't know if the kids could have been rescued or not, but it would have been nice if someone had tried.http://www.people.com/people/archive/...Probably the most important thing about this book, and all the publicity around the case, is that it helped to change perception about spousal abuse. When Francine was growing up spousal abuse was the business of the family and nobody else's business. Her father abused her mother. She grew up seeing it, and to a large degree it was part of the culture of male dominance in which she lived. We understand a lot more now about the psychology of abuse, its causes and effects. It doesn't mean we have things under control though. From what I read, the third son Dana also became an abusive husband. We have more social services to help battered women and children, but it is far from a sure thing that these victims can get the help they need, that they can recover and not become the next generation of abusers. Also, I am not sure about the accuracy of what I have said here; I read a book and read some on line articles and comments.

By the time I reached the end my eyes were very nearly closed in sleep. So there was that, but it was also frustrating. It could have been titled ""Missed Connections and Wasted Lives"". Lucy Gault is nine years old when her family is threatened by patriot hooligans who poison the dogs and try to firebomb the house. Mr. Gualt, Lucy's father, shoots over these hooligan's heads from an upstairs window to frighten them, but he misses and hits one boy in the shoulder. The boy is then considered a patriot wounded for Ireland and sentiment runs against the Gaults. Lucy's parents decide they must move to England until things cool down. Lucy does not want to go and takes an impetuous action that changes all their lives forever. One could forgive that mistake, despite the terrible consequences, as she was a child. When she later makes another stupid decision I was done with her, although I did finish the book. The sentimentality of the book left me untouched. I thought it was a melancholy waste of time in that I gained no insight, learned nothing and was not entertained. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 13, 2015","Mar 30, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/167302.The_Story_of_Lucy_Gault

It is not an easy book to walk into with no prior knowledge of football in England or of Brian Clough. Once I got a grasp I enjoyed the book more but it was always appalling because Brian Clough was an appalling sort of guy. His language was rough with F*** and bloody laced through everything he said unless he was talking to kids or his family. He wasn't nice, he didn't try to spare feelings, his drinking was out of control. He was also a guy who got things done, and was a successful football manager. He was a powerhouse personality, but if the book is accurate, he was also beset by things like fear of failure and loneliness. Because the book was written about the 44 days he was Leeds manager and then got fired; and about the times he very successfully managed Derby but resigned after falling out with members of the board; because it was written about these times it is notably dark. But a lot of good can be said with his successes in managing football teams, successes in the media, and his player's notably good sportsmanship. And he is written here as a good family man.Well, always interesting to learn about times, places and people that I had been unfamiliar with.

Basics: Our main character, who I don't think is ever named except in his past lives, is a dissolute pornographer. He has been on both sides of the camera and currently owns a production company that makes pornographic movies. He has never known love in his life, just sex and seduction. He does a lot of drugs with people who call themselves friends in the way that sycophants will. One night, high, he hallucinates flaming arrows coming towards him out of a forest. In consequence he drives off of a cliff and is burned terribly while trapped in the car. He doesn't die although it is very touch and go and the life a severely burned victim is difficult and painful. While he is in the hospital, for months, a woman comes into his life. She is a psychiatric patient and tells him incredible stories that concern her lives in past centuries and about the intersections of their lives over these centuries. Is she schizophrenic? She is also a stone carver and works manically. Is she manic depressive? When our main character is released from the hospital she takes him into her home and takes care of him. The stories and carving continue. It is a brutal, beautiful and emotionally smashing love story.

At this time, the 1850's, slavery was flourishing in the United States and it was such an ugly practice. Abolitionist movements were also flourishing. This book is a fictional, but based at least in part on true stories, account of slavery and the viewpoints of people of the time. It is so well-written; interesting, heart-breaking and very amusing in some of the very accurate portrayals of personality types. Sometimes she would get overly zealous, in my opinion, in the philosophy of Christianity, but in the main I was in love with her writing style.What I am having trouble understanding is why the term ""Uncle Tom"" has become an insult that means a person who betrays his own people and African heritage. The Tom that I read about in this book was a saint as they would say in Christianity, or a Tzaddik as we would say in Judaism. Not to say he didn't struggle, but the man was good, honest, moral, upright, true to what he believed, and took every opportunity to help his fellow slaves despite the punishment he received for it. The man was deeply connected to his belief in God and in doing good for his fellow human beings and not fearing what a tyrant could do to his body but trusting in the ultimate goodness of God. Where, oh where, is the betrayal of the black people? I will have to google this for understanding because there is nothing in this book that I can relate to the current meaning of ""Uncle Tom"". Who were we in the 1850's? Slavery, slaughtering the Indian tribes. Who are we now? ""Liberty!--Electric word! What is it? Is there anything more in it than a name--a rhetorical flourish? Why, men and women of America, does your heart's blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers bled, and your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die?Is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not also glorious and dear for a man?

TA very disturbing and moving account of growing up black and extremely poor in the township (ghetto) of Alexandra near Johannesburg in South Africa. The brutality is of a magnitude that hardly seems survivable, and the point is that many black people don't survive it. The great majority of this brutality is committed black against black, but the whole system was set up and orchestrated by the former white founders and leaders and the then current government of apartheid South Africa. The apartheid system is set up for black humiliation and failure. The whites of South Africa are taught their racial superiority from birth. Everyone is stuck in the patterns. Just to be realistic though; blacks enslaved, sold and murdered their own people and outsiders long before apartheid was in place. This is not a characteristic singular to black people, I think every people on earth has done this at some point in their history and/or is currently doing it. This world is a brutal place with a veneer of civilization through which war and every kind of depravity, enslavement and murder keeps popping through like boils on skin. Johannes Mathabane, who changes his name to Mark when he starts playing tennis with white people, is a child of Alexandra, born in 1960 to illiterate parents who do not have the proper passes to be living in Alexandra. Many people who are supposed to be living on the Tribal Reserves leave the Reserves (desert land engulfed in an even worse poverty than the townships as there is no work on the Reserves and they are run by corrupt and greedy leaders) but come to the townships illegally in order to work. Tribal men can get passes to work in Alexandra and live in dorms of men leaving their families behind to see them a couple times of year, but families are not given the passes and so come illegally. This leads to as many problems as you can imagine it might. Mark happens to be extremely intelligent and hard-working. Instead of a becoming a ghetto gangster, an option he considers as he also considers suicide, he becomes a top student and takes up tennis. Nothing comes easy and in June of 1976, when the Department of Bantu Education decreed that all black schools had to teach courses in Afrikaans instead of English, the students of the township of Soweto marched through the streets protesting. Evidently this was a peaceful protest but the police responded with tear gas, rifles, shotguns with which they opened fire. Several small children were killed along with a thirteen year old student and probably other students, I don't know. At least one policeman was hacked to death. This was the start of violent student protests against Afrikaans and the apartheid system. Mark was heavily involved in these protests. At this point he swings wildly between wanting to be part of the white world and his hatred of whites. When he is talking to a group of whites at the tennis club at the urging of a liberal white, he is asked, quite reasonably I think, ""But why do you burn own schools and clinics, and kill your own people?"" Mark answers, ""First of all, it's the police who do most of the killing. Second of all, because the army has sealed off your areas, we can't get at you and kill you. At your property and burn it. We would dearly want to do that. So for the time being, till we devise ways of reaching you, symbols of oppression and collaborators with the system are convenient and necessary targets of our hatred and anger.""Hmmm. I am not really tracking with that logic. Destroy the little we have and our own people because we can't get at you. Seems counter-productive to me. And the police doing the killing are in the majority black men, although in their defense - if there is a defense possible - they are answering to a white ""baas"", if not in the immediate hierarchy, then farther up. And answering ""yes baas"" is necessary for survival under apartheid.Shortly after this, in answer to a question about ""what black peasants want"", he states, in part, ""We blacks are not in the least interested in making slaves out of you. We simply want a country where race and colour don't determine your place in the sun. We want a South Africa where everyone--black, Coloured, white and Indian--is equal before the law. We want to live in peace with everyone as a nation united. .... We can and must learn to live together. We need each other, not as master and servant, but as equals. There's room for everyone in this beloved country.""Hmmm. Well that sounds great but would that be before or after you kill the white population and destroy their property as you earlier stated the black people ""would dearly want to do""? In September 1977 the leader of the Black Consciousness Movement, a healthy 33 year old man, dies in police custody, the situation becomes even worse. Mark says,""I attended meetings where black youths sought ways to get hold of submachine guns and grenades with which to storm white kindergartens and schools and shopping malls in the name of liberation. I was angry; yet I lacked the courage to even face the thought of blowing up the kindergarten where Wilfred's (liberal white friend from the tennis world who helps Mark a lot) son attended. But I had to do something to fight back; I had to find ways of avenging the deaths of hundreds of innocent black children; I had to find ways of dealing with the anger and hate consuming me day by day.""Hmmmm. He lacked the ""courage"" to blow up a white kindergarten. Is that what it takes to blow up innocents? At one point he wants to join the ""Freedom Fighters"". Hello Terrorism! He becomes convinced to use his brain in the fight instead. He says,""It (a story he relates in the previous paragraph) reinforced my belief that among white South Africans there was that small minority that really believed in love, freedom and human dignity for all. So why should they be lumped into the same foul den as the racists, and made the object of hate and vengeance? Why couldn't the struggle in South Africa be not one of black against white, but one that pitted those who believed in freedom, justice and equality against those who didn't?""Hmmm. The problem is who is defining freedom, justice and equality? But I get his point and agree in theory. The laws of apartheid have been abolished but I think the situation over there is still bad. Evidently there is a lot of violence against women and children, organized crime, mob justice and police abuses. Doesn't sound much different than what Mr. Mathabane describes in his book.So, back to Mark, deciding to use his brain and sports skills led him to follow his dream to get the hell out of South Africa and come to America and to go to college and play tennis. I hope he was able to help his family from America. Not having read his further books I don't know how any of this plays out as Wiki just gave me basic facts. I know he marries a white woman and has three children and that he stays in America, becomes a college professor and is a successful author and lecturer. He established a foundation to provide books and other necessary items for poor black children in South Africa. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 17, 2015","Feb 23, 2015","Feb 17, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126151.Kaffir_Boy

I believe I have read a different, more childish and cleaner edition. This ""definitive I never expected to hate this beloved book, but hate it I did. I believe I have read a different, more childish and cleaner edition. This ""definitive edition"" was making me sick. #1 I was having a great deal of trouble believing this book was written by a young teenage girl. It very much reads as if it was written by an adult male. Perhaps she was brilliant and very well educated which explains her exceptional erudition and perception. Does it explain the coy sexuality, or if this book is in fact by Anne, is it perhaps explained by her father's sexual confidences given to his precocious thirteen year old daughter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------Some thoughts of mine I shared with friends who had also read the definitive edition:I'd bet her father was uncomfortable releasing it uncensored as the main weirdness is him. I am extremely uncomfortable with some of the stuff he tells her. And they put the new guy, 54 years old, in her room?! Where she uses her chamber pot a few feet away from him?! Why didn't they put him in with Peter (16 year old boy with his own room in attic)? Or the father for that matter as he wasn't having sex with his wife anyways (and why should Anne know that and about her father's past and his ""girl"" from before that he will never get over and his passions which he tells Anne she is too young to feel yet) and Margot was already sharing the room with them (her parents). This book reminds me of Flowers in the Attic. And I have a very hard time believing it was written by a 13 year old. I never thought for a moment I would doubt this book which is as loved and revered as the Bible. But I doubt it and find it very weird and inappropriate.I suppose, maybe, maybe....They were living in a terrible situation, but still, the family dynamics give me the willies. Mom is aligned with Margot, Dad with Anne. A father who would make sexual confidences to his 13 year old daughter is a very suspect father imo. And I can't reconcile parents who have no problem with their 13 year old using her chamber pot next to a sleeping (we hope) 54 year old man, that is just too weird. Would you be comfortable if your father wrote you a poem containing the words, ""I've got no more panties, my clothes are too tight, my shirt is a loincloth, I'm really a sight!"" And her conversations with her father, ""When we first went into hiding, Father often told me about things I'd rather have heard from Mother, and I learned the rest from books or things I picked up in conversations."" ""Once when father and I were talking about sex, he said I was too young to understand that kind of desire."" I believe Anne that her mother didn't like her much and I would bet the reason why is jealousy. Father pays a lot of attention to Anne, she sleeps in his bed when she is frightened, in her white nightgown ""(the one that causes Margot to exclaim every evening, ""Oh, that indecent nighty!"")""Something is wrong with the family dynamics, at the least. And I find it hard to believe this book was written by a 13 year old. Granted, I am not nearly as clever as the author of this book, but I remember my diary at 13. It went something like, Dear Diary, nothing happened today. And when I did write anything, probably not til I was 14 or 15, it was incredibly immature, nothing like the perception and coy and repressed sexuality of this book.Oh, I agree with you that the whole uncensored book is better than the sanitized version. I've been a bit wide eyed and shocked at what I've been reading rather than bored with the much more normal 13 year old Anne of the first version of this that I read..... I know this book has been verified as true but I am not convinced, and if true, well...I won't be recommending that (my daughter) reads (this version). I think there are many better books she can read. I almost feel like this makes a mockery of the horror of the Holocaust and what the Jews suffered.Otto Frank is certainly the person I would have suspected of being the author. But maybe it (the diary) is true and he is just the author of the author.-----------------------------------------------------------------------OK, that said, I've now finished the book and haven't changed my mind about the book's creepiness nor my doubts about who wrote this book. I mean when she is working on her conquest, mentally not physically according to the diary, of 17 year old Peter, snuggling with him and trying to figure out how to describe female genitals to him, telling him the parts and their appearance, and Peter is shocked, he had no idea that female genitals were located between a female's legs. What?! This just strikes me as so wrong and untrue as both a conversation between a 14 year old girl and a 17 year old boy and as something said girl would write in her diary. I do not believe this conversation took place. But there it is, written as the truth in this diary purportedly by Anne Frank. Now on to the subject and of Anne's relationship to her mother. I felt bad for her that she didn't go to cheder and learn the concept of what a mitzvah is and the specific mitzvoth including honoring one's mother and father. She goes on and on throughout the book about how much she hates her mother and how she doesn't need a mother anymore and how much better she is than her mother. Here is a quote from late in the book, April 1944, ""Young as I am, I face life with more courage and have a better and truer sense of justice than Mother......If God lets me live, I'll achieve more than Mother ever did...."" How incredibly sad is that?! Everyone needs their mother, how much rejection and betrayal would a person have to feel to hate like this? Something terribly wrong here.I've said about all I can about this book, except this: the basic facts are not in question: the war, the situation for Jews, the existence of these people, the hiding, the arrest and the deaths of the women, the girls and Peter. It was heartbreaking, they were so close to the end of the war. I may not have liked Anne or her father, but I mourn them nonetheless. And I've only read a book; I don't know the truth of any of them and can't judge them. I can only judge what the book says, and even that I should probably take a chill pill and relax. When I looked at sites that claim the diary is a fake, they were very anti-Jewish. I would rather be aligned with all the good-hearted people who think the diary is true than with people who claim it is a fraud and hate Jews. I've thought about this book almost continually since I finished this . I've decided to keep the original version as I would like my daughter to read that one. The Definitive Edition I am going to get rid of. I retain my feeling of falseness and wrongness with that edition. I have thought a lot about what it must have been like to be in hiding like that; the enormous stresses and the constant fear. I know of a couple of people from the Jewish community, parents and grand parents of people I know, who did survive the war by being hidden in attics and secret places in buildings. They did not come out unaffected. Emotionally I am on my knees in respect to those people who suffered; both those that died and those that survived. I am not judging that experience. ...more",Notes are private!,4,80,1,"Feb 15, 2015","Feb 17, 2015","Feb 15, 2015",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/831776.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl

The father is a newspaper man, his son Ward is a newspaper reporter, his second son Jack is a swimmer and drives a delivery truck for his father's newspaper. All of them are troubled and drink too much. The story revolves around a man accused of murdering a local Sheriff. The accused is in jail where a woman he doesn't know has been writing him love letters. She wants to save him and marry him. She convinces this team of reporters from Miami to look into his case. One of the reporters is Ward. So Ward and his partner Acheson, his brother Jack who acts as the driver, and the woman Charlotte who has the crush on the killer - these four people start re-investigating the case of the accused killer. Really Ward investigates; the rest of them don't do much. Sex, violence, drunkenness and a lot of weirdness, even madness. It is not a boring book; the atmosphere is oppressive and addictive, it is the atmosphere more than the story that creates the book.

One of the most memorable, and least embarrassing, took place in a campground north of San Francisco. Raccoons got in the cooler and stole meat. My young adult son yelled at them and stole it back. Then he was standing outside the tent saying evening prayers when he felt he was being watched. He twisted around to look and there were a half dozen malevolent raccoons in a tree looking murder at him. But he got in the tent safely, end of story.

No son should love his mother to the extent that this son does. The mother is not happy in her marriage and so sublimates her love in the love of her sons, particularly the son Paul. It is not a physically incestuous relationship, although more physically affectionate than I would be comfortable with. But it is emotionally incestuous and this son is crippled by it. You can't blame her all the way for her son's lack of moral compass and his tortured relationships with women, but he is fairly unable to truly love a woman besides his mother and he is unable to live without his mother. His reaction to her death strikes me as way over the top, just not normal. Paul was the third child born to an illiterate coal miner and his better educated and higher class wife. She was happy for about six months and then found he had lied about his financial security and that he was drinking. Things go downhill from there as he drinks and gets mean and feels her contempt. She is good at contempt and pours it on. She pours her love on to her oldest son and then on to the second son, Paul, as she feels he needs her. So begins their strange symbiotic relationship, very inter-dependent in an unhealthy way. When the oldest son dies, then only the nurturing of Paul keeps the mother in this world. What sort of a strange relationship is it when the son calls his mother ""my pigeon"" and ""my Little"" and ""my love"". The father is at best disregarded and often hated. The mother closes the family off to him, making a tight circle of herself and the children. I can't go on talking about this novel, it was disturbing, and even more so as it was largely autobiographical. The novel drops us off in an extremely low place in Paul's life but we know that D.H. Lawrence overcomes his melancholy to some degree (I think), stays with the married woman he ""eloped"" with, and writes texturally beautiful novels. The writing here is gorgeous, if a little long in the descriptions of flowers, fields and trees. I admired the writing while at the same time thinking shut up and stop agonizing and self-analyzing everything. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 30, 2015",Feb 2015,"Jan 30, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32071.Sons_and_Lovers

The drill instructor in basic screams in his ear ""faggot, addict, cum-sucker, bitchmaster, dickskinner, dickfuck, fuckforbrains, no pecker, and lilywhitebitch""; pornography is rampant, going to bars and ""screwing whores"" seems like a goal most of the Marines have, drinking is worse than in a frat house, the dead enemies are desecrated and stolen from, the leadership is not trusted nor trustworthy, the reasons for war are suspect, patriotism doesn't seem to be part of the equation, and the men who return are bitter and damaged. I am really not understanding if the Marine Corp was always this way and I just didn't understand that. I always had admiration for the Marines, but I have some serious reservations about the Corp (they call it ""the suck"") as described here. #3 Is that the U.S. modus operandi; to go in with overwhelming firepower and just blow things to pieces until the enemy gives in? Most of the death and injuries to U.S. soldiers in this first gulf war seem to be from ""friendly fire"". The Iraqis at that point seemed pretty ill-armed and ill prepared for war. How much damage in international relations did the U.S. do in waging a war at that point?Was that war about oil and money?#4 Was this author OK before he went to war? Before he ever leaves for Iraq he says, "" Filmic images of death and carnage are pornography for the military man...."" ""I wanted a thankless mission; I wanted poor odds and likely death; I wanted to give myself over to beliefs that were more complex than the base beliefs of the infantry grunt. The grunt dies for nothing, for fifteen thousand poorly placed rounds; the sniper dies for that one perfect shot."" In a way I understand that second sentiment, kind of like saying he wants his war to mean something. --he came from a military family; his sister was mentally ill, his father left the family. Actually he says something interesting about that too, ""It's not original to say that the combat unit works like a family--but the best combat unit works like a dysfunctional family, and the ways and means of dysfunction are also the ways and means of survival.""#5 The only thing the Iraqis seem to do in this war, besides die under U.S. superior firepower, is hurl SCUD missiles at Israel. I remember them doing that but I don't remember why they were doing that. Just age old hatred?So, I don't know about this book. I am missing too much information, I don't know what is true and what is not. I am left with an unfavorable impression of the Marine Corp, but maybe I am just not big-minded enough to let boys facing death act out. I mean besides being really crude, they are also undoubtedly very tough and brave. My favorite war book is Flags of Our Fathers, but that was written by the son of a soldier, not the soldier himself. Maybe the soldier himself would have written something different. But that book left me feeling that the Marine Corp were our American heroes. This book left me feeling that any Marine who wasn't twisted before he joined would certainly be afterwards, and I hope that that is not true. But maybe this book is written by a man who took the worst of the Marines and compressed it into a very bitter and ugly account of his time in the Marines. Or maybe this is the natural result of training men to be killers. I wonder what other Marines thought about this book.I feel like I should say, regardless of what here is true or not true, and how the Marines really are; I depend on the U.S. military for our safety as citizens and civilians. I hope they are conducting themselves honorably, but even if this is not always the case, I still want to say thank you to every member of the U.S. military, Anthony Swofford included. I am not without military ties myself; my father and uncle fought in WWII in the Navy, my father-in-law fought in Germany in WWII-he was a Richie Boy, my son is a Captain in the Army National Guard and has served at Guatanamo, my son-in-law served three years in the Israeli army, my close friend's son and his wife both served overseas; the son in Iraq and his wife in Afghanistan.

She was born privileged and after graduating from college and spending time in EuropWhile I rate the book a three, I rate Jane Addams herself a five. She was born privileged and after graduating from college and spending time in Europe she felt herself to be useless; all this book knowledge but not doing anything actually of use in the world. She always did want to live among and help the poor and this is what she eventually does. She buys a big house in one of the worst neighborhoods in Chicago and sets out to be of use. This book chronicles the first twenty years of the settlement house she founds, Hull-House.They start out with a kindergarten and tackle problems from there.She explains ""It is natural to feed the hungry and care for the sick, it is certainly natural to give pleasure to the young, comfort to the aged, and to minister to the deep-seated craving for social intercourse that all men feel.""In this way Jane Addams and her staff at the settlement house set out to see that a social infrastructure is put into place to accomplish these things. Sometimes she is taken for a radical because she is calling for reformation in labor law, business practice, education, and enforcement of existing laws. She is viewed with distrust by some businessmen and men in political power.She says this, ""There is a certain common-sense foundation for this distrust, for too often the reformer is the rebel who defies things as they are, because of the restraints which they impose upon his individual desires rather than because of the general defects of the system. When such a rebel poses for a reformer, his short-comings are heralded to the world, and his downfall is cherished as an awful warning to those who refuse to worship ""the god of things as they are"". ... ""In discussion of these themes, Hull-House was of course quite as much under the suspicion of one side as the other. I remember one night when I addressed a club of secularists,... a rough-looking man called out, ""You are all right now, but mark my words, when you are subsidized by the millionaires, you will be afraid to talk like this."" The defense of free speech was s sensitive point with me, and I quickly replied that while I did not intend to be subsidized by millionaires, neither did I propose to be bullied by workingmen, and that I should state my honest opinion without consulting either of them. To my surprise, the audience of radicals broke into applause, and the discussion turned upon the need of resisting tyranny wherever found, if democratic institutions were to endure.""The most amusing part of the book in my opinion was her visit to Tolstoy at his farm in Russia. He was gruff and unfriendly, commented on the extravagance of her dress, called her an absentee landlord, ate black bread and gruel for dinner while his guests ate European food. He asks her ""Do you think you will help the people more by adding yourself to the crowded city than you would be tilling your own soil?"" Jane is somewhat distraught and determines to spend two hours every morning at Hull House baking bread into order to do 'bread labor'. It is only when she returns to Hull-House and sees all that needs her attention does she come out of her Tolstoy induced bread-labor fixation and get on with all the social reforms and cultural programs etc. that Hull-House is involved in. The existence of Hull-House and its good works are her job, the baker at Hull-House bakes the bread, and all is as it should be.Jane Addams deserves more study and acknowledgement than she receives. I don't recall learning about Settlement Houses nor about Jane Addams in school. So many social changes were brought about because of her tireless efforts. The last quarter of this book is hard to read as it reads more like a dry list of accomplishments rather than a living story which is why I rated the book a three....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 22, 2015","Jan 25, 2015","Jan 22, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/132936.Twenty_Years_at_Hull_House

It felt fine to be in this book. Jing-nan runs a food stand in the Taipei night market, a stand that his grandfather started and has been passed down through his father to him. One day he sees in the news that a binlang girl (betel-nut beauty) has been killed and it is his girlfriend that he had been planning to marry. He had not seen or talked to her in seven years but they had an agreement. He is shocked as he thought she was in the U.S. Being a binlang girl is I guess the equivalent of being one of those mostly naked baristas at a drive through coffee house, except that betel-nut is less acceptable than coffee and these betel-nut beauties are often offered as prostitutes as well. Jing-nan's betrothed had always been top of her class, tons of potential. So why had she been working such a low class job and who killed her? Jing-nan sets to find out. He gets threatened, beat up, lied to, his bike is tampered with so to cause an accident, his house is set afire. Someone does not want him to find out. As well, it is Ghost month and most people are being very careful not to anger ghosts and to burn effigies of money and possessions to their ancestors. Jing-nan doesn't believe in any of that stuff. But his dead girlfriend comes to him in his dreams. And there is a new girl in his life. Can he/should he fall in love again? What does he owe to his old girlfriend? So, this book goes. I really liked the characters, the setting and the normality of the life that goes on around the central drama. I particularly like the night market and Jing-nan's employees and friends; Frankie and Dwayne. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 19, 2015","Jan 20, 2015","Jan 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18761187-ghost-month

Most are a mixture of both and hopefully more positive than destructive. This is a ""normal"" family in a lot of ways. Mom has a lot of chutzpah, drinks a lot and is manic depressive. She loves her kids and does her best. Father works three jobs and sits stoic through his wife's angry times. Brother Jim is tough on anyone who picks on his siblings. He is in charge of their adventures. And he is the creator of Botch Town, a re-creation of their own town and populace made in clay and cardboard. Mary is the spooky little sister who has some numbers thing going on, OCD I guess, but she is able to make some pretty accurate predictions. She is often sitting in the bushes smoking home rolled cigarettes. The grandparents live in an adjoining apartment. Pop has his racing forms, his numbers and his predictions. Nan has her health regiment and her gun. Neither grandparent is to be trifled with in regards to the family. So normal, and not. Like most families. Our main character is the middle child, a little cowardly but willing to follow his brother into all sorts of adventures. He seems the most normal of the three but perhaps not. You will have to read it and make up your own mind.

I did, many years ago when I was a child and I didn't understand it. I never tried again although I would like to some time. This story is based on the father in Little Women. The ""little women"" were the four daughters of Marmee and Mr. March. Mr. March is away at war during the story of Little Women. So tell us about Mr. March please.That is what this book is about, Mr. March as an 18 year old itinerant peddler where he meets a black house slave named Grace. He loves teaching and so starts teaching a young black slave how to read, at Grace's behest. Trouble follows and Mr. March leaves in some disgrace and Grace is punished.Some years later, after he has amassed quite a bit of money, he meets Marmee and marries her. He is an abolitionist as is Marmee and they shelter runaway slaves as part of the underground railway. Then through a series of mistakes he loses his fortune and Marmee is left to try to make a good life for them all. She is productive and loving. Mr. March is a critical husband at times and I think he is getting bored with his good wife and his good little girls. He makes no effort to re-establish their financial security but instead, at age 40 or thereabouts, decides to join the war effort. No asking his wife, he just decides and off he goes, the idiot. It is brutal and bloody and he feels guilty at each life he fails to save, the ones he possibly could have and those he couldn't. He is a chaplain and not a popular one. And then, who should he run into? Grace. There is re-kindling of the former attraction and Mr. March is writing all these cheery, hopeful and lie filled letters back home.Someone sees him with Grace and he gets transferred to work on a plantation in the south as a teacher of black slaves who are now supposed to be working because they want to and to get paid for the work. Much goes wrong and he nearly dies. Who should end up nursing him? Grace. In the meantime Marmee and the girls are working as hard they can to supply things for the war; clothes and blankets and such. Mr. March continues to be a complete idiot and a coward in my opinion. Not easy from a hospital bed but he accomplishes it. He is lucky he only loses one of the 6 women who love him. I left this book with a very low opinion of Mr. March and I am sure if I ever read Little Women I will be sneering as I think about what Mr. March is doing during the time he is away from home during the war. Grace, Marmee and the girls are all good women, he didn't deserve them.Whew, got a little upset didn't I? ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 14, 2015","Jan 17, 2015","Jan 14, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13529.March

He is pretty good at laughing at  himself and not running other people (or their religions or social or government  systems) down. He takes us into Ethiopia, Kenya, Columbia, Peru, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, El Salvador, Sumatra and Papa New Guinea.  His business is coffee, his company is Dean's Beans and his motive is helping people. Put it all together and he calls it Javatrekking.  My coffee, Tony's Espresso Noir, is fair-trade but it doesn't say on the bag where the beans were grown.  One note: needs better editing. On the death-train and amputee section Dean writes about a coffee farmer from Honduras and says, ""Things got quiet as Wilmer looked down at two stumps cut off above where his knees were.""

The author of this book was prescribed valium for a back injury and kept taking it for anxiety. She was a high powered and successful woman but she made some bad choices with men and she was, unbeknownst to herself as the doctor always said the drug was safe, addicted to valium. She decides one day to get off this drug and quits cold turkey, becomes psychotic which causes her boyfriend to descend into a madness of his own. It gets ugly, and results in hospitalization eventually. Her doctor had told her to quit cold turkey like that.

They got married because Rosa was pregnant but have been happy, or so Rosa thought. Wesley feels he was trapped into marriage although he ""loves"" Rosa.

Rosa is in pain; Wesley thought he ""was dead"" and had to get away. Now he is living in a different state with a young woman in her early 20's and enjoying a sex life he never thought he would see again.Wesley says he thinks he should never have gotten married. I agree with him as he is a moral wasteland with delusions of sexual grandeur. For example if he gave a few women an hour or so of pleasure that they needed then that wasn't cheating, he was just helping someone out. Running out on his marriage and living with another woman, that is adultery, but he is oh so happy until she asks for a bigger commitment. She should have asked after the sex that morning rather than before. His wounded male ego couldn't handle being told no.Rosa, the wife. Why is it that so often her thoughts and conversations contain allusions to incest?

Her decisions and thought processes in regards to her relationship with Keir (I love that name) and James made me angry and dislike Marianne. OK, I know she is blind and that her past experience with love has made her fearful. I get it, but I don't feel any empathy with it. Each time she acted cold and hateful, that is what I felt, very cold and hateful toward her. So I spent a lot of the book angry with Marianne. Every other character was like magic, so wonderful, especially Keir. He was a character to fall in love with, and as a reader I did. I also was amazed by Louisa's patience, Garth was a total sweetie. When Marianne let herself love she was, herself is what I guess I want to say. When she let herself love. But you will see how cold-heartedly logical she tries to be. That was when I hated her, she had no heart then, well she did but she was hiding it, making it shut up because she thought if she loved she would lose, again.  Written in a less than realistic fashion, more magical, but that suited me very well. I wanted the magic, I wanted the love. It is a bit of a manipulative book, written to tweak emotions; I knew it and accepted that, I was willing to be emotionally tweaked, although I didn't enjoy disliking the main character so much.

Someone wrote in their  that the book seems to be about Cesar's penis. Yes, yes, I have to agree. The ""pinga"" that wouldn't quit. It was his source of happiness and unhappiness from the earliest adolescence through his old age (and he doesn't even get that old as he abuses his body with his excesses).

They come to the United States as young men and find some success, even making a guest appearance on the I Love Lucy Show playing in Ricky Ricardo's band at the Tropicana. Neither is a happy man however; Nestor pines for an old girlfriend, who left him in Cuba and married her old boyfriend, even though he marries a loving and patient woman in the U.S. and fathers two children with her. The man is melancholy for all his days. Cesar is a macho man; he is very excessive in sex, food, drink and tobacco. Both the brothers are dynamic musicians, but both are killing themselves with their inability to find happiness with what they have. Cesar was married but couldn't leave other women alone or appreciate his wife. It is Cesar we follow through his youth and the process of aging, and it is very sad sometimes. In many ways it is just life and we can all relate.

She grew up in Oregon, her father worked in lumber camps, one of 5 children. Their mother was mentally unstable, the father was often absent. Opal was small, dark, charming, intelligent, had an astounding memory, and was mentally unstable herself. She was a young Christian volunteer and showed a great skill in getting people to participate in the organization she was involved in. But really it was all about Opal, making people like Opal and believe her, whatever she said. She brought these people skills to Los Angeles, Boston, Wash D.C., and India. She had an amazing ability to work her way to the top social strata of any city she was in, and quickly. But she was already cracking and as each group of friends tired of her and wanted her to go away she cracked more. When she got into her thirties she lost her looks and finally her mind really was gone. It was very sad to see her without family or anyone to truly love her. She was loved more in the abstract, and as a youthful memory, than as a real person in this world. What made her famous was her book, ostensibly her diary written as a small child. The book is on many school reading lists and there are people who absolutely believe the book is her diary from when she was seven years old. They also believe she was actually from French royalty and was given to the Whiteley family to raise. Opal believed it. She also believed that she was married to the Prince of Wales as a child bride. She was committed to a mental institution at age 50 and lived there until her death. It is an interesting book to read if you like history and biographies.

And these vignettes of American history are not very shocking. The subtitle of the book is: 115 surprising and amusing tales. That is a more accurate portrayal of what is in this book. If you have a short attention span for history and only want to hear some interesting bits then this book fills that need pretty well.I think the most surprising thing I learned was that ""the Stars and Bars are still flying in Brazil today as the result of an emigration of thousands of Southern expatriates who journeyed there shortly after their loss in the War of the Rebellion."" They became known as the Confederados and ""Today thousands of descendants of the Confederados can be found throughout Brazil, and once a year, they gather to render homage to their Rebel roots."" Well, I had no idea!My favorite story is about Joshua Abraham Norton of San Francisco. After he lost all his wealth in 1859 he went somewhat batty and declared himself ""Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico"". He put on an old military uniform and went to a newspaper to announce his self-coronation. The editor printed it and for the next 21 years, until his death, ""Citizens who passed him addressed him as ""Your Majesty"". Policemen saluted him smartly. He ed the state militia, and a special chair was always reserved for him in the state legislature."" etc (don't want to give it all away!)The most shocking thing, to me, was that Amelia Earhart's letter to her groom as they waited for the justice of the peace. It said, in part, ""In our life together, I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me, nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly."" I also found the book somewhat depressing because as we skate through history from the founding of the country to present day everyone keeps dying. Of course.

He has no money but gets in on a full scholarship and off he goes. He wants to study Greek again but the Classics professor is a weird bird, only has five students and doesn't want more. His five students are a very strange collection of eccentric and bizarre young people. He encourages them in their cliquish weirdness and isolation.

Certainly she doesn't have his sense of humor. This is more woman with dogs observes and records. She particularly wants to see how they interact on their own with other dogs, how they organize themselves in rank and act as a pack compared to how wolves organize themselves in the wild. This is OK except that she is living in Cambridge while she lets her husky Misha voyage on his own or with his ""wife"" Maria, and she tags along sometimes to observe.

I was like what is so honest and decent about that? As I said, treacly sh*t. Evie has a personality, which when she isn't repressing it in order to seem educated and upper class, is suprisingly enjoyable. The scenes that included Ludo were very funny and sparky reading. But the rest of it; you had all the requisite characters including her gay friend Malcolm, the requisite situations including a person who is conveniently dying, the requisite blather of emotions and revelations. 519 pages of it.Funny stuff: Ludo and Evie, Camilla and Heccy, and pig Leonard at the wedding. Although, be prepared, much of the humor is base, vulgar, tasteless.

I can't even point to any one thing that I can say made me sad, but I cried until my eyelids were all swollen and I developed a migraine. I used Kleenex after Kleenex.

The writing is pretty near perfect, the descriptions are so powerful that the book becomes an agony to read. He switches back and forth between voices of the North and South, using most often the voices of Lieutenant General James Longstreet in the South, and Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in the North. Reading this was like watching my brothers fight each other to death, which is exactly what it was. We were only enemies in the military sense as we were all American; often family members fighting in opposite armies. The fighting was so brave, on both sides, but one is particularly struck by that characteristic in the Southern boys, at least in this battle, with the southern boys running uphill with no cover straight into the guns and cannons of the North. I didn't want the South to win as I want us to be one country, but I didn't want the South to lose either. All those deaths of the men and boys, on both sides, was brutally painful. These armies loved and respected each other, even as they worked as hard as they could to destroy each other. It is a curious thing to me that we have Civil War Re-enactments. So many young lives were lost. Further thought, I think it is done to honor all those fallen in battle, and I can see how the re-enactments do that.I also find the idea of the war being about freeing the slaves a suspect idea. Although some people must have felt a genuine compassion for and empathy with the slaves I doubt that between the political leaders that compassion was the motivating factor. Economics and power are the usual motivating factors. At the same time that the North was fighting to end slavery, our army was also killing the Indians massacre fashion. For those motivated by ideals in freeing the slaves I can only think that it had to do with the American penchant for loving and saving the underdog. The slaves, being captives, were certainly underdogs. The Indians, being free and potentially dangerous and often in fact dangerous to the white people stealing their land, were not underdogs and did not get our sympathy and empathy until we defeated them and made them underdogs.

I actually really liked the composting idea from the Swedish woman.Her mention of the Powder River Expedition of 1876 and the Army Captain who had been decorated for gallantry in confronting tribes of hostile Sioux, had me shaking with anger. Having just read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee I was in no mood for jokes regarding this. She says ""Captain La Garde"" (who was actually part of the medical corp and later is ordered to shoot cadavers to compare different weapons effects on human bodies)""led the charge against Chief Dull Knife, whose name, we can only assume, was no reflection on his intellectual and military acumen or the quality and upkeep of his armaments."" Maybe I would have found this funny if I didn't know that the soldiers snuck up on Dull Knife's (he was Cheyenne) sleeping village at night and began attacking as soon as it was dawn. Many people ran out into the freezing air barely dressed, the warriors trying to hold off the soldiers long enough for the children and women to get away. They didn't have enough ammunition and had to run. The army burned all their lodges and belongings and shot all their ponies. Twelve infants and several old people froze that first night. They walked three days, mostly with bare feet, to reach Crazy Horse's camp (Sioux), and the army continued to chase them. I thought about this through the rest of my reading of this book. She talks a lot about dignity in death and how people feel about dead bodies. Some pretty awful things are done to cadavers but nothing in this book offended me the way her mention of Powder River did.I thought I might be bothered by this book because my son is buried. But for nearly 10 years I have thought about his body under the ground and what is happening to it. The first year I used to bring him food and toys and money. Eventually I knew that he didn't need these things and would pray or just visit instead. What gave me comfort was that he was not embalmed nor autopsied. His body was complete. He was buried as Jewish law dictates and that gave me the feeling I had done everything I could for him in his death. The rituals people have around death are very important to give comfort to the living and to make them feel they have done right by their loved ones....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 22, 2014","Oct 25, 2014","Oct 22, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32145.Stiff

The Europeans who came and methodically stole the land and murdered or imprisoned the Native Americans committed a planned, ceaseless and merciless genocide. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee takes us on a tour of the tribes, the actions of the Indians, the actions of the U.S. Army, the politicians, the preachers, miners, ranchers and other settlers. Manifest Destiny my friends, we were meant to have the land, and if that meant exterminating the tribes who did not want to be imprisoned on the worst land in the country (such as malarial swamps) and living on starvation handouts of food and blankets, well Indians that is just too bad for you. Boom! The land of the free and the home of the brave might as well be called the land of the thieves and the home of the murderers. We stole the whole country; we lied, we made treaties and broke them as soon as we wanted more land or discovered a reason we needed the land (need to put a railroad through or gold was discovered or it was getting crowded on the east coast), we threatened, cajoled, pretended to be friends of and if all else failed massacred and imprisoned the defeated remnants of the Indian tribes. We never treated a people worse. While we were fighting to free the slaves (it made economic sense for the Union and not for the southerners so don't get all sentimental about motivations) we were murdering the Indians. Incredible how many soldiers and weapons were leveled against the Indians. If we had had ""weapons of mass destruction"" we probably would have used them. We used the best firepower we had at the time to kill straggling, starving bands of Indians who had survived through the massacres of people and animals up to that point. The Indians had no recourse as they were ""not persons within the meaning of the law"".General Sanborn to the Secretary of the Interior: ""For a mighty nation like us to be carrying on a war with a few straggling nomads, under such circumstances, is a spectacle most humiliating, an injustice unparalleled, a national crime most revolting, that must, sooner or later, bring down upon us or our posterity the judgment of Heaven.""Said by Ouray the Arrow, Chief of the Utes: ""The agreement an Indian makes to a United States treaty is like the agreement a buffalo makes with his hunters when pierced with arrows. All he can do is lie down and give in.""Saddest book I have ever read. At what cost do I live as a free citizen in this beautiful country?

How do I tell you about it without giving it away. It is set in Russia of the 1990's. Our main character is an historian attending a conference on Russian history and he delivers a lecture on ""Confronting the Past"" and speaks about Stalin. He doesn't mince words, no trying to make Stalin sound like maybe a reasonable fellow. Our historian's name is Dr. Kelso and he is weary, somewhat burned out, disappointed, three times divorced, and drinks too much. What has happened to all his potential? Where is the big discovery? Despite those things he is incredibly tenacious. The night after his lecture he is visited by an old-timer, a guy who was a driver for a party boss, and was present when Stalin was found dying from a stroke and afterwards when his boss steals a notebook that belonged to Stalin. As a result of not giving away the secrets he is sentenced to 15 years hard labor in a camp in the north. I guess secrets don't die in Russia nor does the long influence of Stalin. So that is about how much I can say about the story. But know this, it is fascinating, exciting, convoluted, intense - all the way through the last word.

This book just got better and better, and very unexpected. The bad guy is crazy good at being a bad guy. One of his two fellow hostage takers is an unrepentant and rapacious rapist. The hostages are 2 teachers and 8 students, all females and most of them young children, from a school for the deaf. Most of the hostages cannot hear at all, the hostage takers cannot read sign language or lips. They are being held in an abandoned slaughterhouse, gruesome and well-described. The whole situation is intense but the HTs (hostage takers) are pretty relaxed and absolutely brutal. They don't hesitate to kill. Arthur Potter is the FBI negotiator in charge of talking to the hostage takers and getting them to surrender peacefully, and without casualties among the hostages. There are all sorts of jurisdictional and personality problems to complicate things. This is one of those books that doesn't end until it ends.

Now she has died and the man is alone and bereaved. A friend suggests he take a temporary job in D.C. and rent a room from a friend of the friend. The man he will rent from is also a middle aged gay man. So this plan goes forward and nothing else happens except discussions of grief, loneliness, responsibility to the living and the dead. Our main character is in a Washington D.C. that seems empty and he walks around a great deal, going to museums. He lives in a world of near silence. It seems like he is reaching for a closer relationship with the man he is renting from but nothing develops. Middle aged men don't seem to be attracted to each other, they want younger men. The renter snoops in his landlord's private rooms and makes friends with the landlord's dog, letting it out when the landlord is not around.Eventually our main character goes back home, the end.What I did like about this book is the concurrent reading, by the main character, of ""Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters by Justin and Linda Levitt Turner. That was fascinating and I would like to read that book. There were also some good insights into grief such as, ""...grief is what you have after someone you love dies. It's the only thing left of that person. Your love for, your missing, them. As long as you have that, you're not alone - you have them.""That is very true; how I resented anyone who tried to help me ""get over"" my grief. I felt like they were trying to take my son away from me again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 16, 2014","Sep 16, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/251520.Grief

I guess Harvard helped in his writing skill, although he seems a natural at that too. His sardonic humor, his emotions on and about the job whether boredom, camaraderie, adrenaline rush, and his sense of history all make him a great storyteller. He is very funny and often likeable and admirable. I've never liked cops too much, probably regarding them much as cops regard the Internal Affairs Bureau; necessary but to be avoided if at all possible, and full of inconsistencies and injustices.

Curious to know what she has found, she signs up for a hiking and archeological program in Colorado near the cliff dwellings of the Anasazi which they will be exploring with trained guides.But there are problems galore at Medicine Wheel, the site of both serious archeological digs and the educational hiking tours for tourists. Is the Director losing her mind? She is giving out contradictory orders causing chaos. The Board of Trustees is concerned that Medicine Wheel is losing money. A lot of the Indians are against the archeology, a lot of the archeologists are against the tourists, and everyone seems to be against the director. Among the tourists who are the focus of the story we have a beautiful blonde young wanna-be Indian. We have two friends who are in their second teenage-hood, a bereaved mother, and a real bitch who mocks everything Indian, archeological and tourist. One of these tourists dies in a rather gruesome way, then one of the staff die and three busloads of teenagers disappear. Our amateur sleuth, Eugenia Potter has to figure out what is going on.

It was very readable and engaging with characters that I found myself caring for and enjoying. Dora is trained as a midwife by an older midwife in a hillside village in Nova Scotia. All is going well (or as well as normal life usually goes) until a new modern birthing facility is built down the mountain and the doctor tries to convince all the ladies to birth at his facility. Part of his technique to getting the women to birth there is his critical assessment of midwifery and home birth. He is also a very poor OB and perhaps a bit of a pervert as well. Dora gets married to a man who is not right for her, she wants a baby of her own but that is not happening, her husband wants her to give up midwifery and healing and she agrees at first but he is gone much of the time and the women need her. Dr. Thomas (the OB) keeps after her trying to say she is dangerous when it is quite obvious that he is the dangerous one. We get to know the women of the community through their interactions with Dora. And eventually there is a baby for Dora and a man who is right for her. Most of the story takes place in the second decade of the 1900's. We see the boys go off to fight in WWI, the explosion in Halifax took place in these years as well as the molasses flood in Boston.I didn't care for the ending, it stretches into the future in a tenuous manner that doesn't add to the story, and some of Dora's personal choices were not the choices I could relate to very well.It is a pro-midwifery, pro-choice, feministic book.

They hire a friend who is an architect and a group of builders who are craftsmen. The male buyer is a lawyer as is his father-in-law. The architect is just starting his own business and this is the first house he has designed. The builders need to come up with a price based on the architect's designs, which are not complete. When they do come up with a price the buyer talks them down a ridiculous $660.00, just to make the amount they are going to spend a round number. The book is subtly sympathetic to the builders and antagonistic to the buyers and architect. It always seems that the buyers want quality that they are not willing to pay for, the architect wants his dreams of the house fulfilled regardless of who pays for it. The builders are unable to make the house less than their own personal standards call for. The house ends up costing more than the estimate and for the most part the builders have to absorb those costs and make what seems like a paltry sum to me for months of hard dedicated work. But this book was written with this slant, as I said it is subtle but it makes you feel like the penny pinching owners are that way because they are Jews and lawyers. Not that the author leaves the builders in peace; he tells us about the infidelity of one of the builders and how this created a big problem in the close knit community. I didn't want to know.

The skeletons of the Princes in the Tower were found at an earlier time right where they were suspected to be, buried under the rubble 10 ft. down under a staircase in the Tower of London. I think that this is remarkable, that so much history can be put together accurately enough that science later bears it out. Richard had scoliosis, which is what I suspected from the ""one shoulder higher than the other"" description. He wasn't a hunchback or ugly. What is ugly is the constant treachery that went on as royals competed for the crown. Like a game of football where everyone has a sharp knife, wears a disguise and the crown is the football. Losers are beheaded. Their fans are stripped of worldly goods and jobs, their family is ostracized and perhaps imprisoned without trial for life. Oh so ugly! England seems so tame now by comparison; no one is getting burned at the stake or beheaded anymore. As far as I know the royals are fairly well behaved now, but what a tradition they come from! It would be like if William came to the throne, Harry killed him and had his little guy put in the Tower of London, took all of Kate's wealth and sent her to a monastery. Who wears the crown now, heh, heh, heh! What I did like is that the royals at that time fought their own battles. Richard III died on the battlefield but he was the last one, I guess as civilization advanced the rulers of lands starting considering their own persons too valuable to risk being in a battle. Can't we put Obama on a battlefield somewhere? Or perhaps a cage fight with his favorite enemy?This book is fascinating and well written. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 14, 2014","Aug 19, 2014","Aug 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/111221.The_Princes_in_the_Tower

I thought I was going to be reading a book about Guatemala, like When I Was Elena by Ellen Urbani Hiltebrand who was a Peace Corp Volunteer in Guatemala; or about being a midwife in a poor country like Monique and the Mango Rains: Two Years With A Midwife In Mali by Kris Holloway, another Peace Corp Volunteer.The Hummingbird House is not, in the main, about Guatemala. Guatemala is the setting of the main part of the story, although it starts in Nicaragua. This story is actually about a woman named Kate and her love life. First there was Paul and then there was Deaver and last there was Dix. You don't get much of Guatemala; some people get ""disappeared"" (kidnapped and murdered), some people get beaten and tortured, it is a scary place to be even if you try to keep your head down. Some people try to be activists, they are in danger obviously. And there are so many orphans, many sniffing glue to ease hunger pangs. But this is all you get of Guatemala, the rest is Kate and her relationships. The one nice thing in this book is that Kate takes in an orphan girl and raises her. You also don't get much midwifery. Kate delivers one baby during the story and the mother dies. There is no explanation for the death.I wanted to know more about Guatemala; who was fighting whom and for what reasons, the history behind the devolution into purposeless violence. I guess what I wanted was non-fiction, a serious look at Guatemala. I didn't care about Kate and her sex life, or even her redemption at the end. And I certainly didn't care for the twist the author throws in near the end of the story. When all is said and done and years have passed Kate no longer feels sexual desire and she is content. This is what I mean by this book is about Kate and sex. She has her first love Paul whom she evidently dumps for Deaver and a life as a midwife and political activist in Nicaragua with Paul's sister Maggie. Deaver is her addiction to a sex life that is ultimately loveless and perverted. Dix is her platonic love and they have plans to marry when his resignation from the priesthood is complete. Kate and sex, Guatemala is just the background. Also, in regard to the writing, the beginning is very confusing as she does not introduce characters, she just kind of dumps you into the story and you flounder around until you can get a handle on who is who. She also uses a lot of Spanish, some of which she follows with the English meaning and some of which she doesn't. At first I tried to keep looking up what the Spanish meant but quickly decided that the book was not worth the effort. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 22, 2014","Jul 26, 2014","Jul 22, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/671593.Hummingbird_House

I cried a lot at the ending chapters but I was not left with a sense of futility. Most of the book is set in the early 1970's, a time when this country was near the end of its transition from national pride and hope to national shame and pessimism. The Eskimo population, in the fictional town of Itiak, in the Alaskan Arctic, isolated as it was, was also dealing with transitions to the modern world. It was not an easy transition as what is left for the Indigenous peoples? Scraps of land? Tatters of their past? Then there is alcohol to fuel the hopelessness and help death come earlier.

This book is 811 pages of fictional misery, I must have said ""I hate this book"" dozens of times in the week it took me to read it. It felt like it took 2 weeks to read, I was surprised to see that it was only 8 days that I had been suffering, hating to read each page, having to put it down every few pages.This book is about child sexual abuse, the murder of a child, a terrible miscarriage of justice, a twisted sense of loyalty to the the job, cold war politics and deceits, with a little bit of The Bad Seed thrown in. I was very angry at the child molesting character, I wanted to kill him, but since he was fictional I wanted to kill the book. Haha, a little irrational, but there you go. This book received an excellent rating from most people. It must be the writing that they like, it is very multi-layered and detailed, it connects the reader to the time and place palpably. It is a substantial book in its scope, length and just getting down to all the realistic and often dreadful details. The author absolutely understands human emotion and portrays the emotions and thoughts of each character in a way that seemed true. Beautifully done and it made the book that much worse.The one thing I did enjoy was the French and all things Acadian.What is strange is that I might have read this book before. I recognized the description of the air base, then I recognized the ""backbend exercises"". So I either went amnesiac on the rest of the book the first time I read it, or I threw up at the backbend exercises and never finished reading it. Well now I have finished it, I read every miserable page. This story was based on the Steven Trescott case. I didn't realize that while reading the book, but it probably would not have improved it for me as the child molestation part of the story was not part of the Trescott case (that I know of from the brief reading I did on the case). The rape and murder (although the girl in RL was 14 not 9) and the miscarriage of justice (probable in RL) were the elements of the Trescott case. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 05, 2014","Jul 13, 2014","Jul 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7199.The_Way_the_Crow_Flies

He returns after a number of months as he is worried about his mother. The Agha punishes them both and they nearly starve that winter. None of the villagers in the villages that this Agha control have any liking for him but pretend to out of fear. Lots of ""I kiss your hands, I kiss your feet"" to his face and name calling (infidel is the bad name they all like to use when they want to insult someone) and death wishes behind his back.

It is set in Turkey and gives some interesting, if basic, history that made me want to learn more. Despite the fact that I couldn't really relate to the culture, I liked the story of Memed and his love for a village girl named Hatche. What goes on here is that there is already hatred in Memed's heart for the Agha, and the Agha has a hatred for Memed as well. When the Agha's nephew decides he wants to marry Hatche the marriage is set as far as the Agha and the nephew are concerned. So Memed and Hatche make plans to run away. They do, but they are tracked and caught. In the ensuring firefight the nephew is killed and the Agha is wounded, Hatche is captured and Memed runs to the mountains to become a brigand with the intention of eventually getting his revenge on the Agha and rescuing Hatche. In the meantime the Agha has coerced all the men who were with him during the firefight to say that Hatche was the one who shot and killed his nephew. Hatche is brought to prison. And the story goes from there.From what I understand, the book is meant to point out the oppressions that the peasant class in Turkey was suffering, and the way the culture and politics were working to both fight or further that oppression. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 30, 2014","Jul 06, 2014","Jun 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175545.Memed_My_Hawk

I love reading about the early steamboat days on the Mississippi. What an amazing and challenging job it must have been to pilot one of these boats before all the ""improvements"" to the river such as making cuts to make it shorter and electric lights to see where one is going. Well I suppose they were improvements in the sense of bringing the river and boating into the modern age and making it a whole lot safer. But I loved the old days on the river when the pilot had to have the river memorized in his head. Well Mark Twain makes it sounds really cool. Except for that boilers exploding part of steamboating. Not such an uncommon event evidently. Mark Twain's brother Henry died from injuries suffered in a steamboat boiler explosion. That explosion and his brother's death is written about in this book. Actually quite a lot is covered in this book, not just steamboating; there is a lot social and political commentary, and as usual for Mark Twain, much of it is funny.  I learned that mark twain means 2 fathoms which is 12 feet, deep enough to be safe for the steamboat. Read the weirdest supposedly Indian story called ""The Undying Head"" in appendix. Read that Mark Twain holds Sir Walter Scott responsible for bad writing, bad architecture and at one point, perhaps the Civil War. Is he joking? Yes and no, I think. I just think this man had a fascinating mind and I love reading him. The only places this book dragged was in all the descriptions of the cities on the Mississippi 20 years after the time Mark Twain was a riverboat pilot and he travels down the river as a writer and tells us about it. There are exceptions to this boringness such as when he goes to his old home town and asks about all the kids he knew at that time. It is interesting and entertaining when he is giving us history or making jokes, but when he starts giving population and industry statistics, I found that boring.

I was surprised to open this and find it was fiction. And very strange fiction.This is a story of a brilliant but mentally ill man. He has a genius for mechanics and invention, but he is sure that the United States has become a destroyed society destined for war. He states a lot of current political truths and feelings but magnified into a paranoia that results in him taking his family (wife, 12 year old Charlie, younger brother Jerry - 8 or 10 years old?, and 5 year old twin girls) to Honduras to live, to escape the catastrophe that he believes the U.S. is headed for. He has them walk away from their home bringing nothing except camping equipment and gear that he has purchased for this trip. They get on a cargo ship that contains a missionary family and a Honduran family and off they go.  It is rather amazing to see what this man is capable of organizing and building, he builds this compound in the Honduran jungle that he calls Jeronimo and it is comfortable and self-sustaining for the most part. He is manic and brilliant, but he has this obsession with ice, making ice. He has invented a huge ice maker that is fueled by fire and it really works but contains the dangerous elements of hydrogen and enriched ammonia. When a situation develops that threatens the family, disaster ensues and Jeronimo is destroyed. The remaining sanity of ""Father"" is also destroyed. He and his family stagger away from this disaster with Father, still following him as he has always been their leader. The life they lead then is untenable as he makes a series of mad decisions and drags his family with him as he makes these decisions. Reading this story I was always tense and feeling dread. I thought this is what it must be like to follow a cult leader; someone brilliant and charismatic but absolutely insane and getting worse. He also has a strange relationship with his sons, a magnification of a type that I have seen before, where the father challenges the son to do dangerous and difficult things in order to teach him and make him a man. The oldest son responds with loyalty although he knows something is wrong with his father. The younger son, without the maturity to make allowances, just sees that his father is a madman and going to destroy them all. One of the twins is fiercely loyal to her father, the other is more of a non-entity in the story, more babyish than her sister. All of these kids have been homeschooled and have both the advantages of that type of education and the isolation that comes with it. Each of these children respond differently to their bizarre life, the wife is loyal to the end. She truly loves her husband and works hard to realize his dreams. The story is tragic, the man needed medication although it certainly would have dulled his brilliance and energy. After the destruction of Jeronimo there was no more hope for him.

I am that ""without words"" after reading Finding Fish. It touched on a lot of potential sore spots with me and I am still leery to poke at my psyche and see how sore these sore spots are. Antwone is a ward of the state of Ohio. He was born to a mother who was in jail and unable to care for him. His father was already dead although he would not know that for many years. He was basically told nothing about his background by the state, and his foster mother just kept reiterating that he and the other foster children, Dwight and Flo, were not part of the family and were not wanted. She calls them ""nigga"" all the time (she herself is black and from the south) and tells them how worthless they are and how no one wants them, that is why they are at her house. They are never given gifts(including Christmas) or even the money that the state allocates for their allowance. The punishment is often corporeal and even more frequently psychological. The state is unaware of all this of course, but as time goes on there are suspicions that all is not as it should be. It doesn't help that case workers are switched so often. Antwone is lucky in some ways though, partly due to his personality, partly due to various mentors and teachers. The story ends with him at home with his wife and 2 year old daughter; a happy, successful, loved and loving man. Unlike a lot of unhappy/abusive childhood memoirs, Antwone makes his adult life as he sorts things out and makes a success of himself, very interesting. The book is good through the last word. Identity is a touchy subject, especially for children who are not kept by their blood families. As an adopted child I can tell you that that identity thing pops up regularly along with the feelings of worthlessness, rejection and sadness.

This is big news in every country that has hunted whales. But the IWC has given permission. So the Makah Indians try to learn how to whale like their ancestors. They practice and pray and argue. Not every Makah Indian is in favor of whale hunting, not every white person is against. But the situation does stir up a lot of anti-Indian sentiment (for example when the Puyallup tribe supports the whale hunt, Puyallup high school receives a bomb threat). Emotions were running high. While the Makah tribe practices their paddling and harpooning techniques they are harassed by protesters with fire extinguishers, insults and blaring whale music. The Makah generally do not rise to the provocation, although there were instances when it occurred. I found myself almost immediately in the book when I read this description of a young Makah man who was originally on the whaling team but eventually dropped out: ""He was a kind of Save the Whales whaler, who saw environmentalism and whaling as compatible if conducted on ancient Native American terms."" I had to laugh as that would be me alright. Never mind that I don't think anyone else should ever kill whales unless in a desperate need for food. So I was wondering about that, is that the romanticizing of the American Indian that is so popular that I have fallen into? Is it that I loved a native boy when I was young and so I defend his rights even though I haven't seen or heard of him in almost 40 years? Probably a bit of both. Well the Makah Indians certainly weren't perfect. They have their own personal and national peculiarities and foibles. And I was kind of saddened by the death of the whale and grossed out by the carcass and butchering. But I am saddened whenever I pass stockyards or cattle trucks and grossed out by the carcasses and butchering of cows and other animals. As Wayne, the Captain of the whale hunt says to some protesters one day, ""Go stand in front of McDonalds"". He has a point. If the Makah decided to go commercial I would find that objectionable as the whales (and other species in the ocean) have suffered terrible depletion. The Gray Whale, once so populous, was nearly wiped out by commercial whaling. I mean, these commercial whalers were out there with giant whale processing factories. It is absolutely worth fighting commercial whaling and I am so glad for the success that the Save the Whale people (of whatever particular group) have had.But this isn't commercial whaling that the Makah were doing, it was religious and symbolic, trying to recapture a culture that had nearly been completely destroyed by the Europeans who took over the land and killed most of the Indians and forced their children to give up their culture. Now they want to Save the Whales. OK, how about saving the Indian? That is what the Makah hunt was all about, trying to find and save their identity. I support that even if a few whales have to die for the cause. I don't know if the whale hunting helped the Makah or not. But I want to go visit the museums in Neah Bay, hike the trails, see the dig and spend some money in Neah Bay. I would assume tourism helps. I also think that if the Makah gave Whale Watching tours that it could be profitable for them. They are kind of short on jobs and money, or at least they were at the time this book was written in 1999. Overall my feeling is good for the Indians, I would not have been out there protesting.As far as the book goes, I liked it a lot, felt like the author was successful in putting across differing viewpoints. I was not that excited about all the commentary on Moby Dick, I had to force myself to read that part. I do have an interest in Herman Melville though which made the Moby Dick parts easier to get through....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 08, 2014","Jun 11, 2014","Jun 08, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1348234.A_Whale_Hunt

It is not a quiet book nor is it ever dull.A man wakes up and has no idea of his identity, nothing is familiar. He finds a note that he must have written to himself before he lost himself that tells him to call this doctor and take these car keys and go to see her. He finds out that this is the 11th time he has woken up like this. He also finds out that his condition is related to the accidental death of his girlfriend while they were vacationing in Greece.Now it is up to Eric Sanderson, as he finds himself out to be, to try to put together the past. He gets some help from packages and letters that come in the mail from the previous incarnation of Eric Sanderson.There is also great danger in that a shark is after him; a shark that is a concept and eats the memories, feelings, data; that which we hold in our minds and makes us who we are. This fish has to do with an out of control brain that is occupying a great number of different bodies. Kind of science fiction-ish. We go on some wild adventures with Eric, and a girl named Scout. We end up in a mad professor's underground labyrinth of paper and books. It just gets wilder from there. The love story part of it is exceptionally well written, I felt that love and that grief down to my toes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2014","Jun 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/144800.The_Raw_Shark_Texts

Would you like to hear some of it?""As the boat came to a stop, I nodded to Carl, who leaned over the rail and grabbed the leader just below the snap. Standing up straight, Carl leaned into the rail with the tops of his legs nd hauled the leader, hand over hand, twisting his upper body to pull with his back and shoulders. Kenny and Ringo appeared at either side of Carl, each with a 16-foot-long-gaff. The gaff poles were 2-inch-diameter oak dowels, and each had a large shiny hook secured to one end. The gaffers were poised and staring into the water, looking for the fish that we all anticipated. Carl gave a long steady pull with his right hand, and the fish came into view a few feet below the surface. It was a sword. it was big. And it was alive. My pulse quickened. Swordfish are the most magnificent of all ocean creatures. A streamlined and muscular missile with a bayonet, the swordfish is strong, swift, and agile. The fish circled, swimming under the boat as they often do. Carl held the leader, no longer pulling; he waited. When the fish swam out from under us, Carl pulled in another fathom of leader. A dorsal fin cut the surface; then hell broke loose as the fish slashed wildly with its 3-foot-long sword. The fish's bill and back were lit up in blue and purple, and its sides flashed in silver and pink. With two short jerks, Kenny and Ringo sunk their gaff hooks into the head of the fish and pulled it toward the door in the rail. The fish thrashed, and the water flew. Grabbing a 24-inch steel meat hook, I reached through the door and placed the hook into one of the fish's eye sockets. Peter came from the stern with a second meat hook, and placed it in the eye socket with mine. Ringo grabbed the bill to prevent it from slashing as we all pulled together to drag the fish onto the deck.""""...we landed another sword, a small marker of about 110 pounds that was quite frisky but was quickly overcome by Carl's tenacity and Kenny's sharp gaff to the back of its head. Once on deck, the fish flopped on its side, raising head and tail into the air and slapping both down over and over, flogging the deck soundly. The flops got fewer and less vigorous, the up-and-down motion working like a pump, pushing the life from the fish, from torrent to trickle in a matter of minutes. The colors left the fish in the same way that a Polaroid picture develops, but in reverse. Sharp flashing silver lines and vivid colors yielded to fuzzy borders of blended shades of blues and purples that gave way to mottled patches of grays, blacks, and whites as the last of life dribbled from the defeated fish.""I must have been born without the hunting gene as I don't find this exciting or pleasurable. I can understand fishing and hunting for food, even for money. But the number of fish taken, by each boat and there are many out there, seems terrible excessive to me. The operating ethic, which certainly makes sense from an economic standpoint, is you don't come in until your fish hold is full and that means many, many thousands of pounds of fish. Captain Linda Greenlaw says, regarding the idea of overfishing and ocean depletion, that ""in seventeen years of swordfishing, I have seen no evidence of depletion."" Really? I thought there was evidence of overfishing, could I be wrong? She says, ""If a problem with overfishing does develop, it is not the American fisherman who should be punished, but perhaps the fishermen from countries that currently have no regulations in place and continually exceed their allowable catch quota."" Well politics are certainly going to play a part in which countries and fishermen and which fish are going to be allowed and in what quotas. But OK, even if I can accept the numbers in which these fish are being caught, can I accept the killing and the pleasure taken in that killing? Afraid not. You can call me a liberal, tree-hugging, animal-loving hippie if you want. Maybe you are right in some small way. In my heart I was rooting for the fish and totally LOVED THE FISH THAT GOT AWAY from 3 strong, experienced and determined fishermen, and then did a victory lap around the boat giving them all the evil eye. Captain Greenlaw is still bitter about that fish, told it F you at the time and every time she thinks about it gives the fish that got away another F you. I do admire how hard the fishermen work, it sounds like brutally hard work. Anyway, no matter where you stand on commercial fishing, swordfish, or any related topics, this is a very informative and interesting read....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 06, 2014","Jun 07, 2014","Jun 06, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/173165.The_Hungry_Ocean

I was so tempted to skim. Really the book ended for me by Christmas 1939. I know the philosophy was meant to be meaningful in the meaning of life and beauty and memory kind of way. But I was not up for it. I wanted happiness on a practical level and basically I didn't accept the kind of happiness that Mr. White or Mr. Horner found. I also thought that the killer was inconsistent per whatever else I have read about killers. I almost felt like he was not supposed to be a real person but just a personification of evil.

The Jamaicans are educated and consider themselves part of the British empire and children of the mother country of England. Unfortunately the people of England doesn't seem to recognize the Jamaicans; they don't know where Jamaica is and to them Jamaicans are just black people, inferior to white. Prejudice, alive and well in 1948 Britain.In this story we follow Gilbert and Hortense, a Jamaican couple; and Bernard and Queenie a white couple; and a young Jamaican man named Michael Roberts who becomes entwined in the lives of all of them. Set in both pre-WWII Jamaica and WWII London, race, relationships and world changes all come together to make a very good novel.I only recall meeting one person from Jamaica. He was a student trainee in acupuncture and I was a patient. I was pretty new to my grief of losing a child (and new in that case lasts at least 5 years) and the world looked grey to me, I was always cold. So here comes this tall black man bursting with color and warmth; everything about him looked and felt warm and his smile was dazzling. I thought maybe I could get better if this man just kept his warm hand covering mine and smiled. I don't think he even put any needles in, I just remember meeting him that one time, but I can pull out that memory like the memory of a sunny day when it has been endlessly cloudy. I also remember the middle-aged black women from the islands who lived in N. Miami Beach. They always dressed like for church, in dresses and hats, I think I may even have seen some gloves. And that was in 2001. I thought it was classy.So evidently I was predisposed to like this book and relate well to the characters, even Michael Roberts, even the ludicrous Bernard. It was the author's gift to put these characters on the page in a way that let a reader relate to them in all their failings and mistakes. I also loved the dialect, I could hear it in my head. Very, very good book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 10, 2014","May 12, 2014","May 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44001.Small_Island

I enjoyed this 7th women's murder club book very much. The story was coherent, it followed the pattern (4 women, 3 crimes and 2 to 3 page chapters) and worked well. It didn't bog down, it was simple without being stupid (mostly), and it had some good surprises. Well the trial happening at all was stupid because they had absolutely no evidence against the suspect except her own confession and people falsely confess all the time. There was no evidence including no dead body. But for entertainment value and for forwarding the story I thought it worked.Three cases:1. Someone is killing older wealthy couples in fires set in their homes. 2. A well known sick young man (like the boy in the bubble kind of famous sick kid) is missing and the last to see him was a local prostitute.3. A true crime writer is stalking Yuki (She is the prosecutor in the case against the prostitute who last saw the famous sick young man, and a member of the women's murder club).It feels like there might be some sort of underlying message about young men who grow up wealthy and don't develop a conscience, but that could be getting too deep for a James Patterson story.If you like James Patterson I think this one is one of the better ones. It is quick to read and decent entertainment. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 10, 2014","May 10, 2014","May 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/552894.7th_Heaven

The book seems endless at 674 pages of small print; dense, emotional, often depressing, very intense, sometimes boring, always heart-breaking.But having stuck with it, having absorbed this book, I would never give it back. It felt important to me to understand what had been going on in Russia at this time and the experiences the prisoners went through. Solzhenitsyn takes us through the terrible choices that prisoners sometimes have to make in order to survive; in fact the story starts with a Soviet official who tries to warn an old friend of the family that a trap is being set for him. It is the moral choice versus the choice that allows survival. It is also heart breaking to see the betrayal of the true believers in Communism and who work so hard for the ideals only to have it all twisted and before you know it they are accused of something, perhaps thinking against the regime, and arrest follows. It was terrible to see how Russian soldiers who fought so hard during the war were often arrested on their return to Russia. A prisoner was not allowed to see his wife except once a year, supervised. And a wife could not allow anyone to know her husband was a prisoner as she would lose her job, housing and community support. It was awful, and kept more awful by the majority of people choosing survival over helping other people and risking their own life. But the choice would be understandable because the consequences of acting like a human being were disastrous on a personal level. The miracle was that so many prisoners, and even those who were not prisoners, would make a moral choice rather than a practical choice. Often in this book, when I would put myself in a character's shoes I would think, well that is it, there is no reason to go on. But the characters do go on, not like my wimpy self who wanted to give up and kept seeing death as the only way out. So I cried a lot and wanted to leave the book but I didn't and here I am on the other side. This is an emotionally battering book, but it is meant to be, it has to be as it was an emotionally battering time and place.

The baby has only testicle and 'he' also has a vagina. The baby is a true hermaphrodite. His mother thinks he is perfect as is (my reaction as a mother as well when I imagined being in this mother's place) the father is not unkind but thinks the child will be better off without this ambiguity and should be raised as a boy. The mother understands as she fears for her child and the judgment of the world so she takes the baby in to the hospital for a surgery to close the vagina. Thereby starts the story of Wayne, a sensitive child, a gifted artist, a child neither fully girl nor boy despite the surgery and hormones he takes. I thought the story was very well written and often heart-breaking.I also thought the subject was fascinating. I googled it and read a bunch of articles, both medical and Jewish to see what Jewish law said about it. (Typically opinions varied although it seemed that circumstances allowing with the child's physical characteristics, to raise the child as a boy).Recently there was a case in the news in which a female runner was found to be hermaphrodite. There was a possibility she would be stripped of her gold medal because of it. She identifies as female, is happy with herself the way she is and is accepted as female in her country, if news media can be trusted.Isn't the human body endlessly fascinating??Anyway I really enjoyed this book and how the characters were presented.

I hadn't been in about 2 months but I felt I couldn't wait to get back. So much joy in being back on my mat!Yes, I love yoga!I thought the book was OK; I have never wanted to go to India and still don't. I am not looking for spiritual enlightenment. I am seeking a quieter mind and a fit body (to the degree that a 56 year old with scoliosis and disc deterioration can be fit - bring on the pensioner's yoga!)Lucy Edge is looking for spiritual enlightenment, yoga bliss and a man to love. She has been doing yoga for awhile, has gone on some yoga retreats but really feels a need to make some big changes from her high stress, seemingly meaningless ad agency job and her lonely life as a single woman. She books a flight to Bombay with a list of Ashrams to visit.And she takes us along on her often funny and difficult explorations of yoga in India.I found myself interested in some of the theory of yoga; the ""yamas"" (5 disciplines that govern the way we behave towards other people) and the 5 ""niyamas"" (the practices that help us to create a disciplined mind and body). She was learning about these things from someone she called the ""Swoony Swami"", she often had her mind on men. No judgment on my part, just so we understand that. This was at the Sivananda Ashram.The two weirdest Ashram's she went to were ""Amma's Ashram' (the Hugging Mother) and the Ashram (if you could call it that) of a guru called Osho, also known as 'the sex guru'. He was the guru who was set up in Oregon for awhile until he got deported for immigration violations. He was the one with all the Rolls Royce cars. I did most of my laughing in this book reading about Osho's compound.One of my favorite characters was Swami Vijayananda, an 89 year old man that Lucy ends up talking to while visiting the ashram of Shri Shri Ma Anandamayee and having a dip in the Ganges. My favorite question that Lucy asks of herself is, ""How could I achieve my dream of becoming a serene and poised Yoga Goddess if I had a knackered neck?"" I have asked that same question myself and hearing Lucy ask it made me laugh.OK, another yoga principle that interested me was ""duhkka"" (suffering) and the 5 kleshas (obstacles) that cause it, and the 5 states of the mental plane - I could really relate to ""mudham"" (the second state - the official state of the blues). And this, from ""Dictionary of Sri Aurobindo's yoga"",""Aim of the Integral Yoga: It is not merely to rise out of the ordinary ignorant world-consciousness into the divine consciousness, but to bring the supramental power of that divine consciousness down into the ignorance of mind, life and body, to transform them, to manifest the Divine here and create a divine life in Matter.""Lucy doesn't understand this, but I like it and feel that I have an understanding of it. Course if I studied it more I could find out I know nothing about it.So in the end Lucy finds herself by not trying to be something she isn't. I don't think she gives up yoga but she goes back to England and I think goes back to advertising. Life isn't so bad being what you are. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 23, 2014","Apr 24, 2014","Apr 23, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1872651.Yoga_School_Dropout

If a story can be very intense and boring at the same time, then this book is it. I think this is because the story is secondary to the history. Historical fiction is often a story written in an historical context. This is history written through the vehicle of a fictional story. Everything in this story is created to tell the history of Burma (Myanmar). I felt emotionally connected to the story because the author is, his love for the country and the people comes through strongly. He says, in his Author's Notes:The seed of this book was brought to India long before my own lifetime by my father and my uncle, the late Jagat Chandra Datta of Rangood and Moulmein - 'The Prince' as he was known to his relatives. But neither my father nor my uncle would have recognized the crop that I have harvested. By the time I started work on this book, the memories they had handed on to me had lost their outlines, surviving often only as patterns of words, moods, textures. In attempting to write about places and times that I knew only at second- and third-hand, I found myself forced to create a parallel, wholly fictional world. The Glass Palace is thus unqualifiedly a novel and I can state without reservation that except for King Thebaw, Queen Supayalat and their daughters, none of its principal characters bear any resemblance to real people, living or deceased. Perhaps it was the very elusiveness of what I was trying to remember that engendered in me a near-obsessive urge to render the backgrounds of my characters' lives as closely as I could. In the five years it took me to write The Glass Palace I read hundreds of books, memoirs, travelogues, gazetteers, articles and notebooks, published and unpublished; I traveled thousands of miles, visiting and re-visiting, so far as possible, all the settings and locations that figure in this novel...Well first of all, that is one elegant Author's note. You can see he writes beautifully. But you can also see, even this is dense, how much more so the book. The story begins in 1885 with the deposing of the King and Queen of Burma, told through the story of Rajkumar who is 11 years old when this occurs. We follow Rajkumar and his family through the 1990's.  Politics, war, philosophy, and history, history, history. A great place, in my opinion, to start to learn the history of Burma, India, and Malaya....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 13, 2014","Apr 20, 2014","Apr 13, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77103.The_Glass_Palace

It iThis is a very serious book filled with history, medical information, Hmong culture and the politics of war and immigration in the United States. It is a rather damning text, both to the U.S. in our international politics, and to the rigidity of our medical system. Lia Lee is the 13th child of a Hmong couple from Laos. When the communists are victorious in Laos the Hmong people were killed, tortured, starved for their part in the war which was fighting on the U.S. side. So Lia's parents (Lia was not born yet) took their children and walked, in great danger, to Thailand where they lived in a refugee camp until they were given permission to emigrate to the U.S. Culture shock doesn't even begin to describe it. Like many Hmong they ended up going to Merced, CA. hoping for a bit of land to farm as this is what they knew. They didn't get any land, most Hmong didn't. Lia's mother grew her plants and herbs in her apartment building's parking lot.Lia is born in a hospital in CA. (The other children had been born at home in Laos, caught by their mother's forearms so they wouldn't touch the dirt floor, in silence so complete that the other children were not wakened.) Lia seemed normal but at about 8 months her sister slammed a door and Lia fell down in an epileptic seizure. The U.S. doctors understand this condition as a storm of electrical activity in the brain that causes seizure. The Hmong understand this condition as 'the spirit catches you and you fall down', her soul fled when she was frightened by the slamming door. They took her to the ER and here started the collision between the American doctors and Lia's parents and the Hmong community. Because Lia's parents did not comply with the regimen of anti-convulsant meds she was taken away from them when she was two and put into foster care, by her doctor's request to the courts of CA. Even though she had great foster parents I think this whole experience was to Lia's great detriment. She was given back to her parents before a year was up and they gave her the prescribed meds but Lia kept getting sicker and eventually contracted sepsis and seized until she was essentially brain dead. Western medicine sent her home to die expecting it to happen within hours or at the most days. Lia did not die, her parents took the most excellent and loving care of her. She was clean, fragrant, beautiful and emotionally responsive to her parents. Her parents used herbal medicine that they knew from Laos and Hmong shamanistic healing ceremonies. That didn't mean Lia came back, but she lived. The last scene where the chanter is calling her back is just heartbreaking. This book was of particular interest to me as I was epileptic as a child, and also because I have a disabled child. I felt somewhat ashamed reading how Lia's parents took care of her. We take good care of our son, but not as spectacular as her parents did. I thought I should make more of an effort. I also believe that there is a spiritual aspect to all of life. That as long as we are alive on this earth our body and soul cannot be separated or treated medically without consideration for the physical and spiritual aspects of a person. I think that there is every possibility that both the western understanding of epilepsy and the Hmong understanding of epilepsy (if you are Hmong) are both true and not mutually exclusive. I was impressed with and interested in Hmong culture and looked up to see if they have a community here in Seattle. They do. It was also interesting to read about animal sacrifice, now in modern day life. Not warehouse killing but individual animals sacrificed in propitiation or thanks. Altogether, an amazing book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 06, 2014","Apr 09, 2014","Apr 06, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12609.The_Spirit_Catches_You_and_You_Fall_Down

Obviously we did not care to pick a war with Britain. But this supplying weapons and supporting terrorists is incredibly criminal. What are we hoping? That all the indigenous peoples will be slaughtered if we supply both sides with weapons and then we can take all the riches? But why does this author lump Palestine in with places where innocents are being slaughtered? So wrong. The people running ""Palestine"" (another false entity created by Britain) are Muslim terrorists! They daily try to kill Israelis while Israel tries to help Muslim civilians caught in the middle. Am I going to get a lot of hate mail and angry tirades for saying so? Probably. So be it. As you can see, every nerve ending was grated upon and I was angry, disgusted and sick. I hate reading about war. And nothing good seems to ever happen in Africa. Give me good news out of Africa, I know there must be some.The book is well-written and heartbreaking. She includes pictures from Biafra in the late sixties. Babies with their swollen bellies and stick limbs. How can you not cry?? It is the worst thing, a forced starvation of people to ""unite"" Nigeria. F that! She also has a secondary line of story in the relationships of Odenigbo and Olanna, and Olanna's twin Kainene and her white lover Richard. Adultery and its destructive force, and how in comparison to war and starvation, it pales. Adultery is another subject I detest and find very depressing....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 27, 2014","Jan 02, 2015","Apr 02, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/449251.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun

And I was asked why I was reading a book that upset me so much because reading is for enjoyment. Is it?? I thought it was about learning and experiencing points of view outside of one's own experience; also for enjoyment if the book happens to be the enjoyable kind. Well this book certainly took me outside of my comfort zone. I mean, yeah I thought it was funny, but it was also very painful because it was astute. The writing was absolutely masterful. This was writing you could eat, it was so delicious. But it was also kicking me in the head.Sherman McCoy has it all, sort of. He is a Wall Street Bond trader at the top of his game. He makes a ton of money, although his wife spends a major part of the money on interior decorating. He has a sweet six year old daughter. But he and his wife aren't really connecting well, mostly because Sherman (Shuhmun) is having a hot affair with a younger woman, wife of some old really rich guy. So basically Sherman tries to have more than he should, could or is capable of having. He ruins his family life, his career, his finances and his reputation. His lies catch up with him so badly that even the truth can't save him. He becomes the rallying cry of the black community against oppression even though the truth is that he was the intended victim of a crime by a black man in the Bronx. But he is accused of running down a poor black honor student with his Mercedes and leaving the scene without a word to anyone to help this kid. A very twisted version of the truth, but with enough validity to get him in serious legal trouble. The saving grace, for me, was that I liked who he had become by the end of the book.

She could easily have been killed or her family members killed or shunned. The custom of marrying little girls as yo Nujood is one brave little girl. She could easily have been killed or her family members killed or shunned. The custom of marrying little girls as young as 8 is widespread in Muslim countries, I guess because their prophet married a 9 year old girl. This year an 8 year old girl, I have forgotten which Muslim country, died from bleeding on her wedding night. It mentions in this book that in Yemen a girl of 9 was married to a Saudi man and died three days after her wedding. The parents apologized to the husband and offered their 7 year old instead! There is something terribly twisted and upside down about the sexuality in Muslim countries and every woman is in danger of rape, every little girl is in danger of legal rape by being married before she even reaches puberty. Yet these are the men talking about ""honor"" and the ""decadence of the West"". Rape and child sexual abuse happen in the West, all too often, but it is illegal and no one is claiming it is right and/or justified. The reason Nujood's family had to leave their happy home in their little village is that a stranger walked in and raped the oldest girl at home while her parents were away. This was not a crime on the part of the man, it was a crime on the part of the girl and the family. They had to move away for having shamed the village. Do you see what I mean by twisted and upside down? Recently a Muslim cleric beat and tortured (and possibly sexually assaulted - the wife denied this part) his 5 year old to death because he suspected she was no longer a virgin. She took 10 months in hospital to die. The cleric, a popular one who is often on Arabic TV, was jailed for a short time but paid a blood fee and was released. Twisted, twisted, twisted!! The horror stories go on and on, with women with their noses cut off, women with acid thrown in their faces - all in the name of honor and having to do with some sort of sexual situation, like she rejected my advances as a suitor so I threw acid in her face, or she looked at a boy so I threw acid in her face.So Nujood was pretty lucky that she lived through telling her story. I imagine that if the eye of the world had not caught this story it could have ended much differently for Nujood. I hope she is successful in her quest to help other little girls but she is up against the whole fundamentalist Muslim world. By the way, the 8 year old who died of bleeding on her wedding night? A Muslim cleric justified child marriage after that incident saying that there was nothing wrong with an adult man marrying an 8 year old....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 27, 2014","Mar 28, 2014","Mar 27, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6818019-i-am-nujood-age-10-and-divorced

I took a dislike to Julie; she often seemed unkind, sarcastic, neurotic, sex obsessed, foul-mouthed and she drank too much. The book was much different than I expected and that had to do with Julie's personality.So Julie decides to cook every recipe in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and do it within one year. She is also going to blog about it, back when blogging was pretty new. So she cooks in her obsessive and angry way, her husband is patient with her and her friends come over to eat.

She thanks everyone for their support of Julie and then says, ""PS - Clarence, who fucking cares what you think, anyway.""So really, we can just apply those words to me, who cares what I think and whether I like Julie or not.One day when Julie is feeling better with the world she says, ""And I figure, maybe just believing in goodness generates a tiny bit of the stuff, so that by being so foolish as to believe in our better natures, if just for a day, we actually contribute to the sum total of generosity in the universe.That's naive, isn't it? Dammit, I hate when I do that.""Now see, I liked her ""naive"" statement. But she is such a negative personality that she immediately cuts herself down for having such a thought. She was just joking? Every joke contains the truth or it wouldn't be funny. Putting herself down in jokes is a way of life with her. She says, ""I can only assume I've been blessed by the attention of CBS because I'm a foulmouthed hysteric with misanthropic tendencies for whom things are constantly going terribly, terribly wrong.""Yet, for all I disliked her, when she finds out Julia's response to her project is negative criticism I actually cried with Julie and thought how horrible Julia was being and that Julie put Julia back into the minds of people when she was disappearing. It was SNL and Julie who kept Julia Child's name and cooking in the minds of younger people.

It was hard for me to finish reading this book, I wanted vomit up the contents and leave it behind, just contemplate beauty instead. But I guess I should say something. Here goes:I didn't understand sometimes, maybe too white to understand. She blames everything on whites basically but she works alongside white civil rights workers and the only man she married was white (looked that up on Wikipedia, it was not part of the book). Her father left the family without an income when Anne (Essie Mae) was a young child to pursue another woman; her mother's boyfriend evidently had a sexual interest in her when she was a teenager and hated her because of it so she left home; her father's girlfriend's brother in law gets upset about something and is threatening to shoot his wife but ends up shooting her father's girlfriend instead. Her father's girlfriend loses the majority of one foot but doesn't blame the man who did it, she blames the whites who made it difficult for black men to make a living. Anne thinks this is admirable but I am confused. It seems to me that if a man picks up a gun and shoots someone then he is responsible for what he did. If a white man is unemployed and cracks under the strain and tries to shoot his wife and injures someone then he is prosecuted and jailed. Why is it different for a black man? Unemployment and poverty can happen to anyone. It doesn't provide immunity from prosecution for crimes. And for Anne herself, her family caused a lot of the difficulties of her childhood, as is true for a lot of people of any color. The whites underpaid her and she experienced prejudice as that was the way the whole southern society was structured. But overall her anguish came from the experiences of seeing black people in her town being beat up, run out of town or killed by white men. I do understand that part. I think Anne may have been somewhat emotionally unbalanced by it. Many members of her family rejected her during and after her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement; whether out of fear or disagreement or non-understanding is never really clear. I hope that that was resolved.I think the Civil Rights Movement needed to happen as the segregation was an ugly thing. What I also don't understand though is what has happened since then. We may not be segregated but we continue to be polarized and blame is being slung in all directions. We've had innocent white men grabbed by black mobs and beat nearly to death. Two that come to mind are the Reginald Denny beating after the acquittal of the policemen who beat Rodney King and the recent beating in Cincinnati of a white guy by about 40 blacks last 4th of July. The acquittal of the police in the Rodney King beating caused widespread looting and burning in Los Angeles. Fifty-three people died. I can't understand how this helped anybody. Did Reginald Denny's permanent brain damage help anyone? Now we have the whole ""black lives matter"" countered with ""police lives matter"" slogan match going on. Why? All lives matter. Like I said, sometimes I feel like nothing got solved and nothing ever will and I just should ignore it all and contemplate beauty and try to create beauty in my own little space and that is it. I AM grateful to Anne and others like her that we are no longer segregated, and have compassion for the those who suffered prejudice and ill treatment. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 10, 2015","Aug 16, 2015","Mar 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5736.Coming_of_Age_in_Mississippi

Ugh!Thomas Clarence did not cooperate with the writers of this book nor did he want anyone else to it seemed. Those who asked Clarence Thomas if he would mind if they spoke with the authors were told he did mind. He is not a fan of the media; once bitten twice shy, and he has been bitten plenty.Before I read this book the only thing that came to mind when I heard the name Clarence Thomas was that he had been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill. Now isn't that a sad and ignorant thing, that this is all I should know about a man who has accomplished plenty in his life. So on that basis, just learning more about Clarence Thomas than I knew, made this book a worthwhile read for me.So who is Clarence Thomas? He is a Supreme Court Justice. He was appointed during the Reagan administration, his Senate Confirmation Hearing was a mess because Americans are obsessed with their political leaders' sex scandals and Anita Hill (who worked with him on the EEOC) had accused him of sexual harassment.On that subject; the only ones who can know the truth are Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. I have an opinion of course, probably so does everyone, but so what. I won't bore you with mine.So I knew so little about this man I couldn't have told you where he stood on the political spectrum. First I found out Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton don't like him. I was like, oh I probably like Clarence Thomas then. Then I found out that he was good friends with Rush Limbaugh. Really?? So maybe I didn't like him so much.No, actually I do overall like the Clarence Thomas portrayed in this book. He is such a mixture of good character traits and not so good ones, strengths and weaknesses; he just comes across as very human. He is easy to forgive for his less than stellar moments and decisions (for me anyway, someone who doesn't know him). He is a real shmoozer and I enjoyed that part of his personality. He is kind of larger than life in some ways, but still a very real man. Honestly, I can't get the image of him spinning around on his chair like a bored child during Supreme Court sessions out of my head. I should probably take such behavior seriously but it makes me laugh.My oldest son has been through law school so I asked him what he thought of CT and his response was, he is smart but not Supreme Court smart like Ginsberg, Renquist and Scalia. His decisions aren't that brilliant. Well I figure CT made it to where he is, so good on him. People should be proud of him. Which most of his own people, African-Americans, are not. They don't like his conservative views and especially that he doesn't approve of or back affirmative action. I am in agreement with some of his opinions and some I am not in agreement with. But who am I? I'll keep my opinions to myself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 18, 2014","Feb 23, 2014","Feb 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/710155.Supreme_Discomfort

What does child abuse have to do with it? What does a young woman, very unlike the other victims, who gets put into critical condition have to do with it? At least she tells us who hurt her. Although the person who hurt her is evidently wanting to be hurting someone else; so why doesn't he? Is he punishing the first woman or just practicing for his next intended victim? Why is there no similarity in the crimes if the same person is responsible for all the crimes? Is the clue in academic theories? What was in the way of the door in the final scene? Beats me, and why don't I know? Because it is never explained or because I am just a dense reader? The only character who is likeable is Charlie Resnick, he reminded me of Swedish detective Kurt Wallender. Actually detective Lynn Kellog is also likeable but we don't spend a lot of time with her. Patel was OK but we see him even less than Lynn. This story is Incredibly Inconsistent!! And Horribly Unhappy!! Hated Rachel, everyone else is looking for love, she is throwing it away. And by the way, who wrote the Lonely Hearts Ad for Rachel? Was it Rachel? Nothing made sense. The author is not without talent and he had the potential for a good book here, but like Rachel throwing away love, the author throws all the potential for a good book away. Too bad. I think I will go read other readers s and see if I can get a clue as to what actually happened in this book.I think this book spawned a migraine in my poor head but after reading other s I've decided to accept the one serial killer premise here, unlikely as I find it. But that ending? I don't think so.The symbolism, the room Charlie kept making up as a nursery, just too much.

But that said, there were two things that bothered me: 1. Parker would not have survived his accident. Why didn't the author make the accident more believable? #2 Parker was very cruel to Maris after getting her to trust him, just awful really. And the excuse given in the book for this cruelty didn't make sense to me. Supposedly he did that to make her leave. Why didn't he just say, listen I need you to leave for a few weeks until I call and tell you it is OK to come back. I'm working on something and need you to leave for awhile but I love you and can't wait for your return. It seemed to me that the scene was written just to twist up the reader's feelings. That part of the revenge seemed to be personal against Maris because she was Noah's wife and Noah had killed Sheila therefore it made sense to hurt Maris. What? How so? I mean how did it hurt Noah?? If I had been Maris I may not have healed enough to return to him or to trust him fully again. Noah was hurt more by Nadia's machinations and Daniel's cleverness than by the hurt put on Maris by Parker. Noah didn't even know Parker had hurt her, just knew Parker had slept with her which might have irritated him but hurt him not at all.Other than those complaints it was a good romantic thriller, I pretty much read it straight through as it was always interesting. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 03, 2014","Feb 05, 2014","Feb 03, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/76179.Envy

I found myself very involved in the lives of the characters, caring what happened and emotionally invested in their fictional lives. I also liked that the book is historical fiction and that her setting is based in reality, particularly the Indian massacres that took place in 1622 and 1644.I didn't understand why Drew had to act like such an idiot sometimes. I was feeling Constance's pain during the times he rejected her. I don't think I would have had her equilibrium and understanding. But the author does a good job of describing the thought processes that went on in Drew's head, especially considering all the people he had lost in his life from Indian attacks and illnesses. I also like that the Indians were not drawn as bad people, that a balance was shown of the rights and wrongs committed on both the Indian and White settler's sides.The things that might have made this ""Christian"" fiction seemed totally normal to me; like saying or quoting psalms, looking up things in the Bible in order to understand what a person should do, or honoring both marriage vows and the sanctity of the intimate relationship within marriage.All in all I thought this was a very good book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 03, 2014","Feb 03, 2014","Feb 03, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/324022.A_Bride_Most_Begrudging

I spent quite a lot of the book saying ""who?"" to myself. I couldn't keep track of most of the characters as they were not grounded in the story. Names just kind of floated around. I think the author was trying to keep her readers mostly in the dark so we could get the big reveals at the end. But it wasn't until I was 3/4 of the way through the book that I began to understand how people were related to each other, what their connections were. And then all the reveals at the end were a bit much. People kept having conversations where they would now sit down and tell all. I actually thought the premise of the story was solid, she just didn't plot it out well as far as what to reveal when, imo. So basically you have some upper class people in England, servants polishing candlesticks and everyone getting ready for the yearly ball. Then some soldier dude ends up dead on the estate and his best buddy, drunk and covered in the dead guy's blood, is crying over him and saying 'it's all my fault'. He gets jailed and there is this very short court case (we are getting near the end of the book) and then a bunch of reveals. Done.Kind of embarrassing here, I didn't realize this book was based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Now I see why I was so confused, the author expected the reader to already be familiar with the characters and I was not. I don't even know if I ever read Pride and Prejudice, if I did it was more than 10 years ago and I don't recall it.

My own son happened to be in the Florida National Guard, joining in order to get his college education like John Crawford did, just a couple of years after John. At one point he was short-listed to be sent to either Iraq or Afghanistan, I forget which. He managed to slide out of that one and after reading John's story I can't tell you how glad I am of that. But you know, I do know other people who have been soldiers in Iraq and they came back in much better shape than John. It has to be such a personal thing, how one responds to being in a war zone and killing people and seeing friends killed. It didn't help that a 3 to 6 month posting turned into something like a year and a half, or that the country was a brutal, sewage filled hellhole filled with people who hate Americans. John Crawford lost his marriage during his tour or shortly thereafter, he had become addicted to Valium while in Iraq, he was sleeping on friend's couches when he returned. Active duty pay should have been pretty good but I guess that wasn't what John was lacking when he got back. I was really sad for him and can only hope he is doing better now. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 15, 2014","Jan 18, 2014","Jan 15, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/894391.The_Last_True_Story_I_ll_Ever_Tell

It is so well done that it is hard to remember that what you are reading is not really the journal of Mrs. Chippy but a story put together from what is known from the journals of the crew and by an author who knows cats. Mrs. Chippy belonged to the ship's carpenter Henry (Chips) McNeish. After the Endurance had been stuck in ice for 9 months and then was finally crushed by the ice, the Captain ordered everyone onto the ice and started eliminating anything that was not absolutely vital to the survival of the men. Now I haven't read about what happened after this but I do know that it was McNeish who built the boats that made survival possible. As McNeish did not agree with the actions of the Captain, and made that known and did not forgive the Captain, he was left out of the honor of receiving the Polar Award because of insubordination to the Captain.One of the saddest stories I have ever read but I am glad that it got written so people will remember Mrs. Chippy.

When I started reading it seemed so current. Here is a conversation between Prince Ali Yusef and his English friend and pilot Bob Rawlinson,Says Prince Ali ""Take refuge in your Embassy? That, never. The extremists would probably storm the place -- they wouldn't respect diplomatic immunity. Besides, if I did that, it really would be the end! Already the chief accusation against me is of being pro-Western. It is so difficult to understand. ... My grandfather was a cruel man, a real tyrant. He had hundreds of slaves and treated them ruthlessly. In his tribal wars, he killed his enemies unmercifully and executed them horribly. The mere whisper of his name made everyone turn pale. And yet--he is a legend still! Admired! Respected! ...And I? What have I done? Built hosptials and schools, welfare, housing...all the things people are said to want. Don't they want them? Would they prefer a reign of terror like my grandfather's?""....Says Bob Rawlinson ""I bet you anything you like that if they boot you out of here, some spouting hot-air merchant will take over, yelling his own praises, building himself up into God Almighty, and stringing up, or cutting off the heads of anyone who dares to disagree with him in any way....I expect the people will like it, too. Exciting for them. Lots of bloodshed.""Hmmm, sounds terribly current but she published this book in 1959. The only thing different is that the terror has been successfully exported all over the world. What did Muslim terrorists blow up today? A Russian train station.Anyway, the book isn't really about this, it is about some jewels and a girl's school in England.

His daughter is constantly questioning him about the time he comes home and wheedling for money and suspicious that other people are after his money. He eventually has to go stay in a hotel. He meets up with an old friend, a woman he used to play with back when they were little kids. A relationship seems to be developing, although they mostly fall asleep after they eat.

They don't stay in character if you can even get a grasp on their particular character traits in the first place. Weird stuff is always happening and nothing really makes sense.

One day, Lacey who is deaf and was raised in an orphanage, gets a letter in her mailbox that states she has an identical twin and to go down to this bookstore and check it out. She sees her face on a poster as the author of a book. So she goes in and defaces a book and is rude to the bookstore owner. Then she lies to her boyfriend about why she is upset and will be late for dinner. Does this sound rational? And this is just the beginning.

Then there is the whole lock the parents in the basement scenario. We really get off into la la land here.

He starts training Dusty for Agility and this is the story of Rob and Dusty during their first year of competition. Rob is neurotic as well and so in some ways it is a good match but often they seem to acerbate each others anxiety and anti-social behaviors. When Rob seriously breaks his ankle he has to retire from Agility until it heals but he doesn't want to retire Dusty so he asks his partner Jeffrey to take over for him. He then suffers from feeling unnecessary and displaced, and guilty for his feelings, and he tells us all about it. This book is about Rob's neurosis as much as about Dusty's career in Agility.

I have no idea where Dave Pelzer is now or whether he is active in trying to stop child abuse but it seems like a former victim who has written books about his own experiences might be. As I read other people's s I see that there is some doubt cast as to the truth of his account. Well there had to be something going on otherwise the school would not have intervened and the state wouldn't have taken him out of the home. Did he exaggerate? I don't know, it is certainly possible. But it wasn't all untrue because his story is a documented case of child abuse. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 08, 2013","Dec 08, 2013","Dec 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60748.A_Child_Called_It_

Of course I have read it before, I think it was required reading in high school, but what an amazing book, truly worth multiple readings.Atticus is a small town Alabama lawyer in the late 1930's raising his 2 children, Scout Finch and Jem Finch, by himself. Atticus is the person and the parent I would like to be, a great human being, someone who can love and understand and bring about change in the world. The book is written from the point of view of Scout, a lovely lively 5 to 8 year old over the course of the story. She refuses to wear dresses and fights with the best of them. Jem is her big brother and he is a great kid too. Well no wonder when they are being raised by Atticus. The kids learn to understand the world they have been born into with all of its hypocrisies, oddities and entanglements. When a 19 year old white girl who lives with her father and younger siblings in horrible poverty and no kindness, when this girl accuses a young negro man of rape, Atticus is assigned to defend the young man. This is Alabama in the 1930's, you can guess how it turns out, but everything Atticus says and does is so necessary for the people and his children to hear and understand. Terribly sad but change comes slowly. Then there is the strange unseen neighbor, Boo Radley. He is a source of much speculation and fear for the children. We see who has a kind heart and who does not, who might be capable of change and who is not. I loved this book and cried over it quite a bit. It is a treasure and deserves every accolade that it has ever received. Recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 04, 2013","Dec 07, 2013","Dec 04, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird

It is written in a style of witness statements to a crime of stolen identity. Each person contributes his statement of the parts of the story he personally witnessed or was involved in. Although the language is old-fashioned, formal and lengthy, the crime and the plotting of the story might be found in any worthy crime novel today. This book has the advantage over most modern crime thrillers in that it has no gore, no sex but is still very creepy, authentic and fascinating.What I didn't like is that the character Laura is so colorless and uninteresting and seemingly as mentally challenged as the character Anne Catherick. Birds of a feather, those two. Yet Laura is the main love interest! Her sister Marion, who along with Walter, is the brains of the crime fighting characters, is a much better love interest. But she just lets her sis Laura have the man because she loves Laura. Walter and Marion are a couple in every partnership except the bedroom. Laura gets the bedroom. OK, I guess, whatever works.

This is when a stubborn, hard woman who won't show her feelings marries an uncouth, uneducated widower against her father's wishes and then won't admit to herself or her husband that she loves him. The story is told through the memories and thoughts of 90 year old Hagar Shipley. She is somewhat senile so we constantly slip through the past and the present and often she is confused about where she is and what has lately been going on. This doesn't make the story confusing to the reader however, this book is written with a very deft hand. The reader is borne along on Hagar's thoughts and memories, alternately sympathizing with and hating her. As her son Marvin says about her, ""She is a holy terror.""There is a scene in the beginning which pretty much sums up Hagar's personality. This takes place when she is a little girl and has said something her father doesn't like:""No good to say you're sorry when the damage is done. Hold out your hands, miss.""I wouldn't let him see me cry, I was so enraged. He used a foot ruler, and when I jerked my smarting palms back, he made me hold them out again. He looked at my dry eyes in a kind of fury, as though he'd failed unless he drew water from them. He struck and struck, and then all at once he threw the ruler down and put his arms around me. .....""You take after me,"" he said, as though that made everything clear. ""You've got backbone, I'll give you that."" So Hagar goes through life with backbone; she sometimes thinks nice things in her head but very rarely says them. She won't cry or show weakness. She grew up with money and even though she doesn't have any after she marries Bram Shipley, she maintains her haughty attitude, especially with her uneducated husband who tends to say things like, ""them there"". She likes the way he looks but wants him to be quiet as she finds him embarrassing when he talks. She really is quite the b-i-t-c-h. But Bram loves her too, their love is the common thread through everything, even after she leaves him. It is such a painful love as Hagar makes her terrible decisions. They have two children together; common, steady, plodding, loyal Marvin and quick-witted, lying, sneaking, disappointed, hard-drinking John. Hagar is not too interested in Marvin but bestows her favor on John. She takes him away and tries to get him an education as she thinks he is the son her father never had, that he can do better than a Shipley. It doesn't work out, and in the worst way. This is a painful and superbly realistic story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 17, 2013","Nov 20, 2013","Nov 17, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1102322.The_Stone_Angel

I really enjoyed reading it and am not sure I want to leave it yet. Connie May Fowler has the gift of description, she brings the people and places in her book to life for the reader. I basically fell in love with every main character despite their human frailties, maybe even more so because of them. There is a lot of redemption in this book, a lot of places where one has to forgive and understand. This is true of the characters but also of the history as it covers a time of huge change in our country in relationships between black and white people. There is magic and power in this book and it is not just the hoodoo, although that provides the magical realism and is used, I think, to show how different black and white were emotionally and practically, and how in the end that makes no difference in love or worship of God.Starting after WWII, maybe 1948 or so, the story starts with 2 honeymooning white couples and a black maid working at the motel where the couples meet and become friends.The black maid is Inez Temple, the two couples are Rose and Charlie Looney, and Eudora and Burl Junior Jewel. Rose and Charlie have a son Emory and when that son is near grown his relationship with his father reaches a boiling point resulting in Emory being sent to live and work on his uncle's sugar plantation. This is where he meets the beautiful black field worker Soleil Marie Beauvoir. A love story is created here that just swept me away. But we are dealing all along, in every character, with love, human nature, how we make excuses for ourselves and justify our actions, how we find redemption.

When a best-selling author drops dead during a book signing at the newly re-vamped bookstore Penelope thinks the bookstore will fail but the opposite happens as people now are anxious to procure a book by this author from the location in which he died. When it looks like murder rather than a heart attack the crowds go wild purchasing books.

He betrayed people he tricked into trustin I knew I wouldn't like what William (Billy) Queen (St. John) was going to do as soon as I started reading. He betrayed people he tricked into trusting him.So, I had to try to figure out why this bothered me so much.1. I have lived in Tujunga CA. I owned a house there about 1/2 mile from the intersection of Lowell and Foothill Blvd. I knew the areas he was talking about and didn't feel frightened of any biker activity going on when I lived there. If anything the bikers were polite to the general populace. Unlikely to flip you off while driving, that kind of thing.2. These bikers are outlaws and I wouldn't hang around them or go in bars (I don't go in bars anyway) where I see dozens of bikes outside. But they are mostly destructive to themselves. They take drugs, they fight, they steal stuff, they commit a large amount of domestic violence but generally they are not a threat to the larger population. They probably are a threat to businesses they want to take over or extort from. They are a threat to law enforcement.3. I guess I just don't see them as the threat that I see white supremacy groups or Islamic terrorist groups to be. OMGs would be likely to leave you alone if you leave them alone. They aren't killing people because they are the wrong color or wrong religion.4. They have a very strong code of brotherhood amongst themselves. Billy will tell you about that. They took him in as a brother and loved him and he completely betrayed them. (Of course if they knew who he was they would have killed him without compunction. But they didn't go out and look for an ATF agent to kill, they would have killed him for infiltrating their group)Maybe I am not making any sense, maybe there is some factor in my personality that is just wrong-headedly sympathetic to outlaws (I was also sympathetic to Jesse James, Ned Kelly and the Barefoot Bandit) and unsympathetic to law enforcement.I feel like the gangs of L.A., like say the 13th street gang or the Crips and the Bloods, are a different type of criminal than the OMGs. They seem more dedicated to violence against innocent people, as does the Mafia. Of course some members of the OMGs are mentally ill or deranged from drugs. That makes them unpredictably violent. The OMGs also don't graffiti up the city. The Hell's Angels even run that Toys for Tots every Christmas.The OMGs are terrible to women but as Billy points out, these women choose this lifestyle. And any woman who is not attached to a biker and goes into a biker bar is an idiot in my opinion, she is asking for trouble.There really are true victims here and those are the children. Children of bikers are often necessarily the children of drug addicts. No kid deserves a meth addict for a parent or a parent whose lifestyle is likely to lead to jail or a violent death. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 09, 2013","Oct 10, 2013","Oct 09, 2013",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/104522.Under_and_Alone

It reminded me of a book called ""Shot Through the Heart"" although I thought Bo Mason was a much better man than the father in the ""Shot Through the Heart"" book. I actually liked Bo Mason for much of the book, and felt sorry for him too. Oh, this book is a tragedy. A young girl named Else goes to live in town out west in the Dakotas. She is 18 and pretty. Bo Mason is handsome, young, shoots very well, plays baseball well and runs an illegal bar. They fall in love and get married and have 2 boys. Bo, true to his nature, is constantly chasing the next ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"", looking for that big break that is going to make him lots of money. He pulls his family all over the country chasing dreams. He is an impatient man and pretty rough on the kids when they are little. Much of his life he smuggles illegal booze. Sometimes they have money, sometimes they don't. He tries homesteading in Saskatchewan but when the crop fails he gives it up and starts running booze again. His wife is steady and faithful, she loves him and is never is demeaned by the petty criminal class they necessarily run with. The boys are, well I thought Chet was weak compared to his father, a good boy but so weak. My goodness, one raid and he gives up everything. So bizarre to my way of thinking. Then there is Bruce, the weakling little brother, prissy mama's boy. He makes it fine, but I never did like him, there was something cold about him. The father, of course, loves them both the way only a parent can love. Don't ask me why I keep defending Bo Mason.

She loves food and is willing to eat almost anything which endears her to other people who love food. And cooking for people stands in pretty well for a lack of being popular with boys. Everywhere Ruth lives the house is full of people who come to eat. I loved the part covering the early 70's and that book, Diet for a Small Planet.

The daughter that the author travels through India with accuses her mother of blithering. I concur! 600 pages of blithering on and on. She writes well, but just too much. She uses numerous adjectives to describe things, and she wants to describe near everything. She wants to tell us about India and it's mythology and holidays, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh religion, her Protestant background, her grandmother, mother, daughter Veronica (the one who lives in India and that she is traveling with), the 1960's, her marriages particularly her marriage to Veronica's father. I read parts of this book out loud to keep myself from falling asleep over it. One of my kids thought it was a book of poetry, my youngest said I should sue the author but I had to explain that I was reading it of my own free will and the author was dead. Here is an example of the excessive adjective use and going on and on that I am trying to explain to you,""Frogs, bringers of rain, bringers of life, worshiped by the Maya. But to me the monks's chanting- this humming roar, this roaring hum- sounds more like the wind, the rumble of rocks, the thunder, an avalanche, a volcano, fumaroles, geysers, waterfalls - like all, yet precisely like no one of these. The sound vibrates, pulses, contracts and expands in my mind as though I were part of the systole and diastole of the beginning of creation. It is a pulsing, flooding darkness of sound- thick, deep, heavy, old, warm, profound - a sound that combines with the split of the voice into the light, high, thin, sound of whistling, a sustained note from some unknown instrument, like the pipes of Pan must have sounded.""This is not the end of the description of the sound of the monk's chanting either. The above paragraph continues for another 1/2 page. All of this description brought on by her daughter's simple statement ""I love the sounds of the monks. They sound like bull-frogs.""It IS good writing (although I don't know who Pan is or what his pipes must have sounded like) but it is too much! 600 pages of this!Also, there are some dark suspicions over this author's life. She was accused by another daughter of child sexual abuse along with the author's 5th husband. The daughter she was traveling with in this book was extremely promiscuous by the age of 13 and was, from what I understand, a runaway by age 15.Regarding this; I have to wonder why any mother would detail for the world her daughter's promiscuity. It is a very sad thing for the girl and her family but made so much worse by publishing it for the world! And the mother's judgment, by her own statements, was iffy at best. She tells us about an incident where a boyfriend (her husband has left the family) tells her, in front of 13 year old Veronica, that she has a pubic hair in her teeth. Leila (the author) thinks this is hysterical. She tells of another incident where a boyfriend (maybe the same one?) tells her, again in Veronica's presence, that he wants ""her"" pointing to Veronica. The mother does not take this seriously. These incidents scream poor judgment in my opinion. The danger sirens should have been going off. Can we blame the 1960's for this? Even though personally I don't find India to be a source of spiritual inspiration I can see why Leila's daughter went in search of something outside of her family to find meaning in. The mother spends the time in India searching to reconnect with her daughter. I don't know if she succeeded in that as every story told as ""the truth"" is somewhat untrue, even if just because it is filtered through the mind and words of the teller. There is some sort of applicable quote in this book, regarding this,""She (Veronica) says that in the code of the Bodhisattva, the meaning of life is to bring happiness to others, that later, when meditation has made one understand that the world as one sees it is one's own fabrication, the purpose of living to be good for another also dissolves. ""One is naturally, appropriately good, with no motive for it."" ""My final feeling regarding this book is just a vast relief that I have finished reading it. Although I like the Bodhisattva thought above there was much mythology, psycho-babble and ""guru-gobble"" that I tried to read with comprehension through my boredom. Erudite but not, personally for me, edifying. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 06, 2013","Aug 15, 2013","Aug 06, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/769441.A_Journey_with_Elsa_Cloud

Socrates is a 12 year old boy who gets into a lot of trouble with his friends by blowing things up, breaking into houses and illegally riding a moped. His brother is the village lothario. Both boys are actually nice people. There is taxi driver who is a terrible person and another man who molests young boys of about Socrates age. There is a man who is not very high IQ although he has some nice talents with plants and animals. There are a bunch of nasty gossiping old women. There is an arcade owner who isn't so happy but things get better for him. There is the puppet master who is kind of strange, tells futures. There is an idiotic bully of a cop. There is a lecherous old man. And my favorite character is Koko the magpie.The story is related in a nice way I suppose, culturally rich (I think, I'm not Greek so a Greek person would have to tell me for sure if this story is culturally rich or not, it seemed so to me). I don't know who chose the cover but I really didn't like it. The kid on the cover, who I assume is supposed to be the representative of Socrates, looks neither Greek nor 12 years old. Poor cover choice in my opinion....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 29, 2013","Jul 31, 2013","Jul 29, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3138042-land-of-the-golden-apple

So the question is, why do I and so many Americans have a reverence for him like a hero Jesse James was a bank robber, a train robber and a murderer. So the question is, why do I and so many Americans have a reverence for him like a hero? Logically it doesn't make sense, but we Americans seem to love our wild west outlaws. Jesse James wasn't even really ""wild west"", he was from Missouri and began his gang activities as a member of the Confederate army guerrilla gang that his older brother belonged to. According to the author, ""He considered himself a Southern loyalist and guerrilla in a Civil War that never ended.""He must have possessed great personal charisma. Robert Ford became one of the most hated men in America for killing Jesse James. But how could you respect Robert Ford? He pretended to be Jesse James friend (actually it was more like a hero worship with a flip side of hate and jealousy) and then shot him when he was unarmed and his back was turned. You can't just shoot an unarmed man in his own living room, the wife and kids at home, in the back of the head when his back is turned.So why did Robert Ford do this? He may have had some fears for his own life but he was probably motivated by the reward (which he got only a fraction of) and even more by the idea of being a hero in the eyes of the American people.According to the author Robert Ford said, ""Do you know what I expected? Applause. I thought Jesse James was a Satan and a tyrant who was causing all this misery, and that I'd be the greatest man in America if I shot him. I thought they would congratulate me and I'd get my name in books. I was only twenty years old then. I couldn't see how it would look to people. I've been surprised by what's happened.""But even in the 1880's you weren't just allowed to gun down criminals without some sort of arresting procedure. As O.M. Spencer, the prosecuting attorney for Buchanan County, said, ""I don't care if Mr. James was the most desperate culprit in the entire world, that fact wouldn't justify you in killing the man except in self-defense or after demanding his surrender, and the law is very explicit on that point.""It remains to me an inexplicable puzzle; somehow Jesse James was loved by the people and by the media. It was actually the two law men who had encouraged the betrayal of Jesse who paid for Jesse's very expensive casket, anonymously. This was only revealed much later.Robert Ford eventually died by violence, having had some success in business in his life, but still a hated man.It is a question, why did Jesse James give Robert Ford a new gun as a present right before the killing, why did Jesse take off his guns and lay them down and then get up on a chair to dust a picture? ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 28, 2013","Jun 30, 2013","Jun 28, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/320730.The_Assassination_of_Jesse_James_by_the_Coward_Robert_Ford

We are in a state of Nature, Sir.....The distinction between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.""That quote actually brought tears to my eyes.Now here is where the liberty or death quote comes from, Patrick Henry again,""Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!I know not what course others may take; but as for me....give me liberty or give me death!Of course the British didn't have the colonies in slavery or chains, they were quite reasonable to the colonies actually. And yes, life is dear and peace is sweet. But these fiery words certainly apply when a country is at war fighting those who destroy liberty. Thomas Jefferson had the gift of writing, Patrick Henry had the gift of speech. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2013","Jun 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/506156.Thomas_Jefferson

On the other hand there was lot that I found I could and did believe possible if unusual.My favorite parts of the book are the ones about Adam himself, after he is born. My absolute favorite scene was the Christmas battery gift scene. As the mother of s special needs child myself I could very much relate to that and I laughed and cried as I watched Adam open that gift and what his reaction to it was. There is so much grace in our special needs children and those of us who have these children have received an extra blessing (and challenge) in being their parents. So Martha Beck's love for her son resonated with me very strongly. On the other hand, why does she use the word ""retard"" or ""retarded"" so often. Even as she knows that part of her fear about having Adam was her own fear of being an idiot, and even as she explains all of Adam's gifts, she keeps saying ""retard"". That was disturbing but maybe so much changed in the time between Adam's birth and my son's birth 10 years later that I can't relate. The word is, at the least, politically incorrect.Another thing that bothered me was her near constant crying and her starvation of herself. She probably couldn't help being as sick as she was, but she kept refusing to ask for help until she was near dead. She was lucky the angels were around. And her husband, she is lucky to have him as well. And Adam.

A child is kidnapped in a small town in Minnesota, a place that is supposed to be safe. Then an investigator who is investigating the kidnapping is brutally beaten. The perpetrator is run down and caught, but the evidence against him is being systematically discredited by his brilliant lawyer. This lawyer is a former love interest of the main character, Prosecutor Ellen North. Ellen is fighting as hard as she can for justice but she has a lot stacked against her. She has some people in her corner as well, particularly a true crime writer who keeps running his thumb over Ellen's bottom lip. Can she trust this man? Isn't he just an opportunistic parasite feeding off the misery of others and getting rich off their horrible stories?So, this bad guy I mentioned before, the one who is run down after the beating of the investigator, gets put in jail but keeping him there is getting hard to do as bad things keep happening even while he is in jail. Who is the accomplice? It seems like the evil is everywhere!As the reader I was pretty sure I knew who the accomplice was and I was right.

He seems like a nice guy until circumstances converge to make him depressed and unemployed. Then the Shah gets deposed and the Ayatollah takes over. Mr. Mamoody becomes politically involved in Iran and reconnected to his family in an intense way. He wants to see the family again and introduce his wife and 5 year old daughter so arranges a 2 week vacation. Uh huh.

But it really did surprise and shock me. The part of the book that chronicles a (fictional) Practice House, which is where the baby and house mother live and the students who are practicing to be mothers have their practicals, is really really interesting.I also learned that there was a place called the ""Custodial Asylum for Unteachable Idiots""! That was in NY in the mid 1880's. You can google it. The idea was good loving care for the kids, but not education, because an uneducated idiot was a happy idiot. Wow!Then there was all the interesting stuff about Disney studios in the time of the making of Mary Poppins and then Jungle Book after Mr. Disney's death. Now I didn't research all of that to see what was true but it sounded pretty likely. The 1960's were also well done.So what didn't I like? The story itself. Henry and his emotions, Mary Jane and her emotions, Martha and her emotions, etc. I'm not saying it couldn't be that way, I just didn't enjoy reading it. As an adopted child myself (although not a practice baby) I found Henry and Peace to be ungrateful and troubled. At least they could have been grateful for all that they did have. Neither was unloved.

It wasn't smooth sailing; they had crazy delays, too many committees and bosses, storms knocking work down, and heavy heavy non-stop rain for days before the opening day. But they did it, they created this magical place of beauty and cleanliness with clean bathrooms, a good police force and hospital, a place that payed it workers and gave them clean safe living accommodations. Also, I learned that the Pledge of Allegiance was created for schoolchildren to say on the dedication of the fair, that the Ferris Wheel was created for the World's Fair, that the use of AC rather than DC to light the fair changed the future of electricity in this country. Also that snake charmer song was created on the spot by Sol Bloom for a piano player to make music for the belly dancers to dance to. All of this was in contrast to a terrible prolific serial killer doing his heart-breaking work a short distance away from the fair. He had a lot of aliases and I don't feel like giving him the dignity of even writing his name. ""Half a century later, in his path-breaking book The Mask of Sanity, Dr. Hervey Cleckley described the prototypical psychopath as ""a subtly constructed reflex machine which can mimic the human personality perfectly.....So perfect is his reproduction of a whole and normal man that no one who examines him in a clinical setting can point out in scientific or objective terms why, or how, he is not real."" Isn't that creepy?! This murderer fit the description.

Not much happens in the way of action; this is more an examination of types of people, their motives, actions and reactions. What are their resources, their backgrounds, their intelligence, education, financial standing, state of marriage. What kind of a person commits a murder? What drives a person to such an action? Why are certain people seducers and philanderers? Or lazy or unkind or timid? Strangely, considering the pace and lack of action, the book is not boring. It is rather a little multifaceted puzzle; one keeps turning it over and over, examining it as the inspector does. The story is set against the inspector's health. He tells us something about his fever or his breathing, then he tells us something about the case. This works but I have no idea why. The sad condition of the marriages in the book are in contrast to the inspector's own marriage where his wife fusses over him, cooks for him, advises him and generally shows her husband a lot of love and works hard for his welfare. Reminded me a bit of Inspector Wallander in Sweden, if Wallander had a wife who loved and spoiled him.

I enjoyed this one the most of any of the Jodi Picoult books that I have read. First of all, it was a book about grown people, no adolescent drama this. No one was setting fires or cutting themselves. Instead we have a beautifully drawn romance and marriage. Both of the main characters, Cassie and Alex, were believable and understandable. The places and cultures that are brought in seem very real, Tanzania Africa, the Lakota reservation in South Dakota, the bayou in cajun country Louisiana, and Hollywood CA. The problem between this couple, Alex and Cassie, deeply in love, is who they are and their inability to be something else. Alex was physically and emotionally abused as a child with no one to care for him. He retreats into a fantasy world where he creates personas of who he would rather be. This gives him great success in Hollywood, he is a great actor but there isn't much real Alex that is not tied up in pain and anger. Cassie is the daughter of an alcoholic mother and she takes care her mother rather than the other way around. When Cassie and Alex meet they both tap into the best parts of themselves and their love in genuine. But Alex can't control his rage and beats Cassie.

Judy is a kindergarten teacher at the Waldorf school and Zach is a 16 year old student at the school. Judy caught her father in the bedroom with their young housekeeper when she was 10 years old. At this time her mother was in a mental institution and Judy was in love with the housekeeper's teenage brother. The brother was a nice guy and although probably aware of Judy's feelings did not take advantage of her. Nevertheless, Judy was quite a cracked person, you won't know how cracked until near the end. Zach was a kind of this ideal teenage boy; smart, kind, hard-working, in good with his family, and in great physical condition. He had been raised in a yoga/Waldorf environment and lived it quite well and willingly. But he also very strongly suspects that his mother had an affair with one of her yoga students. Backgrounds, hormones and proximity ignite; soon Judy and Zach are involved in an intense sexual relationship. People start suspecting, Zack starts to resent Judy and mostly wants out of the relationship, Judy just gets more cracked. Zack's mother is pregnant and her midwife, in an attempt to promote safe sex, has supplied Zack with condoms. She is quite angry when she finds out who Zack is using the condoms with. As I said, I found this to be a better than average book about this subject because it acknowledges that adultery can inflict damage on the children whose parents are involved in it, and as a novel it is creepy, has a ton of great atmosphere. It also brings to one's thoughts the prosecuted cases of rape against female teachers and teenage male students. And the current practice of giving condoms to teenagers and trying to teach them safe sex vs the vows of chastity that some religions promote.

So to start, I don't follow true crime or watch many movies so I had never heard of this case nor had I watched the movies that had been made about this case. So it was all new to me which it made more interesting than it would have been otherwise.A man and a woman, both married to other people, are having an affair. All too common. But in this case the wife wants to ""get rid"" (she didn't want to use the word ""kill"" as she said, ""It sounds so cruel, I don't like to use it."") of her husband and talks the man into helping her kill her husband. There is a large insurance policy that the wife has taken out on the husband. They wait until he is asleep, hit him repeatedly in the head with a sash weight, try to chloroform him, and then choke him to death with picture wire around his neck. That is not the funny part. Albert Snyder lost his life here. It particularly bothered me that traces of his tears were on his face. The poor man. He may not have been an ideal husband or father, but to lose his life on the basis of childish whimsy and greed on the part of his wife and her lover. Really sad.The funny part is that these people are like caricatures. It is hard to believe that they were so bereft of compassion, so selfish, so lacking awareness of themselves except as hungry, greedy, I want it now bodies, demanding constant satiation. But even harder to believe is the dramatics. Look at the pictures of Ruth Snyder, she is always posing, even after she has been sentenced to death. She should have been an actress. The only real emotion she seemed to show was love of her child and even that could not stand up to her hunger and greed. Listen to this letter she writes to her lover Judd Grey, the day before they are to kill her husband:""My own lover boy--Gee, but I'm happy. Oh, ain't I happy. Tomorrow's my lucky day. I'm so very happy, dear, I can't sit still enough to write what I'm thinking of.....Wouldn't be a bad idea if I had me a haircut--it's beginning to luka-lika da wop. Wassa a guda writin--huh? All I keep thinking of is U....you, you darn little cuss. I could eatcha all up. .....Ah yes hon, let's get good and ""plastered""; ain't that a nice word? .....All my love, your Momie""I expected that any minute she would start kicking her heels, shaking her bosom and singing ""Easy Street"". And ""Momie""? Mommy? Judd himself is what they used to call a mama's boy, which makes that ""Momie"" nickname a little twisted. Judd obviously does not want to ""behave himself"" and he doesn't, but once caught he is an ashamed little boy who confesses all and leaves his punishment in the hands of the authorities, takes it bravely and thinks he deserves it.The lawyers are as much caricatures as the principles. You would have to read the courtroom scenes to see how over the top the lawyers were. Hair pulling, eye popping, gasping, each sentence more exaggerated and ludicrous than the last, like this said about Judd Gray,""driven into this tragedy by a force not his own, dominated by a will not his own, commanded by a brain not his own...He was in the web; he was hemmed in the abyss; he was dominated; he was commanded; he was driven...""

This author is constantly killing her characters and her characters are constantly killing the trees of the Pacific Northwest. Death everywhere. She kills off the kids and adults by accidents and illnesses, she even makes one of her characters a serial murderer. She also wrote two of the most disturbing violent death scenes I have ever read. One of those scenes actually gave me nightmares. It is how mundane she writes these scenes and how unimportant. Very disturbing, as I said. This attitude, that nothing human over time matters, is just depressing. Here is a quote from near the end of the book,""How was it possible to endure the losses one accumulated just by living? Sentiment based on fact was the most grievous sort, she thought, for the only escape from it was to shrug off the fact -- that babies died, say, or that people lost lands they loved, that youth aged, love faded, everybody ended in graves, and nothing would ever again be the same. She pounded herself to tears with these melancholy truths, as if to ensure that she would not betray herself by forgetting them -- which, however, she knew full well that she would, as all other grown persons have done, to their manifestly improved mental balance.""See what I mean? Beautifully phrased, communicates strongly, but so depressing. The book is 397 pages long but they are packed so densely that it takes a long time to read. The author is a fine writer, she has a singular way of writing. Another quote that I think demonstrates this author's unique voice.""Pearl's heart went out to her.

Also truth, heroism, bravery and how different people fight against or try to slide their way through the difficulties of this life. This is probably the most serious book by Mr. Irving that I have read so far.Homer Wells is an orphan, Dr. Larch runs the orphanage. Dr. Larch delivers women, cares for orphans and finds homes for the orphans to be adopted into. This is what he does legally. What Dr. Larch does illegally is perform abortions. He teaches Homer to deliver babies and perform abortions as well. But Homer is uncomfortable with the abortions and refuses to perform them because the fetus is living and has a soul. Dr. Larch provides a service to women who, for many varied reasons, need an abortion. He firmly believes in what he does; that both delivering a baby and aborting an unwanted baby are G-d's work. Dr. Larch, and Homer after him both believe in being of use. This is their ethic and framework for their lives.What happens when idealistic Homer finds himself having to face his own hypocrisy, something that pretty much happens to all adults somewhere along the line. How does Homer resolve his needs, his rationale and his ethics?So you see it is serious subject matter. It does have its ""Irvingisms"" which anyone familiar with John Irving books will recognize, but they don't detract or distract too much here. Also, it is pretty long, 587 pages, and it has some boring and some depressing stretches. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 15, 2013","Jan 22, 2013","Jan 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4687.The_Cider_House_Rules

Gucci did well when it was the founder Guccio Gucci and his sons. His son Aldo put the business on the international level with stores in Italy, the U.S. and Asia and a variety of products besides the Gucci hand bags and loafers. When the grandsons took over the whole thing began to fall apart; there were too many bosses, a lot of fighting in the family, too many products being sold. They were spread too thin and were not cohesive with each other. As happens with businesses eventually, sales began to drop as Gucci was no longer the hottest new fashion. Then there were all the buy out threats which could not be held off forever. The saddest of the story is the murder of Maurizio Gucci. His father told him not to marry Patrizia and he should have listened. Maurizio's story was kind of sad all along, he had such dreams for Gucci but he was disaffected from the rest of the family and his dreams were not realized. There was too much money in this family for their own good and it destroyed them. As a book, this is interesting from the opening with the murder of Maurizio and through the history of the family until we again get to the point of the murder of Maurizio. After that I found the reading tedious; too many complex business deals and ridiculous fashions like the Gucci g-string. I looked up Gucci on line and thought their product line was incredibly ugly. The Gucci fashion designer of today doesn't look like she is wearing Gucci. I looked up Ferragamo and their fashions were much better looking. Not that I buy fashion but it is always fun to look. (I have Ferragamo boots but I bought them 2nd hand for $30, lucky me!)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 21, 2012","Dec 21, 2012","Dec 21, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1906659.The_House_of_Gucci

But I got tired of it about 3/4's of the way through. Partly I started to dislike it because of the continuous cursing of our main character Maureen and her friends and family. That language does sound more charming in a Scottish voice, such as, ""Fuck, aye."" or uniquely different than American bad language such as""...but she couldn't be arsed holding more than one thought in her head today..."" But the book gives us a pretty continual diet of it starting on page 8 when Leslie, Maureen's friend, says, ""Get us a fucking waitress"" and ending on the last line of the book when Leslie says, ""Tell them to fuck off"". So there was that aspect. Then there is all the drinking, lots and lots of whiskey going down. Add in mental illness, rape, incest and violence. I started to feel sorry for Denise Mina thinking she must have had a very hard life; she writes really really realistically about this stuff, particularly about growing up with an alcoholic parent. But maybe she just did her research well. The mystery itself was reasonably good; I had worked it out but it wasn't too obvious. The interplay between the characters was also well done, most of the time; as soon as I said that I thought of times when I didn't think the conversations and actions between characters was realistic. Maureen was a difficult character to like, an extremely adversarial character. At some points I really sympathized with the police, well sometimes not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 09, 2012","Dec 12, 2012","Dec 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/94177.Garnethill

So to make a long  manageable let me say I really, really liked this book. It reads like fiction, everything going on was so intense.We are barely, hardly out of the Civil War, some troops are still fighting, but officially the war has ended and the people of Washington are ecstatic; John Wilkes Booth is devastated. He believes he should have been able to prevent it somehow. He and some friends had been plotting to kidnap the President earlier but this did not work out. Now with the war lost, John Wilkes Booth decides to kill President Lincoln, which sadly for both of them, he does. He convinces two friends to also commit assassinations of Vice-President Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State William H. Seward, and a third friend to hold the get-away horse for Mr. Seward's assassin. The assassin for the vice-president finds himself unable to commit the murder. The assassin for the Secretary of State botches the job, wounding a number of people but is not successful in the killing. The guy holding the horse hears all the screaming and decides not to stick around and leaves the would be assassin to figure things out for himself. JWB shoots the President in the theatre, jumps over the balcony and breaks his leg. He still manages to get away, meets up with the guy who left the scene of the botched assassination, and .... then what? JWB doesn't seem to have adequately planned that part. He was just going to get to Virginia and keep going south, expecting southern hospitality and praise all the way. Instead he finds all doors are closed, no one wants to be caught giving aid to the killer of the President!I don't know if the author has his sympathies with the south but he certainly has no liking for betrayers and cowards. JWB is neither of those; he is a southern gentleman, a famous actor and a homegrown hot-headed terrorist trying to save his homeland (the south). The country had barely taken a breath from all the killing in the war, JWB just kind of continued on with the war. He expected to be lauded once he got to the south. But the war was really over, and he killed the President! Shocking and horrible, truly terrible, such a horrible thing. But as I read I couldn't help but have some sympathy for JWB as well.The people of Washington and the War Dept went nuts after the killing. It was mob violence and that ghoulish behavior of wanting to collect souvenirs of tragedy on the part of the people; and a nightmare of ""Homeland Security"" by the government.JWB himself was shot in a barn just over the border in Virginia 12 days after he shot the President and started running.A sad situation all around, but a great book.The Ford Theatre has been completely restored to look just as it did the night Lincoln was shot; it is a very popular museum. As the author says, ""The restoration was intended as a tribute to Abraham Lincoln, but Ford's has also, inevitably, become a memorial to his assassin."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 25, 2012","Nov 30, 2012","Nov 25, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/146274.Manhunt

Will grows up in North Carolina, maybe a week's ride from the Cherokee nation, an orphan living with aunt and uncle. At 12 they contract him out to work at an outpost in the Cherokee Nation. They give him a horse, a key to the outpost, a little food and money. Will is frightened as you may imagine but he is quite capable; well-read, a decent gambler, a boy with his wits about him. He is taken under the wing of an older Indian man who adopts him as part of his clan. Will also falls in love before he even reaches the outpost when his horse gets stolen by an Indian named Featherstone and he goes to retrieve it. The girl is there on the property with his horse and Featherstone. Will remains in love with this girl, Claire, for the rest of his life. They have a history that you will have to read the book to understand.The book is also about the Indians who lived on these lands, how most of them lost the lands and were gathered together and made to walk west 1,000 miles or so to a new Indian territory. President Jackson is ruthless in his determination to rid all the land east of the Mississipi of Indians. In the book Will and his Indian father Bear are successful in buying up land and holding on to it for Bear's people. This is correlated in real life. We also are witness to the destruction of environment; the hunting out of all the animals for their skins, the felling of huge forests of old hardwood. Both of these things are pretty hard to read about, disturbing. And it is interesting to read about the Indians in the South, I never really considered them in relation to the Civil War.

That piece of writing was so bitter, sour, pitiful (as in pity poor me, I've been twisted by my parents and my upbringing, I can't get my mother's voice out of my head). Why is that piece of writing in this book? Certainly it can't be something he aired on the radio. The only person who needed to read that was the author's therapist. Then there is the chapter ""revival"" which was so boring I had to skim it. I think that chapter was meant to put religion, which is a very large part of the book, in a final perspective.

Odd Thomas is a great character and I loved reading how he went about getting through each dangerous situation. He is, I don't know, like a boy everyone would like to be or know. The conversations that Odd has with the sheriff were great, in fact Odd's most potent weapon is his ability to talk himself out of most situations. He doesn't make too many mistakes, just enough to make us relate to him. Odd Thomas is a fine fictional hero for our times. Also, having read an early Dean Koontz just a few days ago, it is abundantly evident that he has become a much better writer over the years. He wasn't a poor writer to begin with but his ability to create a story of pathos that is taut and never boring is in the stratosphere compared to before. Here are a couple of quotes I really liked,""I would not be surprised, however, if Heaven proved to be a cozy kitchen, where delicious treats appeared in the oven and in the refrigerator whenever you wanted them, and where the cupboards were full of good books.""""In Vegas, he was two years older than he claimed to be in his California incarnation, but perhaps a Las Vegas lifestyle aged a person prematurely.""""With narrow faces, bared fangs, and radiant-eyed intensity, these current six coyotes confronting Annamaria and me did not have what it took to be featured in a Purina Puppy Chow commercial. They looked like fascist jihadists in fur.""""Not immediately able to proceed, I stood there, inexpressibly grateful that my life, for all its terrors, is so filled with moments of grace.""Also, I have read other people's opinions of this book and can totally see what they mean about how it is inconclusive and a set up for another book but that was not really a concern for me. What I didn't understand is why those triggers were not dropped at sea where they would not be found again. And maybe that is a set up for another book?

Decades before the US civil war, the American diplomat found himself in Spain wandering around a forgotten gem and set about writing what became, in effect, its first promotional tourist brochure. Of course Mr Irving did much greater justice to the edifice than the Inquisition could hope to achieve""The ""inquisition"" quoted above is not THE INQUISITION. But in thinking about Alhambra certainly The Spanish Inquisition is the first thing that comes to my mind. The edict expelling the Jews from Spain was called The Alhambra Decree.""The Alhambra Decree (also known as the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492 by the joint Catholic Monarchs of Spain (Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon) ordering the expulsion of Jews from the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (not from the Kingdom of Navarre) and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year.[1]""Despite the romantic view that Mr. Irving takes of The Alhambra, Granada and of Spain in general, The Spanish Inquisition was uppermost in my mind while I read the book.The Alhambra was originally built by the Muslims (Moors) who had control of Spain at that time, then along came the Christians who made war on, murdered, conquered and expelled the ruling Moors. The Alhambra then belonged to the Christians and King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella lived there for a time. They were the ones who started the Inquisition which was set on ferreting out any false converts to Christianity.So, on to the book itself. It is a mix of W. Irving's travelogue from 1829 when he actually lived in the Alhambra for a number of months; and legends and tales of the Alhambra and the area that he relates to us. Personally I preferred the legends as I could just enjoy them and not have to constantly think about the reality of all the deaths involved in the wars between the Moors and the Christians and the murders of the Inquisition. Tales of enchanted Moorish armies and hidden caches of Moorish treasure were a great deal more pleasant for me to read.Here is a quote from the book that comes from a tale told to Mr. Irving, related in this  as it stuck in my mind, as certainly a different point of view of ""The Grand Inquisitor"" than I hold.""At last, in the rear of the army, between two black Moorish horsemen, rode the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, on a mule as white as snow. Tio Nicolas wondered to see him in such company, for the Inquisitor was famous for his hatred of Moors and indeed of all kinds of infidels, Jews and heretics, and used to hunt them out with fire and scourge. However, Tio Nicolas felt himself safe, now that there was a priest of such sanctity at hand.""Another quote, just a taste of Mr. Irving's romantic view of Spain,""Among no people are relations between kindred more cordial or between superior and dependent more frank and genial; in these respects there still remains in the provincial life of Spain much of the vaunted simplicity of the olden time.""Personally I think every age and place vaunts the ""simplicity of the olden time"", and actually it was never simple.The book is interesting as a travelogue, and the legends are often sly and amusing. Also, the engravings give a good insight to all that he relates....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 27, 2012","Oct 27, 2012","Oct 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/542977.Tales_of_the_Alhambra

Actually I I had this book for a long time on my TBR shelves but I finally read it during Plum's What to Read in Oct. which was folk and fairy tales. Actually I wasn't sure if the Arthur legends had any basis in reality so I googled it and found that historians don't know either; they can only tell you about how long the legend has been around and guess at its origins. Fascinating really as the legend is so popular and ubiquitous.So as to the book itself: Not bad. I did get sick of certain words like ""otherwordly"" and phrases such as ""Oh, my love"". Probably the best writing in the book had to do with that witch Morgan and, even creepier, her son Mordred. That dream that the king has toward the end of the book rivals Neal Gaiman's stories. Now why Arthur and Guenevere were so completely DENSE when it came to recognizing evil is a mystery. The idea must be that good and innocence only see good in others, don't anticipate jealousy, hatred, twistedness and evil intentions. Well, their mistake! Now you would think that Merlin, with all his second sight and everything, would have been able to do a better job of protecting Arthur and his family, but it is all kind of explained by Merlin's wrong in helping Uther with Queen Igraine. That might cloud anyone's vision.Also, the druid religion kind of gets whitewashed until we deal with Malgaunt's druid and that makes it seem like just one evil druid. Oh, not so. Druid's practiced human sacrifice. But then every religion in this book is enough to make a person feel ill. Even the Goddess religion of love when you think about how that connected with the Druid religion, at least per this book, is another incarnation of evil. I've never researched Goddess religion. Also not sure about the timeline with this book. ""Arthur"" is first mentioned in the 600's but the legend of King Arthur starts about 400 years later. Nobody is sure so the whole story can be made up and romanticized.And so the legend of King Arthur lives on.This book is the first in a series. Undoubtedly Morgan and Mordred are going to show up again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 18, 2012","Oct 18, 2012","Oct 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56351.Guenevere_Queen_of_the_Summer_Country

It is also a long philosophical treatise on the properties, characteristics and origins of evil. We start the book when The Wicked Witch of the West is in utero, near to being born. Her parents (well her paternity is under question) are a minister and a disaffected woman from a rich and politically powerful family. And so Elphaba, our witch, is born; green and with teeth like a shark. Her first act in life is to bite off the finger of the midwife. Her mother is so dissolute, always on drugs, lax sexual mores. Well no one in this book is ""normal"". But when Elphaba grows up and goes to college she is quite likeable; very intelligent and outspoken. Sadly this is the high point of her life, she is an activist, a righteous woman but it all ends up going terribly wrong. When an act of terrorism that she is supposed to commit ends with her lover being killed her mental condition deteriorates terribly. She is in a secluded environment for a number of years and when she emerges she decides she must make her apologies to the wife of her lover. She wants forgiveness. I haven't even mentioned her sister, the one who is crushed under Dorothy's house. There are a lot of family emotions, father loved sister better, gave her those gorgeous magical shoes that Glinda (the ""good"" witch) gives to Dorothy. The author uses the Oz story to discuss evil, as in:""This was too much like her childhood, discussions with her father and Nessarose about where evil begins. As if one could ever know!""""Evil isn't a thing, it's not a person, it's an attribute like beauty...""""It a power, like wind...""It's an infection...""It's metaphysical, essentially the corruptibility of creation--""""Blame it on the Unnamed God, then."" ...""It's not of air and eternity, evil isn't; it's of earth; it's physical, a disjointedness between our bodies and our souls....""""Evil is moral at its heart --- the selection of vice over virtue...""The witch doesn't like children much either. She thinks this""Such silly things, children -- and so embarrassing -- because they keep changing themselves out of shame, out of need to be loved or something.""I think that is heartbreaking statement. So Wicked, I think it was essentially a morality play done like a college group of students trying to puzzle things out.

Truthfully I appreciated that I could keep some distance. I think the reason for this is that we are not immediately plunged into the war, we are instead in a home in a village in France where Stephan, a young Englishman in France for business, and Isabelle, the wife of the boss and mistress of the home in which he is staying, become involved in an intense adulterous relationship. I'm always a bit put off by that kind of thing so I was given some breathing space in the book and an easing into the war scenes. The book is always interesting, often heartbreaking. There are some strong parallels between what happens in the war years and what happens 60 years later when Stephan's granddaughter starts looking into her grandfather's life and experiences. Truly, fictional character that she was, I still wanted to hug her and thank her for caring, for looking into things, for carrying on. It is a powerful story of love, of friendship and of humanity.

Obviously I don't listen to much classical music although I like the idea of becoming familiar with these works. So who was Chopin? He was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1810 to loving parents, father a French peasant (although by the time Chopin was born that was not generally known) and mother a Polish gentlewoman. Poland was regularly in political upheaval but Frederick Chopin had a mostly happy childhood, his father taught French at the lyceum to the sons of Polish gentry, he had 3 sisters to whom he was close, he had many friends and he showed musical promise by the time he was 6 years old. He composed a Polonaise in G minor at the age of 8 and become a Warsaw celebrity being invited to play in the drawing rooms of society hostesses and the palaces of the the Polish nobility. He gave his first public concert shortly after his 8th birthday. The family was exposed to tuberculosis, common then and incurable; his youngest sister Emily died from it at age 14. Chopin suffered ill health because of it, he was frail, but he lived into his late 30's before it killed him. In his personality he was reserved, loyal, indecisive, temperamental, creative, nervous, passionate about music and, just my opinion, somewhat effeminate. In this book there are some letters which are controversial, the author and others believe they are letters that he wrote to Countess Delphina Potocka, the Chopin Society believes them to be forgeries. After reading the book I am of the opinion that they are probably forgeries. They do not fit with his personality as otherwise characterized. In my opinion.But I am also of the opinion that although I can know some basics facts of his life I cannot even come close to a rudimentary understanding of who he was without listening to his music. His music was how he expressed his inner self. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 19, 2012","Sep 19, 2012","Sep 19, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2699825-nocturne

Truthfully it wasn't always exciting to read. Reading about driving across the country probably has a lot in common with driving across the country; stretches of boredom; something to break boredom (in the case of this book that would mainly be the history of roads, driving and cross country trips in America starting with Lewis and Clark.) On the other hand, I could really relate. I love road trips myself; that anticipation and excitement to get going, the willingness to see what this trip will bring, how it will differ from plans and expectations, the happiness of sharing this with your children, the appreciation of the beauty of our country and our freedom to travel in it. Mr. Sullivan seemed kind of uptight at the beginning of the book, nervous, his jokes fell a little flat and sounded more like self-criticism than anything else. But he loosens up as he talks about history and he seems like a really nice guy when he talks about his family. His love of family and country come through loud and clear. I appreciated that he did a lot of research to write this book, I think he really wanted to teach his readers and I was interested in learning.Some of his philosophical thoughts near the end of the book:""On this bridge, in this daredevil-like moment of multilane over-the-river traffic, I can see that the modern American road is a common space where people share nothing. It is the thing that, while separating us, we all have in common""""When I wonder about the future of the interstates, of these things that cross and bind and rush-hour America in to a stupor of convenience and aggravation, and when I think of what seems so unlikely to change, I think again of how quickly things came to be--of the generations of my parents who saw the birth of the interstates, of the generation of their parents, who saw the birth of the car, of the generation of their parents, who rode the first railroads.""

There is no question that this book is written by someone who is very well educated and writes beautifully. The language was often dialect which got easier to read but which I often did not understand fully. Then there were the archaic words, the Latin words, the Erse words, the French words. I struggled to make sense of what he was saying and I was often looking things up on line. But I wasn't going to make a great study of it and that left me with an incomplete understanding.The subject matter was disagreeable in some ways; lots of homosexual man/boy relationships. I really, really did not want to hear it. Historical homosexuality also was not an area of interest to me, the Spartans in particular. The book is heavily about male homosexuality, whether between boys who are best friends or boys and men. It is also about war, the Easter uprising in particular, and Ireland's fractured relationship with the British. This actually was of interest to me but the story was so wrapped up in the other that it was hard to take one and leave the other.I did like a few of the characters; Jim and Gordie's father was my favorite. I also liked Doyler's mother. A few people asked me why I was reading this book if I disliked it. It is a good question and I can only say that I think it was because the author's intelligence was challenging and intriguing to me. There was beauty in his language and I wanted to experience that.

Bethany's illness was really hard to read about, it seemed like demon possession to me and I don't even know if there are such things as demons. Since I was having trouble with her condition I googled the symptoms and think she would fit the def of catatonic schizophrenia.

Mostly eating bananas and drinking water he loses a lot of weight, as you might imagine. He also re-establishes his relationship with his next door neighbor Norma, a woman he has neglected for most of her life even though he is aware that she loves him. What I didn't understand is why at the end of the book he starts eating junk food again and gives away or loses all his biking gear. This was disturbing to me, but maybe it just meant that his quest was done and he was going to live a ""normal"" life now, not alcoholic and guilt driven, but not spartan either.

Augusten is far from ""ordinary"" long before he joins the evil psychiatrist's wacko family. As a child he is boiling his spare change, polishing his jewelry, obsessively combing his hair (must be perfect!), and wrapping his dog in decorative aluminum foil. This is an ordinary boy??!! I think not. And having a mother who is starring in her own drama and a father who is an alcoholic does not explain all, no way. Augusten is also gay and mostly refuses to go to school. The only way he is ordinary is in that he trusts his parents, especially his mother, and goes along with whatever they are doing. He spends a lot of time with his mother in Dr. Finch's office and then is left with Dr. Finch's family while mother goes off to deal with herself. Mother is, of course, being well drugged by Dr. Finch. So is Augusten for that matter, along with everyone who lives in that house. So Augusten, despite his objections, is left, at 13 years old, to live with the doctor's family. They are disgusting and despicable. Augusten finds himself fitting in quite nicely, especially once he starts on his ""love affair"" with a 33 year old pedophile also living at Dr. Finch's. Augusten thinks he has won the lottery sex-wise, but he hates being told how much he is loved and how much he means to this guy, because on some level he does understand that he is being taken advantage of. Well maybe this is ordinary in a pedophile/child relationship, I don't know. I guess I shouldn't be blaming a 13 year old, he was pretty much stuck in the situation, but wow, he doesn't make himself a very sympathetic character here. This is a book about living without rules, and it is awful. Do psychiatrists ever wonder why their profession has a tarnished reputation and why a lot of people distrust psychiatrists? Points in this book's favor: it is hard to put down, the writing is good and the subject fascinating despite how ugly it is. Augusten also has a sense of humor, sees the irony in things and so makes the reader laugh. He also gives credit for the good that any of his characters do.The more I think about this book the more I question its veracity. I very much wonder why the portions of the book that deal with pedophilia sound more like they are written from the point of view of a pedophile, rather than that of a child.

ADHD almost certainly. He couldn't complete things, he jumped from one thing to another, his attention was all over the place --- unless he entered the zone, like he did when playing exceptional basketball. So Harry is always looking that zone again, for his teenage success. That ADHD behavior, that search for the zone is where he stays, only without the success. He also seemed to suffer some delusional thinking, beyond that magical thinking that children have. He was vastly immature, but that didn't explain it all. In some ways he wanted to do the right thing but he was so impatient and so self-centered that he would get in a snit and off he would go, either leaving physically or being unkind or both. His one area of success as an adult was with 2 year old Nelson (except for running off for 2 months), but when he was with Nelson his behavior became patient and mature, he wasn't a bad father.Now is wife Janice is a different story although she is also immature, child-like. She has very low self-esteem and is an alcoholic. She relies on other people, most of all her husband. Her family gets her through the first time he leaves, but the second time they are too late and tragedy happens. Her strength disappears when her husband walks out the door and she turns to alcohol. Why her husband couldn't see her weakness (he actually did know she was an alcoholic but not what that meant in consequences) and realize that he had to take care of her like a child - well I guess he was too much of strutting teenager (although he was 24) to see it. He just thought she was ""dumb"".This book reminded me of John Irving's writing, although I don't know if anyone else would think that.

Obviously something is wrong with the man, probably his own rotten childhood. He is also quite a character, keeping a movie camera in the car so he can film things like car accidents and tornadoes. Monica develops a fascination with death when a young girl in her community dies. Then she becomes friends with the girl whose father owns the mortuary and the two of them do things like play in the coffins. But something is wrong with Monica too, despite how funny she is and how successful she is. Something is wrong with all of her siblings as well. Her Mom is weirdly self-absorbed; first in the image of the family and later with her boyfriend. She ignores anything that does not fit the image and the life she wants to have. Basically she deserts Monica when she is in her teens leaving her living alone in the house with no money for food and other necessities. All around it is bad, but then it gets worse when her older sister begins remembering childhood sexual abuse. It would almost sound fanciful except I have seen this. An adult who is likely guilty of pedophilia and incest, children who accuse him but by then they are their own messed up selves and who believes these young adults who are addicts, who habitually lie, who can be violent, who are in the spotlight of the police and under the care of psychiatrists? Mr. Pedophilia looks like an upstanding citizen. Before you know it the next generation of little children are under scrutiny of CPS as likely victims of sexual abuse by guess who? The previous victim of the pedophile. And the strangest thing? The family denies and protects the pedophile. If I didn't see this denial with my own eyes I simply wouldn't believe it. Try talking to a family in denial and you will get silent disapproval as if you are the one doing wrong by daring to accuse or even ask questions about this person. And everyone continues to love this person because he is the father, grandfather, brother or whatever. It is so strange, but knowing this made Monica's story something that made sense to me. I wish it didn't make sense to me. A very good and terrible read. btw, just like most memoirs there are parts that do not ring true.

He may be right about a lot (maybe most or possibly even all) of what he writes about the Right, but fair and balanced it is not. He praises Clinton throughout the book and never mentions that Clinton himself was a liar. I am not actually at all convinced that one can be a politician and not be a liar. One has to do a certain amount of saying and doing what will please one's supporters. I myself am a moderate Democrat living in a houseful of men who are ""Right"". Avoiding discussions of politics is a good idea. What we all agree on in my house is Israel's right to exist and policies and people that protect and support Israel. Al Franken agrees with this also. He disagrees with aligning ourselves with the religious Christian Right. I agree with his disagreement on this. Al Franken is an entertainer first, jokes are his stock in trade. So he jokes throughout this serious book; the subject matter is serious no matter how many jokes are made. The jokes just make it more palatable and keeps people reading and listening. The people he particularly criticizes are Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and ""the Bushies"" (George W. Bush (Dubya) and his administration. That is not a complete list of course. Much of that criticism was probably well earned. My favorite chapter of the book was Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One, which is a totally made up spoof in which Bush, Cheney, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, Ashcroft, Thomas and some others are in the Vietnam War. Oh, and the part where Al meets Barbara Bush. A lot of this book is laugh out funny. My least favorite part is where Al Franken and one of his protege go to Bob Jones University and pretend that they are not who they are.But Al Franken says he doesn't feel very good about having done that.I know this is cynical, but I don't trust either the Left or the Right. I aim for a balance in office so that hopefully they will deadlock and cancel each other out so that nothing too destructive takes place. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 17, 2012","Jun 17, 2012","Jun 17, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11071275-lies-and-the-lying-liars-who-tell-them

Anyway, as someone who respects, even reveres, the Lubavitcher Rebbe and his predecessors, I was appalled. On the other hand, well it was a pretty well-written story. The reason I think Michael Chabon is Jewish is not the extent of his knowledge, which is extensive as I just hinted at with the word extent. It is because of the love/hate relationship he has going on here. He mocks religious Judaism, calls the black hatters a bunch of criminals even to the extent of trying to scam G-d (read his diatribe on the eruv, he really has something against the eruv - page 110 - but when he starts talking about the handball court that got built where the fake doorway was he had me laughing). So there is all that sarcasm and nearly vicious offensiveness, but then there is the guy clinging to his people, his culture; Yid this and Yid that. If he doesn't love the Jewish people and count himself among them, I would be surprised. He (his characters) think it is all BS and can't let go. So the story is set in Sitka Alaska, which has been the temporary Jewish territory since 1948 when the Jews (fictionally) failed in holding on to Israel. So they live on borrowed land on borrowed time among an Indian population that doesn't like them much. Our Detective Landsman, a child of survivors, son of an avid and unhappy chess player, is living in a dump of a hotel in an alcoholic haze. A body is found in one of the rooms, a junkie shot in the back of the head. A chess board is set up in the room, mid-game, and it appears that the junkie uses a tefillin strap to tie off. Detective Landsman and his Jewish/Indian cousin Berko start to investigate. Detective Landsman's ex-wife Bina is his boss and she black flags the case (not active). Of course he investigates anyway. This brings him to Verbover Island and the Verbover Rebbe. And on it goes. This book is almost painful with love for the Jewish people despite all the mocking. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Jun 2012,"Jun 06, 2012","Jun 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16703.The_Yiddish_Policemen_s_Union
