Also, it included a trope that I don't like and normally won't read but which I wasn't expecting because I thought this was Romantic Suspense. Still, the premise was intriguing, and I'll probably read the rest of the books in the series. At least the major plot was wrapped up, and though some threads were left open, it didn't end with a cliff-hanger which forces you to read all the books in the series to get one story.

Hale lies in a hospital bed in a screened in porch-turned-bedroom in his father’s house, unable to communicate or control his body. Almost everyone thinks he’s in a vegetative state, but he can see and hear everything. Add to that his father’s grief at losing his wife, two years before the bus accident that killed one son and left Hale as he is, and the depression that brought about desperation enough that the father borrowed money from a loan shark. An intense and satisfying read that includes Biblical principles of clinging to God in the tough times instead of falling away. ...more",Notes are private!,2,2,1,Aug 2023,"Aug 02, 2023","Aug 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62684316-i-am-in-here

She does get the chance to apologize but not before the world collapses due to a rampant virus. Lizzie and her dad end up leaving their home due to people looting and toting guns.
