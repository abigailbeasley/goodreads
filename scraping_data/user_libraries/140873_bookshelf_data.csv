The first two longish stories in the collection work really, and I think it's largely because of their length; we spend just the right amount of time with the two displaced main characters. I found myself invested in their struggles and their situation. However, the center piece of the work, a novella called ""In a Free State,"" is just too long considering both it's overly nihilistic tone and, maybe more importantly, the situation--two people driving from one part of a somewhat decolonizing African nation to another in the midst of low scale civil war. Actually, that makes it sound far more interesting than it was. It was really just the two story of two Brits driving through an African country and revealing their racism in different ways.

Lots of times, people will say the narrator of a book is unreliable because it makes a book seem more complicated (there's more to it than just surface--the narrator is so unreliable), but usually people just mean the narrator espouses a different view of life, one with which the reader may not entirely agree. That's not the same thing as an unreliable narrator. ""The Sportswriter,"" on the other hand, seems entirely predicated on the fact Frank Bascombe is full of shit and much of the novel's power comes in measuring the distance between Frank's perceptions and what's actually happening to him. For instance, I love the scene where Frank goes to the police after Watler's suicide and the cop on duty is kind of grinning and Frank's convinced it's because the cops have been joking around but it's clearly because the cop thinks Frank was Walter's lover (this is early '80s New Jersey after all). One thing I find odd is how many s of the book refer to Frank as a descent man or some semblance of that line. That seems a total misreading of the novel, because Frank is a real shitbird--as self-absorbed and oblivious as the suburbs he professes to love. Granted, much of Frank's ""dreaminess"" results from the death of his son, but Frank deals with his loss in the most self-serving ways possible. I thought this the first time I read this book, about ten years ago, but I'd heard so many people--people whose opinion I trusted--speak of Bascbome in such glowing terms I thought I was wrong. Then recently I heard Ford talking on the Diane Riem show (I endured her head-up-the-ass brand of upper Northwest nonsense for the entire hour--that's how much I like Richard Ford) saying something like (and I'm paraphrasing), If I ever find myself agreeing with anything Frank Bascombe says, I've failed. That's basically how I feel about him, too, and it's amazing that Ford can pull it off. I will say there is not a lot of forward motion in the novel, and while I like Frank's digressions, there are probably 75 pages worth of material Ford would've been smart to cut. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 22, 2014","Dec 22, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40722.The_Sportswriter

It's incredibly readable, but just about every event in Jobs' life is given equal weight so few moments stand out. Also, because this book is obviously about Jobs, we don't get enough sense of the growth of Apple--sure, it has an amazing IPO, but we don't really see the physical growth of a company that started in a garage to using huge Chinese factories to mass produce products. All of that said, Issacson provides valuable insights into what made Jobs so successful, particularly emphasizing that he was one of the few people in the tech industry to consider the importance of the liberal arts, a concern that profoundly influenced the look and functionality of many Apple products. In addition, Issacson doesn't depict Jobs as a saint--he clearly illustrates his tendency, often needless, to be an asshole--though he also clearly revers him. One thing I will say is that the book gave me more respect for Apple's closed design of products. Granted, that made more sense in 1984 when there wasn't much of a consumer software market, but that is the tradition out of which Jobs grew, and even today I can appreciate his desire to produce a ready-to-go product, particularly given how glitchy Windows still is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 12, 2014","Dec 13, 2014","Nov 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs

The problem with Mccandles wasn't that he didn't properly respect the land (as many who objected to his expedition claim), though there's a bit of that, too. The simple issue with him is that this is someone who, given being born at a certain time, of a certain race, to certain parents of a certain socio-economic class, never had to actually worry about failure--even when the potential for it is acknowledged as he begins his journey it seems perfunctory, the type of thing the kind of Thorouian guy he is choosing to cast himself as is obligated to say. Now granted, perhaps the shackles of that existence are what drove him to such extremes, but was creating a thoroughly manufactured nomadic existence really bringing him closer to some type of natural reality? Is that a more noble or more thrilling existence then taking the fruits of his privilege (including a $25,000 trust fund that he just gave away), and actually working for the betterment of something? Still, I should also say Krakauer is a hell of a writer. I disagree with almost every single defense he provides of his subject, but his investigation into Mccandles and others who have gone into the wild, including himself, give this book an impressive, and effective, scope. This book isn't only about the man at the center of it, but very much about the pull nature has always had on a certain kind of American man. Situating Mccandles in that context made the book infinitely more engaging than it might have been. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2014","Oct 10, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1845.Into_the_Wild

And now, two months later, that still sums up my feelings about the novel--I just didn't care. I didn't care about the characters, their predicaments, their relationship to each other, the place where they lived or what might happen to it.

I think the issue is that Chabon, really for the first time in all of his books, confused quirkiness with characterization.

Here, in the middle class middle brow realm of Telegraph Avenue, these people are so strangely okay with themselves that there's not much running under their surface interests--mid-wifing, record collecting, band playing, screenwriting. These people are simply what they are. What's the point in reading a novel like that?...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2014","Oct 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10756240-telegraph-avenue

The nine stories in Stansel's first book are enough to remind people why they liked serious, classically structured stories in the first place. That's not to say the book lacks surprises--there are plenty of those, too, but they rise from the organic twists and turns of strongly rendered characters which run the gamut from young hippies in the rural Illinois of the '60s to a lonely, forty-something hostel owner in Houston in the present day. All of the main characters are enduring the quiet tumults of everyday life, though some are in more of a jam than others. Stansel uses those opportunities to artfully explore some of our most basic concerns as people--what do we do when we don't have enough money, how does that affect out relationships with others, why do some people fit in and others not, why are some drawn to cities and others to towns. The author's insight into these and others questions are worth the price of admission alone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 30, 2014","May 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18285566-everybody-s-irish

The biggest thing going for Last Days was the atmosphere; it's actually one of the creepiest books I've ever read. Maybe that's because I find amputation so disturbing--then again, who doesn't?--and the novel really taps into that deep seeded fear about the partial death we experience when lose little bits of ourselves. Also, Evenson clearly understands and effectively conveys how religious devotion can drive people to actions that seem bonkers to the uninitiated; he even draws some interesting parallels between that inclination and the lengths to which some will go in the name of basic human curiosity. On other hand, the biggest drawback of the novel was the narrator who was far too much of a blank slate, definitely more so than the narrators in the Dasheill Hammett novels on which he seems to be based. It's fine to not get the narrator's back story, I actually kind of like that, but we get so little of his thought process, his personality, it was hard at times to maintain interest in the story beyond the plot (which is admittedly very well executed). Granted, we never get any of the Continental Op's home life, but we have a sense of of his point of view, what drives him, etc. Now, given the general pulp feel of the novel, some might say the characterization of the narrator is beyond the point, but there's too much other interesting stuff going on for me to buy the author was simply trying to write a smash'em up crime book. All of that said, there are definitely scenes that have stuck with me, and like I said, any book that can still unsettle me in 2014 is pretty impressive on some level. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 21, 2014","May 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4309446-last-days

In fact, this belief is a major drawback of the book. Stross diminishes a number of Edison's accomplishments based largely on the fact that a significant percentage of his creations never made money or failed all together. However, this is often the case with inventions. You invent forty or fifty things in the hopes that one has a life or that something will grow out of a less effective device; this seems like something a writer familiar with technology should know. In addition, Stross attributes Edison's fame more to his ability to work the press than the fact he ran the labs that invented the phonograph, and the electric light and a system to power it. Granted, Edison did work closely with his associates and likely took credit for their work in his many patent applications, but to ignore the fact that Edison directed much of this work is to ignore how R and D occurs. Edison was certainly no saint, but this book seems more intended to present a contrary take on a much revered figure than an accurate representation of a complex historical figure. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 13, 2014","May 12, 2014",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/16421105-the-wizard-of-menlo-park

Hiltzik's book explains how over the course of ten years some of the world's foremost computer scientists invented almost every feature that we have come to associate with personal computing--overlapping windows, ""what you see is what you get"" word processing, the desktop, high speed printing, connection to an Ethernet, point and click technology, the ubiquity of the mouse, and the use of icons as opposed to coding. What's most fascinating is how Hiltzik details the creative process that led to these inventions, specifically how so many of them built off each other and the spirit of competition within the lab that resulted in great leaps forward. While the author is occasionally too worshipful of his subjects, it's not hard to see why with the cast of characters he has to work with. Heavily featured in the book are Bob Taylor (the man who ran the department of the Pentagon that literally invented the Internet), and Alan Kay (a research scientist whose dissertation anticipated by more than 30 years the hand held computer technology that Apple would bring to fruition with its Ipad), two of the most important individuals in the history of personal computing. While it may sound as though this book is written exclusively for those with an interest in or knowledge of computers, that is not the case. Much of the book explores the tensions between Xerox's corporate headquarters and PARC management in addition to the rivalries between and among the departments at PARC.

It's hard to write about what makes writers great, and to call one ""honest"" (what the fuck does that even mean?) is such a cliche, but Yates may well be the most honest author I've ever read.

There are a few drawbacks, though, the first and most annoying, was some serious repetition: if Charles went to the cliffs one more time I was going to scream. The other issue, and this is much more subtle, and I suspect hard to avoid in a novel of this sort, was that the book often felt bifurcated. What I mean is when the romantic plot really gets rolling, TFLW losses much of its intellectual heft.

Also, Dressler's marriage is far too quickly entered into and the reasons for it are a little vague, as are Martin's reasons for choosing Caroline over Emmaline (the reason Martin gives for this toward the end isn't really something the reader could've discerned on his own). All of that said, the novel's exploration of the drawbacks of ambition and modernity, as well as its evocative rendering of turn of the century NY makes it a solid read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 18, 2012","Dec 20, 2012","Dec 18, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/146219.Martin_Dressler

The stories were tonally and thematically repetitive (and not in a good way) and almost all of them were too long by half considering the general lack of tension. There were a couple of standouts, though. ""L DeBard and Aliette"" was a thoughtful exploration of a relationship set during an era (the 1920s) in which social class and strict moral/gender rules could manifest themselves even more violently then they do today. The title story was strong as well, and a good example of how to raise the dramatic stakes in fiction. All of that said, ""Blythe"" was awful and ""Sir Fleeting"" could totally have been written by Kathleen Turner's character from ""Romancing the Stone"" if she made the Jack Colton character a little less swashbuckling and a little more smarmy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2012","Nov 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3734317-delicate-edible-birds-and-other-stories

I more than liked “This Bright River,” but, sadly, I did not ""really like"" it so I went with three starts rather than four. The reason for that mostly relates to the middle section of the book, which far too often sagged under the weight of the ideas and themes Somerville explores—what is evil, what determines how a person becomes who they are, what responsibility do the privileged have to acknowledge their privilege, how much knowledge is too much, is it better to confront the past or ignore it (and I’m probably missing a few others). This isn’t to say a novel shouldn't explore weighty ideas—in fact that’s one of the most important things the best novels do. However, the exploration of ideas should always, to quote Steve Almond, arise from “the emotional lives of the characters.” Far too often, and particularly in the middle hundred or so pages of ""This Bright River,"" the characters spent a lot of time in a room talking about ideas, rather than taking actions that convey ideas. That’s not really why I read novels. Another roadblock I encountered in “This Bright River” is the order in which the story is presented. Far too much of the story, at least in the order in which Somerville and the narrator delineate it (which, it should be said, is not always the order in which the events actually occurred or even the order in which the characters ascertain knowledge of those things) gives a coincidental feel to a number of important plot points. Coincidence is fine for an episode of Breaking Bad, but I expect a book, especially one that is relatively realistic, to work a little harder at foreshadowing and prepare us for what’s to come so key moments don’t feel like the author working himself out of a jam. All of that said, the novel starts incredibly well and ends the same. The characters, despite their occasional tendency to ramble, are well-drawn, complex, flawed, and sympathetic. There are several narrators besides Ben, the main character, and each has a precisely-rendered, idiosyncratic voice. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 16, 2012","Sep 27, 2012","Sep 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13208908-this-bright-river

It's one you're supposed to read in high school, right? I basically liked it, but I thought it was going to be totally different. It's not so much about the trial (like I thought it was) but about Scout growing up in the segregated depression-era south (but you already knew that). While I generally agree with Malcolm Galdwell's estimation of the book (he published a piece in a recent New Yorker about it) as not as forward thinking as many give it credit for, I do think you can see the grounds of the eventual Civil Rights movement in the actions of Scout and Jem. I also thought how different the world as become in terms of perceptions of people's motivations and personalities. In this book, a person is what they are innately. While the book does a nice job of showing that a person's race does not determine much about how they are, it does make the case that some people are just good and some people are just bad, and you've got to make allowances for it. So different than this era when we're always trying to figure out what made people what they are. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Sep 20, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird

In some ways an amazing book: an incredibly smooth voice and a deft handling of not only several narratives but of seemingly accurate historical information in the service of an inherently fictional tale. The end left me kind of cold, particularly how quickly things wrapped up (however, that might only be true because I read what was basically a truncated version of the novel in The New Yorker about six years ago. That meant I more or less knew how things would shake out which is never good when you're reading a story about a mystical curse).That said, it's a great book for all of us sci-fi/fantasy geeks who eventually evolved into literary fiction geeks. Diaz has an ability to reference the fanboy cannon in a way that betrays intimate familiarity with everything from The Stand to obscure animea.(How does the main character realize he's getting old? When he can't accept how Magic cards have replaced traditional roll-playing games: That. Is. Awesome.)Besides all that jazz, the book has boat loads of insight into how looks and race play a huge roll in determining our destinies: the fat sci-fi geeks ends up screwed (though, much to his chagrin, not literally) while the weight lifting sci-fi geek can better hide his proclivity for genre, thus saving his social life....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2009","Feb 24, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao

The book provides an ever-changing, though almost always economically-based, definition of the word independent and given its scope, that makes sense; the hallmarks of cinematic independence in 1909 vastly differ from the hallmarks of cinematic independence in 1999. Each chapter of the book provides a case study in a particular figure or film, but the vast majority of the work explores the economic and systemic factors leading to an Independent American Cinema. That's the main strength of this book but also its biggest flaw--it focuses far too much on the business end of independent cinema, which means the author basically ignores films that have little to no connection to the film business--neither Maya Darren nor Stan Brackage are once mentioned in over 250 pages. In essence, Tzioumakis allows the major studios to define independence, which is certainly an odd, not mention problematic, way to go. However, the book has some really fascinating info, especially on the ultra low budget exploitation films of the 50s and 60s as well as on the ethnic cinema of the 20s, 30s, and 40s....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jul 2007,"Jul 11, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1491322.American_Independent_Cinema
