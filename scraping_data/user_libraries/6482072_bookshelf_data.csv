I felt !most comfortable when the author writes about his mother and her influence while growing up. The immigrant and refugee displacement in general and from Vietnam is one that is centered on war and strife.treatment as depicted in movies and literature can be violent and stereotypical. I had an uneasy feeling as I read this memoir with its often mocking tone of America. Which can be a good thing for knowledge and change. Literary references added perspective.

It starts out with the author's own story of being diagnosed at six with anorexia. That could have been a good book. Aviv builds on this by introducing the reader to other patients of psychiatry for different reasons. The mother who jumped from a bridge with her children really got to me.

The investigator just didn't quite come together with her tattoos, face nail and occasional slang conversation. The mystery of the next door neighbor is an interesting element. so, you have sexual harassment, assault, murder, robbery and extortion to name a few of the crimes committed by not very likable characters. Riveting and clever court room drama saves the story which sometimes got too bogged down with technical details.

Jake is a writer who uses the plot described to him by a student and the suspense builds around who finds out after the novel's success. The question of who owns the story or the idea of the story comes up as Jake fights his inner and outer doubts. My favorite character is a small town coroner who makes a brief appearance and steals the scene with his sarcasm and snappy dialogue.
