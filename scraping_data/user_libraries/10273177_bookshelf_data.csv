But not know-it-all smart because over the years I discovered she has a hungry, curious mind that's always eager to learn. When she does a thing, she does it thoroughly, with exacting attention to detail.2.

Any fiction listens were works I’d read before. Old faves. So I literally haven’t sat down and read a novel with my eyes in a long, long time.Go figure I break the streak with a one-sitting wonder.Speaking of a long time, I can’t remember when it was, but Emma Scott once made a Facebook post that said, “I just want to write something extraordinary.”Jesus Christ, no shit, I thought, feeling that creative call/lament to action in my bones. I want that too. I want I want I want. Write something extraordinary. Not necessarily different, not necessarily a far-out-there premise, but a story that took you out of the ordinary, evoking authentic emotions that took you to the next level of yourself.I also know that Emma has a post-it on her computer that reads “compare you to YOU.” Even within the confines of keeping the standards of your work within the parameters of your work, there’s always the yearning, the yen, the pull to outwrite yourself and go beyond.With Sinner, Emma wrote something extraordinary. In premise, research, writing, characters and emotion. It’s Emma, but an incarnation we haven’t seen before. She’s stepped far from the path of herself, yet it feels like the most authentic thing I’ve read by her. I loved its historical depth (research crush!!) and I loved its intentions (Like, I didn’t need the epilogue, but I knew exactly why it was there).It’s impossible to set aside the prism of knowing what you know, which makes a simple line like “I thought I was ready, I’m not ready” into a heart piercing. A line like “Let go, baby” into a searing brand. And “It wasn’t your fault…I saw everything and you couldn’t have saved me” into the forgiveness you’ve waited a lifetime for.When you pick up Sinner, be prepared for some extraordinary, honest-to-ancient-Sumerian-Gods next-level stuff, but also be prepared for it to feel wonderfully familiar. Like an old legend from a new storyteller. Listen for the thought, “I haven’t been here in a long time… But I remember this.”(By the way, if this one doesn’t get optioned for film rights, I’ll be a wandering dybbuk)...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Aug 15, 2021","Aug 15, 2021","Aug 15, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57796208-the-sinner

I just stayed on him, stayed on the Hook. No shame. Lots of guys hang on their buddies while stumbling along, wounded or half-asleep or wretched. Or all three.It’s funny, Asta, how in peacetime, physical contact between men is considered odd. Even suspect. Yet out here, between battles, we touch all the time. Unconsciously. Desperately. It reminds me of when you talked about Brazilian men always being aware, almost competitive with their masculinity. If I ever see you again, darling girl, I think we should have a drink and continue the conversation, because war is changing my idea about what it means to be a man.The camaraderie between these combat buddies was a pulsing, palpable thing. They did everything, everything together, each mundane act suffused with ritual and superstition. They dressed in the same order, arranged their kits just so. Cleaned their guns in a choreographed ballet of pieces laid out on the ground and pieces reassembled. They went around giving secret handshakes, kissing each other’s dog tags, reciting a canon of catch phrases, platitudes, creeds and dirty jokes. They shared their solemn last smokes before battle, and the jubilant smokes after. Every platoon had that one guy who could materialize out of nowhere to snuff your match if you dared try to light three cigarettes on it. And another guy who, if you threw your spent match on the ground, looked at you like you’d just shit on his shoes, then picked up the match and threw it over his left shoulder.“That’s for salt, you moron,” someone always said.“It’s for matches, too.”“Bullshit.”And they’d argue for an hour about it, knowing it was all bullshit. The ceremony, the superstitions and rituals, the matches, even the arguing—all bullshit. But they were unable not to cling to it. It was how the trust went on thriving. Trust in your buddy, trust in the squad leaders, trust in the platoon, the division, the mission, the cause, the war and above all, trust in their definitive stance on the right side of history.Before battle, some went alone to take a last nervous piss. Others went together and crossed shaky streams. If they did it once and got lucky, they had to do it always. They prayed and davened and spit and swore and smoked and shook and touched. They filled and emptied their pockets, cast their spells and went off to fight. Some came back alive, and each mourned differently for the ones who died. There were soldiers who could cry in the open and soldiers who crawled away to mourn. Soldiers who broke things in their grief, soldiers who consoled themselves by picking up tool kits or shovels and putting things together. And soldiers who did absolutely nothing at all.At night, they bedded down and breathed hard to get warm. They ignored the stench and cuddled like brothers, spooned like lovers. One thrust his cold feet between his buddy’s shins and there was nothing for it. Another slid his chilblained fingers into his mate’s armpit because there was nothing for it. Two brothers in arms fell asleep in each other’s arms and thought nothing of it, because there was nothing for it. Nothing except each other.“What is it?” Kennet said. “Hook, tell me.”“It’s stupid.”“Which is why you should tell me.”Hook’s hands clenched Kennet’s sleeves. “I don’t want to die.”“I know,” Kennet said. “It’s not stupid.”I don’t want to die. I have gold in my blood, I can’t die like this. Don’t let me die like this and I’ll be good forever. Good as gold. Don’t let me die. Please don’t let me die…They hung on tight through the cold, terrifying nights.

Opposite the lyrics, Ray had drawn a couple on a tandem bicycle, rolling through fields of daisies. The woman wore a chain of them on her head. The man had one tucked in the button of his seersucker jacket. A mid-century feel was in the illustration. A bygone time rendered soft with watercolor and detailed with India ink.“You made this for me?” she said.“This one specifically for you, yes. But…” He turned over another page. “Here’s where it gets stupid.”A skyscape now, going from pastel day in the bottom left to indigo twilight in the top right. A hot air balloon piloted by a man in cap and goggles. His passenger a blonde lady, a long white scarf floating behind her like a banner. Out the back of the basket dropped tiny purple flowers, drifting down and about the page, circling another verse:Violet, Violet, give me your answer true.I’ll be a pilot and fly away with you.On top of the clouds we’ll tarry,Among the stars we’ll marry,And songs we’ll sing upon the wingsOf an air balloon built for two. Ray turned over more pages. Every one had a woman’s floral name, a made-up verse and an illustration.“I want to live in them,” Daisy said. “If I were a little girl, I’d want a book like this on my shelf. I’m a big girl and I want it.”“Then it’s yours.” Within a month Ray finished the verses and drawings. Pitched the book and sold it and partnered with a children’s charity to donate all the proceeds.He arrived in Saint John one weekend and brought Daisy one of the first printed copies.
