She is a genius when it comes to people, expressing their inner feelings and thoughts, their dilemmas anI love Liane Moriarty, and her writing style. She is a genius when it comes to people, expressing their inner feelings and thoughts, their dilemmas and morality. And maybe especially their complex relationships and friendships. She is true to the Gore Vidal citation: ""Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little"".In this book, like her other books, there are three couples, their lives intertwined around an incident. She used her common recipe, alas, she did not add enough of her spices with the recipe this time. That made the book much weaker than the unforgettable Big Little Lies or the wonderful Big Little Lies (even though much much better than Three Wishes).The book drags for the most part (over 200 hundred pages before you found out ""what the hack happened in this barbecue"", the mystery is not as awesome and compelling. There is still the stringing wonderful unique sense of humor. There are still the great observations about human behavior, envy, love and the conflict between them. But it is not enough, not enough to make it a good book.Since this book also includes the topic of hoarding, I am proud to say that I did say in the past I said that The House We Grew Up In sounds like a Liane Moriarty (see my ). Whereas, Lisa Jewell did a much better work describing the hoarding, her book altogether is not great. (view spoiler)[because of too much incest, way too much. (hide spoiler)] Still, Liane Moriarty is a much more talented writer and story teller.With all the sadness, I give it 3 stars and feel ultra generous, and it is mostly because I do love Moriarty. I guess I would give it less without her high credit history. If you don't know her, read Big Little Lies. If you become addicted to her (easily done), come back to this one much later....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27831371-truly-madly-guilty

That is basically it, you know pretty much the whole story. The description says ""A Boy Made of Blocks is a funny, heartwarming story of family and love inspired by the author's own experiences with his son, the perfect latest obsession for fans of The Rosie Project, David Nicholls and Jojo Moyes."". I have to say that it was ok, but it wasn't funny almost at all, while The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion is really funny. In this story the dad is a mortgage consultant, who is really frustrated about the job that he hates, and is even more frustrated with his son, Sam, with whom he cannot interact. He left the house, and now his wife Jody and his son live on their own, even though he spends a lot of time in the house. The dad is quite self centered at the beginning, and open over time, especially when the magic called Minecraft comes into the picture.Sam starts as somewhat functional autistic 8 year old. He hits other children, and children at school torment him. With Minecraft he can show his skill, brilliancy and good measure. 3 stars.

The picture of her pregnancy where she was naked, the movie Indecent Proposal that brought a ton of criticism towards her, and of course G.I Jane. It is so hard to be a woman in such industry, and the lower pay is not even the top problem.

My daughter and I did a team reading on it, since she needed to read a book and discuss it for school. I am so happy that she picked this one because I would probably never get to it without her.Kit Gordy is a high school student that is going to a boarding school. Her mother just remarried and she was accepted to an elite school (or so she thinks) called Blackwood School for Girls. The school is located inside an antique castle, which is beautiful. But for Kit one word only described it when she got there: Evil. She hoped that when the rest of the students will arrive it will feel better, since she arrived one day early, because her mother and her new husband are going on a honeymoon in Europe. On the day school starts, Kit understands that only four girls are going to study. Linda, Ruth and Sandy join Kit. Each one gets a beautiful room, and shortly after they all feel that something is off, but they can't tell what it is. They also find out that each of them has a dead relative (In Kit's case it is her father) and they all think that they found out about the death before being told about it.From there, the school goes down hill. It is not a real school, and something is totally wrong with it. But they are all quite trapped in this awkward experience. Duncan did an awesome job keeping the suspense and also getting the setting and the characters very well portrayed.4+ stars.

It is described as “fun, fluffy” romance novel and “isn’t supposed to be that serious”. I don't even know how I survived to the end of this book. So, the book is about Alex Claremont-Diaz, First Son of the United States, who falls in love with Henry, the prince of England. They were so called enemies before, but I didn't find a trace of that in the book for real, except that it is mentioned several times. Henry falls in love back of course. And this is complicated, with election campaign and with responsibilities of a prince. That is about it, and it is dragging and dragging with physical touch scenes here and there.Yes, it is an LGBTQ book which is great. Yes, it is about two men fall in love and it is not common in books (but improving). But this is not the book to put at the top of your pile if you are looking for a good book about gay love. Even, What If It's Us by Becky Albertalli was a bit better. And yes, this book talks a lot about Hamilton (with Albertalli and Silvera also over mentioned in their book).The characters are flat, the plot doesn't really exist and overall the book is not that interesting. Henry, is a very frightened boy that we do not learn almost anything about. And, the politics and the houses setting do not make a lot of sense and are not believable. I especially was unimpressed with one scene that Alex goes to Buckingham Palace and almost makes a scene outside to get in. And of course, this is how it works, and he is getting in. Very reasonable. Not.2 stars. Not joining the raving s here.

I didn't like the characters, and their way throughout the plot did not resonate with me. And I really wanted to read a book by Rooney, that seems like a capable author based on ratings.Marianne, starts the book as an awkward girl with no friends. Connell, actually does pretty well at school. His mother cleans Marianne's house. And he find that he likes Marianne, at least for the sexual encounters, but actually likes her for real.Time goes by, and Marianne and Connell, find each other again (and later again and again without a lot of sense). In the second time Marianne is socially successful, have friends and everything is awesome. But in the third time we figure out that Marianne is actually quite broken (and Connell is found at some point to be broken too). I think I was mainly bothered by Marianne's character, that was not developing in any believable way, and the very close relationship with Connell, that has unexplained serious issues in several critical parts. Sorry, but I like well woven stories, and this one has huge gaps and jumps in between. And then it also drags a bit too much. If you want to read about unusual interesting love I would recommend to go with Our Souls at Night by Kent Haruf. It is better executed, and really feels like the author captured the people, relationships, shames and complications better.2.5 stars rounded to 2 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 03, 2019","Sep 25, 2019","Aug 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41057294-normal-people

Kirby, the rebel girl, that wants her freedom and independences, she does not come with the family to Nantucket, and goes to work at a hotel for the summer.

With joy, sadness, fear, with truth and with secrets, the reader gets to know the characters very well. This is a story about love, in many different shapes. Motherly love, first love, abusive love, distant love, and also pure love that cannot easily happen. It is also a story about figuring out being a woman, and what kind of relationship work and what type of people you want in your life.I have to give it 5 stars, because it was definitely more than 4 for me.

Claude feels that he is a girl, and from a very young age he really wants to wear dresses. His parents do not know how to react to Claude's requests, but they do their best to try to understand. Rosie slept in. When she came down for breakfast, Penn reported, “Claude wants to know if he can wear a dress under his lab coat when he’s a girl scientist.”At some point they decided to move to Seattle. I thought that it was because it was a more accepting and open place. Apparently, it was just because no one knew them there, so they could hide Claude's (or now Poppy) real gender.The premise of this book is really interesting, the main problem is that the writing style is extremely boring. I had really hard time to get into the story, and I needed to start and go back several times.

I value real life activities and relationships a lot, and on that front I agree with the author that we should make sure to keep our time protected and not just be on screen all the time. It is especially a challenge for people who were born into this situation and maybe never learned enough about human connection and how to get off the screen. On the other hand, I didn't like the tone or the preaching. I didn't like the warnings and the negativity. Technology is also awesome, and I would hope that there are other ways to keep it in check.The book also contradicts itself many times with its ambivalent attitude towards technology. I think the author meant to show balance, but ended up being quite confused. The advice in the book are also not going to be practical for many people, so I felt a miss there too.Overall, I will give it 3 stars, even though it is a bit below. I hope everyone will try to keep real life and real connections a priority, even if they enjoy the occasional like or being up to date with far high school friends. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Nov 2019,Nov 2019,"Jul 07, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism

And her mother, Isra, who came from Palestine/Israel to the US to marry Deya's father. Isra, spent her life in a miserable marriage, to a violent, abusive drunk man, and died in a car accident together with him. Or maybe it was not exactly the case?I will start by saying that the main reason that I really dislike the book, is that there is an excuse to the abuse, the fact that they live in America away from home. I am really sorry, but no excuse to domestic violence is acceptable. And if any book will try to do so I will be extremely mad. The other reason that I do not like this book is that even family members that are supposedly love each other seem to be calling their girls sharmouta, a whore, every five minutes and on every little thing. I understand that the Muslim culture is more traditional about woman, but then again, I would hope that is not the case in all houses.Here you go:“Fall in love? What are you saying? Did I raise a sharmouta?”“Make sure you don’t let him touch you until after the wedding ceremony. We don’t want this American family to go around saying we raised a sharmouta. That’s what men do, you know. Always put the blame on the woman.”“She said we had to stop going to school,” Deya said, feeling her stomach twist at the memory. “She even called me a sharmouta.”“You can’t be friends with boys! Did I raise a sharmouta?”“Only a sharmouta leaves her house in the middle of the night.”This is what I get for not beating you more often! I must have raised a sharmouta!I am not sure what was the goal of the author, but clearly she missed it. 1 star, a rating that I didn't use for a long time.

It was quite innovative, and explored the different paths that a person can take. Here he tries to explore memory, and the fact that everything is in our memory actually. The neural impulses from your taste buds and your ears get transmitted to your brain, which processes them and dumps them into working memory—so by the time you know you’re experiencing something, it’s already in the past. Already a memory.” The book starts here with Barry Sutton, who tells us about people that have memories that never happen, false memories. A bit like Blade Runner (much better to go watch Blade Runner though).There's the neuroscientist Helena Smith, who wants to build a chair, a technology that will let us preserve our most precious memories. ""If you want to help your mother, get your funding and build your chair.” I got really tired at some point from all the talk about ""the chair"".Too much chair, too many memories, and I also didn't like the ending. It started well and then lost it altogether. The characters were flat, and pretty much nothing happened.

It is well written, interesting and the characters are well portrayed. This is a story of two sisters in the Kaufman family. Jo, the older, the tomboy, and Bethie, the perfect little lady. Jo is hated by her mother, who is disappointed at her, she can never get anything right. Jo has progressive opinions and at her young age she is a justice worrier. Jo's refuge is her father, who loves her without conditions, and is happy about her and her interests. Bethie, the mother's favorite, is perfect. She is beautiful, has good manners, talented in every way. Unfortunately, the father dies early on, and the family stays with financial difficulties.Jo's grows up and finds out that she likes women. Unfortunately, it is not easy to live with such tendency in the 60s and even the 70s. She falls in love, she has relationships, but many gay women did not have the courage to choose this life style and not get married and have kids. Bethie also loses her track, and during her youth and early adult life encounters problematic men. Her life takes several tracks that made my heart wrench. I was disappointed at times by the characters choices and actions, but I can see that it could be reasonable for the time of the story. It was interesting to see how experience sometimes changes people's life forever, and how the sisters almost switched with each other throughout their lives. Is one of them Mrs. Everything or maybe she misses everything? It reminded me a little of the awesome Summer of '69 by Elin Hilderbrand that I read earlier this year.

She meditated in darkness.At first it was horribly difficult.She couldn’t sit still. She was hungry after six hours. All she thought about was her stomach. But after a while the hunger was so overwhelming that she couldn’t think about it anymore, because she couldn’t remember a time when she hadn’t been this hungry.On the second day she felt dizzy. She was woozy with hunger, so starved that she couldn’t feel her stomach. Did she even have a stomach? What was a stomach?On the third day her head was delightfully light. She was just air, just breath, just a breathing organ. A fan. A flute. In, out, in, out, and on and on.On the fifth day things moved too fast, too slow, or not at all. She felt infuriated by the slow passage of time. Her brain was racing in a way that wouldn’t calm; she felt as if her heartbeat must now be faster than a hummingbird’s. How had she not dissolved? ...On the ninth day she suffered a geometric assault of lines and shapes without form or color...On the thirteenth day she had a horrible sensation of being trapped, as if buried within stone, as if covered in mud. She was so light, so weightless, but she had nowhere to go; she rebounded around inside this bizarre vessel called a body like a caught firefly.Overall, I didn't like the magic, I didn't like the war, and it felt to me like an easy way out for the author. I also didn't like that it all dragged for so long. 2 stars because of this. Overall, interesting premise and a very good start, but later it falls....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 30, 2019","Jul 30, 2019","Jul 04, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war

I loved The True Story of Hansel and Gretel by Louise Murphy, I watched the first three seasons of ""Once upon a Time"" (until it became not that interesting and I lost interest). I read almost every book about modern fairytales that I could find. So I was excited to read this one. This book is about they true story of Hook. Actually, his name is Jamie. And he tells us about a Peter Pan that is very different than the one that you know. He tells you that Peter Pan is a manipulator and lier. Once I was young, and young forever and always, until I wasn’t. Once I loved a boy called Peter Pan.Peter will tell you that this story isn’t the truth, but Peter lies. I loved him, we all loved him, but he lies, for Peter wants always to be that shining sun that we all revolve around. He’ll do anything to be that sun.Peter will say I’m a villain, that I wronged him, that I never was his friend.But I told you already. Peter lies.This is what really happened.The concept is enchanting. It is amazing to see how Peter, that we all love, and maybe sometime envy, can be the bad guy. And the wireframe of the story is actually pretty good. The problem is with most of the middle. So many battles and fights, that it is just pure pure boring. So many characters that we do not get to know, because none of them has any real personality. Basically, if it would be a short story, with a really thin middle, it could be really good. I am not even sure how I held until the end of it.Let's say that it tries to be ""Wicked"" (and the concept is also really similar). They are super close friends, and the good one is the bad one and the opposite. The only difference is that ""Wicked"" is just amazing and well done throughout the whole story.2.5 stars rounded to 3. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 09, 2019","Jul 09, 2019","Jul 02, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32828538-lost-boy

Let's start with the genre, maybe the same class of Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. It is not exactly romance, maybe Erotica? To start with, it has way too much physical attraction in it. Jess, the female character wants to jump at Duane, the male protagonist. Top recommendation, do not look at the s of this book on GR in a public place, they are all shirtless male with a beard, and that does not look good in an airplane or a train. Everyone wanted to take a stab by how the hot guy look like, and so it is a problematic landing page.So Jess is a hot girl, and she is (not convincingly at all) in love with Beau. Then someone (that looks like Beau) comes and kisses her passionately. She is in love with him, knows him and his brother all her life and now after the kiss, removing the shirt and touching body parts, this is Duane (gentleman? ha). Btw, for most twins if you are around them enough you can tell. If she can't know who she's in love with, maybe she's not in love that much? Anyway, she now falls for Duane. She wants to jump at him, but now he wants to wait. So she is talking about her melons and his banana (I swear that how she calls them), and he is riding on the white horse, in the shape of seven cars (which one he gives her after 7 minutes of bf-gf. Oh, and it was 1966 Mustang 289). And overall, that part works, except that every time one of the two protagonist loses it like crazy, in a completely strange feat without telling the other why they are pissed and mad. I forgot to mention that Jess wants to travel the world. Actually, not travel, she wants to live in the world. And she thinks that in two years she can do it, and live in Italy, then Greece, then somewhere else. Duane on the other hand, wants to live in his place, with his family and never go anywhere. Hey, but love, right? So of course, a few more complications are going to happen, and poof, we will probably get to happily ever after. Most likely, I am supposed to hate this book and give it 1 star. From plot perspective, it is probably 1-2. What amazed me is that the author seems extremely intelligent, and her writing style is overall good. She has a huge fan tribe, that know all 6 brothers from the Winston family, and try to guess who is which brother when they see people in the street with a beard. Overall, this is between crazy and adorable. I am probably not going to read another book from her series, but I definitely think that it is interesting to see how this GR  page is explained by this fan cult she created. I'll go with 2.5 rounded to 3, maybe she will get one or two new fans....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 15, 2019","Jul 15, 2019","Jul 02, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/23314731-truth-or-beard

Jane is an amazing young woman that has to be married and produce an heir. She has been engaged to be married before, and every single time it did not work. Now she has to and she is going to marry someone she never saw Gifford Dudley. The King Edward who is a really close friend of Jane is going to die from a deadly illness. One thing is not known to Jane, and it is the Gifford (nicknamed G) is a bit different in the light hours. Gifford, is not your regular guy, he is an E∂ians, he is actually a horse since the sun rises and until it is completely dark. The story is full of surprises, and we find out the E∂ians were outlawed . The E∂ians are determined to bring us into an age of darkness and perversity. We find out that there are quite a few more E∂ians around. Jane herself is a strong amazing opinionated woman. Gifford, who is known to hang out with so many women, is found to be a great person that really likes strong women, and his arguments with Jane are the best you could hope for in a book.

My daughter has been listening to the audio book with me, and she loved it as well. Actually, she started loving it from the third chapter I think, and was quite skeptical at the beginning.Elise is a 16 year old girl with no friends. No one likes her, she is strange, she is different and she really does want to be loved. The only people that love her are her mom and dad, and her sister Alex (7) and her brother Neal (5). The book starts on the first day of school, Elise threw away all of her beloved clothes and got new ones, ""cool"" ones. She remembers things that happened to her in the last year, and quickly finds out that clothes are not going to make the difference. At that point she decides (very surprisingly) to kill herself to punish everyone. I was really worried that it would turn into Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher (which I really really didn't like), but it was similar only in that point.Elise is very smart, and very talented. And she can teach herself anything (almost). She loves music, and knows so much about it. But she feels alone, she feels unloved, and she does not know what to do to change it. She starts wondering around in the night to think and listen to music. And then one day she does find a new opportunity. I will leave it up to you to read from here. I can just say that for the most part it is fun and well written. 4 stars.

This is also a story about two women, who become friends, very good friend.Bea is a lady in her 70s. Her husbands died a few years ago and she has very little money. Actually she has about 700 dollars when we get to know her, and she is scammed away from the money that she has (and also money that she does not have) and she starts living in her (not in great condition) trailer. Allie, is 15 years old. When we meet her, both of her parents are being arrested. Now she is on her on, except for child protective services. Not a great place to be, and very hard for a girl from a wealthy family (who is also vegan) to face the real world. They meet each other on the highway (I will leave it up to you to find out how).

The characters are nice (not a masterpiece, but good). The plot is a bit too perfect (who would choose to go to the Monte Ray Aquarium when they don't have money?) The author also had a few places where she was repetitive, I thought for a second that it was intentional but I waited her to pick up and connect I think she did not mean it. (If and when you read it see where “I can be nice” shows up). Also, Allie is just a tiny bit too perfect, and she is definitely is an endless driller with her being vegan.Almost 3.5, rounded to 3.

I read My Not So Perfect Life by her, and it definitely was a page turner and entertaining, even if not a masterpiece. She does a very good work on all fronts, character portraying, plot, dialogs. And for me the most important, that overall everything makes sense. There are writers that skip or leave huge patches to get done with a book, and there is a star loss (or multi-star-loss) for such choices. Kinsella, in her genre, is doing a beautiful job of a smooth, great paced, and fun books.Fixie Farr has always lived by her father’s motto: “Family first.” Unfortunately, she is pretty much the black sheep of her family. Her brother is much more self confident and successful than her (in business and life), her sister is super beautiful, her mom runs the family business store. She looks at herself as quite a failure, and she really does think that she is not that good at anything. She can't speak up in front of any of these people, because her brother shuts her up and dismisses her, so even if she wants to talk she almost physically loses the ability. She is also in love with her brother's friend for years and years. And he played with her and her feelings, but she would love to get him back (and be sure he will be back, the self-centered dude).But what we found out on Fixie (which got her name because she can't let go and need to fix things all the time), is that actually she is much more capable than she thinks. And actually, that some people around her, are much less perfect than she thinks. And so, it all starts one day, when she goes out to a coffee shop and the guy in the next table, Seb, asks her to keep an eye on his computer for a second. The ceiling just happen to fall on the coffee shop exactly at that minute, and Fixie saves his laptop, and so he gives her an IOU note. And after the first one, they tend to meet again and again the the IOUs come back again and again.So much is happening, her mother takes vacation and the siblings need to handle the store. Fixie learns about herself, and maybe that Family first is sometimes tough, even very tough, and that she might need to rethink how she says yes all the time, and not speaking up. The meeting with Seb changed a lot, and keeps changing until the end.Loved this book, even with some cheesy parts. Loved how she gained confidence and learned to value herself. Loved how she learned to say no, and how she actually did that with some of these people who thought she was a sucker. 4+ stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 03, 2019","Sep 03, 2019","Jul 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40702156-i-owe-you-one

Olive doesn't even have a job, a romantic life or any friends.Well, everything changes when everyone in the wedding get sick because of the seafood, except of course our favorite Olive and Ethan. These two are going to take the honeymoon trip of the newly married couple to Hawaii. Therefore, the un-honeymooners. So they will need to find a way to at least not hate each other (at least on the plane where they have to sit together, and you can guess that also later).I will let you read from here, but I had a bunch of places that I wasn't happy with the way that the characters behaved. A bunch of them were just nasty towards olive, including her own sister, and that was a bit too much even if the point is later to resolve it and be funny.Overall, 3 stars. Not the best by Lauren, but still entertaining. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 05, 2019","Nov 05, 2019","Jun 18, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42201431-the-unhoneymooners

She was once a beautiful model, and slowly she exposes the reader to what happened to her. In a disorganized way, in a mess, This is a criticism about beauty (the author seem to have criticism towards our modern world like in fight club and consumerism):I was tired of staying a lower life form just because of my looks. Trading on them. Cheating. Never getting anything real accomplished, but getting the attention and recognition anyway. Trapped in a beauty ghetto is how I felt. Stereotyped. Robbed of my motivation. Can you be a brain surgeon and look good? And do you get the right recognition if you are not attractive?For me the story jumped around to much in a way that was hard to follow. But I have to say that fight club was similarly too jumpy for me, so maybe it's something for this author that doesn't suit me well. A ton of strange things are happening, the story is interesting, but overall more strange than any other word can describe.One example, is this scene, where her parents give her a ton of condoms for Christmas: Almost everything in my stocking is condoms, in boxes, in little gold foil coins, in long strips of a hundred with perforations so you can tear them apart. My only other gifts are a rape whistle and a pocket-sized spray canister of Mace. That looks like I'm set for the worst, but I'm afraid to ask if there's more. It a weird book, not in a bad way, but not in a great way. I'll try to read another book from this author, because of his style being different, not sure if it's going to work, but seems like it would be worth a try.

And I couldn't stop thinking on How to Train a Dragon (the whole series of movies) that were all so much more entertaining, fun and making more sense than this very very long book.In the book's world there are East and West that are very different, especially when it comes to dragons. In the West Queen Sabran believes her bloodline is keeping the mother of all Dragons from returning and therefore she has to give birth to an heir or else The Nameless One will rise. In the East the people want to become Dragonriders, to protect the world and keep the Nameless One away. It especially made sense to compare it to HTTAD because of the different approach to dragons in the different queendoms/kingdoms.

Her family, her friends, everyone she ever to be seem talking to. She was a true brat, and not a person that I think anyone can like. Even if she feels that the whole world is against here, which seems like how Thomas's characters tend to feel.So, in addition to this character there was a lot more on this book, that made me feel it's not my thing. The writing style was mediocre, the plot non-exist, the characters were flat and in the one case she had one dimension of complete disrespect.1 star. I just can't give it more (or less technically).

She curses like a sailor and has a romantic affair with another woman pilot.

Even when Jordan found out that Anneliese was lying about pretty much everything and they still decided to go like normal. But what drove me crazy was the zero moving pace of this book. You could cut it by half and it would still be too long and boring. It didn't even get to the point that the dialog was not convincing, it was just non-existent for the most part. It also doesn't help that the book has two narrations, and this time I cannot even tell which one was more boring.It could be very interesting, and I wish it was another author or another story about women during wwII.

Unfortunately, I feel the same weakness existed here. Actually, it was a little bit better, but really not enough to go through a bar of a really good book.Grace Healey is rebuilding her life after losing her husband during the war. ""Grand Central Terminal on her way to work, she finds an abandoned suitcase tucked beneath a bench. Unable to resist her own curiosity, Grace opens the suitcase, where she discovers a dozen photographs—each of a different woman."" Basically, Grace is a thief, because this is what most people call this action. But of course from that point on Grace is a saint and a detective. She needs to know who are these women, and is not willing to give even the police or the government the photos, because she is the best person to hold them, and as we see legally allowed to do so (?!).""The suitcase belonged to a woman named Eleanor Trigg, leader of a ring of female secret agents who were deployed out of London during the war. Twelve of these women were sent to Occupied Europe as couriers and radio operators to aid the resistance, but they never returned home, their fates a mystery. "" Actually, their fate is not such a mystery. But if anything, there were so many places in this book that the women that were sent to Europe could just write a huge sign ""Please Kill Me, I AM A SPY"". They made so many strange mistakes, some even worse than Grace stealing things that are not hers.Overall, I really tried to like this book, but it worked only very partially. With all the holes and lack of common sense of the characters actions, I have to go with 2 stars.

I got to know Taylor Jenkins Reid when her previous book The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo came out. I gave this book 5 stars, since Reid really knows how to portray a story and bring characters to life. This book is no different from that aspect, it is an amazing tale. Actually, the book started so real to me, that I started searching for Daisy Jones and also The Six, because they sounded too real to me, and I wanted to know if somehow I missed them. Only after a while I decided to check if they were fiction. Yes, she is that good.Daisy starts her story young and insecure. She tries to figure out who she is: I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing things I knew I didn’t want to be doing. But I’ve had a lot of therapy in my life now. And I mean a lot of therapy. And I see it now. I see myself clearly now. I wanted to be around these men—these stars—because I didn’t know how else to be important. And I figured I had to please them if I wanted to stay. Later on she finds herself, and she becomes a strong and expressive person. Reid continues to bring strong impressive female characters to the table.DAISY: I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else’s muse.I am not a muse.I am the somebody.End of fucking story.The Six's story starts separate, with Billy and Kamila's love story and conflicts. It has a beautiful love story, but that love doesn't feel too perfect and fictional. It is not clean of hard time, and of mistakes, pain and ups and downs. Daisy starts singing with The Six. And then again, it does not start like a pure fairy tale. And they grow to get to know each other. And like many musicians and bands, they go through drugs and alcohol, sex and other complications and lack of balance. And then again, it all feels real, and interesting, and tough, and sometimes make you smile, and sometimes feel bad. It does have some similarities to A Star is Born. And it is funny that they were created at the same time (and I understand that this one will become a movie too pretty soon). I do think that Reid has more depth, and I am really planning to read everything she is writing next. Another 5 stars for this author.

He was a very unusual writer that masters in writing about super grumpy old people who hide a heart of gold inside. I loved A Man Called Ove and really enjoed Britt-Marie Was Here. I also liked his novelas and especially The Deal of a Lifetime.Then he became different I didn't loved as much Beartown and even less Us Against You. Maybe he had too much pressure to publish, but the magic was fading.In this book he writes to his son, about fatherhood mostly. But I found it somewhere a long the lines of cheap standup comedy. For example poop is a big part of this write-up: Because I want you to understand that this whole parenthood thing isn’t as easy as it looks. There’s a hell of a lot to keep track of. Diaper bags. Car seats. Nursery rhymes. Extra socks. Poop. Above all, poop. There’s a lot of poop to keep track of. It’s nothing personal. You can ask any parent with small children. That whole first year, jeez, your entire life revolves around poop.The presence of poop. The absence of poop. The discovery of poop. The aromatic sensation of poop. The waiting for poop. Seriously, I can’t express how much of your life will be spent waiting for poop once you have children Here is some more of the jokes part, Google-it parenting: But my generation knows, OKAY? We know EVERYTHING! So if anything goes sideways with your childhood, I’ll be held responsible. It will never be legally sustainable that I acted “in good faith.” I could have googled it. I should have googled it. My God, why didn’t I google it?*** it.From here there is more ""crap"" and more ""poop"". Overall I believe that these words consist a large portion of the book:So we google things. We google everything. And we care about the environment. Because we didn’t inherit the Earth from our parents, we’re borrowing it from our children and all that crap. We believe in that crap! We’re ready to fight for that crap! We have framed posters with sunsets and rocks and really inspirational quotes and crap on them on our living room walls and everything!And when you’re standing there, in the storage section at IKEA, don’t focus too much on the furniture. Focus on the fact that you’ve actually found someone who can see themselves storing their crap in the same place as your crap. Because, hand on heart: you have a lot of crap.So, here we are. You and I. And the poop. In the dark.Personally, I do not find it funny. I don't find that sense of humor funny even when the people that use it excel in this as a specialty. I definitely did not expect from Backman to write such a book. And I wonder how many of Backman's fans are going to find out that this style is not what they expected. This book did remind me of another book that have the same concept, writing a letter for a future adult. It is the amazing Dear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. An inspiring and outstanding writeup by Chimamanda, who is really one of my top favorite authors. I can highly recommend this book, and I wish more of this type of writing will be adored and adopted by others.Sad 2 stars for Backman. I'll read books with less crap and poop in them. And I hope that Backman will go back into writing high quality books....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"May 19, 2019","May 19, 2019","May 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42833687-things-my-son-needs-to-know-about-the-world

Our story teller is Korede, the ugly sister of beautiful and enchanting Ayoola. I can see her trying to make the connection, measuring Ayoola’s looks against mine. The resemblance is there—we share the same mouth, the same eyes—but Ayoola looks like a Bratz doll and I resemble a voodoo figurine.Since Korede was a little girl she was the older sister of Ayoola. She is there to protect her. She is there to swallow her pride when her cooking is attributed to Ayoola. She is there to organize after her, and to clean after her. And also after her murderers. It all happens with Nigeria and with a beautiful knife. And somewhat with a reason.In this case, is only Ayoola the bad disturbed person, or also her sister, that with a very cold attitude cleaning and moving bodies around, for her sister of course. The angel of death sister, that can have a conversation like this: “How was your trip?”... “It was fine…except…he died.”And then Ayoola starts dating Tade, a doctor that Korede is in love with. And things get more complicated. To make it even more complicated Korede kept it quiet, except when she did say something to someone. Very well written, and very interesting setting. 4 stars.

Gurgeh is a player, a very successful one and a very bored one. He accepts an offer to play Azad in the next two years, a game that is used to determine social rank and political status. Several of his opponents played this for their entire lives. This game is much larger and more sophisticated than it looks, and overall maybe everyone is just a little pawn in great hands trying to achieve other political goals? As I said, I loved the concepts, but overall the dialog was abstract, and the plot drags quite a lot in the book. The book is very slow, and I wasn't interested much in the characters or the games. Even the parts that the author added about sex were not very interesting:“I feel you want to… take me,” Yay said, “like a piece, like an area. To be had; to be… possessed.” Suddenly she looked very puzzled. “There’s something very… I don’t know; primitive, perhaps, about you, Gurgeh. You’ve never changed sex, have you?” He shook his head. “Or slept with a man?” Another shake. “I thought so,” Yay said. “You’re strange, Gurgeh.” She drained her glass.My top favorite game/geek book is Ready Player One by Ernest Cline.

It was The Runaway Jury, and the main reason that I stopped reading it was that it was so wordy, and so details that over a hundred pages into the book the only thing that was described is the clothes in the closet of one of the characters. So many words and so little content. And I, that never DNFed anything, because I really wanted to find the bright spot in every single book decided that sometimes it is just not worth my time. Unfortunately, Grisham does continue with this line of writing. I gave this book a chance, since I hoped that being a non-fiction, maybe Grisham talent will be easier to digest, and a more interesting storytelling will emerge. The storyline, which is told the best by Grisham in the first 5 pages of the book, is interesting, and could have been a great book. Grisham though, decided to get into the minute detail in the lives of every person involved, and every conversation or investigation. Many of these details and descriptions just got me really bored and tired, and did not add up to the story. It is a story of a murder of Debbie Carter, and the story of Ron Williamson, a past baseball star that was a troubled adult and got accused because he looked right to the police. While this story is heartbreaking, much of the book is long long long word by word conversations and events. here is a tiny example:The lying continued. “Isn’t it true you were going to rob McAnally’s? We’ve got people who are going to testify to that.”Tommy shook his head and held firm, but he was deeply troubled. If the police were willing to lie so casually, what else might they do?Dennis Smith then pulled out a large photograph of Denice Haraway and held it close to Tommy’s face. “Do you know that girl?”“I don’t know her. I’ve seen her.”“Did you kill that girl?”“No, I didn’t. I wouldn’t take nobody’s life from them.”“Who did kill her?”“I don’t know.”Smith continued to hold the photo while asking if she was a pretty girl. “Her family would like to bury her. They’d like to know where she is so they could bury her.”“I don’t know where she’s at,” Tommy said, staring at the photo and wondering why he was being accused.“Would you tell me where she’s at so her family could bury her?”“I don’t know.”“Use your imagination,” Smith said. “Two guys took her, got her in a pickup, took her away. What do you think they did with the body?”“No telling.”“Use your imagination. What do you think?”“She could be alive for all I know, for all you know, for all anyone knows.” There are great books that talk about wrong conviction. Two that I loved were Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption by Jennifer Thompson-Cannino and The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row by Anthony Ray Hinton. There are great books about the injustice in the justice system, and one of the best is Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption by Bryan Stevenson. I would recommend to everyone to read a book about these topics. And Grisham's book is not my cup of tea, because it misses the story that is drowning in words. 2 stars (and probably no more Grisham for me). ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 21, 2019","May 21, 2019","Apr 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5345.The_Innocent_Man

My daughter loved this book, and that's probably telling much more than my personal opinion about this book. My most favorite animal book is still The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo, which is a true 5 stars for every age. Ivan is a gorilla that lives in a mall for 27 years. Across the parking lot the billboard beckons, as it always does: COME TO THE EXIT 8 BIG TOP MALL AND VIDEO ARCADE, HOME OF THE ONE AND ONLY IVAN, MIGHTY SILVERBACK!He is also an artist and a thinker. And seeing his new friend, young Ruby, an elephant is this captivity, make him see that they need to get out of there and go home. And he uses his art to try to help.Of course it is not easy being a gorilla that is so smart, no one wants to believe that a gorilla is actually capable of trying to tell you something. “Maybe it’s just a coincidence, Jules. You know, a once-in-a-trillion kind of thing, like that old saying about the chimp and the typewriter. Give him long enough and he’ll write a novel.”Maybe the most amazing part is that Ivan himself is based on a true story, even if the rest is fiction. From the author's notes: The One and Only Ivan is a work of fiction, but the inspiration for this imagined tale lies in a true story.Ivan, a real gorilla, now lives at Zoo Atlanta, but on the way to that happy ending, he spent almost three decades without seeing another of his own kind.After being captured as an infant in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Ivan’s twin sister died en route to the U.S. or shortly thereafter), Ivan was raised in a home until he became unmanageable. At that point he was added to an odd collection of animals housed at a circus-themed mall in Washington state.Ivan spent twenty-seven years of his life alone in a cage. Over time, as an understanding of primate needs and behavior grew, public discomfort with Ivan’s lonely state grew as well, particularly after he was featured in a National Geographic special entitled The Urban Gorilla. A public outcry followed, including heartfelt letters from children. When the mall where Ivan lived went bankrupt, he was placed on permanent loan to Zoo Atlanta, which houses the largest group of captive western lowland gorillas in the nation3+ stars for adults, but 4+ starts for kids, and since they are the target audience this will be the rating.

The voice was her voice and was ultra similar to Paris for One and Other Stories or After You (both are books of hers that I am really not a fan of). Moyes's only favorite for me is Me Before You, and I don't think that she succeeded to recreate the success, so we are still waiting. Actually the books are even similar in the protagonist name (Laurie here is Lu and Louisa in Moyes's Me Before You, is Lou and they of course are being pronounced the same). So our Lu here, falls in love with a guy that she saw from the bus window in the evening hours when it was dark. But oh wow, she knows that he is her one and only match, and she is looking for him for like a year (with the help of her friend Sarah). And then she does meet him, as the boyfriend of her best friend, guess what, Sarah. Coincidence? How did Sarah not catch from the description and helping to look for this guy that this might be the one? How can someone look for a person that they saw for about 5 seconds in the dark and decide that this is the only person that can be their one?Of course, now Lu needs to be in a close relationship with these two. Actually, the narration is intertwining between Lu and Jack, and I can't say that he is such an amazing guy to fall in love with (and I guess neither does Lu). Both of them are not extremely interesting characters. The biggest problem is that not much is happening, and we are talking about years and years of plot.If you love Moyes's every book you might really love this one. If you love romance and really want to believe in love at first (and very short and dark) sight you should definitely read this. If this genre is not your cup of tea, then find something else to read. Maybe on real amazing women like Hedy Lamarr in The Only Woman in the Room by Marie Benedict. 2 stars for this one.

But is is also a story of book, a story of libraries, even a story about homeless people that are finding shelter in libraries and the garden. It is a book about the history of the LA public library and the library directors, the volunteers and the patrons. It is a story about the telephone InfoNow support, where people can call and ask any weird questions.And it also follows the suspects and the investigation. And tells the story of the person that probably burned the library, and probably did it on purpose. And also, was never convicted. Partially, because he was a professional lier.InfoNow sounds like an amazing thing. It was closed though, but it is where callers called with any question or request for help. “Sometimes I’m amazed by what people call about,” she said, tapping her desk with a pencil. “Once, a patron called to ask if it was okay for her to eat a can of beans that didn’t have an expiration date. I mean, there is a website called Still Tasty that I use to check expiration dates on things, but I’m not going to take responsibility for a lady eating a can of beans!”“Hang on. InfoNow, can I help? Okay, okay . . . Did you say ‘What’s a cabana boy?’ ”“We get a lot of repeat callers,” said David Brenner, who was at the desk next to Princenthal’s. “We have an older gentleman who calls regularly with questions about mythology, science fiction, World War I, that sort of thing. He also always asks about a few actresses and celebrities, asking me if I know what’s going on with them. Actually, he asks about Juliette Lewis and the women in Pussy Riot.” “I swear some people have us on speed dial,” Brenner said, hanging up his call. “This woman—we call her ‘Fur’—she calls for spelling and grammar help all the time. She says she’s a poet. Sometimes she will call twenty-five times in an hour with editing questions.”I was very interested with the fact the library suffers from the same problems the city is suffering from. Every day, many homeless people come to the library, and many hang out in the garden and around the sides of the building. Some are doing nothing that is concerning, but they look unkempt and seem erratic; the air around them can feel charged and nervous-making. I have seen people drinking and using drugs in the garden—not in the building—and if I had a young child, I would be upset to be near them. I have seen people drinking and using drugs in public throughout the city, in parks, on sidewalks, at bus stops. Every problem that society has, the library has, too, because the boundary between society and the library is porous; nothing good is kept out of the library, and nothing bad. Often, at the library, society’s problems are magnified. Homelessness and drug use and mental illness are problems you see in every public place in Los Angeles. One difference is that if you see a mentally ill person on the street, you can cross to the other side. In a library, you share a smaller and more intimate space. The communal nature of a library is the very essence of the library, in the shared desks and shared books and shared restrooms.And because 80% of the patrons are men and 80% of librarians are women the LA library have a huge amount of security guards.I never heard about this fire before, and I did learn a lot about libraries, book preservation, and in general got some really interesting information through this book. As a book lover, some parts were extremely interesting. For example, the fact that you can freeze a book that got wet until someone salvages it. Overall, 3 stars (because there are some not-that-interesting parts as well)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 16, 2019","Jul 16, 2019","Apr 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39507318-the-library-book

It does not have much of a plot, and some parts of the plot I wasn't a huge fan of, but it is perfect for middle schoolers. It talks about love, and inviting someone for a date and also to the prom, it talks about friendship and has great drawings. It is worth mentioning that the book deals with sexual preferences and parents probably want at least to be aware of it. (Actually, part of what I didn't like was that some of it didn't make quite sense in the book). So for the book, the school is having a production where kids are playing all the roles, from the actors, to back stage and the crew. The kids are excited and each one is responsible for something, and we get to know Callie . The kid from last year lighting broke a bulb and was worried. Got lighting againCallie, an energetic and sweet 7th grader, who is doing the props. Callie is in love with a guy named Greg. Unfortunately he has a girlfriend named Bonnie, who is a real brat throughout the whole book. These two seem to break up and get back together, while Callie is on and off in love with Greg (who is not amazing himself for parts of this book).Now Callie meets two lovely guys, Jesse and Justin, 8th graders, twins that are found to be having a huge talent for the stage. Justin is gay and very confident. Jesse is more shy, and even though he is super talented doesn't have enough courage to take the stage, and decides to work with Callie backstage. From here, these guys get closer to each other, and with Liz, Callie's best friend, we learn to get to know everyone, and see the show's being woven and makes it to the opening night. Overall, it is a fun book, but very basic (and with a twist or two that I didn't find very realistic). 3 stars.If you like animated books I recommend anything by Sarah Andersen and especially Adulthood Is a Myth.

I didn't know what the book was about, and although I would not make the same choices like the protagonist, it was fun and almost kind of made sense.For months Holland Bakker was going deliberately into the subway station to listen to the captivating music performed by a street musician. And she had crush on him, and she went out of her way to see him and listen to him. She never actually talked to the stranger, but then came a night when she did. That happened on a night she was attacked on the subway rails, and Calvin (which Holland called Jack in her head) rescues her, and then quickly disappears when the police start asking questions. That is because the talented musician is illegal in this country, but he still wishes to stay and be found and become a famous and successful musician. Actually, it reminded me a bit the story where a famous musician actually did play in the subway, and people didn't even get the genius of it just because they assume someone in the subway is probably not that of a great artist. (check Famous Violinist Joshua Bell plays in the subway). Anyway, Holland's uncle, who is pretty much a father for her, is Broadway’s hottest musical director. How convenient and awesome. But of course, he cannot hire a person without a work permit. Now, what can they do? So she decides to marry Calvin. Which is kind of crazy, and also kind of stupid because she has a crush on him. And stuff happens, because they have to live in the same apartment, and now Holland gets to know Calvin for real.Yes, there were cheesy parts. Yes, there were some parts that were not greatly written. But overall it was fun, pretty well written, quite entertaining, and overall good. I really liked the characters portraying, and especially how Holland learned finally that her best friend, Lulu, is actually not a friend, and that she should decide what to do with this unhealthy so-called friendship.Almost 4 stars.

And I have to emphasize how much I agree with so much that is written in this book. All of us want to see ourselves as progressive, caring, good human beings. No one likes to be pointed out as racist, which is clearly a bad human being. No one. And definitely not us. We? Racists? How can that be?But the world for black people is much more complicated than clear upfront racism. Racism exists in comments, in jokes, in comparisons (by the way, sexism exists in that way too, and not just in a cleat sexual harassment or touching someone). And yes, many white people are somewhat racist, even if not all the time. And many hate that it is being pointed out to them. We want to be color blind, but it is not possible. Actually to be color blind is also not making any progress with treating black people fairly. We have to get closer if we really want to change anything, it is not going to work if we never talk, never study in the same schools, never shop in the same places. And to say the truth, we all know it: Many people of color have shared with me that they don’t bother giving feedback to a white person if they think the individual is unwilling to accept it; they either endure the microaggressions or drift away from the relationship. They do not feel close to white people to whom they can’t speak honestly about racism, and these relationships always have a degree of distance and inauthenticity. While we worry that if we have revealed our racism in any way, the people of color in our lives will give up on us, I have found the opposite to be true. When we engage with the feedback and seek to repair the breach, the relationship deepens. Trying to explain away our racism does not fool people of color or bring them closer.And now just look at these scenarios, race is still shameful, but only when it is black or not white:To illustrate an early lesson in white racial framing, imagine that a white mother and her white child are in the grocery store. The child sees a black man and shouts out, “Mommy, that man’s skin is black!” Several people, including the black man, turn to look. How do you imagine the mother would respond? Most people would immediately put their finger to their mouth and say, “Shush!” When white people are asked what the mother might be feeling, most agree that she is likely to feel anxiety, tension, and embarrassment. Indeed, many of us have had similar experiences wherein the message was clear: we should not talk openly about race. When I use this example with my students, sometimes a student will say that the mother is just teaching her child to be polite. In other words, naming this man’s race would be impolite. But why? What is shameful about being black—so shameful that we should pretend that we don’t notice?31 The mother’s reaction would probably be the same if the man had a visible disability of some kind or was obese. But if the child had seen a white person and shouted out, “Mommy, that man’s skin is white!” it is unlikely that the mother would feel the same anxiety, tension, and embarrassment that would have accompanied the first statement. Now imagine that the child had shouted out how handsome the man was, or how strong. These statements would probably be met with chuckles and smiles. The child would not likely be shushed, because we consider these statements compliments.Overall, this book is very important, and I agree with almost everything written in it. My only issue was that it was very repetitive. So overall the book is too long, and some of the great things get lost when it becomes almost boring. Almost 3.5 stars, and should have been more. This book reminded me a lot of So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo. But maybe the best books that will get people to understand how it feel are books by the amazing Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who is giving the strongest message throughout her talented storytelling....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 08, 2019","Apr 08, 2019","Apr 08, 2019",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/43708708-white-fragility

I really didn't like the previous book by Greer Hendricks. This book was much better than the previous one, it started pretty awesome even, with the protagonist reminding a bit of Lu from Me Before You by Jojo Moyes. A girl, a makeup artist, that needs money and come from a family with a bad financial state, finds an opportunity to take part in research and get paid for it. And a lot!Jess decides to take a chance for this research about honesty and ethics, which is kind of funny since she got in a very deceitful way. Quickly she gets very close with Dr. Shields, and she find things about herself, about Dr Shields and slowly the truth about this research.Halfway through the book it all started dragging. It was a feeling of nothing new is being added one page after the next, until Greer decided to save us with a resolution at the end. The two points of view were written find, and helped getting to know the characters. Dr Shields, made sense as the manipulative therapist conducting the survey, and Jess, the participant, that is somewhere between naive and low class not so innocent person herself.Overall, almost 3 stars, because it had a core that is good, and it started very well. Even with all the dragging it is still above 2 stars, but definitely cannot go with the crowd of 4+ stars.

I read her first one, The Other Einstein which was so much better book about Einstein than Einstein: His Life and UniveI love Marie Benedict so much. I read her first one, The Other Einstein which was so much better book about Einstein than Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson (which is way too wordy in all of his books, and tends to be more one sided). Even though her Einstein book is somewhat fiction, and no one knows exactly how much. Benedict is telling the story of the silenced women, the ones that are behind a wall of non-existence, or in Lamarr's case, beautiful and silent existence. These women who are strong, extremely smart, and actually have an amazing story of their own and it needs to be heard, and we need more of these. Benedict is such an amazing story teller, that there are very few dull moments in the whole book.  Did you people know that Hedy Lamarr was so much more than a pretty face? Not just more than, she was an inventor and one that invented super complex patents that exists in every cell phone, but that also improved massively spread-spectrum technology and wired torpedoes to remote control and safe ones? But how on earth did an invention patented by a dazzling movie star in 1942 eventually become part of the foundation for the modern cell phone, a device that has transformed our world? If that's not enough reason to read this book, and learn more about this woman I am not sure what is.Hedy Lamar was born as a jewish girl in Austria. Her name was Hedwig Kiesler. Her family was not exactly jewish, she didn't even really know what it means, but closer to WWII that was not important. At 19, she married Fritz Mandl, who was much older than her and very very rich (and an was also armaments manufacturer and arms dealer, and sold weapon pretty much to everyone). He was not a great person, or a great husband, but definitely had a huge affect on Hedy's life. She was an actress before, and with these marriage, she had to stop acting. Fritz controlled Hedy in every possible way, but she was useful even to him a little bit more than a beautiful artwork, since she could listen and understand what people said around her. His controlling started even before the wedding when he decided on her dress, the venue and everything else. Let's say that no one cried a river when she left him forever.From there starts her Hollywood chapter, and Hedy does not let anyone own her again. She is a smart woman, an excellent negotiator, a funny, witty and beyond forgettable. And no one probably thinks that there is a genius mind in this beautiful woman, but oh wow! Hedy never forgot Europe, the war, the jews, and her mom (which she got out of there at some point). She knew things about Hitler's plan, that she overheard from Hitler and his people, and she couldn't stop thinking what it. But she also knew things about war technology and its weak points, and her inventions came from there (at least at the start), merging that with her renewed passion for art. I was so enthusiastic to see the relationship between playing a piano and torpedos and frequencies, brilliant!!! Hedy's father was an excellent father, and if there is one person except Hedy herself that we can attribute having such a talented amazing Hedy, that would be her loving and respectful father. He believed in her, he taught her to think, he questioned with her, and supported her. Strong women are best if they have strong fathers standing by them. I wish for every child to have a father like Hedy had. Of course there was sexism that made me furious, and unfortunately, our world even right at this moment have a ton of sexism in it. Here you go: “I’m a big fan of your work, and I speak for all of us here in saying we appreciate the incredible efforts you and Mr. Antheil have undertaken here. But my advice to you is this—stick to your films. They help lift people’s spirits. But if you’re bound and determined to help with the war effort, we think you’d be better able to assist by selling war bonds than building torpedoes. Instead of focusing on all this weapons stuff, why don’t you help us raise money to win the war against the Japs and the Krauts?”No matter the sexism that I knew well permeated the very fiber of my world, I couldn’t believe his words. These men were rejecting a system that would enable a plane or ship to steer a whole fleet of torpedoes against enemy vessels with perfect accuracy, without any capacity on the enemy’s part to jam the necessary radio signals. How could the military allow their soldiers and sailors to lose on the seas—to be killed in vast numbers—because they wouldn’t use a weapon system designed by a woman?I wish I could say the world is different today, and people will embrace people like Lamarr, not just on stage, but also for their brains. I think we will need a couple of more years before there is a decent amount of equal opportunities and embracing women (and men) in all fields.5 stars for the book, millions of stars to the star Hedy Lamarr!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 09, 2019","May 09, 2019","Mar 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39971465-the-only-woman-in-the-room

I have never heard about her before (because I am clueless and know stuff mostly frKamala Harris is a very interesting person, and a very honest one. I have never heard about her before (because I am clueless and know stuff mostly from books), but I saw this book on the best seller list and decided to check it out. She is a daughter to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she lived in a busing area (my elementary school class was only the second class in my city to be desegregated through busing>), still with very good background and a mother that was a breast cancer scientist. And she has values that I hope we can all admire. From the writing perspective I did like Elizabeth Warren's style better, she is an amazing woman and a great write. And I can only recommend This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class, but both of these women are outstanding.It is quite amazing to me how many of the politicians in America (or maybe in the democratic side) come with background of law school and work. That is including Warren and the Obamas. Several topics that I loved hearing about and knowing they are on her radatr. The first one was racial inequality in the justice system: One thing we must do is take on, head-on, the racial bias that operates throughout our criminal justice system. And that effort starts with our stating clearly and unequivocally that black lives matter—and speaking truth about what that means. The facts are clear: Nearly four years after Ferguson, Missouri, became the flashpoint for the Black Lives Matter movement, the state attorney general reported that black drivers there are 85 percent more likely to be pulled over than their white neighbors. Across the nation, when a police officer stops a black driver, he is three times more likely to search the car than when the driver is white. Black men use drugs at the same rate as white men, but they are arrested twice as often for it. And then they pay more than a third more than their counterparts, on average, in bail. Black men are six times as likely as white men to be incarcerated. And when they are convicted, black men get sentences nearly 20 percent longer than those given to their white counterparts. Latino men don’t fare much better. It is truly appalling....The criminal justice system punishes people for their poverty. Where is the justice in that? And where is the sense? How does that advance public safety? Between 2000 and 2014, 95 percent of the growth in the jail population came from people awaiting trial. This is a group of largely nonviolent defendants who haven’t been proven guilty, and we’re spending $38 million a day to imprison them while they await their day in court. Whether or not someone can get bailed out of jail shouldn’t be based on how much money he has in the bank. Or the color of his skin: black men pay 35 percent higher bail than white men for the same charge. Latino men pay nearly 20 percent more. This isn’t the stuff of coincidences. It is systemic. And we have to change it.She is also talking about children separated from their parents and the problem with this:Shortly thereafter, Elaine Duke, the deputy secretary of homeland security, appeared before the Homeland Security Committee. “Do you know when this is supposed to take effect?” I asked her, trying to gauge the likelihood that something so atrocious could be under way.“It is not a decision,” she said. “The Secretary—I talked to him personally about it. He considers it still a possibility. They are looking at a wide range of deterrents, and it was raised as a possible method of deterrence but there is no decision made and there is no implementation plan currently.”It was an unacceptable answer. The next month, when Kelly appeared before the committee, I grilled him on the issue. He was evasive about whether this policy was under consideration, but he refused to rule it out.“So are you unwilling, sir, to issue a written directive that it is the policy of this department to not separate children from their mothers unless the life of the child is in danger?”“I don’t need to do that.”I continued to press for answers through the end of 2017 and into 2018, but DHS was not forthcoming. Then, on April 6, 2018, Attorney General Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy at the border, meaning that the administration would refer for criminal prosecution any adult crossing the border illegally, regardless of the reason, and that this could include separating children from their parents. We learned through a New York Times report several days later that, despite DHS’s insistence that there was no separation policy, seven hundred children had been separated from their parents since the previous October, including one hundred who were under the age of four.There are few things more cruel, more inhumane, more fundamentally evil than ripping a child from her parent’s arms. We should all know this to be true on a gut level. But if we needed more proof, we could look at a statement released by Dr. Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, on behalf of the organization, stating that she was appalled by the new policy. Dr. Kraft wrote about the extraordinary stress and trauma of family separation, which “can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture and affecting his or her short- and long-term health.” These findings are shared by the American Medical Association, which has called for an end to the policy, noting that the children the U.S. government is forcibly separating from their parents may be scarred for life.“What purpose have you been given for separating parents from their children?”“So my decision has been that anyone who breaks the law will be prosecuted. If you’re a parent or you’re a single person or you happen to have a family, if you cross between the ports of entry we will refer you for prosecution. You have broken U.S. law.”Again I pressed. “So your agency will be separating children from their parents—”“No, what we’ll be doing is prosecuting parents who have broken the law, just as we do every day in the United States of America.”“But if that parent has a four-year-old child, what do you plan on doing with that child?”“The child, under law, goes to HHS for care and custody.”“They will be separated from their parent. And so my question—”“Just like we do in the United States every day.”“So they will be separated from their parent, and my question then is when you are separating children from their parents, do you have a protocol in place about how that should be done and are you training the people who will actually remove a child from their parent on how to do that in the least traumatic way? I would hope you do train on how to do that, and so the question is, and the request has been, to give us the information about how you are training and what the protocols are for separating a child from their parent.”“I’m happy to provide you with the training information,” she said, though she never did. Once again, Nielsen made the false claim that she had stuck with through the entire process: “Again, we do not have a policy to separate children from their parents,” she said. “Our policy is if you break the law, we will prosecute you. You have an option to go to a port of entry and not illegally cross into our country.”And she is talking about the environment (and mentioning Israelis on the way): There’s a lot we can learn from friends and partners who have already made such investments—especially Israel, a global leader on water security issues. In February 2018, I traveled to Israel and toured its Sorek desalination plant, which uses reverse osmosis to produce clean drinking water from the sea. I had a glass. It tasted as good as any water I’ve ever had.And that’s not all. As many have said, the Israelis have made the desert bloom. They’ve done so in part by successfully reclaiming 86 percent of their wastewater and purifying it for agricultural reuse. By contrast, the United States, which produces 32 billion gallons of municipal wastewater each day, reclaims only 7 to 8 percent. Surely we can do better than that.Kamalas knows that Superheroes fight back, and she is definitely one of them. She fights for very important causes, that are important to every single person, and her godson knows that as well:At a certain point, my nine-year-old godson, Alexander, came up to me with big tears welling in his eyes. I assumed one of the other kids in our group had been teasing him about something.“Come here, little man. What’s wrong?”Alexander looked up and locked eyes with mine. His voice was trembling. “Auntie Kamala, that man can’t win. He’s not going to win, is he?” Alexander’s worry broke my heart. I didn’t want anyone making a child feel that way. Eight years earlier, many of us had cried tears of joy when Barack Obama was elected president. And now, to see Alexander’s fear . . .His father, Reggie, and I took him outside to try to console him.“Alexander, you know how sometimes superheroes are facing a big challenge because a villain is coming for them? What do they do when that happens?”“They fight back,” he whimpered.“That’s right. And they fight back with emotion, because all the best superheroes have big emotions just like you. But they always fight back, right? So that’s what we’re going to do.”I loved the fact that she is so open and that we have more strong women that speak up and becoming more visible. These arenas are extremely men dominated and it is not easy. A report in 2015 found that 95 percent of our country’s elected prosecutors were white, and 79 percent were white men. She talks about failures (like when she failed the law school state bar exam, how she felt and what people said. She is talking about being single and dating in her 40s. She does not leave personal areas out of sight and allows the reader to get to know her. 4 stars for the book.

I was mostly interested in catching Eichmann and the story around it. I felt that this was one where the author has put all the details and took the time to really tell a story. In many of the other cases later, I felt the author rushed into telling a quick summary, and it was less compelling in the way it was told. I was always very interested in the Holocaust, and this book brings information of after the war, and how Nazis were found after trying to disappear.Eichmann was caught because of love. A love story between his son, Nick, and a half Jewish woman in Argentina. When she figured that this might be Eichmann, she helped catching him, and the story is really interesting.And it is love that is finally flushing Adolf Eichmann from hiding. His twenty-year-old son Nicholas—known alternately as Klaus or Nick—has adapted well to life in Buenos Aires. While his father still pretends to be Ricardo Klement, his four sons keep the family surname. The tall, blue-eyed Nicholas is fond of riding horses and hunting pumas. He frequently spouts anti-Semitic rhetoric, so it will one day surprise him to learn that the pretty German immigrant, with whom he has fallen in love, is half-Jewish.It was also interesting how they missed Eichmann at some point mistaking the owner of the house, an Austrian person to be Eichmann and not checking the tenant.The south America and especially Peron's relationship with the Nazis was very interesting, and explained a lot of how Nazis hid for years in Argentina and the area. Juan and Eva Perón’s deep ties to the Nazi Party. During Perón’s previous career as a military attaché, he toured Germany just as the Second World War began. In the process, he developed a disturbing respect for the efficient manner in which the Nazis waged war. He also shares their anti-Semitic views and actively works to prevent Jewish migration to Argentina. Perón’s personal secretary and intelligence chief, Rodolfo “Rudi” Freude, is a Nazi sympathizer whose father funneled German money into Perón’s first presidential election campaign in 1946.It is a very easy read, and if everything would be told in the same way like the Eichmann story I would go with 4 stars.

David Sheff wrote a book about his son Nic, and about the period when he was addict to CrystThis book is so painful, and so hard to read as a parent. David Sheff wrote a book about his son Nic, and about the period when he was addict to Crystal Meth. An addiction the ruins the body, the brain, and the relationships in the house. The addiction took over Nic, and it also took over David and his wife Karen, and his two little siblings, Daisy and Jasper. Nic lost everything he had, he was a bright young man that could not resist drugs, and he gave his life to this addiction starting a very early age of 12 with pot. And of course there was an excuse: ""It's hard. I don't know. Everybody drinks. Everybody smokes."" What Nic had throughout the whole time is parents who love him and care for him. I can't describe David's way of caring for Nic and trying to save him. From looking for him on the streets to putting him in rehab, again and again and again. This all happened while Nic was breaking into his home, disappearing and almost dying from OD several times. My heart wrenched throughout the book, and I am so happy that Nic found his way in the end. We cannot live for our children, nor making choices for them. My children will live with or without me. It is a staggering realization for a parent, but one that ultimately frees us to let our children grow up. David blamed himself for divorcing Nic's mom when Nic was 5, and maybe there was something to it, or maybe not. Many drug addicts come from intact families.The most painful times were the relapses. He's clean for some time and lapse back. relapse is often part of recovery, but the recovery is hard and looks impossible, and is not working for all. And on the way there are people that cannot live their lives, and two children that are worried about their big brother and very affected by his addiction. His disappearances and reappearances are cruel and painful, and he can't control these as well. David summarizes his journey and mentions not giving money to frug addicts: I would not in any way help someone using drugs to do anything other than return to rehab. I would not pay their rent, would not bail them out of jail unless they went directly into rehab, even then would not repeatedly bail them out, would not pay their debts, and would never give them money.And he further shows the compassion of a parent, and our wishes for our children to live a happy and full lives, even when it is not up to his original expectations: At least he's alive. I have also learned (the hard way because, as it turns out, there's no other way to learn such lessons) that parents are more flexible with our hopes and dreams for our children than we ever imagined. When Nic was growing up, I thought I would be content with whatever choices he made in his life. But the truth was that I fully expected he would go to college. Of course he would. It was never questioned. I pictured him in a satisfying job, with a loving relationship, and eventually with children of his own. However, with his escalating drug use I have revised my hopes and expectations. When college seemed unlikely, I learned to live with the idea that he would skip college and go right to work. After all, many kids take a circuitous route to find themselves. But that began to seem unrealistic, and so I concluded that I would be content if he found a sense of peace. Now I live with the knowledge that, never mind the most modest definition of a normal or healthy life, my son may not make it to twenty-one.And maybe the most important he is being reminded to live his own life, even when addiction his hitting his own son, he can't care only for Nic and forget everyone else. ""Be allies. Remember, take care of yourselves. You'll be good for no one—for each other, for your children—if you don't.""5 stars.

This book gives a very interesting point of view on the lifeI actually never thought that an animated book can be so great and on such a heavy topic. This book gives a very interesting point of view on the life of Jeff Dahmer. For people who do not know who he is, he was one of the infamous serial killers and he killed 17 men and boys. The guy that is telling the story is Neil, who was at high school with Dahmer. They had quite similar lives on the surface, both of their fathers were chemists, they both had one brother. They were actually kind of friends.But Dahmer was wired all along. He did have friends in high school but they figured that it's a school friendship and didn't feel comfortable to hang out with him in the afternoon. And he had this fantasy of unconscious man. He even wanted to try his fantasy and hit a runner that ran next to his isolated house, but luckily for this guy he didn't show up on that day.It was hard to be homosexual at the 1970s. And Dahmer's house was quite ruined, his mother was depressed and self medicating to unconsciousness, his father left. At some point he was all alone. Dahmer started drinking (only at school, 6 pack before 8am), and no one saw anything. And other kids were cruel to this weird guy. And he showed signs of cruelty very early, happy to see dead animal and messing up with them.It is a waste to know that Dahmer was really smart and charming. He even once convinced the Vice President of the US crew to get them a private tour of the office. But his life circumstances and his choices left him with a very different path, a dark one with many people dead. Dahmer story is well known, including the part that with the first time the he killed, that same day he was stopped by the police. The man that he killed, a poor hitch hiker, was stuffed in garbage bags in his truck. The police even opened the truck, and saw the garbage bags. And Dahmer told them a story that he is on his way to the dump site to throw these away because his parents will be angry if they come back and see that he forgot to take the trash out. Just painful to imagine that many lives would be spared. If you are into true crime, I highly recommend to read this book. Great animations, and very interesting insights of a serial killer in the making. 4+ stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 24, 2019","Apr 24, 2019","Mar 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12959045-my-friend-dahmer

It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book.

I really liked The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo by Amy Schumer, and I thought it is going to the same direction. I never heard about her before, or saw any picture of hers, but gave it a shot anyway, since the book is rated so high by so many people.And so I did like her at the beginning: Once, a (former) guy friend of mine, who happens to be gorgeous and famous and all of the things, said this to me: “You know, I think people would consider you really beautiful, if only you didn’t talk so much. Your personality is just a lot. Don’t get me wrong, I love you, but I think people get distracted by that.”My clear reaction should have been, “Ewww. Go fuck yourself.”But for so long, even with my strong personality, telling a man to fuck off wasn’t easy for me to do. Instead, I would just nod and laugh and agree, “Hahaha. Yeah,” and then swallow whatever insult and seethe later. And men should not count women's personalities against them, and then I started by cheering to Busy, and hoped to see what comes next. Quickly after, I found out the for the most part, this book is the love life of Busy. There was not much of Busy herself, just a lot about Busy and boys, boys and Busy. And truly, I wasn't very interested in that. And there a few other stories, like slitting her wrist or dislocating her knee, or getting lost at two because she decided to take off, but there were nice and not much more.* I was furious founding out that she went through rape that as her first intimate act with a guy. I feel very sad for Busy, and so many other women, who go through violence and force. That did not make the book any better though.Overall, it was about 2.5 stars for me.

It is a well known childhood classic, and even me who is not a native English speaking person knew the lines:“Mistress Mary, quite contrary,How does your garden grow?With silver bells, and cockle shells,And marigolds all in a row.”Mistress Mary comes to England from India after both of her parents died. And they were not nice people to start with. Mary, a neglected child, behaves quite awful at the beginning when she got to her uncle's place. And very quickly after she found a secret garden, his dead wife's beautiful and locked garden. She finds the key, and she also find slowly the key to herself and better behavior. I guess the bottom line is that people can change, and that attitude is a key. My issue was that the pace was super slow, and that so many parts of the book really did not find my interest. And I really tried hard, I actually got back to read from the beginning after I figured that my trained of thoughts has left and was somewhere else completely. I was finding it hard to see that children can be fixing their lives with fresh air and a secret garden and not much more. And that is the case for both Mary and Colin. Probably this book works much better in younger ages. For me it was a 2 stars book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 26, 2019","Jun 26, 2019","Feb 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2998.The_Secret_Garden

It was interesting reading about times that the land was new and chThis book was an interesting read especially for the historical value and context. It was interesting reading about times that the land was new and cheap, and that people had very hard times on many different fronts. It reminded me a little of book by the outstanding Wallace Stegner and the talented John Steinbeck. Both are giving so much of the feeling of how it felt to be in this time (both of them are more California people though).So for whomever wants to know about the High Plains (because I personally needed to check): The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains mostly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota, generally encompassing the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains. The High Plains are located in southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and south of the Texas Panhandle.I especially liked the historical parts that shed light on things that are quite different than today. For example when some people wanted to close the whorehouse, and that someone claimed that they need the girls:But Dalhart needed to be slapped to its senses time and again, and it was the job of the loudest voice in the Panhandle to do just that. McCarty could not stand that the one business still thriving in Dalhart was the whorehouse.... ""SO THE PEOPLE MAY KNOW"" was his headline for the next day's Texan. When he took the page dummy to the shop, his printer shook his head. He refused to print it. The printer had lived in Dalhart since its creation and he knew the Number 126 like people knew Rita Blanca Canyon south of town. McCarty was indignant. This whorehouse was a sore on the face of Dalhart; it had to go. It was one thing to be invisible at the edge of town but another to flash and parade painted women and their dresses and the pink Caddy. Sorry, Mr. McCarty, the printer said. Can't do it. Won't do it. We need them girls. McCarty pulled his story.It was also interesting and sad to read about antisemitism in the book. Blaming the Jews for anything that happen, and being especially unhappy and mean about these with money. Here you can see that some people even thought that at least ""Blacks had some virtues"" (well, I guess slaves are always useful, ugh): ""I appreciate the old darkie who comes to me talking softly in that humble spirit which should characterize their actions and dealings with the white man,"" he said to wide applause at the constitutional convention. Murray hated Jews as well. Blacks had some virtues, but Jews had none, in his view. Nor did he like the handful of Italians who had come to the High Plains. The ""low grade races"" of southern Europe, he said, were a threat to civilization. Oklahoma became the forty-sixth state only after President Theodore Roosevelt forced Murray to remove the segregationist planks of the constitution. Murray was furious; he never let go of his grudge against the Roosevelt family.I want to highlight one more thing that I learned from this book, and it's about Hoover's arrogance, and it also shows how much everyone need to be careful on what they are saying, especially if they want to run for office in the future: Hoover was an engineer and entrepreneur who was worth four million by the start of the First World War. As president, his past statements haunted him like a bill collector. It was not just his inaugural prediction that the United States was close to eliminating poverty forever, nor his prosperity-around-the-corner forecasts. One statement, defining character by how much money somebody had, followed Hoover everywhere. ""If a man has not made a million dollars by the time he is forty, he is not worth much,"" Hoover had said in the giddy days, when America was a crapshoot with good odds.Very Interesting read. Personally the writing style felt to me very old fashion, so I almost couldn't believe it was published in 2006. 3+ stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 10, 2019","Feb 10, 2019","Feb 10, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40961608-the-worst-hard-time

It is an unusual point of view on serial killers victims. Kerri's life changed forever in a heart bit, she is the daughter of BTK, Bind-Torture-Kill. Her father, an almost perfect family man, killed 10 people, including 2 children, a few of them after she was born and just a few feet away from her house. The book starts with the FBI agent coming to speak to Kerri. The scene actually speaks loud. Kerri's father, had put fears in her from strangers, and for a good reason. He knew what dangers are out there better than anyone. She saw a man looking into their house, and then approaching the door. She takes the safety steps that her father taught her to take, until the painful moment that her father image shutters, and now she knows that he is the infamous BTK. I propped my wire-rim glasses on my head and squinted through the peephole to see a man in his fifties wearing a dress shirt. Tie. Glasses.I twisted my glasses in my hands and placed them back on my face.“Hello? Can I help you?” I called from my side of the subpar door.“Yes. I’m with the FBI. I need to speak with you.”...Dad always said, “Make them show you a badge. Make them prove to you who they are.” Not that anyone, ever, had approached my door with a badge, but I guess there was a first time for everything.I opened the door a bit, putting my foot next to it. If he was FBI, he might or might not push his way in. Hard to say, based on what I’d seen in movies.He didn’t look like FBI. He looked like someone who might do my taxes.“So, uh, can I see your ID?”“Yes.” He flipped opened his badge and let me study it for a bit, then asked more softly, “Can I come in? I need to talk to you.”Okay . . . but what the heck?“Sure. My husband will be home soon. He’s on his way. You know, for lunch?”That’s another trick Dad taught me long ago: tell the stranger in your house someone is on the way, even if it’s not true.The most painful parts to read were the flashes that Kerri had. It can't be true. But it must be very true. He was perfect, and a perfect dad, except when he wasn't. He was sometimes unpredictable, and he was full of rage, and her mother knew how to send him away in these moments. And he wasn't home on the nights that women were murdered. He wasn't home. And he did try to strangle his own son twice with rage, and the mother and Kerri stopped him. Mom’s voice rose; it was direct but strained: “No, he never sexually abused me or the kids. He never hit us. The police asked the first day.”He never hit, but he still could be abusive physically. Brian. He tried to strangle Brian twice. The first time was over noodles being spilled: My dad, red-faced, wound tight, leaped up from his chair, full of rage. Standing in the middle of broken plates, tomato sauce, and noodles, he lunged at my brother. Facing him, putting his hands around his neck, Dad began to choke him.Dad’s eyes and face were blazing, close to manic. My brother, terrified, turned white. Yelling, Mom and I pushed at Dad and were able to break it up.Overall, he is described like a caring person and a loving dad and son. He did go overboard and didn't have the right borders sometimes, but I don't think that it was easy to guess that he was the BTK. Mom told me later that Dad had wept over his father’s body. Wrecked with grief, he had walked hunched over down the hospital hallway. She said, “I don’t think your dad had ever sat beside someone who died before.”Kerri lost her father. He did not die, but it was even worse. She was his victim, her family was his victim. Others were tortured and murdered by him, but their family was changed with no way back. And she is lost, and confused, and she remembers. There is a man . . . FBI . . . your dad is . . . Dad can’t be.... Dad can’t be. Dad is. A man. FBI.For a while Kerri wasn't Kerri anymore. She was the daughter of the BTK. She was in the papers. I was the daughter of a serial killer, and I didn’t know anyone else like me. She had a father that she knew, or that they thought they knew, and they found out that they really didn't.I'll leave this with one last citation that I found extremely interesting: “I asked your dad once why would BTK use a cereal box to communicate with the police—like it was reported in the news. He said, ‘Cereal—like a serial killer.’”Kerri lost her dad, but finally she found her way out of the shame, and she shares her story with all of us. An intriguing and honest story, of a wonderful woman that had this little tiny chance of being born to a terrible horrible killer. 4+ stars....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 13, 2019","Apr 13, 2019","Feb 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38915935-a-serial-killer-s-daughter
