NEXT, we have so many weird moments in this book. i think they're meant to be ""humorous, but they came across as cringe to me and it just gave so much second hand embarrassment. from accidentally finding themselves at a SEX PARTY (how could dean possibly see this betrayal coming from his coworker that has done nothing but backstab him) to solange's cousin making dean wear a electrode BIRTHING SIMULATOR so he can feel the pain she's going through, there were so many moments that made me truly question why i wasn't dnfing this book already. we also cannot forget that poem dean recites that genuinely made me laugh from the absurdity, cringe, and pain I was feeling in that moment. also i don't like the way the relationship between dean and solange built up. there wasn't enough build up! which is the best part of reading romance! idk i just never connected to their romance and i got sick of them. and like most other romance books, this was very character-driven, which became just a little problematic when I disliked all the characters. the ending also tested me so hard. you don't know how much strength in my body I had to summon to get through those last few chapters. we get the revelation with kimberly and nia which made me roll my eyes. we get the full circle las vegas moment, which could have had the potential to be cute, but came across as cringe because of how much i disliked the rest of the book. and we get such a cliche happily ever after epilogue ending. overall, this book gets two stars for the glimpse and shred of hope I had that this would be a somewhat enjoyable read in the first few chapters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jun 20, 2022","Jun 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55506996-the-wedding-crasher

I am usually not one to DNF books, but I made it a goal of mine this year to not waste my time and just quit books that aren't enjoyable and don't look like they're going to get much better. first of all, this whole plot of ari/russell working together to magically save their bosses' ex-relationship was just too unrealistic to me! they were previously married, then divorced and in the beginning of the book, they absolutely despise each other. they go into screaming fights, throw stuff at each other, and go through such lengths to make sure the other's day is crushed and ruined to oblivion. HOWEVER, their relationship magically gets fixed after A FEW curated meetups on behalf of ari/russell. russell takes his boss to a hockey game and INSTANTLY gets him to spill about the status of his relationship and how he's always been in love with her and is so sorry and wants to do whatever he can to get back with her. like really? you torture this woman at work all the time. this man cannot be for real. it's the same with ari's boss too. also I did not feel the connection I wanted to with ari and russell!! they were just so mid. usually I read a lot of books that are rivals or enemies to lovers so you kinda get a bit of that romantic tension already built in, but because this book was friends to lovers, it had to do more to fulfill that and unfortunately could not. you could tell they were into each other from the very start, I did not like the buildup, and it was SO UPSETTING. overall, unfortunately this one just didn't work out for me.

I think that a lot of my problems with the book has to be with the plot and the depth of characters.I thought that the plot got somewhat repetitive after the first few husbands. A lot of the book was Evelyn using different men as a shield for her love for Celia, and it just fed into the constant back and forth with Evelyn and Celia’s relationship. I felt like the same thing was happening over and over again. Evelyn falls in love with Celia, marries a man to prevent her career from collapsing as a bisexual, realizes she still wants to be with Celia, marries a man to mask her relationship with Celia, over and over again. And the thing is, maybe it would have been okay if I liked the characters more, but I didn’t like them enough for me to enjoy it.As for the whole plot with Monique and her problems, I just didn’t really care. To be honest, I may or may not remember what happens with her because I skimmed through her chapters, but I just didn’t find her interesting. The reason why Evelyn chose to interview her was kind of predictable. Going back to the characters, Evelyn was definitely a bad person at some parts, but I think they worked because of how she was supposed to be portrayed as a flawed character. She did what she wanted and was unapologetic about everything. I still think that Celia deserved better in their relationship, but it’s whatever. Their back and forth bothered me, and while I didn’t mind them too much individually, I found their relationship was kind of toxic. When it came to all of the other characters, they just felt like cliche caricatures. There were too many people and not enough book space and a lot of them felt so shallow and flat. Like okay we have a pedophile, an abusive guy that seemed perfect at first glance, some random dude that lasted a chapter, and others that I just didn’t really care about. I know they’re just there for the whole seven husbands plot, but it made the chapters featuring their relationships boring. I will say that the only redeemable one here was Harry because of how supportive & actually kind he was throughout the process. Also, I didn’t like that ending with Evelyn.

I was really looking forward to reading this book, because I was super excited for the whole vacationy setting and the hate to love romance, but it just disappointed!First of all, our main girl Henley is just flat out annoying. She’s trying to be a confident #girlboss, but instead she comes across as ungrateful. There’s this one time where Graeme is genuinely nice to her and tries to help her overcome her fear of being in the water, but she immediately shuts him down and gets mad at him for helping her? She also severely lacks the ability to communicate with other human beings. She hates Graeme for something that happened a few years ago that she never even thought to bring up with him, which he easily explains after she finally does. She’s obsessed with thinking he’s always trying to sabotage her because of the mistake he made because of TECHNOLOGY ISSUES even though he has only been kind ever since. THE WHOLE BOOK WOULD HAVE LITERALLY BEEN SOLVED WITH COMMUNICATION AND HENLEY BEING A REASONABLE PERSON. Next, we have our main man ~Graeme~. I don’t have a problem with him, but he’s a bit of a bland, cliche character. Also, I don’t understand why he keeps chasing Henley after her continuously being rude to him. She doesn’t deserve you! He also brings in a tragic backstory, which was like okay I feel really bad for you, but you’re also just like so many other male protagonists I’ve been reading lately. I wanted so much more hate to love tension too. You could tell Graeme was in love with her from the start and never actually hated her. It was hate to love romance, but only one of the characters disliked the other, which didn’t really work well. I just didn’t see the connection between them, and ASDFDHAHS. Also, there’s this old dude called Nikolai that is so creepy to Henley throughout the book. He always tries to ask her out to dinner and thrusts his hips right at her while he’s dancing. When our #girlboss Henley finally lays down her foot to say that it makes her uncomfortable and he can’t do that (YES!!), they make a redemption for him? They try to do a redemption at the end where he’s only unsettling to her because she reminds her of his old girlfriend, but that’s not an excuse? I don’t want to read about people like this! It’s not going to make me suddenly like him. Anyways, this book was not for me. It was very very similar to the Spanish Love Deception, which wasn’t my favorite book ever either, so I guess it matches up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 16, 2021","Nov 17, 2021","Nov 16, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54304013-shipped

It was one of*4/5 StarsI loved ACSDAL by Brigid Kemmerer, and when I saw that she was coming out with another book, I knew I wanted to give it a try! It was one of my most anticipated releases of 2021, and I'm super grateful that the publisher has allowed me to read an e-arc of it. Honestly, I had no idea that this was a retelling of ""Robin Hood"" before I read a few other s, but now that I do, I think it does a good job at distinguishing itself from the story. I've been in a big slump of ""mediocre"" books, and I'm glad to say that this one did surpass my expectations! This book starts off with the introduction of our two main characters, Tessa and Corrick, in an alternating dual POV. In the Kingdom of Kandala, a sickness is spreading through the land, threatening all that aren't rich enough to secure the limited cure made from Moonflower petals. People are dying, towns are suffering, and the country is on the brink of rebellion and revolution. It's interesting to see the whole divide between the rich & the poor, as well as the tensions created as a result of the whole scenario. As for our characters, we first meet Tessa Cade, a young apothecary apprentice who dedicates her nights to stealing Moonflower petals from the royal palace. She's not my favorite character and I found her a bit too rash, sappy, and boring at times, but it didn't affect my reading too much. Along with her best friend Wes, she creates these elixirs and secretly distributes them across town to those who need it the most. There's a secret aspect to their relationship, with both of them promising to never reveal their faces or further their relationship beyond what they currently have to protect their identities from being uncovered. Learning about this high-stakes job they take on really helps emphasize the suffering Kandala is currently in along with the severity of the whole spreading sickness. It definitely helps set up the rest of the story in terms of immersing us into this new world. We also get introduced to the members of the Kandala royal palace. There's King Harristan, who was unexpectedly thrown into power after the death of his parents. He's suffering from his own illness, and faces constant coughing that he tries to hide to preserve his public image. He's harsh at times, but also really caring about the wellbeing of his people. He is also rather sheltered when it comes to the less ideal parts of his job, which he leaves up to his brother Corrick, but you can definitely see his growth in attempting to be more involved in his role as King throughout the story. There's also Corrick, who is designated as the King's Justice, or assassin to those against the crown. He's your classic morally-grey swoonworthy hero, but it's okay because we always need more of those! Despite his apathetic appearance, he truly does suffer from carrying out his violent job. He protects those close to him and takes on a lot of the political responsibilities of the nation, especially with the King's secret health condition. There's also a bunch of side characters, including Allisander and Quint, who are all interesting to read about. I especially loved Quint, and I thought he was kind of a ""cinnamon roll"" character who is one of Corrick's best friends and does everything possible to protect him, even in defiance of the King. I also LOVED listening to all of the court politics of Kandala, as well as its complexities. Along with the King, there are royal Consuls of all the neighboring regions, and you get to witness their own dynamics, alliances, and relationships as well as how they influence the story. There are political aspects from the beginning that get brought up at the end of the story, and I liked how it underlined the whole book. We also see how the Consuls deal with the countrywide illness, especially with two regions having a monopoly on the Moonflower supply. I enjoyed reading about Harristan and Corrick managed these relationships, especially when the health of the country was on the line. I don't know about anyone else who's read this, but there was a big big plot twist in the middle of the story that kind of took me by surprise! I sort of guessed parts of it, but definitely not the main aspect, and I was like gasping in actual shock. It made the story so much more interesting and set off the next events to come. It was just really good and made me want to read more of the book, when I usually have to set a page goal to motivate me. There's also a lot of reveals that come towards the end of the book one after the other, and it was really nice to have all the plot points tie up. I know I'm all over the place, but going back to the relationships, there's a huge focus on the romance throughout the story. There is definitely still the plot to back it up, which I enjoyed because there are so many times where I feel like the plot doesn't stand up to the characters well enough. I really loved the hate-to-love romance throughout the story, and I just wanted more angst! I mean, there's a few chapters where it's at its peak, and if it lasted through more of the story, I would have probably liked the book even more. The relationship eventually comes to a point where it slows down and becomes too simple and gushy, which isn't wrong, but it just wasn't that interesting. I don't know, I know hate to love has to eventually turn into love, but I missed the retorts, entertaining banter, and romantic tension between them! It's just that the tension was the only thing that kept me reading. Anyways, it was a pretty good book overall! The plot was good, the characters were good (for the most part), and the romance for a decent chunk of the story was good. I thought it was a pretty fun read to end off my August with, and I'd highly recommend this to anyone else interested in the genre, especially if you're a big fan of political intrigue. Thank you to Bloomsbury and NetGalley for sending me an e-arc of this one!

While at least King of Scars left me with a good ending that hyped me up for Rule of Wolves, this one was so mediocre. There were definitely highlights in this where the action peaked, especially towards the middle of the book, but the overall feeling I have for it is apathetic. I wasn't invested enough in some of the characters and plot for it to be that enjoyable of a read for me. Note that this  will have King of Scars & inherently SOC duology/Grisha trilogy spoilers (because the events of the story take place after both), but no Rule of Wolves spoilers! I'll vaguely talk about some of the events, so hopefully you'll know what I'm talking about if you've read it. The Characters--I really didn't like reading through Nina and Hanne's POV. I just found it so boring. They just felt so annoying to me! There's something that happens towards the end that I won't spoil, but I was celebrating so hard until I realized it wasn't real. There was just something about their relationship that didn't exactly click for me. It might just be me grieving over the lost relationship that was Nina and Matthias, but it was missing everything that I loved about those two. Plus, Nina's POV didn't really tie too much into the main story arc that was happening. Her being in King of Scars felt like overextended closure as to what happened after Matthias died. Like yeah, I guess she's a spy helping Nikolai, but the story focused too much about her and Hanne's relationship, which I didn't really care for. It's just that most of the fun action (and better romance) happens in Nikolai's POV, so Nina's paled in comparison. Also, what even happened in their conclusion? It felt like a really strange way to end their arc. I also did not like the Darkling's whole appearance here. What did he even do? Nothing. In this whole entire book, he feels like he's just there for the sake of being there. After he takes on the form of the monk, we get a POV of him walking around and rallying people, but in the end, he was not necessary to the story at all. It felt like fanservice. I was also a bit confused by the whole thing with him at the end. I don't know, it just didn't feel like something that he would do. We also have the whole thing with Mayu and Mahki, and to be honest, that felt like a wholeeee fever dream. I swear I totally forgot about that whole story arc until I read a  of it. Yet again, I didn't really understand the point of them being there, and they felt a bit too much like filler. I can definitely say that Nikolai's POV was the most redeeming part of the story. I felt like there was actually story progression happening with him, and it didn't feel as boring to read through. I really enjoying his witty banter and humor and his relationship with Zoya was fun to read about. Seeing his internal doubts despite his entertaining appearance gave more personality to him. His struggles and him trying to do what's best for his country was one of the few things I enjoyed. Like a few of the other s have mentioned, it's much more Zoya's story than Nikolai's, but I'm okay with that. I liked their growth together, and I approve of their happy ending. Also, I don't know where to put this, but what was the point behind the death in the middle of the story? I felt like it didn't contribute much at all and it was just there to be there. It didn't further anything in the story and I was just confused over it. I think I forgot too much about the character to be sad over it though. The Plot --The main story plot is the whole war between Fjerda and Ravka and it was interesting enough. There's a lot of random sub plots scattered around, but that's the main point of the story. I did really enjoy reading about its conclusion towards the end of the book, and the whole battle was a fun read. There was a lot of action when the two nations finally met, and things were happening!The final few pages of the book sets up the third SOC book, which I will never forgive. SOC and Crooked Kingdom ended perfectly, and I will never understand why there's a third. It feels like fanservice and I got upset when I remembered (after repressing it down deep in my mind). It's just the same with King of Scars, and even though this duology wasn't a bad read, I just liked the way the Grisha trilogy and SOC ended on their own. ConclusionOverall, this is a mediocre series. You really have to read Six of Crows and the Grisha trilogy before reading this though, because there's a million of spoilers in here. Basically all the big events that happen in those two series are a part of King of Scars and Rule of Wolves. If you liked both series, then this isn't a bad book to try. Almost all of the characters from the prior books show up for this one, so if you want more content from them, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I had the unpopular opinion for this one, but although I wished I could like it more, I don't really regret reading it. Anyways, I will be back for the third SOC book, and we will see if it lives up to the originals!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 02, 2021","Aug 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54589790-rule-of-wolves

It is definitely worth all o*4/5 starsI know I'm so incredibly late on this whole Song of Achilles trend, but I am so glad I finally joined in on it. It is definitely worth all of the hype, and it is an unforgettable roller coaster of emotions. I finally know about the infamous ending that everyone always talks about, and I promise you that it is no exaggeration.The Song of Achilles is a emotional, beautiful, and heartbreaking Greek mythology retelling that will make you feel every single emotion. It is centered around the romance between Achilles, the prophesized savior of his people and Patroculus, an awkward exiled boy. We also get a little war plot with this book being based off of the Trojan War, but I'd go ahead and say that the characters and relationships are the strongest part of the book. We see the two develop from young children to adult men as well as their journeys in their years spent together. -- The Characters:Achilles is actually such a good character (probably my favorite!), and I really loved seeing his transformation throughout the book. He starts off so pure and kind-hearted, but you can see him develop into a more unforgiving, blood-thirsty person, eager to fight for his own increasing fame and legacy when he dies. It was so interesting seeing the contrast between him unwilling to kill anyone who has done nothing wrong to him willing to do whatever is necessary to better his own position by the latter half of the book. He so badly wants to secure his own fame and legendary status with this war, and is especially willing to do so after hearing his own prophecy. The one thing he cares about almost as much as his own legacy is Patroclus, and it's interesting to see his struggle to achieve both at the same time. I also enjoyed reading about Patroclus, and I liked how he was the one constant in his relationship with Achilles. No matter how much Achilles changed with his own principles or values, Patroclus maintains himself, even when this creates arguments between them. He stays empathetic and caring, willing to defy Achilles to defend these ideals. He also grows throughout the book, from an awkward, insecure child to someone strong and willing to stand up for what he believes in. The last few chapters narrated by him made me fall for his character even more, and his sweetness, love, and near desperation to be with Achilles was *perfect*. I also surprisingly grew on Patroclus's mother Thetis, especially after those last few pages. Even though she could be controlling and rude at times, you could tell that she just wanted what was best for Achilles. She pushed Patroclus away because she didn't think he was worthy of Achilles, but you can see her growing on him and them finally making peace with each other. It was so good. Briseis was also okay, but I didn't care too much for her. I cared for the fact that she was a plot device, but not really much more to be honest. As for the other characters, I don't really remember them all too well, so there probably wasn't anything too offensive about them. The RelationshipOf course, I have to spend another section talking about the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus (yes, I know I already discussed parts of it in the characters section, but I will do it again). These two were so perfect. Absolute faves. Their everlasting love for each other throughout the story was everything I could have wanted. You see them from the very first moments, where Achilles is one of the first few people to show Patroclus kindness. You see their friendship slowly developing into a romance. And then you see their romance withstanding throughout the war, despite Achilles changing and the different disagreements they have. They compromised, supported each other, and they were so so cute. You can really see their love for each other in the last few chapters of the book in its raw form and I love it. This book is an emotional roller coaster for a reason, and relationship was definitely one of the main reasons why.The Plot & PacingHere's why I don't have this book rated as a five star. I thought that the plot sort of dragged on at times. Despite loving the relationship and romance in this book, I was kind of bored, especially towards the middle of the book. Like the beginning and end (especially the end omg it was actually a 2930283942 star ending) were SO GOOD, but there were so parts in the middle of the book that just couldn't stand up to it. I guess you could say the pacing was too slow. I haven't actually read The Illiad as the source material, so I don't know how true it stayed to the original text, but I liked how she took the same names from the source text. I feel like it makes it easier to see the connections between her retelling and The Illiad, which I will probably look into the second I finish writing this . ALSO, even if you know what happens in this book, it's still good anyways. I got somewhat spoiled for what happened, but I still enjoyed the journey and the writing and I was actually surprised over something I wasn't spoiled for. You'll still feel emotional and you'll still be attached to the characters despite it. --ANYWAYS, this was a very good book and I'd highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of retellings & Greek mythology (still read it though even if you're not). It is a timeless, memorable read and you will not regret it. I literally reread the last few sentences like 2384932 times and felt like crying over it & throwing the copy I have across the room over it. It fueled my soul so much and it just boosted this book and my final impressions so much.

It's like the first third was a four star, a big chunk in the middle was a three star, and then the final few chapters ended off as a four star. So, I finally made my mind, and I'm rating this a 3.5 star rounded down to a three star. One Last Stop is an incredibly heartwarming read, filled with a swoon-worthy romance, found-family, and pancakes. It details the life of 23 year old August, who is struggling to find her life's purpose after transferring to many colleges over many different cities. She's lived her entire life alone, and hopes that moving to cold NYC will be the perfect fit for her. However, she quickly finds friends in her quirky roommates, finds a waiting job at a lively pancake diner, and discovers the future love-of-her-life, Jane, as she's riding the train. The only problem is that Jane is displaced in time from the 1970s and has been bound to it for decades, with seemingly no way of leaving. The Characters:The characters were probably my favorite part of the whole book. I enjoyed all of the dimensions, and even the side characters were thoughtfully written. We have our (sometimes) cynical, anxious MC August, who's determined to find her own way in life, while helping the people around her. She bonds quickly with her roommates, Myla, Niko, and Wes. I really liked the diversity in the whole cast, with Myla being queer and black, Niko being trans and latino, and Wes being queer and Jewish. They also had a lot more depth in them compared to more typical side characters, and you really got to learn a lot about them. You get to see Niko making the most scarily-accurate psychic predictions, Myla pulling everyone towards her with her bubbly personality, and Wes's bumbling self as he struggles to commit to a relationship over the fear that he's not worth it (along with his West Elm secret modern bedroom that not even his roommates have ever seen). They were just so likeable, and might honestly be better than the actual MCs. We also *of course* have our love interest, Jane, who is a Chinese lesbian who has such a fun punk-rocker vibe. She's cool, collected, and makes a difference in everyone's lives she enters. There are a lot of chapters that actually start off with news pages and social media posts that discuss people's mentions of Jane throughout time, which I really enjoyed. For example, we get an instance where she gives a boy a pride pin after he's been bullied and so many other times where she's helped people, and it's interesting to see the impact she's had on so many lives. Despite being different, there are so many similarities between her and August, such as their love for music, that make their relationship really work. The Plot & PacingHere's where I have a few problems. The pacing is way too slow for my tastes, especially towards the middle of the book. I felt like we got a lot of filler that just didn't really contribute much. It dragged out the story a lot, and I feel like this could have definitely been a better book if it wasn't as long. There were some times where the romance just got boring because there wasn't enough of anything else happening (it is a romance book though, so it's probably just a me thing). There were also some mechanics in the plot that were too absurd for my tastes. I feel like this book is centric in contemporary romance, but there are some parts that crank up the sci-fi a bit too much. Like the whole reasoning on how Jane begins to remember her past life, and why she's so connected with August? I lowkey found that kind of cheesy and dumb. It might just be a me problem though. I did enjoy the continuous mystery of discovering what happened to August's uncle throughout the book though. I actually got confused between him and August because his name is Auggie, and it's a lesson on why you shouldn't read books too quickly. I liked how that one sub-plot point carried through the entire story, with it all building up towards the end of the book (despite August telling her mom that she definitely will not help). The main plot of finding Jane's true identity and untethering her to the train was also entertaining. I actually thought that this book was going to surprise me and head towards a bittersweet ending which I SO BADLY WANTED (I was like yes! finally!), but it reverted back to essentially a happily ever after ending (besides one bit, which I didn't think was bitter enough to twist it). I also thought that there were too many coincidental aspects of the plot. Everything lines up perfectly for these characters, and it's nowhere near realistic at times. There were just too many plot conveniences and times where I was like, ""really??"" Like, it shouldn't make sense for everyone to magically has the answer to everything, and for August to get the answers to whatever out-there question she has by talking to one of her five friends. There are also some plot conveniences and things that just didn't make much sense. The RomanceI feel like I wasn't as obsessed with the romance as some people. I mean they were cute together, but I can't really say much more besides that. I don't have any concrete reason for it, but I just didn't connect to it and swoon over it as much as I would have liked to. Anyways, it was a good read overall, but nothing amazing. I similarly thought Red White and Royal Blue was just okay, and I'd place this book a little better than it. I definitely see its appeal to many others, and I think that it's great that we've been getting more popular LGBTQ+ reads recently. I'm still really glad I read this one, and I think that it's a good one to start off my June with.Thank you to Netgalley and St. Martin's Press for sending me a e-arc of this one.

The characters fell flat for me, and I didn’t particularly have a connection with any of them. While the story features both Evangeline and Jacks, it more so centers around Evangeline’s story. The problem with this is that I just liked Jacks more than Evangeline, so it was disappointing that she got more of a spotlight. She felt naive and a bit annoying in how unaware she was in some scenarios. As for the side characters, they just felt shallow and somewhat underdeveloped. It felt like a lot of them were there just for the sake of being plot devices.I did find myself interested in the lore discussed in the book with the archways and everything. I’m really excited to see what happens with them in the next book especially after the tease at the end! Anyways, I would recommend this book if you enjoyed Caraval! It’s fun to see what happens to Jacks (and Tella/Scarlett to some extent) after the series and get back into the world. I would also only read this book if you’ve read that series.

There were so many unbelievably boring*3/5 starsI have no idea how to rate this, and maybe I'll change my mind later, but the book kind of fell flat. There were so many unbelievably boring parts of the book. This book splits itself between past and future, as Addie Larue has lived for 300 years, and everything in the past is so boring. I swear, it's literally Addie being like ""I'm so tired of people forgetting me"" and ""I don't want to die and sell my soul"" dragged on for chapters and chapters. We also get a lot of examples of how everyone forgets her, but its so redundant. Like you don't need to tell me 239328 instances of people who have forgotten her for me to know that she's cursed by being forgotten by everyone she meets. Plus, we get a ton of conversations between her and Luc, and I swear, they're saying the exact same thing every time. I guess it's meant to ""further their relationship"" but it was so repetitive. The part of the book in the present is a little better. It dives more into the relationship between Addie and Henry, and it's fun seeing their relationship and romance develop. I mean, after all the repetition in the past, I was dying to read something new. It's not a particularly interesting romance, but I'll take it. I found the rest of the characters to be quite forgettable too, and I unironically don't remember their names.We also get a little bit of Henry's perspectives , both in the past and the present. I don't want to be mean, and maybe I should choose a less strong word, but he was a little pathetic. All of his sections were boring too, and I did not care for him at all. Also, there really isn't much of a plot. I can't tell you a single thing that happens in this story. There are a lot of events that happen to develop the romance and to develop the idea that Addie is in fact forgettable, but none of them are substantial in any way. They're not significant enough to hold up the plot. This is definitely a more character-driven plot, and I feel like the plot was created to work around the characters, rather than the other way around (if that makes any sense at all). I hated that meta ending too. I just found it dumb. I almost wish the story ended prior to the scene of Henry at the bookstore. Anyways, I know I get into the habit of badly bashing books, but I will say it wasn't a bad read. Yes, I found myself skimming portions. But, I finished it! Like I said, the present sections weren't bad, and I did enjoy Schwab's writing style.

Expectations? Gone. I read These Violent Delights last year and gave it a four star, so I already had some expectations going into Our Violent Ends. But, I just did not expect to like this book that much! I was not emotionally prepared for this book. In fact, I'm going to need some compensation for how bad that ending destroyed me. Chloe Gong truly did us dirty in the best possible way. Where was the permission in this?? I will not shut up about it, and I am still in shock over how much I liked this book. It's definitely secured itself as one of my top three books of the year so far.The Characters--Our Violent Ends starts off a bit after These Violent Delights ended and begins to discuss the consequences of the HUGE cliffhanger (last few chapters, you know what I'm talking about if you've read it) we had in the prior book. We get to see how Roma and Juliette's relationship has progressed from when we last saw them, and how their lives have been going so far. There is an insane amount of angst and sexual tension and honestly, give me all of it. I don't know if things have been turned up a lot or if my crippling memory loss hasn't served me well over the past year, but I did not remember things being this intense in the prior book. It's like if you take the midway point between a hate-to-love relationship where they say they hate each other, but we all know there's a part of them that secretly loves the other and just magnify it. AKA even more of the best part. Now imagine that same sexual tension with Roma and Juliette pointing knives at each other and still not being able to kill the other. I think these fantasies are really messing with my views on romance because the mix of hate to love with just a touch of *i want to kill you* is my new thing. It was so attractiveWe also get to see changes in each of the characters' personalities with the cliffhanger. We see a sharp change in Roma's personality, acting colder, less emotional, and more vindictive. Similarly, we see Benedikt falling into a shell of who he once was, emotionless like Roma, but in a more hollow way. We see Juliette struggling with her feelings for Roma after everything that has happened, trying her best to please the Scarlets in the process. Finally, we see Marshall, surprisingly okay, doing his best to protect Benedikt no matter. I liked that the cliffhanger from the past book didn't immediately resolve itself and that it had significant repercussions in the sequel. It's really interesting to see how each of the characters deals with it in their own way, and I thought that it made them feel more real. We also get a lot of character development within Kathleen. Without spoiling anything, she learns to embrace who she is, and transforms into a stronger person. There's also a lot of stuff with Rosalind going on, which I will also not spoil. There's a ton of major plot points tied to her, and all you need to know is that it was really good. I liked seeing into the minds of both of these characters too, especially Rosalind, to see their thoughts and motives beyond the dialogue we typically get. Going back to our main couple of Juliette and Roma, it is just really fun to see their relationship grow and develop throughout the story. Their backstory and divisions within gangs all contribute to such a good lovers-to-enemies-to-lovers romance. They make rash decisions in the process, but it surprisingly works to their characters in the type of impulsive love they have for each other, which kind of mimics Romeo and Juliet in a much better way. They would literally destroy the world for each other, and it's totally dramatic, but I'm here for it. All it did was secure my need for a Roma to call me ""dorogaya"" in my life, so I'd say it's one of my favorite parts of the story.The Plot--Going more into the plot, we continue to see how the monsters/parasites/whatever you call them still impact the city today, despite the efforts of the previous book. It carries on in an alternate way that connects the two books well. It still has the same investigative, ""who did it?"" and ""where are the monsters coming from"" vibes that the first book had, which was pretty interesting. There are a few big mysteries in there that lead into some plot twists. I will say that I am a really bad predictor when it comes to these things due to how clueless and unaware I usually am of smaller details, so I was surprised! It made for a nice ""whoa, really?"" and I really liked reading about these unexpected reveals. We also have the same political conflict of the first book between the White Flowers, Scarlet Gang, Communists, and Nationalists all fighting for power. It defines the whole story and continues to be there despite the many other plot points. I am always a big fan of political intrigue, and I really liked its continuous impact on the relationships, alliances, and events of the story. It just adds another layer to the story that complicates things beyond the surface level.As for the pacing, it is a lot better than the first book. I think that it took so much time to set up everything and really explain the world, that the first book felt boring at times. However, things pick up instantly in the second book and when you think it can't get more intense, it gets more intense. The last 20% of the book had so much action in it from all of the plot points finally peaking at once, and it made for a stunning conclusion. It was so wild. Where I may have skimmed through a few chapters of the first book, I felt so much more immersed in the second and it gave me the perfect mix of fast-paced plot, developing relationships, and politics. Conclusion--Would I recommend this book? I rounded it up to a five star, so of course so! The series is perfect for lovers of forbidden starcrossed lovers-to-enemies-to-lovers romance, a gorgeous 1920s Shanghai setting, political intrigue, and a fast-paced plot. Even if you're a bit unsure of the first book, I'd highly recommend picking up this conclusion because of how much it amped up in excitement and enjoyment for me. It's one of my favorite series endings I've read in a while, and I am not afraid to shove it in your faces.Anyways, I'm going to head off until I get word of Chloe Gong's new spin-off series (held in the same world with some of the same characters!), so I will see you all then.Thank you to Simon and Schuster for sending me an e-ARC of this book!

And I was so desperate to love this book. As a student myself, I thought I would be able to relate to these characters & really feel for the story. I kind of go hard with the negatives on my s, because of how much easier they are for me to write than my likes, so if you loved this book and don't want to hear my rant, feel free to click off. Problem 1) The RomanceIt just didn't work. Here's the thing. Towards the beginning, Ethan and Alison are very clearly rivals, which I did love. In fact, I will take all your enemies/rivals to lovers romance books and eat them up. We get a bit of slow-burn romance going, and it's pretty obvious from page 10 that they're going to end up together if you haven't already read the synopsis. HOWEVER, the transition between rivals to lovers was quite poor in my opinion. We go from them insulting each other, to quite literally making out in half a second. I know that someone's going to be like ""it's just banter,"" but I don't know, I guess the relationship wasn't fully developed enough for it to be real to me. They weren't close enough for this not to be a complete escalation. In fact, I'm going to give you the exact quote where this happens. ""Four years of seeing your face every day,"" he says like it's a prison sentence. ""Of hearing your voice in every class. Graduation can't come soon enough. ""I fantasize about it frequently,"" I fire back. ""Just imagining the day I never again have to look upon our endless array of pretentious blazers.""And don't forget that less than a chapter ago, Alison was complaining so hard about how Ethan sabotaged her. I'm not going to go into the details to avoid too many spoilers, but it's a somewhat of a big deal. Fast-forward half a page of dialogue:""I'm picking up velocity, brakes cut, heading for collision. Without thinking, I drop the newspapers and reach for his waist a the precise moment his hands find my face. Our lips crash together. I sink into the kiss for an incinerating moment. The rush is overwhelming..."" It goes on for even longer. Like no?? I did not ask for this. Maybe I wasn't clear when I asked for enemies to lovers. Maybe I should have asked for ""enemies"" to ""I don't like you but we're going to make this work to achieve this goal"" to ""okay fine you're actually not that bad"" to ""friends"" to ""lovers."" And okay, maybe we do get some moments of true bonding between these two characters, but the second their relationship starts to progress, something happens that pushes them back 50 steps to enemies once again. I swear, one of the biggest ""enemy"" moves and ""sabotages"" happens a chapter before this. What?? I don't know, there's something about it that I just didn't connect to. Problem 2) The CharactersBypassing the main characters, who were slightly annoying at times but okay for at least half the book, I just didn't like the side characters. They were just irrelevant for me. We have Alison's whole family, but I didn't like a single one of them. I mean, I definitely skimmed over the last quarter of this book, so maybe they got a secret redemption, but they were not saved for me. Alison's sister is just bland. She's someone whose life got ruined when she lost her job and life in Chicago, and now has to live at home with her family, but tries her best to stay positive despite that. I can't tell you anything else about her. Alison's mom and dad also weren't memorable and the only thing I remember about them is the fact that they're older than all of her friends' parents. Then we have this random driver's ed teacher named Hector, and I didn't really understand the point of him either. I thought his entire existence was used as a plot device to make Alison and Ethan hang out and bond more. I couldn't care less about what happened to him. Problem 3) The Predictability and the Happily Ever AfterThis book is so predictable. If you give me the synopsis, I can probably tell you all the major plot points of the story. Basically, if you want to know what happens, assume every character is going to receive the best possible outcome. Everyone gets a happily ever after. We have one ending that's just a bit different from the ""standard"" you would expect, but in the end, I would still consider it a happily ever after. It makes it a wannabe bittersweet ending, but it's still so sweet that I wouldn't call it anything near that (what did I even type there). Bittersweet endings do not exist here, and everyone gets what they want. I do like happy endings, but plot twists are so much more fun! Combined with my other problems of this book, this just made it worse. Problem 4) The Weak PlotThis is a heavily character driven book. Almost every romance I have ever read is. We get one major plot point, but it does not stand on its own in any way. Everything that happens is used to further the relationship of the characters. And it's okay! I do like character driven books, but you're going to have to know that the plot isn't going to keep you reading. Now that we've got all of that out of the way, I will give you some things I enjoyed about this story, that made this a 3 star book instead of a 2 star one!Overall, the middle of this book was not bad at all. I actually did enjoy some of Ethan and Alison's banter. It's a fun rivals aspect, and it was somewhat entertaining to read. There's also this one chapter where Ethan and Alison have a conversation that slides their relationship forward in the perfect amount. I thought that some of the school aspects of it were somewhat relatable, and there were times where I was like ""yeah that sounds a bit like me."" But in the end, it sadly was not enough to make me like this book. My preferences in general are shifting slowly away from YA to adult, so that was definitely a part of it. I do see an audience for this book, and I get why some people really enjoyed this, but it wasn't for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 30, 2021","Feb 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44044099-what-s-not-to-love

I really enjoyed following Poppy and Cas through this story, but I do feel like it disappointed slightly compared to From Blood and Ash. I feel like there was too much ""filler"" in this story, and there were a lot of times where I thought the story dragged on. The pacing was a off, especially towards the beginning of the book, and it made it boring. I also didn't feel like any major events happened in the story at all. Poppy also started bothering me a bit more in this one, and I thought that she became incredibly rash at times. This book also features a lot more romance, at it became much more center to the story. However, I feel like we didn't get as much of that tension and build-up compared to From Blood and Ash, and it was a little less compelling. There was so much time spent on Poppy and Cas denying their relationship and ""pretending"" even though everyone in the whole world knew they loved each other, which was definitely annoying at times. Despite all of that, I still enjoyed the book. I think that I enjoyed the characters and world enough from the first book for me to be able to tolerate the more boring/annoying aspects of this one. The ending felt a little abrupt (like it was there for the sake of having a cliffhanger), but it worked and I did desperately want the next book to see what would happen right after finishing it.

Actually, That entire last hundred pages or so?? This book surprised me in the absolute best way, and I am very excited that I listened to the hype and dived into it! I was definitely apprehensive at first, since I'm usually not into paranormal and didn't think the synopsis was too interesting, but it definitely ended up being the book for me. My absolute favorite part of the book had to be the romance. It was the PERFECT forbidden enemies-to-lovers dynamic, that created such a thrilling romantic tension between Poppy and Hawke. It seriously fueled my soul. It definitely gave me Feyre/Rhysand vibes with everything, which I loved, since ACOTAR remains one of my favorite books. The witty banter between them also made their relationship so much more compelling, and it was definitely one of the reasons why I kept reading the story. I've heard people say that there were a ton of predictable twists, but I didn't feel that way at all! Granted, I'm probably the worst person at predicting these things (I swear, they're never obvious to me and it's almost embarrassing how much these things breeze by me), so that probably contributed to my incredible surprise towards the end of the novel. I will say that the beginning does get boring, but I found it necessary to understand the story. There are so many new creatures and societal structures that do need that explanation, and in the end, I'm glad that they were there. Even though it took me super long to understand everything, and I still don't remember much of the history and everything, I appreciated all of the complexities of this new, fantasy world. I would definitely recommend it for fans of ACOTAR, and I thought that it was the perfect end to my January reading month! :)...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jan 28, 2021","Jan 28, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52831247-from-blood-and-ash

I enjoyed seen Naomi and Nicholas rekindle their relationship, and I loved their exchanges. It was fun to see them team up against Naomi's mean friend, or Nicholas's crazy family. This book was the perfect thoughtful, cute, and amusing book. I will say that the second half of this book is significantly better than the first half. I thought that the first half wasn't fun, because you were just surrounded in Naomi and Nicholas's toxic, mean relationship. It made the book feel like it was dragging on, and I didn't like hearing them argue for that long. But, the second half ended up being really good, so it probably inflated my positive feelings about this one too. The banter between them just became more playful rather than mean-spirited, and it was interesting to see how their relationship developed further. Plus they way the story ended with the bowling alley scene, and seeing how things started was so sweet.I really enjoyed this one, and I thought that it was an incredibly heartwarming. engaging read, after you got past the first bit of it.

I think that my main issue with this read was the pacing. There was an arguably slow start to the novel, as McFarlane takes a lot of time explaining the depths of Laurie's prior relationship. I found that there were too many details for this section of the novel that didn't have much relevance later on in the novel. Even if we fast-forward to some future chapters, the pacing continued to drag down the novel more than what I would have wanted. There were also various sub-plots (or should I call them something else? they're a bit more minor than that) that seemingly come out of nowhere. I'll try not to be too specific, but her problems with her father's friend and the random kiss at the party really had no reason to be there. There was no development to it, and no reason for it to be there, other than simply placing it in the story to act as an artificial plot-device to extend the book a few extra pages. The characters were a little bit better, but I still didn't feel the ""connection"" that I usually do with books I enjoy more. They didn't have enough meaning to me, and other than wanting to see them together at the end, I was indifferent to them. Overall, I think that it was a cute read, but nothing more than that.

By the time I was able to borrow this from my library, I actually forgot what this book was about, so I didn't have many expectations at all going into it. It definitely wasn't my favorite novel ever, but it was a thoroughly entertaining, light read!I think that the main character, Ollie, was more interesting to read about than normal because I saw a lot of my own personality in him. It made his perspective more entertaining to read about, and I loved reading about his thinking. However, I didn't find any of the other characters to be notable at all though. I felt that Will was really unlikable for the majority of the book, and I didn't like how he mistreated Ollie. There were so many instances for basically the entire first half of the novel where Ollie got walked over, and I felt bad for him. I think that this contributed to my apathy towards their relationship. The other side characters were a little too flat for my tastes as well. I did enjoy the incorporation of grief and loss into the novel though. I think that it led to a few interesting discussions, and it definitely added another layer to it. The rest of the plot wasn't bad, but it was on the forgettable side. I would definitely say that this was a more character-driven story for that reason. There are also occasional flashbacks that give us more context into Will and Ollie's past, summer relationship. I didn't care for them much, but I think that goes back to my disagreement with their relationship in general. Overall, it was a fun read and I'm glad I checked it out!

I'm going to cover what I disliked first, so we can end off on a high note!Problem 1) I didn't feel like there was much purpose in this book existing. The plot felt extremely weak, and I thought the story was too character centric. I do like my books being more character driven, but I found myself constantly asking what the point of the plot was in the grand scheme of things. In fact, I really felt like nothing happened for the first half of the novel, before we get a few plot points that seemed a bit out of place. It definitely worried me that when ACOWAR wrapped up, there wouldn't be much to write about anymore, and it unfortunately came true. A couple of the story arcs also seemed to parallel that of the prior books in the series. It felt a bit repetitive at times, like I was reading the same thing happening with different characters. The plot is also very predictable. I'm one of the worst predictors in the entire world, but all of the outcomes were easy to see from the very beginning. There's also one plot twist, but I kind of saw it coming. This entire aspect made me care less about the book, because I already pictured what would happen in my head. Problem 2) I'm okay with romance. In fact, I love having romance in my books, and my second favorite genre is contemporary romance. But all of the smut was a bit cringey for me. I also found the sheer amount of it to be unnecessary, and at a certain point, it didn't do much to benefit the story or relationships. Problem 3) I don't know if too much changed in my own personal reading preferences from when I last read ACOWAR, but Feyre/Rhysand began bothering me. I liked them so much before, but I just found them to be annoying during this book. I can't exactly pinpoint what bothered me, but I was sighing when they came across the page. Problem 4) While the two new characters and friends of Nesta were fun enough to read about, I found them a bit on the forgettable side. They were great side characters at the time of reading them, and I liked that Nesta was able to forge her own family, but I just didn't really care about them. I actually don't remember their names, and there wasn't enough to them. There were a ton of good things about this book though! I was your #1 Nesta hater, but this book really converted me. Her character development is one of the best parts about this book. It's incredibly interesting to see her healing journey, and her making peace with herself. I think that this book also helped us see another facet of her, besides how she appeared from another POV, which helped a lot in empathizing with her character. Seeing her rationale and her thoughts definitely helped me understand why she was the way she was. Additionally, while I can't necessarily say that this book is amazing in any way, it was still an enjoyable read. Despite all of my many problems with this, I found myself reading this in one day. It's so incredibly long and way longer than it honestly should be, but I don't regret any second of it....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 18, 2021","Feb 18, 2021","Jan 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31050237-a-court-of-silver-flames

I mean, I get that you’re trying to make the character more realistic by bringing in all these “self esteem issues” and “frustrations” but WOW did it ruin him for me. Especially towards the middle of the book, he was just so self-deprecating, so rude, so self-destructive, that it didn’t make reading about him fun! The most his character did was wear my eyes out from rolling them too much. I was also sighing a lot. BUT we have Oliver, and he redeems the whole thing. I wish I was joking when I say that he was the only reason why I didn’t DNF this. His banter made me laugh! He was an actually good mix of slightly anxious, slightly shy, and just being a good, authentic person. The only part about him I didn’t like was when he pushed everyone emotionally away at the end. Though, I was dealing with Luc doing that for the entire rest of the book, so I think that did a number at boosting my tolerance. You win some, you lose some.And I cannot finish this  without talking about Alex for at least a few sentences. I don’t know if he was purposefully dumb for comedic relief or something, but I wanted to yell at the page in frustration. It felt like I was reading about a five year old in an adult’s body. At this point, I think the only reasonable conclusion is him being an alien without an inch of knowledge about how people work. The book itself also feels like it drags on for too long. There are definitely some plot points that felt unnecessary & didn’t really do much for the story. Okay, so that was a little harsh, but I think you can get the gist of my feelings about this.

The book itself is a lot lighter and fluffier in the topics it covers, but it is just such an adorable read, that it doesn’t matter! It’s the type of book that makes your heart flutter. I enjoyed the alternating chapters that alternate between time periods. We get to see the vacations leading up to the one in Croatia that broke Poppy and Alex’s relationship (though it was kind of predictable what happened there). We also get them in the present day, taking another spontaneous vacation to Alex’s brother’s wedding. It’s interesting to see the romantic tension between them and all of the *emotion* that comes with it. Their banter is so fun as well, and I really loved the friends-to-lovers, grumpy & sunshine pairing. No spoilers, but at the end, I wanted to throw my Kindle at Poppy for what she said towards the end, until she came back with a speech that actually made me cry (so I'm all good now haha).There are some times where the story feels dragged on and tedious with the novel being more character-centric, but most of the times, it didn’t bother me much. I enjoyed the characters enough to not mind just being immersed in their relationship and dynamic.

My absolute favorite *4/5 StarsThis was an incredibly thoughtful book, and I'm glad I ended up picking it up, despite not usually reading this genre. My absolute favorite part of this book were the characters. This is definitely more of a character-driven novel, with the plot actually falling a bit short. There were times where it felt a bit tedious and annoying, especially with the story centered around one event. There were a few interviews, but I felt like they dragged the whole book down with irrelevant, spiraling talk that didn't add enough to the story. Anyways, I really loved how the book focused on the intertwining and collision of lives between a group of seemingly unrelated ""strangers."" There are so many slowly uncovered connections between them, that although do seem too convenient at times, are enjoyable to read about. However, by focusing on so many characters at once (like eight or something), it was a bit confusing towards the beginning. It took me a while to comprehend each individual character, who they were, and how their perspective and lives fit in with the overall story. I did end up really liking the end with everyone's story wrapping up, and especially the one with Nadia. It might seem a little too ""perfect"" for some people, but I like happy endingsThe writing style is whimsical, a little humorous at times, but reflective over everything. There are many times where the author steps back to provide commentary about overarching themes and ""life observations,"" which at times seem a little forced, but were thoughtful nevertheless. This book also covers a lot of heavier topics, with a lot of sad events happening to the characters. It's more of a personal thing, but it was a little depressing for someone like me who tends to read lighter, fluffier reads. However, I don't necessarily dislike that fact, and I think that some of these misfortunes added depth to them.Anyways, I'd highly recommend this one, and I still feel emotional about it after throwing all my thoughts out on this !...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Feb 26, 2021","Dec 13, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/49534036-anxious-people

While I can see where the Romeo and Juliet retelling came from, I feel like it’s more of its own story than that. It takes a lot of the forbidden love from it, but I thought that the book offers a lot of new plot points that stray away from the original story. I liked both of the characters & I enjoyed the romantic tension between Juliette and Roma. It wasn’t my favorite thing ever, but it was good enough to keep me reading. I just wish I cared more for the others though. I felt like they were honestly really forgettable. Like, I thought that most of the reading chunks with side character perspectives weren’t as engaging as they could have been. I also wish that the pacing was a little faster. I felt like there was a big chunk in the middle of the book where nothing really happened? Like they were chasing down the monster or whatever, but I felt like not enough progress was made. However, things really picked up in the last third of the book or so, and it definitely got more interesting. There are a lot of reveals in the last few chapters especially, with a lot of plot points also tying up. It was a little abrupt, but I didn’t mind it. I did really enjoy the cultural twist on the book though. I don’t think there are enough Asian-inspired novels, so it was definitely interesting to read about this one. I also really enjoyed the writing style of the author, and I found that it added a lot to the sophistication (in a way?? I don’t know how to phrase that) in the novel. I’ve been reading a lot of more casually written contemporary/romance novels lately, so I could maybe be exaggerating the writing style because of that shift.Anyways, I thought it was a fun read, and I’ll definitely keep my eye out for the sequel!

The plot was actually really nice & thrilling, but the characters were so boring, that they ended up dragging down the entire story.The way the book is structured is unique, but it totally works for this. It incorporates interviews, notes, and journal entries, rather than just straight-up dialogue and I thought that it contributed well to the whole murder-mystery plot. The mystery itself had a lot of layers to it, and I was quite surprised by the final reveal. The last quarter of the book was especially fun, since the different pieces of evidence finally clicked together, and the reveals began increasing and escalating. What I didn't like lied in the characters themselves. They were so boring and flat, and there was nothing special about them. They were so one-dimensional, and I could care less for what happened to them. Pippa was your average over-achieving student who cares about her family, but will do whatever it takes to solve this investigation. That's it. That's all there is to her. And it's the same thing with Ravi. He's the brother of the supposed murderer, so he has been socially outcast, but underneath that, he is a caring person.

I loved this story, and the fact that it wasn't the light/fluffy read I thought it was going to be made it more meaningful. This book deals with a few heavy topics, but I thought that the author handled it in a really good way. The characters were so well-developed, and they felt like real people, instead of just words on a page. Both January and Gus had imperfections, worries, and they were each broken in their own way, and I thought that made the story so much easier to connect to.The slow burn romance was so good, and I just loved how well they fit together. The fact that they each found comfort in the other and could each empathize with the other's hard background made the romance so much more meaningful. All the themed trips they had developed their relationship so well, and the uniqueness of everywhere they went made the story so much more fun to read about. And the notes they held up to communicate with each other were so cute. There were a few parts in the middle of the book that felt a little too slow, but it didn't detract too much from the book. I also agree with a few of the other s saying the ending was too cheesy, but I liked the characters enough so I didn't mind at all.

I am a huge fan of college admissions in general, and I found the USC admissions scandal to be really interesting. I thought that this book would offer a unique spin on that, but I don't think it was for me. Please note that I only read about 40% of this book, so my opinions do not reflect the rest of it. However, I do feel as if I did read enough to develop an opinion about the beginning and overall trajectory of the novel. The entire first 125 pages, nearly echoes the entire real-life admissions scandal, so it was a little boring to hear a story so similar to what I was already familiar with. The entire plot is about the MC's parents being charged for artificially raising her SAT score & by getting her into a college by bribing a coach, which is *extremely* similar to the real thing that happened with Loughlin and USC. I was just hoping for a twist on that story in some way, rather than a near direct copy of it. I wasn't particularly a fan of the characters either. I suppose I only read the first 100 pages, so they definitely could have changed for the better. I felt that the main character, Chloe, was too shallow and underdeveloped. She felt too cliche, fitting the ""average oblivious rich-kid who likes to party and doesn't know anything outside of her own little bubble"" stereotype. Additionally, Chloe was a little too naive for my own tastes, and I felt that too much of the story focused on her getting dragged along by her parents while not understanding a single thing about what was happening. The main love interest and romance wasn't my favorite either. I will give him the benefit of the doubt, since I don't think I've read enough to make any judgements, but it still doesn't take away from the fact that I didn't like him either.

I do wish we got more of the side characters though. They don't have too much of an importance in the story, and I really wish we got to see more of Finn, especially. I thought that there was so much potential in his character, and it never got explored to the extent that I would have hoped. In fact, I think that his character arc ended too abruptly for my tastes, and I didn't get enough closure with him. I felt as if he just disappeared out of nowhere. I also wished I cared more for the romance, and I feel like there wasn't enough build-up with it. The romance is more of them simply admitting their existing feelings for each other, rather than them have growing feelings for each other over the course of the novel (if what I'm even saying makes sense). Everything was also a little too perfectly wrapped up at the end for my tastes. I do feel as if this is more of a personal preference thing, with my liking towards slow-burn romances, than anything wrong with the story, especially considering the fact that it is meant to be less romance-heavy. Overall, I think that it is a cute, meaningful read. It's not perfect, but I do think that it is a very worthwhile book. ---Thank you to Wednesday Books and Netgalley for gifting me an ARC.

It was one of my top anticipated releases for this year (even though I say that about so many others), and I guess my expectations were just too high. This book disappointed me. This book felt like it was all over the place, and it did not have the same appeal as the first. I'm going to warn you that this  might be a whole disorganized mess, but I wanted to sort out the scramble from my brain into words when it's fresh before I forget stuff in the next few days. I'll probably come back and clean it up a bit in the next few days if I'm feeling it. This book picks off right where the last one left off, with the huge cliffhanger of Toby being alive being revealed. We see that Toby is the same Harry that Avery has constantly played chess with at the park of her old town. Avery and Jameson instantly make a bet to see who can solve the mystery of what truly happened to Toby first, this time with the potential of their romantic relationship on the line. We continue to find out why Avery was chosen for this huge inheritance rather than the rest of the Hawthorne brothers throughout the book.There's a reveal towards the beginning of the book that honestly made me so uncomfortable with the romance in this book, until I finished going through the mental gymnastics of what actually happened by the end of the story. I'm trying to be as vague as possible for everyone who hasn't read this book, but I have to mention that the inclusion of this plot point made reading a large chunk of this book weird and awkward. I mean it was a great reveal and all, but its implications on everything else definitely brought down my mood and excitement for the rest of the story. Also, I came into this book remembering essentially nothing from the first book, and I paid my price for it. The plot of this story requires you to know about a lot of the characters from the first book, which I did not. I barely remembered Jameson, Grayson, Xander, and Avery, and it definitely led to a lot of confusion. I didn't even know there was a fourth Hawthorne brother! Like who is Nash? I've never heard about him in my entire life. I had to look up his name writing this  because I already forgot who he was. There's also this whole sub-plot with Eli, but I'm still confused over it because I don't know who this guy is. This issue is definitely 100% on me, but I just thought it would be worthwhile to talk about my endless confusion throughout the story and my short-term memory loss. I also really want to talk about the romance and love triangle. I did not like it. I have only loved one love triangle in my entire life (the one in The Infernal Devices), and this one just added another tally to my list of the ones I didn't. I don't remember disliking it all that much in the first book, but for some reason, it just got worse in the second. It felt forced in my opinion, and there wasn't enough development in either relationship for me to particularly care. It is 100% a sub-plot, but that in itself was a problem for me, because that meant that there wasn't enough time to have that slow burn and actual development in the romance besides the occasional emotional moment or kiss out of seemingly nowhere. To make things worse, this girl can't choose either! Like pick one! Plus, it's obvious how the ""conclusion"" to the romance is going to end. I could see what was going to happen at the end, right from the beginning of the book. The other person felt shoved in there for the sake of keeping up with the love triangle. I knew who she was going to choose before she did. Even the conclusion with her ""making her choice"" was just unsatisfying. Now, the characters. Avery...annoyed me. I don't really know what else to say. She's interesting for who she is, but not what she does. She makes rash decisions and can't really get her romantic life together. I didn't really like her best friend, Max, either. There was something about the way she talked that rubbed me the wrong way. As for Libby and Nash, neither of them were that interesting either because they barely had a spot in the story. Now, the Hawthorne brothers minus Nash are more interesting. I remember really liking Xander in the first book, and I still do, but I feel like he got more awkward. So essentially, he's me if I was placed into this story! He feels a bit left out from the mystery-solving of the whole story, with Jameson and Grayson making up their own duo, despite his efforts to get involved. He's on the sidelines of whatever is going on, and makes his own ""team"" with Thea and Rebecca (I forgot how to spell her name) to compensate. I felt a bit bad for him at times. Out of Jameson and Grayson, I did like Grayson more. Despite that one chapter that described him ""dripping confidence/power"" a bit too many times, I thought he was more interesting than Jameson. This book also has too many random sub-plots that distract from the story. I wish that there was just more focus on the Toby mystery, without getting side tracked by everything else. There's a lack of closure in the ending, but in a way that made me feel apathetic if anything. I actually didn't know that this was going to be a trilogy before reading through some other s, so I guess you can say that things might finally tie up in the final book. After all of my negative thoughts, I will say that one of the things I loved about this book was the short chapters. I loved how the story was broken up, and it made the content much easier to consume. It gave me the chance to take a break whenever I felt like it, without having to read another 40 pages for the end of the chapter.Overall, definitely not my favorite, but I will still be reading the third book to see what happens next. The covers are beautiful too, so this book can be some pretty good shelf decor if anything. I'd still recommend the series as a whole because of how much I enjoyed the first, but I'd be cautious as to setting any expectations for this one prior to reading it. There are still a lot of people who enjoyed it though, which I kind of see, but unfortunately I was not one of those people. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Sep 12, 2021","Sep 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50531218-the-hawthorne-legacy

I came in with absolutely no expectations, and it was a good read. Was it the best thing I’ve ever read? No, not really. But was it an entertaining read? Yes, it was.The actual world building was really interesting and I loved the pirate themed world. I feel like there really aren’t enough pirate books in YA and it was a nice refresher from the land focused books I usually read. I thought that Fable’s magic was really unique, and I think that it definitely has potential for the sequel to this series! I wish it was developed a little more, but I can definitely see it’s role grow. I loved reading about the different lands and “cultures” of this fantasy pirate world, and it carried the story well. I found the plot of the story to be kind of predictable and some of the reveals to be a little disappointing. There are two “big” reveals about the relationships between some of the characters in the story, but the main character, Fable, hinted strongly at it before, making it not as big of a surprise. But the actual idea behind it was quite interesting, and I think that there was enough action throughout the story to make the book engaging. There were parts in the beginning that bored me, but I feel like it’s just something that’s consistent in firsts-in-a-series as the setup. However, the book definitely picks up as the story moves on, which I appreciated. I liked the main character cast, but there wasn’t really much to them? I just didn’t really care much and I found West to be a really cliche character. He’s kind of your average male love-interest with a “tragic backstory” and I just didn’t think there was much memorable about him (I had to look up his name twice while writing this oops). As for Fable, I just wish I could have connected to her more. She’s kind of your average defiant, strong willed female character and I needed more from her to care. I feel like there was supposed to be a hate-to-love romance in it, but I don’t think that it was developed enough. It felt so sudden, and idk,,,I just didn’t care much for it (even though I normally love romances on my books)!I also wish some of the other minor characters on the crew had more relevance. I feel like some of the crew were literally mentioned twice and I would have liked them to have a greater role in the story! And while the characters aren’t incredibly memorable for me, I still enjoyed reading about them. It’s just that I won’t remember most of their names a few days from now.Overall, it’s a solid book and I’m really happy I got to read this one early! I’d recommend it if you’re looking for a YA pirate book to read, and I’m pretty satisfied with it as a whole....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2020","Aug 25, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44012880-fable

It was just so boring and average, and there was nothing in this book that kept me compelled to read even more. The entire book follows a girl named Marit who is attempting to solve the murder mystery of how her father and the hundreds of people working in the mines were killed. Throughout the story, she gets closer and closer to the Vestergaard family, whom she suspects. I feel like this concept could be interesting in theory, but it just didn't appeal to me at all. I actually found the reveal to be quite interesting, but the 300 pages or so it took to get there was just lackluster. The characters in the book also didn't have anything about them that kept me rooting for them. I didn't really care for the romance, and everyone else was just so forgettable. I'm also just going to talk about the ending here in this spoiler, because the ending of the book was actually decent, until we got to this part, which just annoyed me. (view spoiler)[The main character, Marit, has the Firn (which is a deadly disease that kills people who have used too much magic. Except, surprise, she survives! Everything is all happy, and she lives happily ever after with Jakob. But why did she *happen* to survive when everyone else before her died? I feel like that entire plotpoint was done to maintain the happy ending of the story, when it would have been more dramatic if she died. I feel like this could have been a character death that made sense and I don't know, I'm just not a fan of people coming back to life. (hide spoiler)]I am still rating this book a 2.5/5 because it interested me enough to not DNF it. It wasn't necessarily a bad book, but it wasn't a good one either. I was kind of interested in seeing what happened, but it's not something I will remember a couple weeks from now.

I've seen so much hype about this book, and other than the fact that it made me smile a few times, it was so MEDICORE!

The heartfelt emails were a nice touch as well. However, I thought that the rest of it was just okay. Now, to the rest of the book. I felt like there really wasn't any plot for the entire middle of the book. Maybe this goes back to the insta-love romance, but I thought that there were so many times where I felt like there was romance just to include romance. I don't know...I guess I wanted it to be more meaningful if that makes sense. I couldn't even tell you half of what happens in this story. The side characters were also just okay. I didn't see any purpose in them, and it felt like they were only there to cheer on Alex and Henry. Overall, it was a cute read, but a slight disappointment.

It follows the main character, Zahru, who was chosen to be the sacrifice of a royal kingdom. There are three heirs to the throne who must race across the desert to kill her in order to ascend to the throne. This world is full of magic, including both “lowly magic” such as talking to animals and more powerful elemental magic. The court politics add a lot to this book, and the dynamics between the three heirs and even Zahru are interesting and well thought out.I did enjoy the magic system in it, and I liked how it was intertwined throughout the story. Sometimes, I did wish that there were less types of magic, since it got a little confusing as to what the extents were. I wish that there were more clear categories of magic too, since there were so many characters with so many different powers. It was interesting that Zahru could talk to animals though (being a Whisperer), and I feel like it’s a more unique type of magic.

All s and thoughts are my own.I won this ARC a couple weeks ago from YallWest (or YallStayHome) and I’m excited that I got a chance to read it! It is a fantasy inspired by medieval India, which I thought was unique and interesting. The story focuses on Gul, a girl who is born with a star-shaped birthmark, who has spent her life trying to kill the King out of revenge for her parents’ murder. Her path eventually crosses with Cavas, a boy willing to do anything for his terminally ill father. Together, they explore the king’s domain as they uncover new secrets.I thought that the actual world and world-building was a strong point for the story. There are very few books set in an India inspired world, and I really enjoyed the representation. I did wish that the magic system was more structured though. The pacing of the story was a little slow for me in the beginning, and I wish that it didn’t take such a long time to get there. The characters were just okay, but I felt like there wasn’t anything special about them. I didn’t connect to either Gul or Cavas as much as I would have wanted, but I didn’t dislike them either. Gul was kind of just your average female heroine looking for revenge, and I wished Cavas had more of a presence in the plot of the story. I felt like he was just “there” at times, with Gul leading the story. The only interesting thing about him was the reveal of his heritage at the end, which I guess can be a plot-point in the sequel of this story. I also didn’t like the romance as much as I thought I would. Overall, there were elements I wish could have been better, but I am satisfied with the novel as a whole! The Indian inspiration gives it a unique spin, with the magic-system playing a central role in the story. I would recommend this book especially if you enjoy the “chosen one” and “star-crossed lovers trope.” I’m excited to see what happens in the next book, and I’m grateful that I got a chance to read this one early!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 05, 2020","Jun 10, 2020","Jun 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46223341-hunted-by-the-sky

It definitely was not written amazingly in any way, but Cassandra Clare's books just have that addicting quality. I'm going to keep my  spoiler-free for anyone who hasn't read it yet! There will be spoilers for Chain of Gold though. I will have some hidden-spoiler tags though for anything that is spoilery, because there are just some things I'm upset about and want to talk about. My biggest problem of all is that there are so many plot conveniences that make no sense. There are just these things that happen that are so ""out there"" that they almost seem ridiculous. It's like Cassandra Clare desperately wanted something to happen, but couldn't find out how to do it in a logical way, so she just made it some ""newly discovered power"" instead. (view spoiler)[Like when Lucie called back Jesse from the dead. Really? Actually, her entire power where she can control all of the dead. It's just so ASDKFSJDLF like there's no extent to it. I swear that entire part where she commanded Jesse to live was a joke. I also thought Grace's powers to make guys fall in love with her were equally as dumb. Also, Cordelia leaving James and Grace's conversation at the EXACT right time, just so that Matthew can profess his love to her. (hide spoiler)] The characters were okay, and there was nothing wrong with them, but most of them were just a little boring. But I did very much like the Alastair & Thomas content!! Literally fueled my soul. This  (!) is what we need, but we only got like a chapter of it? Why are the characters I care about the most the least relevant. Anyways, we also get to experience James and Cordelia's *domestic life* after being married, which I did not care for either. I know I'm saying this a billion times, but their relationship just fell flat. There wasn't enough angst and tension or anything I guess I find thrilling in other romances. Things were boring, and even throwing in a love triangle with Grace couldn't fix it. Cordelia also makes some rash, naive decisions through the book that I found so annoying. (view spoiler)[How could you even think about signing up to be a ""warrior"" for some guy you met a few minutes ago? And this isn't just agreeing to fight on his side, it's giving up control of your entire body to do whatever he wants (or she, as revealed later). I knew this would end up horribly for her. I knew there would be a catch. And there was.  (hide spoiler)]I also liked Matthew in Chain of Gold, so I was excited to see him in Chain of Iron, until the very end of the book happened. Like WHY. PLEASE NO. Don't let this happen. (view spoiler)[I can sense the incoming love-triangle, an I want absolutely nothing to do with it. I'm so sick of love-triangles where it's so incredibly one-sided, that you'd have to be blind to not predict what will happen. (hide spoiler)] We also get more perspectives from Grace, which do help you empathize a bit more with her character. I actually really enjoyed reading about her in Chain of Gold, and I found her to be an interesting character. I don't know if something changed about her though, or if I was remembering things wrong, but she fell flat in this one for me as well. I can't think of the right word for this, but she became a little more ""pathetic""? I know I'm ranting so hard right now, but I somehow still enjoyed the book? The main plot, disregarding all those things I talked about before, was somewhat interesting! I enjoyed reading more about James's struggle with his grandfather, as well as this ""murder mystery"" that continues through the story. I also really enjoyed reading about Lucie and Grace teaming up to save Jesse.Anyways, I thought that this was mildly enjoyable, though not a great book by any standards. I can tell that a lot of people are really going to enjoy this one (and already have!) so I hope you feel better about this book than I do. :) ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Mar 03, 2021","Jun 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17699855-chain-of-iron

Almost everyone I know thinks this book is amazing, but it honestly didn’t start picking up for me until the last half. I thought there were multiple parts that were kind of boring, and I expected to enjoy it more than I actualyl did.To be honest, the book kind of confused me in the beginning. The shifting perspectives between past and present Mia threw me off for a couple chapters, but once I got used to it, it was interesting. I did like learning more about her past from the flashbacks, and I think it added more to her character than focusing the entire story on the present would. I thought the footnotes were interesting, but they were also a little confusing at times. I read this on my Kindle, and honestly found myself ignoring them out of just wanting to get through the book (sorry!).The writing was more lyrical than most, and sometimes I found that it took a while to get to the point. It’s very comparable to the way Strange the Dreamer is written, if you’d like a comparison. There are a ton of metaphors and similes, which I didn’t like too much, because I usually prefer writing that gets to the point in a more simplistic way. I think that this isn’t as much of a fault of the book as it is a reader’s preference though. I’ve heard many people that think this aspect makes the writing more “beautiful” to read, so it’s hard for me to say if it’s straight up good or bad.I thought the actual plot itself was interesting, and the last hundred pages or so were really filled with action. It really started to get interesting once it was time for Mia to do her final trial, and I wish that that it was like that earlier in the book too.The start of the story was slower than I would have hoped for, and it was kind of boring. I was going to put this book down and give up for this reason, but I decided to push through and it did get better. And while I did like the actual lore and world-building of the story, it was definitely confusing at times. I have heard people saying that this aspect gets better with a reread, so I might consider doing that in the future.There were a lot of common YA tropes present in this book, but they don’t really bother me too much. The “training school” with an “academic enemy” and “forbidden love” can be a little cliche, but I think that Kristoff did a good job with adding in other aspects to make it different. The world-building and magic system made up for these common tropes, and I actually really liked reading about the characters learning different skills and tactics while still bonding and interacting with each other.I like Mia as a character, and I liked that she was more “morally-gray”, and literally going to learn the skills needed to kill a couple of her enemies as a form of vengeance. She’s an interesting person to have the book focus on, and I enjoyed reading about her relationships with others around her. Throughout the book, she was more empathetic to those around her, and risked what she had for those that she cared for. The entire magic system and the “darkin” powers she had were interesting, and I really liked reading about Mister Kindly (and Eclipse at the end). I think that the entire darkin aspect of the book can lead well into the second book with Mia uncovering more mysteries, so I appreciated that.No spoilers, but I just want to mention that literally everyone dies. It was kind of painful to see that many characters I cared about die, but most of them did contribute to the plot of the story, so I’ll forgive Kristoff. I swear I was kind of excited to read about many of characters in this story, but they all ended up dying one way or another.I liked Mia and Tric’s relationship, but I really didn’t see anything special about it. It was a more cliche “forbidden love” type of thing, and I just wish there was more to it. I personally love reading fantasy novels with romance as one of the cores to it, so maybe it just didn’t fit my preferences. I also feel like Tric was mostly there to serve as a love interest, and I wish that there was more written about him. His backstory was pretty interesting, but for the most part, the only things written about him were him having exceptional smelling abilities, him getting into fights from others insulting him, or him and Mia falling in love. However, I did like the last chapter or so when Mia went to get revenge on his grandfather or something, and it was nice to have that aspect tie back into the story.Overall, I think that this book has potential for the right reader, but unfortunately it just disappointed me. I might check out the sequels to see if it picks up, but I’m not sure. This is definitely a great book if you enjoy a more lyrical style of writing (since that’s not something too common in YA literature), but that aspect just didn’t work for me. It wasn’t necessarily bad in my opinion, but it certainly wasn’t the great “masterpiece” I was hoping it’d be....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"May 23, 2020","May 24, 2020","May 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26114463-nevernight

The plot was okay, See more s like this at www.universewithinpages.comI truly think that the characters in this book were what made it so good. The plot was okay, but the relationships made it such an amazing read. I do wish that there was a smaller cast of characters though. I feel like there were so many people to keep track of, and it just go confusing. I wish we did see more of Christopher and Thomas though, since they were kind of cast off to the side for the entire book. They were part of the “main gang”, but I wanted to learn more about them, since they did seem like interesting characters.I absolutely loved Jesse in this book. I thought that he was such an interesting character, and I liked his backstory. I loved how the prologue connected him to Lucie and it was really interesting to see him throughout the novel. His link to necromancy was particularly interesting, and I think that it was definitely a nice plot point to be worked on in the future sequels. It was nice to get the background of why Tatiana was acting the way she was, and that her love for him caused the ruin throughout the book.I know a lot of people didn’t like Grace, but I found her to be an interesting character. Yes, she could be considered a untrustworthy and a villain by some, but I found that her personality made her an interesting character. Her conflicting interests were interesting to read about, along with the relationship between herself and her mother. She’s willing to do so much to escape her mother (even forcing this onto James), and I think that it made the “love-triangle” between her, James, and Cordelia even more interesting.James was also a favorite of mine, and I liked that he had the ability to jump across worlds (if that’s how you phrase it). It basically forwarded the entire plot of the story, in addition to his strange demon heritage. I found his entire discovery of who his grandfather really was to be kind of confusing, but it did serve as an interesting plot point, so I’m just going along with it. I also liked reading about his relationships with his friends and both Grace/Cordelia. I’m curious to see where the love-triangle goes, and honestly, that’s one of my top reasons for wanting to read the next book.As for Cordelia, I liked her, but she was definitely not one of my favorite characters. I wish that there was more to her, and she just seemed like your average heroine to me. I did like her brother, Alistair a lot, and I wish that there was more of him too. I feel like he has such a complex backstory with him protecting his sister and being a bully just to protect himself. He’s such a flawed character, but he’s always doing it to protect those that he loved, and he’s kind of underrated. To add onto that, the LGBTQ representation was nice to read about too.I did like the plot of the story, but the without the characters, I don’t think that it would have been able to stand on its own. Because of how it’s in the same Shadowhunters universe, I feel like there are some aspects of the plot that seem repetitive. Obviously, there are some differences, but the overall vibe of the story is similar to others in my opinion.It’s also kind of annoying that you need so much backstory to really understand what’s happening. I read The Infernal Devices before this (about a year ago, so my memory probably wasn’t the freshest), and it was confusing, even though I had a vague idea of what was happening. There are so many short stories and novels (especially The Infernal Devices) that you need to read, and I wish that you could read this book with less context. If you want to read this book though, please read at least The Infernal Devices. In my experience, it probably gives you the bare minimum amount of knowledge to sort-of get you through this book.Otherwise, I liked this book. It was a lot better than I had anticipated and I cannot believe that I won’t read the next book for nearly a year. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a longer fantasy read, and has read The Infernal Devices in the past. It is a really detail-oriented book, and it is not the type of book that you can skim through in a couple of hours when you’re on your book slump (which can be a good thing!)...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 07, 2020","May 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17699853-chain-of-gold

I loved that it dived right into the story and the action, but it threw me off a bit. It took me a chapter or so to really understand what was happening with the living books and the “maleficts” but once I did, it made everything 100 times better. I absolutely loved the idea of books being alive and just being real. They’re so powerful and the entire world crafted was beautiful. The sorcery and the magic added an interesting layer of fantasy that made the book special. Magic has to be one of my favorite YA tropes and the fact that hate-to-love was thrown in there too made it so much better.I loved the relationships in this book. The relationships between Silas and Nathaniel added a nice touch to this book, and I actually liked it more than the primary relationship between Nathaniel and Elisabeth. I loved that Silas truly cared for him despite the fact that he was a demon and his species wasn’t meant to be like that. With Nathaniel’s family dead, he was the only one who was there to care for him, and the friendship/bond between them was heartwarming to read about. It was really sad to know that Nathaniel was alone outside of him, and I think that fact made their relationship even more meaningful.I did also like the relationship between Elisabeth and Nathaniel. I love hate to love relationships and if you threw me a book with that in it, I am almost certain it’s going to be a good read. I liked Nathaniel’s witty humor, and I like that it’s not insta-love and that they grow closer and closer over time. I did find that Elisabeth was kind of awkward and strange at times, like when she bit Nathaniel’s hand (like is this not supposed to be weird?), but that didn’t stop me from liking their relationship. I also think that she didn’t really comprehend some of the information given to her, and there were definitely moments where I was like “why are you not getting this!” Like when she read that sorcerers carried demons next to them and wondered where Nathaniel’s demon was, I just thought that it was way too obvious to not get and it made her a little less real.As for Nathaniel himself, I loved his backstory, and I think that it’s why I liked him so much as a character. He constantly doubts himself and blames himself for all the deaths in his family, and it’s really sad. He’s always alone and he’s dragged down by the horrible acts of necromancy that his ancestors did. It made me feel really bad for him and it kind of worked itself into the present. There were so many moments that connected to his backstory, and it made him so much more real. I love him with all my heart andI did feel like some of the plot was repetitive, but I didn’t have too much of a problem with it. They have so many attempts against Ashcroft, and I feel like it can be repetitive at times. However, I do think that the characters made this small defect better and it made me want to continue on and read more. I’ve seen s that also talk about how the book is too quick at the end, and I sort of agree. I just wish there would have been more to it, but I do like how it contributed to Silas’s character....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Apr 02, 2020","May 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201395-sorcery-of-thorns

It took me weeks to get through, and I feel like I just couldn't connect with any of the characters too much. I did enjoy the enemies-to-lovers romance, but other than that, the story fell flat. It was kind of slow at times, and the pacing definitely took away from my enjoyment. Anyways, with that said, I'm still going to try to get to Blood and Honey! While it certainly isn't my favorite read, I am still looking forward to seeing what happens to all the characters and with the plot of the story. ----4/5Serpent and Dove honestly isn’t really a book I’d normally go for. I’m not the biggest fan of witch stories, but I really wanted to give it a try because of all the good things I’ve heard about it! There are so many people that loved this book, and now that I’ve finally gotten to it, I get why. This book has a perfect hate-to-love romance with forced marriage (if that’s a trope) and I loved reading abou tit.First of all, I loved getting to know Lou and Reid! I always love getting alternating perspectives in books, and it really gave important insight into what each of the characters were thinking. Their contrasting roles and how they were always meant to hate each other was interesting and I loved how their relationship developed through the story. I’m a huge fan of hate-to-love, which added to my enjoyment, but it might be a downside to those who don’t. It was nice to see how their forced marriage literally forced them to come together.Lou is the snarkiest down-to-earth character that I’ve read about for a while, and it was refreshing to see someone like that. She is someone who says what’s on her mind and isn’t afraid to defy everyone’s expectations. It was interesting that she had such a big role in the witch-society and I think that the ending gave a nice cliffhanger for the sequels.Reid contrasted Lou in so many was with his honor-bound loyalty, Christianity, and the fact that he was born to hunt witches, but it worked out so well. I honestly found him to be a quite average male lead, and there wasn’t as much stand-out-ish about him, but it worked for the story. I liked Lou pestering Reid all the time, and it was more fun to read about, especially because of how pure he was. His heritage at the end was also intertwined well to potentially lead up more into the following novels.As for the side characters, I love Coco and Ansel. I found Coco to be a really good supporting character, and she was so supportive to Lou throughout the story. Ansel was so cute too and I loved reading about him. While he is training to be a Chasseur, he was so much more relaxed, calm, and innocent than Reid, which was nice to read about. I loved how loyal both him and Coco were, and I would love to read more about them in the next books (with maybe another romance?).More generally, the plot was good, but I found the pacing to be way too slow for my enjoyment. I feel like the beginning set up nicely to introduce the characters, and the ending was a nice conclusion, but nothing really happened in the middle of the story. The middle basically consisted of Lou and Reid getting to know each other, and it got tedious after a while. I think the only reason why I was able to get through it was because of how much I liked the characters and how they pushed the story along. While we got the original heist and forced-marriage in the beginning and Lou’s mother coming after her in the end, I can’t say that there was any defining moment of the middle of the story, besides Lou and Reid falling in love.I’m going to try to not severely spoil the book, but I did find the general plot of the story interesting. The synopsis for the book honestly sums most of it up with the exception of the last quarter, so for the most part, you get what you’re promised. The entire historical France atmosphere is something that I usually wouldn’t go for, but it didn’t impact my enjoyment of the novel at all.Overall, I found this book to be well written, but slow at times. The middle of the story really took away from my enjoyment, but the beginning and the end had a really strong plot with a ton of action. The characters were well developed and they helped move the story along. While there is the main romance of Lou and Reid, the supporting characters of Ansel and Coco fit in with the story just as well.I would really recommend this book to everyone who likes witch stories with a slow-burn forced marriage hate-to-love romance! All of these tropes work well with each other, and it was quite enjoyable. If you’re not the biggest fan of slower paced novels, this might not be the book for you, but I really liked it nevertheless. I’m super excited for Blood and Honey, and I’m looking forward to reading the sequel!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,2,not setnot set,"Oct 23, 2020Apr 24, 2020","May 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40024139-serpent-dove

While the beginning was a little slow for my preferences, it picked up and the ending ended up being really good. I'd rate the first third a 3 star, the second third a 4 star, and the last third a 5 star, so I'm averaging these ratings out to a 4 star! I'm glad that my streak of good books has continued, and I want to read the next one so badly, especially with that ending/epilogue.When I first read this book, I was initially really bored. There is a ton of chapters that focus on setting up the story, but I suppose that's what needed to be done for the rest of the book (and especially because it's the first in the series). I was actually going to quit the book because of the slow pacing in the beginning, but it started to get much better once Hunt and Bryce finally met to solve the murder of Danika. As the story unfolds, the story gets really good. The last 1/3-1/4 of the book were absolutely amazing, and left me feeling really satisfied with the book. There is a ton of action and everything climaxes at this point, with facts from the earlier parts of the book tying into important events at the end. I found that there were a lot of parallels between the overall concept between this story and ACOTAR, and it felt a little like I was reading the same book with some tweaks. For instance, there is the broken female heroine slowly falls in love with a supposed ""evil"" but also broken male heroine as they heal each other through their love and ultimately save the world, but I liked both of them, so it's fine with me.I really liked the development with Bryce throughout the story, and loved the entire reveal of her true powers at the end, especially with The Drop. I didn't hate the whole fact that she was a ""party-girl,"" and I found it interesting that she was more outside of just that. Yeah, there were times where she annoyed me, but looking back, I thought she was a good character. More interesting than her character itself, I loved Bryce's relationships. The hate-to-love romance between herself and Hunt was executed nicely and while it can be cliche, it didn't affect my overall enjoyment. I loved their witty banter and the constant photo-taking made me smile. Their tragic backstories bonded them together, and I thought it was nice when they each sacrificed their lives to save the other. I do find it slightly annoying how many times they're close to death and come back to life, as I feel like it was a bit overused. It's obvious that the main character has to survive because its a series, but I wish there were just less ""miraculous recoveries from death"". I do wish there was more to her relationship with Fury and Juniper though. I feel as if they were tossed in there, and didn't really contribute much to the story. With Juniper, it seemed as if she just fit the role as a ""supportive friend"" and I don't remember doing much else to benefit the story. I just wish she had a greater role than simply hanging out and talking to Bryce. With Fury, it was more than she just wasn't present in the story. She seemed like a really interesting character, yet we barely heard from her until the last third of the story. I get that it might have been a character choice to highlight how missing she's been in Bryce's life, but I do still wish we got to see more of her. One of my favorite relationships was the one between Bryce and Ruhn. I loved the idea of them being half-twins with Bryce being disowned from her real father, and it was interesting to see both of them develop. My heart broke for Ruhn after seeing how hard he was trying to restore their friendship, and I was nearly crying when Bryce said she finally forgave him. I'm usually more interested in the romantic relationships of books like these, but I found myself to like this friendship much more (which I did like, since it's something different). Moving onto the world-building, it is definitely a strong point in this book, but it can be a bit overwhelming. Especially because it is a new world, there are a ton of politics, rulers, and buildings that took me a while to understand. For most of the book, it was a bit confusing knowing the leaders and how the world operated. It might just be more of a personal thing, but I wish that there was a little less complexity to it. I did enjoyed reading about this urban, paranormal universe, and liked the fact that there was a wide range of fantasy characters. There were also mermaids, wolves, angels, and so many others that made it interesting because it changed things up a little. I also absolutely love fae books of any kind (most of my favorites have them in it), and of course, loved their inclusion in this series. I also liked the entire magic system in this book, but I was similarly confused at times. There are so many powers with lore behind them that each group has, that it is easy to get lost. However, once I began to have greater understanding of it, it definitely made the book more interesting. I liked the concept of the Starborn fae and there is definitely room for that entire ideal to carry onto the sequels of this series. Overall, I'd consider this to be a really nice read, and I'm super glad that I decided to pick this up. I would recommend this book if you enjoyed her other novels, especially ACOTAR because of its similarities. I do get why this book isn't for everyone but if you're willing to pick this one up, I'd definitely say to go for it! It's a long one and needs some patience, but it's definitely worth it....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 11, 2020","May 16, 2020","May 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44778083-house-of-earth-and-blood

The first 60% or s*3.5/5 starsI'm back again with another *sorta unpopular* opinion and I didn't actually think that this was that amazing of a book? The first 60% or so dragged on for sooo long and it was just way too boring to hold my attention. I had to force myself to read like 50 pages a day because I didn't actually have enough motivation to get through it on my own. HOWEVER, the last 40% or so was actually pretty decent! The plot and everything started building up and things actually started to happen! Like if the first half of the book was a 2 star, the last half of the book is probably a 4 star & I'm just rounding up to 3.5 because it left me with a good impression. The CharactersThis is a four POV book, which I really loved because it's just so fun to see inside of everyone's head. We have Nikolai, our witty, charming boy king who I will forever be in love with. He desperately wants to do what is best for Ravka and restore it after all the events of Shadow and Bone. I liked seeing his internal struggles throughout the story and his desperation to balance his own problems and responsibilities. He also has some top-tier banter that actually gave me life. We also have Zoya, our general who uses her coldness to prevent herself from being seen as weak. I really enjoyed reading about her backstory in this one, and it helped me saw her as less rude and annoying. Going into this book, I had exactly 0 memory of what happened in the Grisha trilogy thanks to my short-term memory loss, but I felt like I didn't like her too much? Anyways, she got a redemption from me, so it's all good. Tragic childhood backstories will always get to me and I thought it kinda helped contribute to her character!THEN, we have Nina, probably the most boring POV of the entire book. Her story just wasn't as fun as the main arc with Nikolai/Zoya/Isaak, and I found myself speedreading the last few chapters with her in it just to get to the ""good"" perspectives (in fact, I didn't even know there was a hint at a romantic relationship until I read some of the other s). Like the plotline had absolutely no connection to what was going on with the entire rest of the story. It felt like her perspective was there just for the sake of being there and adding another 200 pages to the story. A lot of the characters in her half of the storyline were boring, and I *sorta* forgot everyone else's name that isn't Nina. I don't know, I remember really liking Nina/Matthias in Six of Crows, but she just disappointed in this one. Finally we have Isaak, a royal guard who is dedicated to serving Nikolai, especially after being saved from him years ago. I won't talk about his importance, because it gets revealed later in the story, but you'll have to trust me on the fact that it's kinda interesting!The RelationshipsI'm going to dedicate this entire section to talking about Nikolai and Zoya, because I didn't really find any of the others that relevant. I loved these two. They just have such a fun dynamic going and their contrasting personalities just fit so well together! Like Nikolai being warm and open and Zoya being known to be cold and closed off is just so good?? I loved seeing their relationship grow throughout the story, and I feel like we get crumbs of what could soon be a romance between them? Please give it all to me. They have a ton of cute moments and I don't know what else to say besides the fact that they just work. The Plot & PacingThe plot wasn't bad (besides the Nina plot). The pacing was the big issue. I know I already talked about it, but we're all just going to hear it again. The first half of the book is honestly a waste of time. It goes so slow and I can tell you approximately two things that happen in it. And this book is huge. The first half is a whole 250 pages. I was struggling to find the patience to read through it all. They do a lot of talking and talking and not any doing. There is just so much lengthy setup for the rest of the book, and I just wish that I could have put it on 2x speed like a Youtube video I want to rush through. I will give credit for the last half though. There's a big reveal at the end that I sorta saw coming because I accidentally spoiled myself, but it's still interesting regardless. Things actually happen! I think that 80% of the story happened in the last half. It made it so fun to read through, and I just wish that I didn't have to go through the slowness of the other half to get to it. Final ThoughtsOverall, I thought this book wasn't bad. I will still be trying to read Rule of Wolves as soon as I can, and I'm kind of looking forward to seeing what will happen next! I would recommend it if you've read and liked the Grisha series. If you haven't, I'd really recommend reading both Six of Crows and Shadow and Bone, because there are some major spoilers for it in this one. Also, it'll make you less confused. It was a fun read, and I'm glad I knocked off another book from my physical TBR....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2021","Nov 24, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36307634-king-of-scars

I loved the concept of it and it’s been on my tbr for a while so I ended up buying it. I read a bit of it at the bookstore and was thinking that maybe this could be an amazing book. If you couldn’t tell by my rating, it wasn’t.First of all, I didn’t understand the plot at all. It made sense in the beginning but I don’t even know what it was at the end. Also I don’t know if you’d call it a plot twist, but whatever it was, it was just bad. The ending made no sense at all and it didn’t align with the rest of the story. It just annoyed me a lot. The entire thing with Roja resurrecting (I don’t know what it’s called) from the lake was confusing and it didn’t make any sense.With the characters, they just deteriorated the more and more I read. Roja became so annoying at the end and the hatred between Roja and Blanca for one of the scenes were so forced. Blanca had no depth to her and she was basically “the sister who cared about her sister”. The characters were so plain and they could have been developed so much more. That were also so predictable, and never strayed away from the stereotypes assigned in the beginning of the book. Roja was always the misunderstood, lonely character, while Blanca was always the soft character everyone liked. The idea of “I won’t let the swans take my sister” got so tiring after a while, and the entire book is basically based off of that.The same applied to both Page and Barclay. They were so dull and there was nothing to them. I also hated their romance with Roja and Blanca. They were predictable (which doesn’t bother me that much), but they were also annoying. The entire idea of Blanca trying to make Barclay fall in love with her was such an empty idea that the author didn’t continue with. It felt so unnecessary other than to maybe see the lengths each sister will go for each other. With Liam, he was just a bad antagonist. I guess the reason he hated Barclay made sense but it was just so plain and basic.What I did like (and I talked about before) was the beginning. It gave background and set up the story well, and I feel like it could have led to something better. Anyway, I wouldn’t really recommend this book, but if you’ve read through and think you’ll like it, then you can give it a shot. I think it had the potential to be something better, but it was just disappointing....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 09, 2018","Nov 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36952596-blanca-roja

They’re only the target you paint around what you want. You still have to hit the bull’s-eye yourself.”I actually liked Muse of Nightmares a lot more than Strange the Dreamer. The beginning was just okay, but the story got a lot better as it progressed. This book was of similar pacing to the first one, but it felt more necessary and enjoyable. The side characters (not Lazlo and Sarai) got better from this book. A bunch of characters that I considered ""tolerable"" became much more interesting. The perspectives were more meaningful that the prior book. We get more insight into Eril-Fane and Azareen, and how (view spoiler)[Sarai is their half daughter, so we get family reunions and I liked it (hide spoiler)]. Also Thyon gets so much better and we kind of see how he's a genuinely good person. (view spoiler)[ He talks about how he regrets being mean to Lazlo, and it makes me feel really sympathetic towards him (hide spoiler)]. Also I really didn't like Minya in the first book but so much information got revealed and I feel really bad for her now. We get a lot of information about her and why she was sort of evil in the first book. Ruby, Sparrow, and Feral were good characters, but I felt like there wasn't as much to them as there were for all the others. With Kora and Nova, I enjoyed their side story in this. (view spoiler)[I mean I appreciated that she suddenly stopped being insane after Sarai talked to her, but for me, it was almost too immediate. Her mood took a huge turn, and it felt kind of unnatural. (hide spoiler)] I felt like they didn't really do much for the story, other than offer another side plot device. They didn't contribute much towards the story and honestly this book would have been fine without them. This book answered a lot of the questions from the first book, which made it more interesting in general. I liked the plot more in this than Strange the Dreamer. It talks about why the god spawn are even here in the first place and it gives a lot of information into the powers that they were exploiting. I really liked the ending together because it tied everything up from this book and even the prior one. We get to know the name of the city which takes us back full circle, and it was a good conclusion to the series. Also it opens up even more questions which sounds like there might be another book? Overall, I'm happy I finally started/finished the series, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes YA fantasy as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 08, 2018","Nov 09, 2018","Nov 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25446343-muse-of-nightmares

Dream up something wild and improbable,"" she pleaded. ""Something beautiful and full of monsters.""I enjoyed Strange the Dreamer, and honestly it was better than I expected it to be. I recently decided to pick up due to Muse of Nightmares coming out. There were certain parts of the book that I really enjoyed, but I felt like the pacing was a little off. For example, the book felt way too slow at times, with almost too much necessary detail. I did enjoy certain parts of the book, but I wouldn't recommend this to you if you hate slow paced books. This took me a while to get through (and I actually started this a long time ago, before getting bored and dnfing it), but overall I'm glad I read it. I love all the characters in this book. For the most part, the characters all came together or helped enhance the plot in some way. What I didn't like was the fact that some of the characters were kind of dull, like Mina. I felt like she was just an average antagonist, with the only thing setting her apart was that she's the sister of Sarai. I did enjoy reading about the main characters, Lazlo and Sarai though. The writing of this book is actually really good, but it sometimes felt necessary with all the random detail. I felt like it would have been fine if Laini Taylor summed it up in a quicker fashion to make it a little faster. The only part I felt like was good the way it was are the world building details. It helped me to image Weep vs. Lazlo's fantasy Weep in a more vivid way (that I enjoyed). Also, the plot was just okay in the book. I mean there wasn't really anything special about it, and looking back, not much happened for the 500 or whatever pages. Towards the ending, a lot more was revealed, but it took a while to get there. It bored me towards the beginning, but it got better the more the book progressed. This book was pretty good and I'd recommend it if you enjoy slower paced books with more character and story detail. I'll definitely read Muse of Nightmares, so I'm actually looking forward to that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 02, 2018","Nov 07, 2018","Oct 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28449207-strange-the-dreamer

It was now her curse.”This was a really good ending to Throne of Glass, and I'm happy I ended up picking up the series. It picks up a bit after Aelin first got trapped inside the coffin. This book finishes up the series really well (like I literally just said), and it sums up everything that I was anticipating from the prior books. We get to see what happens to the Wyrdkeys, we get to see what happens to Aelin and the coffin, and we get to see what happens to Maeve. Also, we get to see pretty much every character from the prior books (which is my favorite part about Sarah J. Maas's writing), so it's pretty good. The characters are great. As usual, I loved Aelin and Rowan. (view spoiler)[I was really happy to know that them and everyone else had a happy ending, but it was kind of odd how many times Aelin resurrected (I was glad of it though). (hide spoiler)] All the other characters were good, but there were some whose story I wasn't really invested in as much, like Nesryn. I liked how the story alternated perspectives, you can get a glimpse into what each character is thinking. The plot was slow for me, but I found this the case with the entire series. (view spoiler)[Everyone got their happy ending, so I enjoyed it, but I almost wish that there was something more realistic. (hide spoiler)] Otherwise, it was interesting because you got to see the result of everything from the prior books. This is a short , but the book was good overall, so I'd recommend picking up the series if you haven't (even though 7 books is a lot). The conclusion was probably my favorite part, and I found that the entire book in general was better than the previous books in the series. I'm glad the series ended on a good note. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Oct 26, 2018","Oct 27, 2018","Sep 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33590260-kingdom-of-ash

This wasn’t my favorite book in the world (I guess it was okay), but I know that it has the potential to appeal to certain audiences, especially those who liked The Selection. Instagram: www.instagram.com/universewithinpagesBlog: www.universewithinpages.comThis entire story is kind of predictable. You could pretty much tell what was going to happen with the characters and the plot. Like, yeah Elizabeth (or whoever) is going to end up with Cedric. The entire story leads to it, and you can predict it from the very beginning of the book. Of course Elizabeth won’t end up with anyone chosen for her. That would go against the entire point of the book. Sometimes I am okay with predictable romances, but I didn’t enjoy this one. Even with this, the plot is just predictable as a whole. You could tell what was going to happen out of the fact that the author wants everyone to have a happy ending. The book may try to bring in doubt, but everything ends up fine. It’s like the book laid out the entire plot out for the reader at the very beginning, while attempting to take it away when you already know that it’s going to happen. The characters are quite dull as well. Elizabeth is your typical royal princess who doesn’t appreciate her royal life, and wants freedom. There’s nothing more to it. Elizabeth is desperate for the chance to “choose” who she will marry (despite the fact that the Glittering Court offers very limited options), and decides to enter the Glittering Court under the name of her maid, a place where common people are trained to become elite women. Now, Elizabeth knows everything she needs to succeed (because she is royalty), so oh no, she has to put in so much effort to keep it a secret. Then, Cedric suddenly realizes that Elizabeth isn’t Adelaide, but it isn’t a big deal. But, oh no, something happens and she suddenly succeeds out of nowhere, giving everyone a reason to question her. Her friendships are in shambles, and nobody trusts her anymore. After that, it’s all a long pushed romance between Elizabeth and Cedric. Tamsin and Mira are kind of just there. I mean, Tamsin wants to succeed at everything, and Mira is that supportive friend. That’s all you need to know. I mean maybe it could be better if the characters were developed more, especially since we don’t see much of Tamsin throughout the book. I think that if they had more of a point to them, it would have led to a better book. I do agree with a lot of other s saying that this isn’t a fantasy, because it isn’t. I definitely think that this should be classified as some other type of fiction, as there is no indication that it could be fantasy. It sounds a bit like historical fiction honestly. If you were to give me this book and ask me to classify it, fantasy would be something that I would not give you. Yes, there are some made up lands, but there is no magic or defined world that makes it a fantasy book. Going back to my The Selection comparison, I think that this book is similar to it in different ways. That might be why I didn’t enjoy it, because I disliked The Selection. Basically, the only main difference between the two is that in The Selection, the prince is the rich one, but in The Glittering Court, Elizabeth is the rich one. Both main characters try to fight for a better life, and both fall in love with someone that is in the literal opposite social class. The two books also try to maintain the romance despite any big events that happen that may destroy it. Overall, I would recommend this to those who enjoyed The Selection, or want a book that has a similar feel to it that The Selection has. Also, I would recommend this book to those who want an easy read, or for those who want to read about a simple romance.

I feel, perhaps, far more than I should. It would be only a slight exaggeration to say that my goal in life is to outrun my mind, my memories.” Okay, I didn't even know if I wanted to read this after finishing Ignite Me. Ignite Me has to be one of my favorite reads this year, and I literally ended up buying it. Now that I do realize that maybe I kind of do want to read a continuation of my favorite characters, I picked up this book from my library. And I had high hopes. I wanted this to be my favorite book, but of course it just wasn't great. I guess that maybe some of my liking towards the book came from how much I enjoyed the previous books in the series, but it was not good. I mean, Warner is okay throughout the book, but Juliette was literally the worst character. All she did was complain and whine about her relationship issues, while the entire world was basically in shambles. What happened to the character that was actually starting to develop throughout the first three books? Well she's gone. More on the characters. Warner wasn't bad, but he was all broken from Juliette so he needed a lot of help. He kept on getting all emotional about Juliette, and I got really confused about how they can go to having a somewhat okay relationship to it all being destroyed for no reason. Warner suddenly becomes different in the beginning of the book, and honestly, he's all a mess as of right now. If Warner was bad, then I don't even know what Juliette was. I don't even know about how I could stand her throughout the entire book. After a huge missing piece of her past gets thrown at her,(view spoiler)[ about her parents being adopted, and whatever (hide spoiler)] she became stupidly emotional about everything, running around and throwing her emotional issues at everyone standing in her way. I don't even know how anyone could stand her without feeling like throwing themselves out of a window in frustration. Like I'm surprised at how sane Kenji is after everything he's been through. It's as if you took the Juliette from Shatter Me, dumped a bunch of emotional issues on her (tacked on to her already prevalent parental issues), and slammed her in Restore Me. I kind of wish I did see more of the other characters in this book. Adam and James are only there for a few lines of the book, either to talk about emotional issues (what a surprise) or to awkwardly hug Warner as he's crying over emotional issues (once again). I mean, they weren't the best characters, but it would have been a good break to hear more about them compared to an entire book on Warner or Juliette. Also, Castle is literally just there. It's like the author had no reason to put them in other than to dump a load of top secret information on Juliette. I don't remember him doing anything else besides that. As with the new characters, they were okay. They were kind of forced into the story, and really served no purpose to the story. All they basically did was introduce a new friendship, which has no development and is almost completely meaningless at this point. I feel like if there was a plot, it was hidden under all the annoying characters. I mean it's obviously about the war, but everything was so focused on Juliette and Warner, that nothing happened until the last few chapters of the book. Even then, everything is so sudden and almost out of nowhere. One moment Juliette and Warner are dealing with their emotional issues, and the next moment Juliette gets (view spoiler)[captured I think, but then again I probably could have paid attention moreMaybe the one thing that had potential was the multiple perspectives. I was really excited to see into Warner's head, besides Juliette's perspective, which we have encountered for the first three books. I think that if this was a better book, it would have been really interesting to see his thought processes. I'm not sure if I hated this book because it was truly bad, or if I had higher expectations. I really wanted this to be like Ignite Me, but it just wasn't for me in the end. I might try reading the 5th book when it does come out, and I hope it becomes a redemption for me, because I really liked the story and concept. Overall, if you wanted to read Shatter Me, I advise you to do so, because it was actually a good series that progressively got better. However, I do tell you to just skip this book altogether, because really, it's all just a waste of time. You'll just be better off in the long run. I wasn't sure how much I should push this book down, but I was feeling kind so I rounded up to a 3 star.

It's about Warner who is literally my favorite character in the entire seriesb. It's in Warner's perspective But of course my critical self has to decide that maybe this isn't the best book. I mean, I definitely got through it and it wasn't horrible, but I wish I enjoyed this more. I read this right after Ignite Me, so I already knew all the information revealed throughout this. There was really no point in this book, but then again, I guess that maybe you're supposed to read this right after Shatter Me? There's no new plot, and everything bridges off of the first and second book. The only good thing is that we get to see more of what's inside Warner's head and his emotions. Reading through, I sympathized with Warner and I felt really bad about him and his relationships with others and especially his father. We get to see more of Juliette's journal entries that she made while she was in the asylum, and they're incredibly meaningful. Even though we don't actually get to see her in person, we get to know more about her past life, and her relationships with her family. (view spoiler)[We see how her family has impacted her, and how her family abused her in the past. (hide spoiler)]Basically, I didn't hate it, but it wasn't great either.

I saw a bunch of 4 and 5 star s, and I was trying to get myself to like it, but in certain portions, I just found it boring. The concept sounded really great, as it kind of reflects back on the title of the book. The plot was just okay, and I felt like a lot of it wasn't necessary. Basically, the entire book was about Amari's developing relationships with Maram, Idris, and a few other characters. I feel like there wasn't any exciting events, as the entire book was about Amari going to a few events and pretending to be Maram. I did like the romance in the book, and I liked Maram's development all the way until the end of the book, where she turned against Amari and she went back to her undeveloped self. I mean, I might pick up the sequel to see if it gets any better, but this book wasn't bad as a whole. I can definitely see why others may like it, and it's all up to subjection.

Going into this, I had no idea that it was a The Little Mermaid retelling, but I can definitely see the rough outline of it in To Kill a Kingdom. I'm usually not the biggest fan of retellings, so if you do, you'll probably like this book more than I did. Basically, it's a story about a siren who is known for being killing a prince every year that gets turned into a human by her mother. While she appears to be drowning in the sea, a prince comes to rescue her that just happens to be a siren killer (and pirate). A slow romance develops despite everything about them throughout the book. With the characters, I feel like they were just okay. There was nothing special about them. I can also say that the side characters were below average. All I got from Madrid was her being friendly and supporting Lira more than the others. She can be considered as a good friend, but I can't think of anything else besides that. Yukiko was the person that didn't trust anyone but herself. She did things to benefit only herself, and we see like two chapters of her (going by the name of Sakura) until she suddenly appears out of nowhere, now with the new name of Yukiko. She joins them on their journey and does nothing. I guess she's a good fighter, but I didn't get what purpose she had in the story. I liked Kye's slow transition from not trusting Lira to trusting Lira, but besides that, he wasn't the best character. He was just Elian's good friend that goes by everything he says. The Sea Queen was your typical antagonist, wanting everything to go her way, and especially with Lira's personality, you know it just won't work out well.Overall, this book was a bit dull at times, and I would have liked to see more worldbuilding and better characters. It was a really enjoyable book overall and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys retellings, The Little Mermaid, and I guess sirens. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,"Mar 27, 2018","Mar 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34499221-to-kill-a-kingdom

It was on my TBR, anticipated releases, and one of the books I was extremely excited about reading this year. I mean by reading the description, it sounds intriguing. Two powerful women from two different time periods somehow connect. All in all, it sounded like a cool book.However, any expectations I had of this book were destroyed when I read it. I mean, the prologue was intriguing, and was what I wanted the book to be like. It had action, and I was hoping that we'd follow that same plot line, or have that same level of excitement throughout the book. That wasn't the case. The entire book was boring, and you could literally predict everything that was going to happen from reading the prologue. Like will she end up being a Blood Queen or a Sun Queen? Yeah, you could basically figure that out from reading a few chapters of when everything is fast forwarded a few years. Now that I basically knew what the ending outcome would be in the very beginning of the book, it really destroyed any motivation I had to continue. Also, especially with the trials that Rielle had to face, I feel like it was all the same thing with different wording. They're all basically the same trial over and over again with different elements instead. They all had the same point to it, and it was just a waste of space. Everything was so boring, and I was done with this book at by the first 25%. The book was really long. 512 pages to be exact. And of what? I don't know. Everything was so boring, that I literally skimmed through just for the sake of a. finishing the book, and b. out of the hope that maybe something will happen to save this book. Also, I would have been fine if the book's plot was a bit better. In fact, I recently read ACOWAR, which was much longer than this book (around 700 pages), but I found it much more tolerable. The characters were really annoying too. Rielle was nothing but annoying. All she did was mope around about Audric and how she deserves to be with him. Also, there's not much development throughout the entire story with Rielle. She's basically your typical character with a thirst for power who wishes to be queen. That's it. I mean it may sound good, but honestly I couldn't stand her in the book. Going back to Audric, he was just okay. I mean he wasn't as annoying, but I felt that he was just there to throw in a love interest for Rielle. He didn't do anything except barge into conversations, and I just didn't get his point. Corien was also one of the dullest characters (or voices in heads) that I've read about. He basically just wants Rielle to release her true feelings, so just pressures her throughout the entire book. I didn't like Eliana either, so her half of the book was a complete waste of time. I feel like she was supposed to be this action, super cool heroine, but I pretty much got the opposite from her. She doesn't know what she's doing half the time, and idk what's with her romance with Simon. Simon was a bit better, but I literally can't remember any memorable moments with him. Although I guess he did have more of a point that Audric, he wasn't memorable. Like this half had more of a pointless plot, and the other half with Rielle had an even more pointless plot, so it kind of adds up to a pointless book. For things I do like, the last 10% or so did get a bit better, and there were parts scattered throughout the book that I would give a 4 star, but the author didn't keep this up. I didn't pay attention throughout the book, so there was this cool connection between the two characters that I barely got because of my short attention span, and me skimming the book. I think I would have enjoyed it, but maybe it would have been better to grasp the readers attention at the beginning of the book, rather than when I'm basically bored to death at the end. yeah I can go on for longer, but my motivation is low after this bookI received this ARC from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for a honest .

Also, the romance in the story was a nice addition to the book since it mainly focused around the plot. Eelyn's relationships develop over time, and it makes sense, compared to if it was more faster paced. Besides Eelyn, I wish her brother was more present throughout the book, as for the majority of the book, he is very distant.Overall, I would definitely recommend it when it comes out. I wish I could write more, but I wanted to keep it spoiler free. I received this eARC from The NetGalley team at St. Martin's Press for an honest .

I didn't have the highest expectations, but I was hoping that this would be a solid murder mystery, along with learning more information about the characters and the motives along the way. The first mistake I made was assuming that since the library included ""mystery"" on the label, it must be a mystery driven story. Turns out I was wrong, and 90% of this book was romance. I would have been fine with it normally, as sometimes I enjoy small romances, but this was just badly done altogether. First of all, the plot was just bad. There's literally nothing else to say. (view spoiler)[The whole story is made up of a bunch of murders, with Makani and Ollie's romance along the way. (hide spoiler)] The author completely dumped murders in and by the end of the book, about 6 people were killed or almost killed. The murders had no meaning and when the motive of the murderer was revealed, there was no depth in it. Also, who the murderer is halfway through the book. By that point, I was considering DNFing it. The main reason I was still reading it from the first chapter was to figure out who the murderer was. The author tried to throw blame at a variety of characters to deflect the reader from knowing who murdered everyone, but there was no solid reasoning towards it. Also, when Makani's deep past was revealed, I actually didn't care. I have no idea why it was even in there. Its probably connected to the murderer's motives but it was so random and out of place. In addition to the plot, this book ruined both Ollie and Makani to me in a long list of ways. I didn't understand the romance also and it seemed so forced. One day, Makani randomly talks to Ollie, but then they suddenly fall in love for no reason at all. They don't develop any relationship that slowly turns into love. In fact, they barely talk to each other at all prior to them deciding they should fall in love. The characters themselves are just so dull. Makani is your average girl who is desperate for love, and I don't even know what to say about Ollie. It's like he's just there. He doesn't play any important role in the story (neither does Makani). I'm not sure if they author tried to make the reader pity him by making him an orphan, and giving him long work sessions, but I could care less about him. However, when you compare him with Makani, it's like he's suddenly an amazing character again. With Makani, I can't even count the number of times she annoyed me. She doesn't care about anyone but herself (and Ollie), and constantly ignores her friends who are a bit cautious of Ollie. I think it would be a bit reasonable to be cautious of someone if they find your phone number out of nowhere and start contacting you. It's reasonable to say that maybe if you don't give someone your phone number, but they randomly find it for an unknown reason, it's a bit suspicious. At one point I considered her being the killer, because from when she was watching the news about people being killed, it's like she didn't care at all. She kept on pointing out that ""oh the facts were wrong"" instead of focusing on what really happened, that three of her classmates got killed. I'm surprised she isn't a psychopath either. Actually, the book was so bad that I didn't pay attention at all, and maybe I missed a few facts, but I wasn't going to suffer by reading every detail with close attention. Overall, this book gets 1 star because I don't give out 0 stars, and .25 stars for trying and for it's potential. I don't know where the praise on the back of the book comes from, but it just wasn't for me. In the end, if you want to waste a few hours of your life, reading about a narcissistic girl and her love interest, with no plot, I think this is the book for you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,not set,"Mar 07, 2018","Mar 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15797848-there-s-someone-inside-your-house

It wasn't as bad as Siege and Storm, but it wasn't as good as Shadow and Bone. I found myself skimming a large amount of the book out of boredom. Also, Zoya was really annoying throughout the entire book. All she did was complain and I probably missed out on the few lines of wisdom she did have.

She remains her irritable self throughout the entire book, and never hangs out with anyone unless they personally come up and ask her if she wants to go.

It’s time to remake the world.” I really enjoyed this book. It was heartbreaking, happy, sad, and overall, a well written book. I think that having the two perspectives (Noah's on the earlier part of their lives and Jude's on the later) really brought together the story well, and I enjoyed seeing the contrast between Noah and Jude. Each of the characters that were mentioned, although seeming random at the beginning of the book, were tied together between the two through different plots and scenarios. I liked how the two characters slowly changed over time, due to the events that occurred, and in some cases, the grief they still felt. My opinions about the different characters wavered throughout the book, and the second I thought one person had done something bad, the author brought in backstory, letting me sympathize and reason with the character.I don't have much to say about the characters, other than that both of them continuously got better as I progressed through the story. In the beginning, Jude was annoying, but I think that through the backstory the author brought in and time, she became a much better character (in my opinion)....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Feb 08, 2018","Feb 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20820994-i-ll-give-you-the-sun

I actually liked Everless, and thought that it was a really good first booI was really excited to read Evermore, but I feel like it just let me down. I actually liked Everless, and thought that it was a really good first book with good potential for the sequel. With Evermore, I do feel like it just lacked something in every area (the plot, characters, and overall story). There's a huge focus on the entire Sorceress and Alchemist thing, and it just kind of repeated itself. It felt like Jules having strange visions and memories about her past lives and Caro took up the bulk of the story, and was just dull. The end was kind of predictable in a way where I pretty much guessed what was going to happen early on in the book. Compared to Everless, essentially nothing happened in the book. One of the elements that bothered me a lot more than the first book were the characters. It seemed like they all declined in depth which made the entire book boring. Jules was persistent and predictable in a boring way, and she doesn't really do much in the story. The same goes for Liam, and I think that a lot more could have been done with him, especially with the background and relationship between him and the others in the first book. I don't know how to describe the relationship between them, but it was just so random and out of nowhere. With Caro, she was just a typical villian. She had no motive to her other than to recover her heart (like the alchemist and sorcerer legends said) and she was also just there. There was nothing more to her than her just being a plot device. Ina also bothered me because she just mimicked everything Caro was doing, and then immediately went onto Jules's side to sudden of a way. The plot was also pretty repetitive and boring. It was just Jules going to various locations in order to fulfill her plan to kill Caro over and over again. Evermore was such a useless book that I genuinely think that this book could have been removed from the series or summed up in twenty pages or so at the end of Everless. The only thing that changes about the plot is the change in scenery, which is too random to be exciting or not boring. Anyways, I was hoping Evermore would be an amazing sequel to Everless in order to start off my year in a good way, but it wasn't that. Evermore was a huge downgrade to Everless, and I'm just sad about the potential this series had to be good. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 05, 2019","Jan 05, 2019","Jan 19, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/37693552-evermore

This was an amazing book that I only wish I had more of (especially with another cliffhanger).For the characters, Legendary is mainly focused around Tella (having Caraval been focused around Scarlett). I admit that she was annoying at times, but I enjoyed her as a character overall. She had motives beyond just the plot of the story, that changed and adjusted throughout the course of the book. Dante also appears more in this book and I think that he's one of my favorite characters so far. Especially with the plot twist at the end. I would say more about him but everything there is to say a big spoiler for Legendary. The only returning characters I didn't like in the story were Scarlett and Julian, who weren't really present besides a few romance related scenes.With the plot, it was a bit slow in the beginning, but it got much better as it progressed. The plot revolves around Tells repaying someone (going back to the letter in the ending of Caraval), and there's also not much to say without spoiling. It's just a really great book. We also get to learn more about Scarlett and Tella's mother which I didn't care too much for but was a nice addition. Maybe I'll add more when Legendary gets released, but it is an amazing book that I would buy once it releases. It was just as good (or more) as I anticipated and I just really want to read more now. I would definitely recommend this to anyone despite if you like fantasy or not. I received this eARC from Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest .

A bunch of questions and plots from the prior boo4.25/5 I found this to be a really good end to The Dark Artifices, and it ties up everything nicely. A bunch of questions and plots from the prior books get summed up and the ending is satisfying, yet the epilogue leads nicely into the next books in the series. There is definitely a lot more of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and I enjoyed that because I like faeries in general. We also get to see much more Clave politics and it gives more insight into the book as a whole.I enjoyed all the characters, but if you’ve seen my prior s, Mark and Kieran are still my favorite. I did find their relationships with Cristina awkward and I didn’t really like the love triangle (I felt like the one with Cristina and Kieran came out of nowhere). They don’t get developed as much in the book though, and I feel like their biggest role in the story was the romance along with Kieran and the Unseelie court ((view spoiler)[as well as Kieran killing the Unseelie King/Cristina killing Kieran’s brother (hide spoiler)]). What I did like was Kieran’s involvement with the Unseelie court and interactions with his brothers. I liked Adaon’s presence but Oban was kind of tossed in there (I think as a plot with the Dearborn’s). Emma and Julian were okay throughout the book but I think they could have been better. I get that Julian had no emotions towards the beginning of the book for a reason, but it was just boring to read about. A big focus was on their paratabai romance, and I would have preferred them as characters to be focused on the plot but I don’t really know. So many parts of the story were centered around that and I didn’t care as much about it as some of the Roehrig parts of the plot. Also with Jem coming in (view spoiler)[to talk about the broken Parabatai curse (hide spoiler)] it felt so random and out of nowhere and I think that something more could have been done to explain and give more details as to how it was done. The side plot with Ty and Kit raising Livvy was pretty interesting, but Ty’s recklessness bothered me. It did fit his characteristics though so that’s all personal preference. I liked how Shade was brought into the story from this and I also like them as a duo altogether. With Dru, she didn’t really play as much of an important part of the story as Ty and Kit, and what she did do was random. I didn’t like her character as much as the others. Gwyn and Diana did a little for the story, but I just wish they had done more altogether. Diego and Jaime were okay, along with all the other side characters in the story. Also with the weddings, they were kind of random and unnecessary but I guess it was nice to see what happened to all the TMI characters.I liked the plot throughout the story because it developed upon everything from the prior two books. Like I said before, the Unseelie stuff was pretty interesting and it was nice to know about The First Heir and it’s impact on the story. The Dearborns and the Clave were good plot devices and it helped set up what was happening in the book. Also, the book picks up right where Lord of Shadows left off, so we get to see what becomes of Annabel as well. I did feel like the antagonists of the story (Dearborn and his followers) were dull, and there wasn’t much to their character besides the fact that they hated the protagonists. I think it would have been better if there was more depth to them. Overall, it’s a pretty good book and I think that it was a really good last book. Now that the series is over, I would recommend this to anyone who has read TMI and Clockwork because it was pretty good (and characters from the two series made appearances). I thought that the length would have made the book too slow, but I think that there was enough detail and plot to last through the book and keep the reader interested. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Dec 07, 2018","Dec 08, 2018","Jan 07, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13541056-queen-of-air-and-darkness

Towards the beginning, it can get very slow, although the pace starts to pick up throughout the story. I would have preferred a faster pace, but the thing that really bothered me was the characters. Yes, Katsa is a headstrong character, but after the first few chapters, she really started to annoy me. She pushes those who love her away in favor of ""love at first sight"". Within a few encounters (view spoiler)[Katsa begins falling in love with Po, before Po randomly declares that he loves her? (hide spoiler)]. I feel like the entire romance was rushed and sudden, and it would have been better if there was more overall development. And with the plot, it started to get tedious and boring towards the end of the book. I feel as if half the book was them riding on horses with talking as a filler space. I didn't know if it was an important part of the book or not, but when the author described Po like (view spoiler)[oh no Po is blind (hide spoiler)] I just didn't care anymore by that point. I wasn't excited about the characters, and I probably skimmed a bit as well.I also think that the villain of the story could have been mentioned more. I tend to read books quickly, and I didn't catch onto the details of the villain as much as I would have liked to. I definitely think it would have been more interesting to bring up more details surrounding him. I probably wouldn't read the book again, but I would continue the series to see if the books improve or not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jan 29, 2018","Jan 29, 2018","Jan 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3236307-graceling

Every human heart was chained by love.I really enjoyed Lady Midnight. I actually read this abou a year ago, but I decided to reread it in anticipation for Queen of Air and Darkness. I found it slightly worse than what I thought it was going to be, but enjoyed it anyways, I liked how there were new characters, while the characters from TMI and TID made small cameos instead of being present throughout the book. I hated Clary and Jace from TMI so I’m glad they took a step back in this series. For the new characters, they were okay for the most part. I liked Mark in this the most and I think he’s probably my favorite character. Cristina, Diego, Kieran, and Julian’s siblings were all okay but I felt like there wasn’t anything special about them. At certain parts, I liked Julian and Emma, but their relationship annoyed me. The plot was slow at times, but it was okay enough to keep me intrigued. I felt like this book could have been shorter and at a faster pace, but it was readable. I liked how a lot of different beginnings of plots were added in for the following books in the series. I’m interested to see Malcolm/Annabel and possibly Kit’s roles in the following books (especially Queen of Air and Darkness). Also I loved how the chapter titles were named after lines in Annabel Lee and I felt that it was a nice addition to the book.Anyways, I’d really recommend this if you haven’t read the series. In my opinion, it’s a huge upgrade from TMI and a small downgrade from TID so it’s a good read. I’m excited for Queen of Air and Darkness to come out and I’m anticipating to how the series will come to a close....more",Notes are private!,0,9,2,"Nov 22, 2018Nov 17, 2017","Nov 23, 2018Nov 17, 2017","Nov 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25494343-lady-midnight

I think that this book was an improvement from Lady Midnight overall. This book leads really well into the plot of Queen of Air and Darkness and leaves you on a sort of cliffhanger. First of all, the characters remained pretty similar in the amount I liked them. I found that Julian and Emma continued to be annoying, and I didn’t like their relationship throughout the book. I liked how Kit and Ty became closer friends, but I felt like they weren’t anything special. Also, Dru was barely present throughout the book, and she didn’t contribute much to the story either. (view spoiler)[All she really did was introduce Jaime. (hide spoiler)] I found that Diego and Jaime were kind of unnecessary and they didn’t really do much. (view spoiler)[With Livvy, I felt like her death was random, and I can’t think of anything it would have done other than open up the story so that it was more about the other Blackthorn children. (hide spoiler)] With Cristina, Mark, and Kieran, I didn’t really know what I felt about them. I think that Cristina was an interesting character, but there wasn’t much to her. She didn’t have much of a role, and I felt like the only thing she did was help provide something to split up Mark and Kieran with. I actually felt really bad for Kieran in this book and he kept on getting betrayed so I hope he’s finally happy in Queen of Air and Darkness. I can’t decide whether I like or dislike Mark too because he’s trying to do what’s right but at the same time hurting others.I liked how Annabel carried through this book, and I really like her as a character. I feel like she’s a good “villain” because she has her motives and she’s trying to do what she thinks is right. The politics stuff at the end surprised me and I think it was an interesting setup for the next book. With Malcolm, he wasn’t really present in this book (view spoiler)[because he got stabbed (hide spoiler)] but I liked how his presence carried through the book with Annabel and the Clave. With all the the other miscellaneous characters (from the prior novels), it was nice how they made small appearances but I don’t think that they were meant to contribute much besides that. I found that the plot of this slowly got better throughout the book. Overall, I found it to be more interesting than Lady Midnight (it was kind of a setup). I liked how there was more about the seelie and unseelie courts as well as faeries in general. It remains on the slower side, but in some parts, there’s enough detail to keep it interesting.Overall, I enjoyed this and it was better than I remembered it to be. This leads nicely into Queen of Air and Darkness and I’m excited to see where the story will go next....more",Notes are private!,0,7,2,not setnot set,"Nov 24, 2018Nov 07, 2017","Nov 07, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30312891-lord-of-shadows
