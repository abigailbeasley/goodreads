Elton is such an engaging and entertaining writer; he's hilarious, frank, mischievous, and just SO gay. I genuinely laughed and cried multiple times and it never dragged for even a moment. In this book he earns the reader's attention and trust and he masterfully uses it to deliver beautiful and personal messages sprinkled into hilarious and grandiose stories. I'm especially grateful for the look it gave me into gay culture in an era and class I'd never experience myself. I wish I could claim I've been a lifelong fan of Elton John's music but I'm so proud to be one now, and what this book accomplished was making me a genuine fan of the man himself. This was my first time listening to an audiobook and the absolute best I could've chosen. Taron read phenomenally, and I'm positive I'd think so even if I didn't already love him so much. His massive love for Elton is incredibly present in his reading. His emotion, tone, and extremely impressive repertoire of accents were all fantastic, but I personally was most fond of getting to hear hours of his natural Welsh accent after his years of British accents in his roles.Sorry this is more long-winded than most of my s, I'm writing it on an airplane as I finish the book, and something about listening to it in the sky is making me so grateful for this book experience and I want to make sure I remember this feeling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 15, 2019","Dec 19, 2019","Dec 15, 2019",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/44670690-me

So it was lonely for a while, but then I got used to it.""I couldn't tell you how many times I had the thought ""oh that's why we were taught in church that these books were evil,"" but it was a lot. The way Pullman presented his philosophy and exposed the dangers and evil inherent in religion made me feel stripped bare and understood. I joked about it, but I genuinely felt known by this man who has witnessed the hurt that a church can cause. I fell madly and quickly in love with almost every character in this series (special mention to Dr. Mary Malone and Lee Scoresby) and I was utterly stunned by the simple magic Pullman captured in every word about Lyra and about Will and about them together.

Hypocritical fiend!WHAT A FANTASYou throw a torch into a pile of buildings; and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins, and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!WHAT A FANTASTIC BOOK! I have lots of thoughts on this one. Warning for spoilers of a 100 year old book ahead.First and foremost, I went into reading this knowing basically nothing except the phrase I've seen a bunch of times, ""Knowledge is knowing Frankenstein is the doctor, but wisdom is knowing Frankenstein is the monster."" I'm gonna have to call bullshit on that one. I can understand reading the beginning of the monster's story and empathizing with him and his interest in life and beauty and family, but that all disappeared for me immediately upon his murder of William and subsequent actions. The way he confronted Frankenstein with an ultimatum that boiled down to ""I have the ability to be violent (as you've witnessed) or the ability to be gentle, and I will only choose gentleness if you do what I say"" is not only genuinely evil, but also something I have seen from men in both my personal history and world history that leaves me devoid of any sympathy for this monster whatsoever. That's the horror of this book, in my opinion, and it's only compounded upon by the people who can finish this book and say they sided with the monster. Frankenstein is a clueless idiot, but I related to him and maintained empathy for him throughout the novel. Definitely cannot say the same for the monster. Secondly, this book is a lot more fun than I was expecting. It definitely is about horror and murder and fear but also made me laugh out loud a good handful of times. Also I love my gay sea captain Robert Walton.Finally, I just have to love on Mary Shelley for a moment. She started writing this at NINETEEN YEARS OLD and literally invented the science fiction genre with this masterpiece. Her use of descriptive language is stunning and the format of the story (within a story within a story) is imaginative and captivating. Lots of love for my girl Wollstonecraft.to summarize: Mary Shelley is a genius and the monster is the monster....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 14, 2017","Jun 24, 2017","Jun 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18306732-frankenstein

It feels wrong to give a Review to someone's real life experiences, so it's hard to put my thoughts into appropriate words. I loved how she spoke about her experiences with depression and other mental illness, and I wish that had been fleshed out more. With regards to the depiction of sex and her own idea of sex, it felt like she set up the character of herself to make some self-discoveries that weren't really seen through. I'd like to note before I say this that this isn't a criticism of the book or the author, just a statement about my experience as a reader: I was hoping to find this more relatable than I did. As someone who has and does struggle with major depression, I found the depiction of mental illness far more relatable than the depiction of sexuality, which is what I was expecting to relate to in this book. I understand the value of writing an autobiographical work that doesn't have a real ""resolution"", but putting down a book that didn't really have a conclusion is a strange feeling.

Soft and harmless until enough time went by. Then all of a sudden you found yourself with the Grand Canyon on your hands.This book absolutely tore my heart open, emptied it out, and filled it right back up. It understands that most crucial fact of how one person can touch another so profoundly, but not always in a positive way. You see examples of the power that love and knowing someone can have in the most beautiful ways and also the most hurtful ones. And seeing everything through June's eyes gave this story such yearning and purity. This story's depiction of AIDS, the suffering it caused, and the stigma around those who were suffering, was stark and startling to experience through June's perspective. Carol Rifka Brunt told a story that deserved to be told with such delicacy and love, it felt like an honour to behold it.

But it felt good to have stood in front of him without flinching and, however stupid it was, I wanted to do it again. If you read The Watchmaker of Filigree Street then you may already know this, but first time readers need to understand going into this book: it requires some patience. I wouldn't describe it as slow because changing the pace would be changing the feeling of the book itself, I would much rather describe it as peaceful and lovingly written. I can hardly wrap my head around the beautiful world Pulley built in The Bedlam Stacks, it's so unlike anything I've ever read before. I was filled with wonder at every little piece of magic that fell into place. Every single detail has so much beauty and uniqueness, Pulley truly raises the bar for magical realism. And then, of course, the reason I was so excited for this book in the first place: the slow burn love story. Beneath the intriguing plot and magical world-building is the absolute sweetest story of two people coming to love each other in the process of learning about each other. They don't realize it as it's happening, until they just let themselves lean into it, and each other, when they do. You hardly notice it when it's happening, until you look back and see their beautiful dance for what it was. The intimacy Pulley achieved through wordless conversations and the relief in being known is so beautiful. I wish a love story like this one wasn't so rare. Overall: same as I said when I finished Watchmaker, ONE MILLION STARS. I highly recommend to anyone, but go into The Bedlam Stacks with willingness to go at its pace to really get the utmost out of it....more",Notes are private!,0,56,2,"Aug 28, 2018Feb 09, 2017","Aug 30, 2018Feb 12, 2017","Jan 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31450615-the-bedlam-stacks
