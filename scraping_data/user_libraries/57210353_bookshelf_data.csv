These are questions that drive human quests, yet, at least in my experience, they are not reckoned with in sci fi novels about sentient machines. For the author to not only think of this, but write a novel about it was something really special, in my opinion.

Those Mayfair gals are spunky, but Lettie Wetherham really outshines them all with her survival skills and boundless heart. Make no mistake, high society in Regency times was a battlefield laced with landmines, which Lettie must avoid while trying to make ends meet. One false move and Lettie's reputation and all hope a respectable life will be blown to smithereens. Enter Nick Dellacorte, handsome and rich but also ruthlessly self-serving (at least by reputation), to enlist Lettie's confidence in a scheme. The game of cat and mouse that ensues pulls in Nick's former squeeze, the equally ruthless Sophia, and her fiancé, the wealthy but awkward Earl Elson. I found myself rooting for Lettie and Nick as they tried to out maneuver each other, each avoiding the building tension between them. Elson and Sophia had their own agendas and were absolute delights as their characters grew and changed.

And Rosa, his unsuspecting (denying?) widow. The story is well told and well written, but the depth and strength of it is the author's insight into many different sorts of interpersonal relationships. The author deftly and believably depicts longing, regret, jealously, racism, and forgiveness throughout the characters' dialogue, actions, and even subtext. Really well done. Highly recommend!Here are a few passages I especially liked:""Trouble and torment had a way of taking thoughts hostage.""""The emptiness she felt was profound. She thought it might be contagious, and she didn't want to expose anyone else to it.""""Rosa had detested her child's naivety as she felt her own shrewdness, buried all these years, come to the surface, grasping and grateful for new life.""""When it came to families, she knew all too well hers didn't fall into the category of apologizers. Their blood brimmed with stubbornness.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 16, 2021","Apr 20, 2021","Mar 11, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57382132-the-wool-over-their-eyes

She made me long to take a meal with Agnes and her family. To spend a day in the garden or among the bees or in the mystical woods from whence Agnes came. To walk with Judith down a darkened street in search of her twin. I was sad indeed when the book was over.I discovered this book by listening to an interview Ann Patchett gave. I guess it was THE book of 2020. I can see why. I listened to the audiobook, and it was mesmerizing.Highly recommend, whether you are a fan of Shakespeare or not.

At a time when Miss Fanshawe should be coming out to society, the death of her mother leaves her stranded and penniless, with a future as obscure as her mother's murky past.Then Miss Fanshawe stumbles, quite literally, into the path of the wealthy, socially elite Arundells. The young rogue Edward, who brings Frannie home after almost running her down with his carriage. His older brother, Sebastian, a stuffed shirt of a businessman who has no patience for Edward's foolishness. And their mother, Mrs. Arundell, who takes to sweet Frannie instantly and irreversibly.Thus Burkard's tale is off and running with Frannie's future hanging in the balance. Readers of Burkard know she immerses you in the Regency. She writes with relaxed panache, and the comic moments, of which there are plenty, will make you laugh out loud.Burkard's work is so cinematic that I think the Hallmark Channel ought to snap up The Brides of Mayfair series for a line of clean and sweet Regency films.

What matters is the quality of Burkard’s writing and storytelling in this novel. Both are excellent. The writing is clean, the descriptions put me in each scene, and the characters are delightful.Margaret Tavistock is a terribly busy girl, who's scheming quickly gets her into a jam in which her years-at-sea betrothed, Captain Gabriel Rempeare, thinks she's actually a notoriously sketchy mystery woman named Lady X, who is pretending to be Miss Tavistock. Whew! I can barely keep it straight writing this , but Burkhard pulls off this crazy Shakespearean-style comedy beautifully. She kept me immersed in the ruse, turning pages to find out what happens next. Every character is a delight: Miss Margaret Tavistock, Captain Gabriel Rempeare, Mrs. Filbert, Roddy, all are wonderful. The “off stage” characters, such as the Duke and Lady X, are equally engaging. Burkard makes us (and Miss Tavistock) wait until the very last minute, but, boy, is the wait worth it! Marvelous storytelling!Burkard commands the Regency period, and I can’t imagine there are many (any?) romance novels—of any sort—that are more FUN than this one.

Maribel Montgomery almost makes it to the Pool of Siloam Camp - where she can lick her professional wounds - when her car breaks down. Well, the 1967 Ford Falcon burns up, actually. And that's in the first couple of paragraphs. That car is reminiscent of Cortés's ships burning on the shore of the New World. There's no turning back now, Maribel.The waters at the Pool of Siloam Camp are troubled indeed, but not in a good way. Soon poor, beleaguered Maribel discovers the body of a woman who died under suspicious circumstances. Then another girl goes missing. Have Maribel's troubles followed her to this peaceful, out-of-the-way place? Some people wonder about Maribel and others are in her corner, like the sheriff, who just can’t ""see her being part of whatever it was that had his peaceful county humming with menace.""Lori Altebaumer spins a satisfying, suspenseful mystery with a dash of romance. A Firm Place to Stand is truly Christian fiction, not just nice fiction written by a Christian author. I think the author's inclusion of Christian dynamics and beliefs woven through this novel was my favorite aspect. Let me put that a different way. I loved that Altebaumer wrote about the Holy Spirit at work in the lives of these characters, Maribel and others.I also loved Altebaumer's writing. I'm a sucker for a well-turned, original phrase, and I highlighted some of my favorites here on Goodreads.If you're a fan of mysteries, and especially if you're a fan of Christian fiction, do yourself a favor and add this author to your short list.

First of all, Ms. Mandel's writingI wanted to write this, my first book  of the new year, before the afterglow of reading Station Eleven fades. First of all, Ms. Mandel's writing is beautiful. Instinctive is the word that comes to mind. The interior monologues of the characters appear as thoughts do, sometimes fragmented, sometimes having little or nothing to do with the exterior dialogue they're having. The post-apocalyptic world of Station Eleven is vivid and, at times, terrifying. But it is also hopeful.I'll admit I had a little bit of a hard time engaging with the opening scenes, and there was a danger that Station Eleven would languish on my ""Currently Reading"" list while I started other books. (Bad habit.) For some reason, I thought the novel was science fiction, and I think my interest was dampened when I realized it's about a pandemic that wipes out most of the world's population. I wasn't much in the mood for this premise at the end of 2020. Nevertheless, I returned to the book after putting it down for a few days and was hooked within a few chapters. From that point on, I read every spare moment. I'd say my interest was spurred on in equal parts by the author's writing style, the characters themselves, and the pre- and post-pandemic worlds depicted. This novel switches back and forth in time effectively, adding layer upon layer to the reader's understanding of the characters and the worlds they came from and are thrust into. Had Station Eleven been set in the first few years after an imagined Georgia Flu pandemic killed just about everyone, I think the book would have been straight-up dystopian. The world was pretty dark in those first few years. But by setting the novel primarily in Year Twenty post-pandemic, the author was able to offer hope.This one goes on my favorites list. Highly recommended, even in the times we're in. After all, it isn't such a bad thing to be reminded how much worse it could be.

S., where community shelters provide safety nets. Juarez-style poverty drives children - very small children - to the dump to scavenge, à la ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Cristal and her little sister, Fina, are two such children. Always hungry. Always dirty. Always trying to navigate the mean streets while their mother is otherwise occupied. There is a church nearby, the pastors of which supply about the only consistent meals the little girls get. On Sunday mornings, the pastor's voice booms over the neighborhood via loudspeaker. That about sums up the extent of the church's penetration.And then there's little Daniel, who has a family that is struggling under the weight of Daniel's little brother's chronic and severe respiratory illness. Daniel is also bullied by a neighborhood tough.Marion Surles does a very nice job of bringing these characters together in ways that spark change, not only for them but for the entire neighborhood. The message is we need one another other, and even more importantly, we need to be there for one another other. That's what love does....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 02, 2019","Dec 11, 2019","Jan 22, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44291451-grit-in-juarez

Terry Whalin's short, highly readable antidote to kidding yourself about what to expect beyond the manuscript. Writers spend inordinate amounts of time obsessing about the craft of writing, but too often we are nothing short of delusional about how our work will reach readers. The right readers. For that reason, 10 Myths is an important addition to your arsenal.Mr. Whalin has earned the right to dispense candid, reliable advice. He's an experienced editor and writer himself, and he's worked in publishing for many years. He lays out the facts without apology. They are what they are, and we are expected to be big boys and girls and make our choices accordingly. Mr. Whalin's objective, dispassionate approach to advising writers is one of my favorite aspects of his writing, whether an article or a book. He never comes off as if he's ""selling"" one course of action or another, unless it’s persistence, professionalism, and bringing the best product you can to the table. He's a ready advocate for these virtues.Unless you're consistently knocking it out of the park with bestsellers, I recommend you get yourself a copy of 10 Publishing Myths. Keep it close for reference and read it cover to cover from time to time.

Millennials arAddie Zierman's memoir piqued my curiosity because lately I've heard people talk about a ""Millennial migration"" away from church-going. Millennials aren't the first generation to stumble over church culture. I know plenty of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers who consider themselves spiritual but want nothing to do with ""organized religion."" I have my own experience too. Many years ago, when I first gave serious thought to following Christ, one of the challenges I had to work through was having to hang out with ""church people."" So I was really curious to hear (Audible edition) what Ms. Zierman had to say. I have to be honest. I expected bitterness. Instead I encountered generosity and grace. It's that perspective that makes When We Were on Fire a worthwhile read. I'd go as far as saying this memoir is a must-read for ministers of all stripes, especially youth ministers, and for parents who are raising their kids in church culture.Ms. Zierman makes it abundantly clear there's a difference between following Christ and immersing oneself in a culture. At this point, I could go on and on about what it means to be in the world and not of the world. But you aren't reading this  to get a sermon on John 17 from me. Suffice it to say When We Were on Fire is a great read to begin a journey of forgiving past offenses and rediscovering fellowship with the Lord and other believers. It's an even better read to help one avoid taking offense in the first place....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 05, 2019","Nov 22, 2019","Nov 05, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29101473-when-we-were-on-fire

Stillness is the Key did not engage me quite as much as The Perennial Seller, but I think that has more to do with my mental state than the book. It's a good read for anyone who is chasing success, or anyone whose life is intertwined with someone who is chasing success. Holiday cites person after person - from a wide range of disciplines and over many centuries - who discovered the key to success was finding a place of inner stillness. Finding a place of peace, if you will.Years ago, I did some volunteer work for a delightful man who had been a missionary for many years. He was filled with gentleness, humility, and wisdom. He gave me one bit of advice during our time together that has stayed with me, lo, these twenty years, ""Lisa, if you don't know what to do, follow your peace."" I have made many decisions, none of which I regret, by simply sitting down and working through which course of action gave me the most inner peace.Ryan Holiday has a way of giving us permission to take the slow road to success, and I see that as a theme in both of his books that I've read. I like the idea of taking the long view of life, perhaps even of having influence beyond the span of my life. If that idea resonates with you too, I recommend Ryan Holiday's books for you....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 30, 2019","Dec 20, 2019","Oct 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43582733-stillness-is-the-key

Most of all, the memoir is about the virtues of working hard and keeping one's perspective. It's about the good fortune that often follows hard work. I might have given the book four stars for a bit of repetitiveness, but I found I wasn't qualified to credit Michael Caine's life with fewer than five.

Clay Jar, Cracked is an honest account of what it means to be human, to be ""Of-Earth"" and yet... Clay Jar, Cracked, for me, goes to the very heart of what it means to be a Christian. To be ""Of-Christ"" at the same time we are ""Of-Earth."" This duality that every believer in Jesus tries to cope with every day of their lives. As the Apostle Paul said so eloquently, we know what to do but we don't do it. While we desire to do good, evil is ever present with us. Like a corpse tied to our backs. But I'm philosophizing about a very specific situation that happened to a woman and her husband. A woman who permits us to walk with her from Ground Zero through the emotional, spiritual, and even physical carnage to a new horizon. This isn't a journey shared with platitudes - you should realize that from the highlights I shared. It's raw and it's real.I'll add a verse of my own to the many Ms. Donelson so beautifully wove through her narrative. It's been my mantra from the beginning:Galatians 2:20 ""I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.""...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 26, 2019","Sep 02, 2019","Aug 22, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32154708-clay-jar-cracked

In that regard - and I'm going a bit more spiritual than I usually do when ing - this book called to mind Esther's story in the Old Testament. In my opinion, Esther portrays a beautiful picture of God's gift to humankind with such clarity, yet God is never mentioned. Similarly, If Nuns Were Wives portrays the myriad advantages of becoming a ""practitioner"" of good without even a whiff of self-righteousness.I think one thing that makes this book work so well (and might suggest why Ms. Chen is a wife now, rather than a nun) is that she is obviously a ring-tailed spitfire, and she writes candidly about her lessons-learned with self-effacing humor. She isn't above going toe-to-toe with her 6-foot plus husband, James. More than once. She has stormed out of the house and stayed gone for hours. More than once. She has fallen into the blues. More than once. Ms. Chen's wisdom is hard-earned, forged in the crucible of youthful marriage, child-rearing, a career (teaching, no less). If Nuns Were Wives isn't a collection of speculations about how much nicer it would be if we all just got along, especially stressed husbands and exhausted wives. This truly is a handbook, an instruction guide. Guess what: This works and this doesn't. It's that simple. Deal with it. Make peace with it. Reap the benefits of practicing what works instead of what doesn't. How do you argue with that kind of logic? I highlighted several passages in the Kindle edition I read, but here are a few excerpts that bear repeating.""...people are capable of exercising control, even under upsetting circumstances.""""When you're playing a video game and you drive off the road, you were not designed to stay off the road.

Ascetic is the word I'd use to describe the writing life she described: Solitude. A cold, rock-strewn Washington coast in winter. A remote cabin that Ms. Dillard chopped her own wood to heat (she was cold a lot). Her husband in a similar cabin doing his own writing. Above all, the daily self-flagellation of trying to get the sentences right, whatever ""right"" is. Ms. Dillard described a literary life that leaves no doubt about the seriousness of the work. This isn't dashing off pages of genre fiction at the kitchen table for an hour each morning before going to the day job. There were some really beautiful comparisons between painting and writing that I'll want to return to periodically to remind myself of the insights they contained. Really deeply moving insights. There were other comparisons between flying and writing that I was keen on because I'm a pilot. Those comparisons were beautiful and, again, insightful. I'll want to return to those passages too. These analogies between painting and writing, and between flying and writing, for me, elevated the book from good to amazing.

In his Masterclass on writing fiction, Dan Brown says to have a ticking clock. This novel has a clock that feels as if it's ticking off the hours of a death watch, right in the clonedroiod's head. Poor creature.You can read the synopsis for Clonedroid elsewhere, but I do believe Bronson is onto a winning character in Prototype 2112, nicknamed Abe by his creator. This novel kept me turning the pages to know what happened next, but even more so, turning the pages to learn more about Abe. By the end of the book, I realized we only had a glimpse of this newly-imagined creature, and that left me wanting more.To give you an idea of the novel's conundrum, in my own family's lore, my grandmother raised a hog from a piglet: Charlotte. Could there have been a worse name? Even worse than that, thereafter, servings of ham and bacon and pork chops were accompanied by Grandma announcing cheerfully, ""Here's some of Charlotte!"" ""Your first mistake was naming it,"" said one of the characters to Dr. Tamera Everett, who conceived 2112. Maybe. Maybe her first mistake was creating Abe. If there is a sequel in the works, I'm eager to know the direction the story takes. I like Abe a lot, but he's pretty scary too. I certainly hope his tale continues.

But there isn't a word to describe parents who lose children, perhaps because a single word just wouldn't be enough.Kris Francoeur is an educator, a profession that toughens up a person. I suspect Ms. Francoeur's personal steel is one reason she could write about her and her family's journey through sucking black grief without ever coming across as piteous. Instead, her descriptions of the days, weeks, and months following her son Sam's death from an accidental overdose of prescription medication is compassionate, yet objective. She intersperses social media posts throughout, real-time testaments that capture the emotions of the day so much more effectively that any attempt to reach back through the years ever could. But the real takeaway from GG&G is getting to know Sam Francoeur, or at least feeling as if you do. Sam wasn't perfect (who is?) but he was filled with life and passion, which his mother celebrates on every page in generosity and plain, pure love. What we come away with is not only an appreciation for her loss, but a sense of the whole world's loss when Sam left it. That's stunning.Death is an enemy, and GG&G makes no bones about that fact. We celebrate the day when death's sting is healed, when the grave loses its victory. In the meantime, I agree with Kris Francoeur. Don't comfort the grieving with lame platitudes, and certainly don't give God the credit.

Of course, I had to have a look when it came, which turned into reading it. Another copy is on the way for the gift.Dr. Clark Gaither put together a perfect little book of pithy wisdom, and frankly I'm astonished it hasn't gone viral. Each chapter is brief, gets to the point quickly, and is accompanied by wonderful quotes by thinkers, writers, and leaders from diverse fields. This is a book for anyone graduating from anything, be it high school or university, the school of hard knocks, or simply from yesterday to tomorrow. Wonderful!Here are a few excerpts:On Success: ""Before you can have success, you must first define what success means to you.""

Ms. Lynn is not a writer who's interested in wasting your time - she gets on with it. I love that. In my opinion, this is Christian fiction at its best, dealing with the tough themes of shame, regret, and anger. Early one morning in a small Florida town, invisible dynamics are set in motion when a college student, distracted by texting, strikes a biker, then, panicked, leaves the scene Thus the book is off and running. It was easy for me to put myself in the shoes of the justifiably angry bike rider, a small business owner who is laid up in ICU. Frankly, it was equally easy for me to put myself in the shoes of the college student, who hides her shameful act while the town seethes with rage.You know reconciliation is coming - this is a Christian novel - but the journey to it is satisfying and believable. This appears to be Jacquelyn Lynn's first novel, but she's obviously a veteran writer.

I have never cared for any men as much as for these who felt the first springs when I did, and saw death ahead, and were reprieved—and who now walk the long stormy summer.” F. Scott Fitgerald“The world is a wonder, but the portions are small.” Rebecca HazeltonI listened to the Audible edition, beautifully narrated by Michael Crouch. When I downloaded the novel, I realized the audiobook was over 18 hours. Eighteen hours! Sheesh! There's a quote in the latter portion of the book about life being at once too long and too short. That was this novel too, at least for me. In the beginning, the book's length was daunting. Slowly, I became more and more invested in Fiona and Yale—especially Yale!—and the rest of the characters. Then I settled into the story, as one settles in to life. By the end, everyone's stories were over too quickly.Rebecca Makkai brilliantly parallels a group of Chicagoans devastated by the AIDS outbreak of the 1980s with the Great War's lost generation. This is a novel about ordinary people—people who just want to be happy—finding themselves in a life and death struggle they did not ask for against an enemy they don't understand. It's about the heartbreak of watching beloved friends and fellows fall on the right hand and the left, and being powerless to stop it.As I write this , it's been a couple of months since I finished the book. I listened to the last chapter again. Because that's where the loss is driven home. That's where Makkai pushes her reader's empathy to a peak.And that's when I added The Great Believers to my favorites shelf....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 08, 2019","Oct 25, 2019","Mar 31, 2019",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/44323861-the-great-believers

We got out the phonebook—as we always did while traveling—to see how many people with our last names were listed. In that thick Manhattan phonebook was a single listing for a person with the same name as my friend’s. Two initials and a surname, as a single woman might’ve listed her number back in those days. The address was only a few blocks from our Midtown hotel, and we joked about calling to see if she was a long-lost cousin, who might take us to her favorite shops and restaurants. We didn’t call, but the “what if?” stuck with me. What if you did call? What if the person you called was in crisis? Or about to face a crisis? What if that serendipitous phone call resulted in a friendship that became a lifeline? That notion was the inception of ALL IN.Author Neil Gaiman talks about having an idea that’s better than our ability to write it. It took 25 years and a couple of false starts, but my vision for these characters and this story is fulfilled. Finally.ALL IN is my first offering as a novelist—my best writing to date. I hope you’ll enjoy it.#allinthenovel...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 31, 2019","Mar 27, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44769119-all-in

Grrr.Then, here comes the inciting incident, rather, more accurately, the ""insighting"" incident. And all that's been unseen - motives, emotions, secrets - slowly percolate to the surface, where they can be recognized for what they are and dealt with. I'm so glad Penelope and I both hung in there. The payoff was worth the pain.I'm Fine and Neither Are You is a quick, humorous read. But it isn't at all superficial.

This isn't a book to be read only by business leaders, and it isn't a book to be read only by clients in the Quiet Warrior program. There's something for everyone in The Way of the Quiet Warrior, and I certainly found several special somethings for myself.Let me start with the stories - who doesn't love a good story? They're interspersed throughout the book. Personal. Poignant. Very well-written. The thing I liked the very most about Mr. Dutta's style is the way he came at these stories. They weren't overly dramatic, despite the intensity of the events taking place in them. They weren't didactic. They were moving, and because they were true in every sense, they were memorable.The remaining narrative, which describes the basis for Mr. Dutta's program, was filled with reminders about what's important and observations about the way we humans interact with other humans, with the world around us, and most importantly, with the experiences we've internalized. One observation that stuck with me - and I continue to think about it - is they way patterns are such a comfort to us. We're like dogs in that regard (my observation, not the author's). If we don't make an effort to course correct, we gravitate toward familiar patterns, even when they're painful or destructive. So strong is this dynamic. There's a lot in the book about recognizing where we're doing this to our detriment. There's also a lot in the book about our need for support from others, which is a major component of the Warrior program. Of course, that's true all the time, program or not.I listened to the Audible edition (wasn't listed on GR). Nicely done. I recommend it because of the impact of the spoken word.

I was intrigued by the author too, a fashionable, well-educated young woman. Ms. Wang’s grapplings with delusions and hallucinations, and others’ reactions to her were moving. Her insights into how psychosis is treated in the 21st century were enlightening.I’ve read that psychotic people are, in fact, sane people trying to cope with incomprehensible stimuli.

From what I can In her Masterclass series on fiction, Margaret Atwood recommended this book, so I bought a used copy of the 25th anniversary edition. From what I can see on Amazon, the book appears to only be available from third-party vendors, although there is a Kindle edition.I'm an American, born, raised, and steeped in barter culture. There's a joke about an old fish swimming past two young fish and asking, ""How's the water, boys?"" When the old fish passes, one young fish asks the other, ""What is water?"" So it is with culture. You don't realize you're in it until someone gives you a perspective from outside it. This book gave me that fresh perspective, and with it a paradigm shift, as a writer, but mostly as a Christian. The Gift is not a Christian book, and Mr. Hyde doesn't tip his hand on his own spirituality. Even so, I think every believer would benefit from reading The Gift because the kingdom that rests on Jesus's shoulder is a pure gift economy. I will go so far as to say a lot of the preaching/teaching that's dubbed ""prosperity gospel"" has a tinny ring to it because the speaker has failed to recognize the difference between ""gift economies"" and ""barter economies."" My opinion.Hyde's remarkable study of gift cultures versus barter cultures is lengthy and detailed. It's a lot to absorb, but it's easy to get the gist of it right off the bat. I know I'll return to The Gift again and again to replenish my soul. From the book:""The gift leaves all boundaries and circles into mystery. The passage into mystery always refreshes. If, when we work, we can look once a day upon the face of mystery, then our labor satisfies. We are lightened when our gifts rise from pools we cannot fathom. Then we know the are not a solitary egotism and they are inexhaustible. Anything contained within a boundary must contain as well its own exhaustion.""""...one man's gift must not be another man's capital...the increase that comes from gift exchange must remain a gift and not be kept as if it were the return on private capital. Saint Ambrose of Milan states it directly in a commentary on Deuteronomy: 'God has excluded in general all increase of capital.' Such is the ethic of a gift society.""""The root of our English word 'mystery' is a Greek verb, muein, which means to close the mouth. Dictionaries tend to explain the connection by pointing out that the initiates to ancient mysteries were sworn to silence, but the root may also indicate, it seems to me, that what the initiate learns at a mystery cannot be talked about. It can be shown, it can be witnessed or revealed, it cannot be explained.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 31, 2019","Dec 15, 2019","Jan 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23564789-the-gift

I came across it in 2018 while browsing the internet for information about shame as research for a novel-in-progress. I bought a used paperback copy. The book arrived a few days later, and I began reading with my characters in mind. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the insights expressed in the book dredged up emotionally-charged memories from my own childhood.Suffice it to say Dr. Kaufman’s 38 year-old book put language to feelings and memories that had been shadowy and murky before. The clarity that followed gave me distance and objectivity, despite some initial emotional pain. From the book: “Language provides us with tools of mastery when confronting the inner life.” I couldn’t agree more. Thank you, Dr. Kaufman, for a very productive session.

I enjoyed it more than I would've if I had not read Lee Smith's memoir, ""Dimestore"" first. One summer, Smith and some college friends floated down the Mississippi River on a large raft, making quite a splash in every town. By Smith's own account, they were priviledged and pretty girls, who naively believed their futures would be as friendly as their brief, sheltered pasts. For years afterward, people asked Smith why she didn't write about that adventure - it was so unusual and so celebrated at the time. In her opinion, there wasn't a story in it. Then years passed and the future happened, and Smith found a story to write: The Last Girls.All of that said, if you haven't read Lee Smith yet, I don't recommend starting here. Listen to the audiobook of ""Fair and Tender Ladies"" first. I hear the heavy dialect of the print edition is challenging, but the narrator (Kate Forbes) brings the protagonist, Ivy Rowe, to life. If you become a Lee Smith fan after that, as I did, read ""Dimestore: A Writer's Life"" before ""The Last Girls."" You'll appreciate it much, much more.Oh yeah, I didn't mention any of the characters or particulars in this novel. There are plenty of other s to give you those. I will say that Baby Ballu is remarkable, the character who keeps you reading and hoping for the best, even though you already know from the outset it isn't to be. Lee Smith excels at creating female characters we can't quite get enough of, despite their flaws....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 07, 2018","Dec 21, 2018","Nov 07, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/126873.The_Last_Girls

If you have skills, why not show them off?I've never read a novel with more variegated prose. It reflects life that way, and like life keeps the reader just a little unbalanced, unsure what's coming around the next bend. The novel pivots on the Hungry Ghost Theater (at least, this is my interpretation) and I thought, Is this happening? This is really happening. First unseen, then seen. Life is that way, actually. It can change so suddenly, seemingly.The Zamarin family are, for all their thrashing about, so connected to one another by love. I really appreciate their tenderness and generosity. I love their individuality, their quests, their passions, and their fierce devotion. I love the backstory that informs their thoughts and actions, and the glimpses we get of it, here and there.There are many ""droplets of originality"" in the book. Here are a few:""Beauty, my dears, is a matter of millimeters.""

""She pulls apart a thigh and drumstick, torquing the bones and giving them a quick snap. A little trail of veins hangs out of the knot of fat and gristle, and still Katya wants that chicken."" (Okay, it's graphic, but oh my! Every word is perfect.)Many images from this novel remain with me. What remains with me most of all is its exploration of the appetites that bring us our greatest pleasure and our greatest pain....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 05, 2019","Jun 12, 2019","Oct 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41797493-hungry-ghost-theater

A Thursday.Like me, you're probably trying to remember what you were doing that day. But you can't. Neither can Jeff Huxford, at least noMay 3, 2012. A Thursday.Like me, you're probably trying to remember what you were doing that day. But you can't. Neither can Jeff Huxford, at least not after he left his father-in-law's hardware store. He doesn't remember leaving the store to drive home, or the red truck that T-boned his car, slamming his head into a concrete post and shearing his brain from its moorings. Finding Normal, Dr. Huxford's brief, powerful memoir, explores what it feels like to have been changed suddenly from the person he'd been to the person he is in the wake of Traumatic Brain Injury, or TBI.By any measure, Jeff Huxford was a good guy leading a charmed life before the accident. He was a respected, small town physician - the guy known as ""Doc"" in the community. He was a family man. He was a church-goer. But Huxford has this to say about himself and his faith before the accident, ""I recall going to church on most Sundays and following all the rules needed to maintain the reputation of a ""good"" Christian, which I believe is very similar to most of American Christianity today. This rules-and-checklist mindset led to a self-centered faith, and because of that I never totally surrendered my life to God. I still counted on myself to do the bulk of the ""work"" and grossly overestimated my contribution to my salvation.""The memoir doesn't linger unnecessarily on how great the Huxfords' life was before TBI. It doesn't need to - you get the picture. Because Jeff has no memory of the accident or the days immediately following it, his wife, Jacqui, fills in the details: The Phone Call. The accident scene. Her first look at her husband. Jacqui's account is emotionally intense, but without self-pity. Jeff picks up the story again at the point when he emerged from the trauma-induced amnesia. His assessment of himself post-accident is objective, yet moving, describing the weaknesses and challenges that are part of his story now. He refers several times to a quote by Pastor Craig Groeschel, ""We might impress people with our strengths, but we connect with people through our weaknesses."" Jeff has lost a lot, but he has gained some things too.There aren't any clichés in Finding Normal. The details Huxford chose to leave out are as telling as those he put in. What he gives us is an unflinching, moving, and entirely relatable account of a metamorphosis. Of waking up to find you are someone else, someone you didn't want to become. Someone who is, perhaps, a better version of you.I can picture myself in Huxford's place, but I'm not sure I can picture myself having his courage....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Aug 10, 2018Aug 10, 2018","Aug 20, 2018Aug 15, 2018","Oct 13, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39345892-finding-normal

There is no magical way to tell a person’s goodness just by looking at them from the outside.""Andrea Cale's story of five people whose lives ultimately intertwine is told with the attention to detail of a journalist. She fleshes out her characters then pushes them along their varied paths toward a ""shucking"" that gives them a chance to show what they're made of. They are mixed bags, each of them, as we all are. I particularly loved the way Cale handled the climax of this novel. Without saying too much, let me just say she included some information that was clearly author intrusion, but I loved it and felt it added to the emotional impact of these characters. Just goes to show the only rule in fiction is that it works, and Corn Husk Experiment works on every level. The fact is that life shucks all of us, and Cale reminds us that a little empathy goes a long way.The cover of this book drew me from the first time I saw it, and I liked it even more after reading the novel....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 14, 2019","Jul 14, 2019","Sep 28, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40681998-the-corn-husk-experiment

I won't stray from that practice here. What I'll tell you is I wasn't quite as glad to say goodbye to this novel as I usually am. Not quite as ready to move on to something else.

Amma, Adora, Ann, Natalie. Victims all, and equally villainous. Only poor Camille Preaker takes it all in to her own flesh without dishing any of it back out. I have to admit that my heart hurt a little for Flynn's Camille. This story bothered me quite a bit, meaning I found myself thinking about it when I wasn't reading. They were unhappy thoughts about certain scenes and the idea that such misery actually happens in the world. I know it does.Gillian Flynn moved the bar for Southern Gothic Literature to a disturbing place: Wind Gap, a Heart of Darkness hamlet in the Missouri bootheel. Where the inhabitants are all a little crazed from their unendurable proximity to one another. Where the atmosphere is so murky with secrets and misplaced loyalties that it's hard to put a hand on the truth.I think this book is a pretty lean thriller at its core. But the reader is so immersed in Camille's heartbreaking psychological drama that it's hard to stay on point, even when obvious answers are shouting from the pages.The writing is, of course, great. I have to read Gone Girl next, even though I loathed the movie. It's difficult for film to do justice to this type of writing because it's hard to translate to the screen motives that are clear on the page.Thank you, Ms. Flynn, for ginning up characters so memorable they seem real....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 12, 2019","Aug 22, 2019","Aug 26, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37702968-sharp-objects

Parker has given us a view into how life might have been in the weeks leading up to the famous raising of Lazarus from the dead. Perhaps I should say infamous because raising Lazarus was, arguably, Jesus's most important miracle. It spurred his enemies to do whatever it took to kill him, and led to his own life-giving resurrection. As much as was at stake for you and me that day, there was even more at stake for Lazarus's sisters, Martha and Mary. Ms. Parker has thoroughly imagined these women and set them loose in a well-researched home and society. I wasn't very far into the book before their daily routines and desires seemed as familiar as my own. I rooted for Martha throughout the book, and often found myself a little aggravated at Mary. But in the end, Mary touched my heart profoundly, and I wonder if those final scenes with her went a little beyond imagination into revelation.

A Thursday.Like me, you're probably trying to remember what you were doing that day. But you can't. Neither can Jeff Huxford, at least not after he left his father-in-law's hardware store. He doesn't remember leaving the store to drive home, or the red truck that T-boned his car, slamming his head into a concrete post and shearing his brain from its moorings. Finding Normal, Dr. Huxford's brief, powerful memoir, explores what it feels like to have been changed suddenly from the person he'd been to the person he is in the wake of Traumatic Brain Injury, or TBI.By any measure, Jeff Huxford was a good guy leading a charmed life before the accident. He was a respected, small town physician - the guy known as ""Doc"" in the community. He was a family man. He was a church-goer. But Huxford has this to say about himself and his faith before the accident, ""I recall going to church on most Sundays and following all the rules needed to maintain the reputation of a ""good"" Christian, which I believe is very similar to most of American Christianity today. This rules-and-checklist mindset led to a self-centered faith, and because of that I never totally surrendered my life to God. I still counted on myself to do the bulk of the ""work"" and grossly overestimated my contribution to my salvation.""The memoir doesn't linger unnecessarily on how great the Huxfords' life was before TBI. It doesn't need to - you get the picture. Because Jeff has no memory of the accident or the days immediately following it, his wife, Jacqui, fills in the details: The Phone Call. The accident scene. Her first look at her husband. Jacqui's account is emotionally intense, but without self-pity. Jeff picks up the story again at the point when he emerged from the trauma-induced amnesia. His assessment of himself post-accident is objective, yet moving, describing the weaknesses and challenges that are part of his story now. He refers several times to a quote by Pastor Craig Groeschel, ""We might impress people with our strengths, but we connect with people through our weaknesses."" Jeff has lost a lot, but he has gained some things too.There aren't any clichés in Finding Normal. The details Huxford chose to leave out are as telling as those he put in. What he gives us is an unflinching, moving, and entirely relatable account of a metamorphosis. Of waking up to find you are someone else, someone you didn't want to become. Someone who is, perhaps, a better version of you.I can picture myself in Huxford's place, but I'm not sure I can picture myself having his courage....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 28, 2018","Jul 28, 2018","Jul 28, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/40312420-finding-normal

The Simons were among New York's upper crust in a golden, glamorous time. Carly Simon battled stuttering, became sexually active early, and suffered from, at times debilitating, low self-esteem.There's this great scene in the movie, ""Postcards from the Edge"" in which Gene Hackman's character talks about how privileged Meryl Streep's character (Carrie Fisher) is, and how many people would give anything to have her life. ""Yes, but I can't feel my life,"" she says. That's the problem with the context of privilege - same problems, different stage scenery. Carly Simon, despite (because of?) her privilege and fame, overcame more challenges than most of us. And she's still here.I love memoirs, and this one did not disappoint. (BTW, I listened to the Audible edition, narrated by the author, who did not stutter once.) It gave me a glimpse behind the curtain of a singer/songwriter's life whose music I've enjoyed for decades. The mood of the sixties and seventies, not just here but in the UK too, came alive. You name him (Mick Jagger, Jack Nicholson, James Taylor) and Carly knew him.Just now, I think I'll stop writing this  and put on ""That's the Way I've Always Heard It Should Be."" I'll imagine publishing icon Dick Simon sitting in the darkened living room of the Simon's NYC home, sometime in the 1940s or 50s, smoking a cigarette and thinking about his company's next big book.BTW, ""You're So Vain"" was not about James Taylor after all....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 25, 2018","Oct 13, 2018","Jul 20, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/34703572-boys-in-the-trees

This is a fast-paced read, but the bI have a feeling that the contents of this biography represent the tip of the iceberg of Terry Whalin's research. This is a fast-paced read, but the book's pace isn't nearly as fast as that of Billy Graham's life. His ministry must've felt like a rodeo ride that went for 80 years rather than 8 seconds, with the entire world as the arena. Beginning as early as the 1940s, Billy Graham and his team proclaimed the good news of Jesus Christ in crusade meetings for days that stretched into weeks that stretched into months. Thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, of people attended, and many of them accepted the invitation to believe. The workload that under-girded the effort was staggering: The preaching itself, the counseling after the meetings, the follow-up to welcome new believers into local churches. That doesn't take into account the prayers, the spiritual struggles, and the sacrifice of being away from families. It took a lot of work by a lot of people to pull it off, just to spread the good news that Jesus saves.Early on, in 1948, Billy Graham reacted to Sinclair Lewis's 1926 novel, Elmer Gantry, about an evangelist whose indiscretions are all too familiar to all of us. Graham and his team recognized the problems created by the lifestyle that goes along with evangelistic meetings. In response, they created a list of commitments that guided their practices in the years to come. I love that they did that, and I love that they did it in response to a novel. The Modesto Manifesto, as the list was known, and their commitment to it protected their ministry from the sin that has derailed too many powerful ministries.I have to admit that I teared up at some of the accounts Mr. Whalin included. One story was about a woman who accepted Jesus at a New York crusade. She told the counselor she was worried that her son, a violent drinker, would beat her when he found out she'd become a Christian. Before the counselor could say a word, they heard someone across the room say, ""Don't worry, Mom. I'm here too."" Wow.Jesus is the star of this bio, not Billy Graham. When I finished reading the book I felt renewed inspiration to pray for revival in our times. What the world needs now is love, sweet love, and there is no love sweeter than the Lord's....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 25, 2018","Sep 10, 2018","Jun 10, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23900575-billy-graham

Now I have to read Resilience, Pulse Effex #2, to find out what becomes of Lexie, Andrea, and Sarah.This is YA fiction, but since Suzanne Collins and J. K. Rowling blurred the lines on audience boundaries for YA fiction, and since I enjoyed this novel so much, I will from now on consider YA fiction to be stories about young adults rather than stories for young adults.The pulse in Pulse is an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP, or epic solar flare) that wipes out all post-nineteenth century technology. Unless it's caged in special material - maybe lead, I can't recall - to protect it. Who would think of doing that? Preppers, that's who. Those odd, march-to-their-own-drumbeat people who seem out of sync with reality until the apocalypse hits.Lexie's family are preppers. Andrea's family are upper middle class. Sarah's family are just trying to make it day to day. Ms. Burkard did a fantastic job of imagining the effects of a total shutdown of everything, even automobiles, in the middle of a brutal Ohio winter. As day piles upon day, the community degenerates into every man for himself paranoia worthy of Cormac McCarthy. This EMP is a particularly nasty apocalypse, simply because absolutely none of the technology we've become absolutely dependent on works. It's the equivalent of asking the flight crew of an Airbus to hang a pocket watch from the panel and bring the ship down safely in a snowstorm. You'll need either Charles Lindbergh or Sully Sullenberger for a successful outcome. In other words, you need someone pretty unusual on your side.There is a heavy spiritual theme to this book because of Lexie's family, the preppers, who go to the Lord for just about everything. Some readers may take exception to that, but we need to remind ourselves that some people do walk out their faith every day, publicly and privately, and these characters reflect that. In that respect, they are true to life.Ms. Burkard knows how to keep a reader turning pages, and buying her next book. I'm headed to Amazon now.

Certainly, she's right at the tippy top of my favorites. Eleanor is pragmatic, funny, and pitiful, but never for a minute does she feel sorry for herself, even though she has plenty of reasons to.From the first paragraph, Eleanor snags us by the sleeve and confides in first-person narration. The opening sentence tells us everything we need to know starting out: ""When people ask me what I do - taxi drivers, dental hygienists - I tell them I work in an office."" The people in Eleanor's life are taxi drivers and dental hygienists, not friends and family. What she does - all she does, except for pounding down Glen's vodka on the weekends - is work. Eleanor isn't looking for happiness, but that doesn't stop us from wanting it for her.

Then Mr. Enmon began to introduce subtle little accelerators that quickened the pace. I found myself looking forward to getting back to the story, and I read the second half in much less time than the first.This is one of those thrillers where you have an idea how everything is going to turn out, but the fun is how you'll get there. It's a good ride, and Mr. Enmon's characters have their own secrets that add to the tension. He left a few things unresolved, including some spiritual themes, that make me look forward to the next novel in this series. Okay, I even teared up a little at the end, which surprised me.

This reader includes the essays formerly published in Metropolitan Life and Social Studies, in which Ms. Lebowitz expresses her views of life, people, herself, and her beloved New York. She’s jaded, acerbic, and just about any other adjective you can think of that says there isn’t much meaning to existence beyond a pack of good cigarettes. Lebowitz is also pretty darned funny, and like Seinfeld, has fun with her own selfishness.In one essay, Lebowitz gives affluent people a brief primer for talking with poor people, in which she defines “overworked” as overwhelming weariness and fatigue, similar to jet lag. That’s an example of her humor.These essays are 40 years old, and definitely dated. But that’s interesting too.

One such scene is the showdown between Sullivan and Keller in the dining room of the Keller's big old Southern home. The teacher ran out the family who'd coddled Helen all her life, so she could try and make the child eat breakfast like a human being, rather than an animal. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, cold scrambled eggs that had been knocked to the floor by Keller and scraped up by Sullivan. But wait, was it the book that was so vivid, or was it the film starring Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft? The film's screenplay was adapted by Gibson from his stage play, which was based on the book, so it doesn't matter. The book is wonderful, and so is the film. As with To Kill a Mockingbird, they are in harmony.Helen Keller's story is remarkable, and she was a portrait of courage, tenacity, and hope, as was Sullivan.

She's feisty as all get out and liable to do anything, not to mention she's ruint. Ivy is a Virginia mountain girl through and through. We discover her story and the stories of those she loves and those she doesn't through the letters Ivy writes to family and friends over much of her life.The New York Times called ""Fair and Tender Ladies"" Lee Smith's most fully realized novel to date (1988), and they got that right. Not only is Ivy fully realized, but the people of the Appalachian Mountains and the changes that fell upon them during the 20th century are too.

You can read a lot of other s to get more details about the ride Iris takes the reader on, so let me just say, it's worth it, even though the novel is long and meandering.

Similarly, McPherson writes that he couldn't imagine the story he tells in Flood being any different, and that's the important thing to remember about this novel, especially for religious readers. McPherson imagines an entirely hostile pre-Flood world in which there is no safety anywhere. He's imagined a demonic, dominant race of beings ruled by an antichrist-like God-King. McPherson has his reasons for telling the story as he did, and they are good ones.Philosophy aside, McPherson has proved himself as a pro of a storyteller in the broad genre of Christian fiction. Readers of CBA books will enjoy Flood, and they'll find familiar themes within its pages. I highly recommend this novel, particularly to those readers. But I also recommend this book to readers who have trouble reconciling a merciful God who is also a holy Judge. You will not be disappointed. You'll be engaged from the first page, eager to see the world Brennan imagines from the ""rest of the stories"" of Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah.

I think that's because Benjamin Percy focuses entirely on what works for readers. He's an unusual guy in the world of literary fiction, coming to it reluctantly from adventurous genre stories, television, and movies. Nevertheless, Percy is well-versed in literature, and I added no fewer than half a dozen books to my Goodreads to-read shelf while I was working my way through Thrill Me. It's apparent what Percy likes is what works. For the reader. What thrills us and keeps us turning pages. Here are a few of the passages I highlighted:""When a reader first picks up a story, they are like a coma patient - fluttering open their eyes in an unfamiliar world, wondering, where am I, when am I, who am I? The writer has an obligation to quickly and efficiently place the reader in the story.""A few pages later,""Just as you should orient us in the beginning of a story, you should orient us throughout. Every time we jump to a new setting (whether that's a character boarding a plane or entering a locker room or dropping through an open manhole), we need to feel immediately stabilized.""One of my favorite passages, on symbols that have been overused to evoke mood,""These, of course, are clichés - ready-made symbols with meaning already attached to them. To throw them into a story or an essay or a poem is to lazily roll your cart into the literary Walmart and pull them off the shelf like hundreds of thousands of poets and writers before you.""My copy of Thrill Me: Essays on Fiction is a used paperback that was already marked up by another student of craft when I got it.

Some elements of the military culture depicted seemed gratuitous, and the depiction of the male soldiers interaction with the female soldiers was dated and a little offensive at times. The technical specifics bogged the narrative down quite a bit too. Okay, so this is sounding more like a one or two-star rating than the four I gave it.I'm giving the novel four-stars and recommending it for a couple of reasons. First, the premise of a war fought in deep space, during which centuries pass on earth while only months pass for the soldiers who are fighting is pretty original, especially half a century ago. But more than that, Mr. Haldeman used this bit of physics to demonstrate what every soldier, especially infantrymen, must feel coming home from every war, especially the Vietnam War. Time moves on while they're cocooned in battle, and they leave too many friends behind on the battlefield.The novel won some prestigious awards in its day, and though some elements don't hold up very well, in my opinion, it's still worth a read all these years later....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jun 2018,"Jun 28, 2018","Oct 24, 2017",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/16086358-the-forever-war

What is the relationship between the two entities we lump under one name, that of ""the writer""? The particular writer. By two, I mean the person who exists when no writing is going forward - the one who walks the dog, eats bran for regularity, takes the car to be washed, and so forth - and that other, more shadowy and altogether more equivocal personage who shares the same body, and who, when no one is looking, takes it over and uses it to commit the actual writing. There's an epigram tacked to my office bulletin board, pinched from a magazine - ""Wanting to meet an author because you like his work is like wanting to meet a duck because you like pâté."" That's a light enough comment upon the disappointments of encountering the famous, or even the moderately well-known - they are always shorter and older and more ordinary than you expected - but there's more sinister way way of looking at it as well. In order for the pâté to be made and then eaten, the duck must first be killed. And who is it that does the killing?This quote goes to the pith of Atwood's book on writing, which speaks more directly to the ""otherness"" of the enterprise than any other book on the topic that I've read. In fact, others seem to dance around it a bit by comparison. In another place, Atwood tells how she spoke to other novelists about what it feels like to go into a novel, noting that none of them asked what she meant by ""into"". One writer described the experience as arranging all the furniture in a room in the dark, and then when it was all arranged the light would come on. That's about as close a description as I've read.If you like Atwood's wry wit and you're interested in people who ""commit actual writing"", or perhaps you commit it yourself, I think you'll enjoy this read....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 28, 2017","Nov 12, 2017","Oct 20, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17647.Negotiating_with_the_Dead

I'm This may be a book that's best appreciated during the second read because the world of Cain is so different from ours, as indeed it must've been. I'm quite certain there isn't a person alive today who has any inkling what daily life was like for humanity's first family experiencing their first family crisis. We, who are two millennia downstream from a revolution in which good crushed evil, surely would need to put aside assumptions we don't even realize we have to understand that world. Kudos to Brennan McPherson for taking a stab at imagining a story set there. Mr. McPherson takes his readers on the ride of their lives into an era during which the physical and the spiritual weren't very far apart. He spins an epic drama with many elements that are common to dramas: Murder, brother against brother, and heartbreaking loss.But in Mr. McPherson's story, each of these elements is primal: the FIRST murder, the FIRST brother against brother, the FIRST heartbreaking loss of a loved one. My advise is to lay aside your assumptions and enjoy the ride....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Sep 2017,"Oct 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28189831-cain

Mr. Griffin takes Scout Finch's advice to heart, that you can't really know someone until you've waked in their shoes (or stood on his front porch in the case of Boo Radley). Mr. Griffin chemically darkened his skin so he could pass for a black man, which he did for seven weeks in the deep South of 1959. With New Orleans as his base camp, he itinerated into Mississippi and Alabama at the height of white aggression against the blossoming civil rights movement. It was scary (and sickening) stuff, let me tell you, and Griffin did a good job of making me feel I was right there with him, experiencing the brunt of racial prejudice. Griffin was brave, despite the yellow stripe down the back of the half-white, half-black effigy the opposition hung from a traffic light in his hometown of Mansfield, TX when his story came out. I live a stone's throw from Mansfield, which is now a suburban community of inoffensive strip malls and restaurants, thank God. I recommend Black Like Me to anyone and everyone.

I plan to refer to it again and again for course guidance, like a compass.Essentially, Holiday's observations are organized into three categories: creating a work that endures, marketing to generate word of mouth, and the writer's relationship with readers over time. His theories about why some books sell to generations of readers resonate, and he cites multiple examples to support his conclusions.From the book on the time it takes to create a work that endures, ""You can't make something that lasts if it's based on things, on individual parts that themselves won't last, or if it's driven by an amateur's impatience. The creative process will require not only time and work, but also the long view. It doesn't matter what the deadlines are or who is breathing down you neck - in a year, will the extra two days you spent seem excessive? In ten years, will spending ten extra days, or even ten weeks, seem like a long time?"" (page 31)On originality and trying to win fans away from established brands, ""I'm always wary of any description that resembles, 'It's like __ but with __.' I'm wary of it not only because it's inherently unoriginal, but also because, again, it forces the creators to compete with the very dominant entitiy they are supposedly improving on."" (page 53)On marketing and word of mouth, ""No one has the steam or the resources to actively market something for more than a short period of time, so if a product is going to sell forever, it must have strong word of mouth. It must drive its own adoption.
