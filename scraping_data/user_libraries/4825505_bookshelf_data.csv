This story has elements of unreality that thrust the world of Jonas and his family into a vivid and shocking reality.

Written in 1979, it tells the story of the Ludlow family, a Civil War Colonel and his three sons who have moved to Montana to avoid the government after seeing what they did to Native American Indians. It's a majestic, tragic story mixed with love and loss. It'll rip your heart out, reader.And here's where I go rogue. I saw the movie from 1994, starring Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, and a stellar supporting cast, most notably Julia Ormand who plays Susannah, the woman who changes every Ludlow man's life. I read the book for my book club, then watched the movie again. I have to say this is a rare instance where I liked the movie better than the book. The book jumps around the globe (Montana, Boston, the oceans wild ...) but the movie stays more centered on Montana. I found it more cohesive and focused. Harrison is said to have written this book in under two weeks, changing only one word for his second and final draft. Hmm. Anyway, it's a powerful family tragedy, but I recommend the movie over the book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 05, 2023","Jul 12, 2023","Jun 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/395397.Legends_of_the_Fall

Oprah chose this for her book club and said she ranks it in her Top Five Favorite Books of all time. Well, not me. THE COVENANT OF WATER, by Abraham Verghese, is a 700-page family saga/medical drama/love story. Verghese's writing never got in the way of the story, except when it came to the medical scenes. As a doctor, I understand he had to write those parts accurately, but only other doctors likely appreciated that.

Then they set off on an arduous journey through a rainstorm to bury her in her family plot (not her husband's family, but her own). The story is farcical! I don't know if this was ever made into a movie, but if the storyline weren't so sad it would be laughable. Most of the story (80%) happens after the mother dies, so why did Faulkner choose a present-tense title from the period before her death?

(Amazing how much more detail we absorb on a second reading, isn't it?) While I can't say The Family Chao is a favorite of mine, in many ways it feels like a ""perfect book,"" one I would be thrilled to have written. It's a literary mystery, but also a love story, a revenge story, and a dysfunctional family story. (Is there any other kind of family?)(Certainly not in literature; that would be boring.) The characters are distinct and introspective; in other words, they face and admit their faults. While not autobiographical, Chang is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. She addresses racial identity head on. While other members of my book club didn't like it as much as I did, we did agree it was entertaining. Again, I highly recommend this book. FIRST REVIEW:THE FAMILY CHAO, by Lan Samantha Chang, was a delightful surprise. As a modern re-telling of The Brothers Karamazov, by Dostoevsky, Chang sets her story in a small, fictional town in Wisconsin. The parents, Big Leo and Winnie, were immigrants to America, pursuing the American dream. They started a Chinese restaurant and had 3 sons: Dagou, Ming, and James. Big Leo had a larger-than-life personality and made plenty of enemies. When he is killed, many people had a potential motive, but one of his sons is arrested and put on trial. That's when the family secrets are revealed.Chang, the director of the Iowa Writers Workshop, is naturally a gifted writer and storyteller. In an interview, I heard her say she gave herself permission to let loose a little bit, not be so serious this time. This book sparks with humor and contains ""419 exclamation points."" That's more than a few. Though she weaves in many serious themes, there is also a sweetness and lightness to her story. I highly recommend it.

Too often if I hear great things about a book I go in with super high expectations that are hard to reach. It's the ""voice"" of DEMON COPPERHEAD that really blew me away. I read several of Barbara Kingsolver's books in the 90s, but didn't know she had the ability to get this deep into her character and story. Well done, Ms. Kingsolver! As a mashup of David Copperfield's plot and Holden Caufield's voice (from Catcher in the Rye), Demon Copperhead tells the story of a teenage boy growing up in very rural Virginia, that southwest tip that abuts Kentucky and Tennessee; not a place that has much going for it. In fact a place that more often devours its own. Born to a drug addicted mother and an already dead father, Damon (aka Demon) faces every worst-case scenario anyone could imagine for a child. The single positive influence in his life is the Peggot family who lives next door to Demon and his mother. Though also highly dysfunctional on their own, the Peggots are the only solid foundation Demon can cling to in times of trouble. And the book is basically 500+ pages of trouble. But don't let that deter you! This is a well-told, gripping story with just enough heart and humor to keep it from being too emotionally heavy. I could barely put it down. This would be an excellent book club book, and I may even choose it for my own so I can reread it. It's that good.

Sebald is a layered, dense, heavily-disguised story about the Holocaust. Sebald must have been a genius to pull this off. It is said that the heaviest subjects cannot be written about directly; the author must tell an oblique story to get a serious message across. That is this book. With three hundred pages and only 7 paragraphs, we can barely come up for a breath in this story—much in the same way those who lived through WWII and the Holocaust did not get to step away or have a reprieve. As the title character relates dozens of anecdotes about his life (in a search to find out who he really is once he discovers he was adopted by an English family), each scene felt analogous to many of the horrors we now know about. So many scenes contain long lists ... I imagined as I was reading it the lists of names of those who had been killed or went missing during the war. This is a book that benefits from deep discussions. Read it with others, if possible. It's tough to get into, but there is a reason for that.

Does that answer change if the creative is a mother? The problem is McEwan makes the reader work way too hard to get the message, IMHO. In fact, this book seems to have two plots that barely intertwine. First, as you can see by the cover and title, is a young boy's experience with piano lessons at a private boarding school. The second is found on the front jacket flap: ""Twenty-five years later, Roland's wife mysteriously vanishes, and he finds himself alone with their baby son."" In between the two storylines, we get the husband and wife's entire backstories, and even their parents' backstories. This borders on info dump to me. One er said that instead of ""going deep"" into the characters, McEwan chooses to ""go wide,"" meaning he encompasses too much history to tell his story. I agree with that. I had to skip huge chunks of this book just to finish it. All that being said, McEwan does have many beautiful sentences and thoughts about life. Also his message about a wife's desire to fulfill her creative drive (acknowledging men get to do it all the time; the problem is when women try it) is well-taken.

By the way, Robert Glenister, the narrator of the audio book is phenomenal! Still 5 Stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Robert Galbraith (aka JK Rowling) is a phenomenal storyteller. In this, the 6th installment of the Cormoran Strike & Robin Ellacott series), ""Galbraith"" has created a storyline that closely mirrors her own life story—to an extent. My biggest knock of this book is its length (over 1000 pages). Really? It seems pretty easy to keep the reader guessing when you can throw in a dozen potential killers (and all the inherent red herrings) when you're looking for only one. In other words, no, I didn't guess the killer until it was obvious because Galbraith expertly teases us with so many possibilities. In this story, Edie Ledwell and her boyfriend, Josh Blay, create a YouTube cartoon called the Ink Black Heart. Then a fan creates an online fan-fiction game with the same characters. When the original cartoon gets so popular and Netflix comes calling, the gamers get angry about the creators selling out—so someone kills Edie and almost kills Josh. Strike and Ellacott are hired to find the anonymous person who started the online game—a person who may or may not be the actual killer. One of the best parts of this series is the romantic tension between Cormoran and Robin, a la ""Moonlighting,"" if anyone remembers that TV show.

Yes, there's a family at the center of the story, but this book is considerably more political. As it should be, in some regards. With the real-life anti-Asian sentiment that increased significantly during the pandemic (not to mention atrocities that go back to WWII and beyond), Ng practically is the perfect person to write a story like this. Set in a dystopian near-future, Our Missing Hearts is the story of a Chinese American mother who must abandon her husband and child after her poetry is used in protests to defy the US government. In this version of the future, the Chinese are blamed for ""the crisis,"" (not a viral pandemic, but a financial crisis) and the US government institutes PACT, the Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act. This allows (encourages) Americans to spy on their friends, family, and neighbors. If anyone engages in anything subversive to our then-ultra-conservative government, the authorities will step in and remove the children from their families and ""re-place"" them in ""better"" homes. Thus, the protagonist, Margaret Mia, had to leave her home and family before the government could take their only son from her and her husband. When she can't stand it anymore, Margaret leaves a clue for her 11-year old son to come find her in New York City. It's a touching cautionary tale, but the least favorite of Ng's books for me.THREE scary STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 19, 2022","Dec 15, 2022","Sep 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60149573-our-missing-hearts

CaThe title of this book should have been: Tennis, Everyone?, because it's ALL ABOUT TENNIS, down to point-by-point descriptions of a ton of matches. Carrie Soto was the greatest women's tennis player of all time, and by some metrics the greatest player period, male or female. Now, seven years after retirement, Nicki Chan has tied Carrie's record, so Carrie comes out of retirement to attempt to win at least one more Slam title. We aren't supposed to like Carrie Soto, not really, not for most of the book. Her new nickname in the press is ""the bitch,"" because ""the battle-ax,"" her nickname before retirement, just wasn't accurate enough. Carrie Soto has no filter, no compassion, and no sense of humor. She cares about two things: tennis and her father, a retired tennis player from Argentina who becomes her coach—until she fires him because he doesn't want her to win as badly as she does. About 2/3 through this book, Taylor Jenkins Reid, whose other books I thoroughly enjoyed, broadens the storyline to touch on the father/daughter relationship. That added one star to my , but I seriously ached for more of a subplot most of the way through.

THE DIAMOND EYE is about a Ukrainian mother and scholar, Lyudmila Pavlichenko, who becomes Lady Death, a sniper for the Russian army after Hitler invades the country in the late 1930s. The first half of this novel goes into great detail about how the young mother and student became a sniper, and then takes us into the trenches as she stalks and kills Hitlerites.

The storyline of THE PARIS APARTMENT is fresh and clever. Foley withholds just the right amount of facts and clues until the last possible moment. In essence, Jess, a young Brit who has had nothing but bad luck, goes to Paris to visit her brother, who seems to have done well for himself. But when she arrives at his apartment, he's not there, and something bad has definitely happened. Scrappy young Jess has to both make her way in a strange city where she doesn't speak the language and figure out what has happened to her brother. The two weren't close, so there's a lot she doesn't know. The other residents of the apartment building are shady and each one is less helpful than the next. The ending does not disappoint!

Whether he's writing plot-based or character-based novels, his stories are gripping. Born in Ireland in 1950, Boyne, a gay man, has made no secret that growing up gay in Catholic Ireland was the most difficult part of his life. Many of his novels include the horrors and atrocities Catholic priests have committed on young boys. If Boyne doesn't personally hate the Catholic Church, many of his characters do. In other words, it's difficult to talk about THE HEART'S INVISIBLE FURIES, his 2017 novel, without mentioning the hatred of the Catholic Church and the entire county of Ireland (which is/was essentially ruled by the Church) that seeps through his words.THE HEART'S INVISIBLE FURIES is the story of Cyril Avery, a boy adopted by Charles and Maude Avery in 1945. Spanning 70 years, the novel follows Cyril, also gay, through his life and chronicles the laws, prejudices, and attitudes that shape the lives and behaviors of homosexuals, both in Europe and New York City. Hatred of the Catholic Church aside, this is a deep, emotional, sweeping novel full of pain and survival, loss and love. It was difficult to put down, and I think this story will stay with me for a long, long time.

I had never read anything by Saul Bellow before, so II randomly read (listened to) this book because it was suggested just before I took a road trip. I had never read anything by Saul Bellow before, so I was curious. Written in 1947, it's easy to see I was not Bellow's intended audience, as this novel didn't really speak to me, despite its top-notch writing.THE VICTIM is the story of Asa Leventhal, a twenty-something married Jewish man, but the novel came off like a long short story. ""Listen to what happened to me that time my wife went down to help her mother move."" In other words, it didn't have much of a plot other than getting inside Leventhal's head during a difficult month in his life while his wife was away. In fact, it's not even clear who ""the victim"" is/was. It might have been one of several—or multiple—characters. While his wife is away, Leventhal is being trailed by and is then accosted by an old acquaintance, Kirby Albee. Albee blames his recent downfall in life on Leventhal for extremely bizarre circumstances. Albee is cunning and manipulative, so he convinces Leventhal of his guilt. This really messes with Leventhal's head when his wife (his rock) is out of town and also while his nephew is dying. As Leventhal sinks deeper into frustration and confusion, he worries that he's losing his mind like his mother did when he was a child. In the end, Leventhal stands up to Albee, though barely. They go their separate ways, then meet up again in the denouement. Though I enjoyed reading a work by Saul Bellow, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in the 70s, I can't say this book held up, at least not for me. There are a lot of Biblical references as well as middle-aged working-man references.

Soon Alice meets Felix, a good-for-nothing, attractive man whom Alice quickly falls in love with, and Eileen reconnects with her childhood crush, Simon.

Is it me, or is literature headed toward Extremism? Apparently storylines have to be over-the-top these days to get an agent/editor/publisher's attention. THE PUSH is the story of Blythe, a woman whose mother left her as a child. When Blythe marries Fox, she decides she will be the opposite of her mother. Except she isn't. She doesn't take to motherhood, at least not with her first child. She does better with her second child, a son. And then something happens, multiple ""things"" happen, which lead to the end of Blythe & Fox's marriage. Though Fox tries to convince Blythe she is the problem, Blythe is convinced the blame lies with someone else. Beyond this extreme storyline (to elaborate on why it's extreme would be a spoiler), Audrain's writing-style choices are also unusual. The story is told mostly in the second person as Blythe, in retrospect, tells Fox her side of the story about what happened and why from her point of view. ""Your house glows at night like everything inside is on fire."" ""You slid your chair over and tapped my text book with your pencil ..."" It's cumbersome. As a mother who loved her children, I couldn't relate to nor did I enjoy the first half of this book.

This is a collection of essays and interviews collected from the past several years on a monumental subject and national/global movement. The primary message and intent of Ms. Kaba is abolishing the prison-industrial complex. But wait! If those words alone make you want to dismiss Kaba, her ideas, or even this , give me just one minute. I read this book in order to understand how the hell we, in 21st century America (and globally), could possibly accomplish that. Shut down the prisons? No, thank you! But that is an unfair dismissal of her ideas. Kaba wants to eliminate harm from society. Who can argue with that? She knows it is a very complicated idea, especially considering that the idea of ""an eye for an eye"" is one of the fundamental tenets of many/most religions. Beyond that, it's how we Americans were raised. If we were naughty, we got a spanking. Two brilliant observations: ""No one enters violence for the first time by committing it."" and, to paraphrase: Hurt people, hurt people. Therefore, Kaba's basic premise is to stop punishing/hurting/abusing young people so they don't learn violence as a way of life. And prisons make offenders worse, ergo they cannot be the answer to our dysfunctional society.My primary reaction to her ideas and proposals (abolishing prisons) is that they are excellent as an ultimate goal, but they should not be presented or taken as a starting point. If that is an end goal, then Square One has to focus on 1) Maternity care and paid leave, plus paid paternity leave. 2) Nurturing and affordable childcare. 3) Early childhood education and equal access to the Internet and devices. 4) Equal education for all. 5) New non-violent methods and responses to youths and teens who will inevitably make mistakes. To build a new society, we have to start with a solid, level foundation for all. Then, ideally, in twenty years or so our prison system would be vastly abolished or minimized on their own accord. That, in my opinion, should be the first step to restorative justice. Two last thoughts. We are now proud of Abolitionists like John Brown and Frederick Douglass for helping to end slavery, so if someone identifies today as an abolitionist, do not dismiss them. Also, educate yourself on the unfortunate soundbite/hashtag #DefundthePolice. What that movement really means is #IfwewantabetterworldweneedtotakesomefundingawayfromPolicebudgetsandRefundCommunities. But that didn't fit in most tweets. Defunding police forces would allow cities to fund mental health organizations that could help a huge number of the people who are now handled (often poorly) by police officers that were never trained to be mental health providers. We need an alternative to 911, a 3-digit number that would ring trained responders for a person in crisis.

Luckily, the story focuses mainly on the characters and their actions and motivations. Like most mystery writers, Penny makes sure multiple characters have a potential motive and possible opportunity to commit the expected murder. In this, I did not guess who the guilty party was before she revealed him/her. I do wish Penny would write longer paragraphs, fewer one-sentence declarations, but I still love her snowy, yet cozy murder mysteries.FOUR blizzardy STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 10, 2022","Jan 17, 2022","Nov 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56269078-the-madness-of-crowds

I was hoping it would be a Louise Penny mystery with insider tips and ideas from Hillary Clinton. Nope. This is Hillary Clinton's stab at a novel with, I'm guessing here, no more than guidance from Louise Penny. The story follows a fictitious Secretary of State, Ellen Adams, through a potential ""worst case scenario"" in American History. From the epilog we know that means nuclear war. Hillary Clinton, it appears, felt no need to cage her politics and opinions, because it takes direct aim at the man who beat her in the 2016 election. Anyone who dislikes it solely because of its politics has the right to go there because the author did first.Sadly, the plot is elementary, the dialogue is stiff and trite, and the ending is very predictable. Worse yet, I'm sorry to say, is the narration of the audio version. Though I assume actress Joan Allen is a lovely person, the narration was possibly the worst I've ever listened to.

It's not a book I would have picked up on my own, but it was interesting to see part of the world at a time in history that I knew very little about—aside from the movie CASABLANCA, which happened a few years before this in the same area. Set in the late 1940s - early 1950s in central Morocco, this story is about a Frenchwoman's life after she marries a Moroccan WWII hero who helped fight for the resistance in France. The racial discrimination was as bad then as anything we see in our world today, probably worse, directed primarily at the French Colonists who lay claim to vast regions of Morocco after the war. The husband, Amine, takes Mathilde to his hometown so he can take over the family farm after his father dies. They struggle desperately with their crops, the discrimination, and the social morés women faced in Muslim countries. It was a brutal existence for many. My biggest knock on this book is that the plot didn't flow. It was written with 9 Parts, which felt like short stories.

When Joy, wife of Stan and mother to four grown children, goes missing, her husband becomes the primary suspect. But it's difficult after reading this book to put it in any single category. I can't say too much without spoilers, but the plot is kind of all over the place. In fact, it's so character-driven, that it could almost be called a fun work of literary fiction, if that's even a thing.At age 69, Joy and Stan Delaney are newly retired empty-nesters. Once owners of a thriving tennis academy, they are now bored and unsettled. Then one night a girl named Savannah knocks on their door with blood dripping down her face. She said her boyfriend hit her so she left ran out and randomly knocked on the Delany's door for help because their home looked friendly. Joy is delighted to have something to do, someone to take care of. But Savannah is not what she seems, and Joy's four grown children are not happy about the situation. When Joy goes missing, the key to her disappearance is centered around Savannah, as well as Stan. So that's the basic plot, but as I said, this book is entertaining, but not a straight whodunit.

I probably wouldn't have picked it up on my own, but it was chosen for my book club. And I'm so glad it was! Harris's writing style is lyrical, with long, vivid sentences. (I doubt he would cite Hemingway as an influence.) But by the time I got into the groove of his rhythm, I fell deep into his story. The novel is about hope, the importance of hope for everyone.Set in Georgia just days after the Emancipation Proclamation, The Sweetness of Water follows two brothers, Prentiss and Landry, who have just been freed. They soon meet George and Isabelle Walker whose son Caleb is a Confederate soldier, away at war. The Walkers, originally from Baltimore, are outsiders even in their adopted hometown of Old Ox. When they hire the brothers to help work on their land, it causes trouble with the lifelong Southerners who don't believe the freedmen should be paid as much as George wants to pay them. Not long after Caleb returns from the war, someone commits a murder. That's where the story really takes off.The characters in this novel are well-written and feel very real. Their personal histories are raw and often tragic. As the book nears the end, the ""profluence"" escalates, and it's difficult to put down.

I both listened to the audiobook and read along with a hard copy (something I love to do!) and could scarcely put it down. Colm Tóibín somehow made Mann's story urgent and gripping. The life story of Thomas Mann, a closeted homosexual who was married to a woman and fathered six children, had a difficult and dramatic life, most definitely worthy of a book. A German who became famous as Hitler was rising into power (he won the Nobel Prize in 1929), Mann was a powerful voice against Hitler. He emigrated first to various European cities, and then Princeton, NJ, just before the war broke out, and eventually Los Angeles before returning to Switzerland for the final stage of his life. He lost multiple family members to suicide, and at least three of his children were also gay or bisexual, one also a drug addict. What amazed me most from this book is learning how powerful Mann was considered at the time (""the most important living German after Einstein,"") and also how nonchalant Mann and his wife were about their children's colorful lives. They spoke openly about their partners and affairs.

I had never heard of Laura Dave before, but when I read the premise and first few pages of THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME, I was hooked. I never wanted to put this book down, and when I had to, I couldn't wait to get back to it. Hannah Hall is a furniture maker in NYC. When Owen Michaels, a Silicon Valley tech genius, walks into her store with one of her best customers, the two cautiously hit it off. Hannah was raised mostly by her grandfather and has trouble opening up to people. Owen's first wife was killed tragically, and he is raising their daughter, Bailey, by himself in Sausalito. When Hannah and Owen get married (not a spoiler), Hannah works very hard to win over her 16-year-old stepdaughter. One day, both Hannah and Bailey get cryptic, scribbled notes from Owen. His company has been raided, and he has disappeared. As Hannah and Bailey follow the very few clues they have as to what's really going on, they discover an unknown past, and also a way forward. The ending is not predictable and does not disappoint.FOUR and a half STARSP.S. Does the publishing industry insist on doomsday titles? They're all so dramatic these days.

The idea of orphan trains—taking orphans and unwanted children from the East Coast in the late 1800s and early 1900s and sending them to ""farm country""—is both heart-warming and heart-breaking. Often, young babies were adopted quickly by families that couldn't have children, but older boys and girls were often ""taken"" by families that needed extra help on the family farm or in the family business. Not all orphans ended up in loving homes. Kline centers her novel around a troubled teenage girl in 2011 and a 91-year-old woman who was sent on one such train from New York to Minnesota after the rest of her family died in an apartment fire. When Molly, the teenager, is assigned service hours for a misdeed, she commits to helping Vivian, the elderly woman, clean out her attic.

But BLIND TURN then grows into a story about forgiveness: how and why to forgive others, and the importance of forgiving one's self, because we have all made mistakes, we are all human. Set in a small Texas town where football is practically a religion, Jessica Johnson has killed the town's beloved football coach. Everyone, especially Jessica, is devastated. Her divorced parents knew and loved Coach Mitchell. The characters are well-drawn, relatable people with personal, familial, and financial troubles. As each character struggles through his/her own circumstances, it becomes nearly impossible to put the book down as the girl's trial approaches. Will she or won't she go to prison? But there's another interesting social dynamic that Achterberg may or may not have intended. In BLIND TURN, Jessica is a ""good teenager"" and the victim is a town hero. Both of those factors up the intensity of the story, but this is a sad reality in America that has only recently come to light. If the driver were a young black male, for example, would the reaction of the small town and the outcome have been the same? If the victim had been a homeless person or unknown neighbor would the reaction and outcome have been the same? Research has shown that attractive blond children who have gone missing are more likely to receive national attention than poor or disadvantaged children. That is so sad. We should care for everyone as if he or she were a good, beloved, attractive friend. Because, we are all human. BLIND TURN shines a light on the power of humanity.

I am a big (late-to-the-party) fan of Penny's work, this being my 9th of her books to read. I'm now more eager to read the rest to see if this one becomes my favorite of all.Set in a real monastery in remote Quebec, though with a fictional order of monks, this novel puts Gamache and his right hand man, Jean Guy Beauvoir, on the trail of a killer inside the abbey. One monk, the prior, leader of their renowned choir, has been killed by one of the other monks. But there is also a parallel and deeply personal storyline concerning Beauvoir. In a previous novel, Gamache and Beauvoir nearly died in pursuit of a killer. Gamache has mostly recovered from that, but Beauvoir still struggles with PTSD—and now addiction to pain killers. The closer the detectives get to solving the case at the abbey, the deeper Beauvoir falls into his troubles. Like icing on a cake to the excellent story, Penny makes the reader fall in love with her settings. Her descriptions of the abbey and the music of the monks are so vivid and reverential that I'm tempted to find recordings of both Gregorian and Plain Chants so I can experience them first hand.

The stories are tragic, but peppered with love and humanity as a means of survival.McGrath's wife, Ellen, initially suggests they spend a year in Lesotho so she can further her anthropological studies on AIDS and orphan care. AIDS is rampant in Lesotho, and one quarter of all their children have lost one or both parents to AIDS. While Ellen travels the country on her motorcycle to visit families in remote areas, Will becomes a teacher at a local school. The two make friends and dive into seemingly every native experience they can—save for beating a thieving shepherd to death. They learn to love the country and its people.

Each sister has a daughter. Eventually, the sisters, who lost track of each other for over a decade, are brought back together by certain events.

I say that because O'Farrell took the scant historical facts about the wife and family of William Shakespeare—arguably one of the most famous historical figures ever—and made up a story about his family. She admits in the Author's Notes that the story is entirely from her own imagination. Basically, it appears she created it from nothing more than birth and death dates, plus names and addresses. In other words, she created an entirely fictitious story about real people. I have no problem with that other than the fact that the ers have pitched this book as ""the story of how William Shakespeare's son, who died at age 11, influenced the making of ""Hamlet,"" the most famous of all plays."" It's not that! It's not even, IMHO, ""a Novel of the Plague,"" as it says on the cover. The plague, or ""pestilence,"" as they call it, also has very little to do with the plot. This is the story of an ""eccentric"" woman who lived in Stratford, England in the late 1500s-early 1600s, and grieves the loss of her son. And, oh yeah, her husband becomes famous (but that's not much more than a footnote).In HAMNET, O'Farrell never mentions the word ""Shakespeare,"" not even once. She never mentions the name ""William"" in reference to the father of Hamnet, not even once. He, William Shakespeare, is called ""her husband,"" or ""the son of John, the glover,"" or ""his father,"" throughout the entire book. I have no problem with that, but it was an odd style decision. All that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed HAMNET. It's a well-written, moving story about how Agnes, also known as Ann, met and married ""the Latin tutor."" They have a daughter and move in next-door to ""his family."" A few years later, they have twins, Hamnet and Judith. When ""the husband"" can no longer bear living in the shadow of his father, Agnes encourages him to go to London where he begins writing and performing plays. It isn't until the final 25 pages that O'Farrell mentions the play ""Hamlet."" I was very curious how this story would end, and was eager to keep reading.

THE LYING LIFE OF ADULTS, by Elena Ferrante, is a coming-of-age story about Giovanna, growing up in Naples, Italy, in the early 1990s. As a young girl, Giovanna believes she is beautiful because her father praises her so much. Then, at the age of 12, he says she looks like his estranged sister, Vittoria, whom she knows is considered ugly, at least by her father. That comment sets Giovanna on a mission to meet her aunt. The story happens over four years, coinciding with her puberty. The novel delves into family dynamics, a young girl's insecurities, and her quest to figure out who she is in relation to her parents, her best friends, the boys who are suddenly paying her a lot of attention; it even touches on God and religion. Overriding the story, in my opinion, is the controversy about who Elena Ferrante really is. It's a pen name, and many people believe Ferrante is a man. I'm one of those people. While I related to many of the emotions and struggles that Giovanna experiences, I ultimately felt like this was a man writing as a young girl.

THE SEARCHER is the story of Cal, a retired Chicago cop who moves to a remote town in Ireland to get away from murder and mayhem. That is spoiled, of course, when 12-year-old Trey searches him out and asks Cal to find Brenden, Trey's brother who has gone missing.

And the concept is a good one: What happens to people on the fringes of a catastrophiLEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND, by Rumaan Alam, is a high-concept novel. And the concept is a good one: What happens to people on the fringes of a catastrophic event? By now we are all familiar with stories (and real life) about people at the epicenter of a catastrophe—from WAR OF THE WORLDS to 9/11—but what about the people who are not immediately affected but still know that somewhere something very bad happened to some people? It's a great question. Plus, LEAVE THE WORLD BEHIND is up for the National Book Award. Naturally, I was eager to read this book which is pitched as dealing with racism and white privilege. But wow, no. With apologies to the author, the writing sunk this story. He made narrative and style choices that didn't work for me.The story is about a white family (mother, father, son, and daughter) who rent an Airbandb house in upstate New York. A few days after they arrive, something happens in the city (never explained) and the owners of the rental house show up on the doorstep. They have fled New York and didn't know where else to go other than their country house. The elderly owners are black. Once the shock of are-they-really-who-they-say-they-are? wears off, race is no longer an issue—and honestly, wouldn't anyone have had that thought no matter what color the people were? Putting that aside, Alam chose to use omniscient POV, but not only does he jump between characters too randomly, about halfway through he starts injecting god-like pronouncements about random Americans who are dying, will die, or who have died in random places from the New York subway to a prison in Georgia to a mother in Philadelphia. Another choice the author made was to eschew (for the most part) dialogue tags. Very few uses of ""he said"" or ""she said."" I know those can be obnoxious, but he replaced them with interior thoughts of the character that disrupted the narrative flow. For example, when the family and the owners are gathered around the kitchen island, we get this from the wife: ""'I'll do the washing.' Ruth thought restoring her kitchen to order might soothe. Also it was only polite."" That really didn't work for me. But this was the kicker for me: The country house has power but no tv or Internet, so they can't get news the traditional way—however, there are two expensive cars in the driveway and they never (even on their two excursions) turn on the radio! Alam makes a quick comment late in the book that no satellites are working, but there are dozens of radio stations outside New York City that would presumably still have some sense of what was happening in the world. Not to mention the idea of driving into town to ask someone or get a newspaper. From there, events get more and more bizarre. I hope I never find out if the world goes as crazy as Alam suggests it might, but he went too far, IMHO, with oddities at the end. The one redeeming factor of this book is that it made me wonder if I should be a little bit prepared for a catastrophic event. I guess it wouldn't hurt to have bottled water and canned goods in my basement.ONE disastrous STAR...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 22, 2020","Oct 29, 2020","Oct 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358031-leave-the-world-behind

In this, Gamache and his wife travel to Paris to be with their daughter for the birth of her daughter. While there, Armand's godfather is hit by a car and another man is murdered. Naturally, he does not stay off the case. I listened to the audio version of this book, and, as a Francophile, I reveled in the French names, foods, and swear words.

This man turns out to be Cameron Bright, the middle brother between Bub and Nathan, the protagonist. We quickly learn that this was not one big happy family. The brothers' father was an abusive, angry man, who passed away years before the story opens, yet his legacy lingers, and has affected each member of the family in different ways. The plot centers around how Cameron died. Was it suicide? Did he get lost and disoriented in the heat? Or did someone leave him out there on purpose? While this falls under ""mystery"" as a genre, it's really the story of a family. It's a story about anger, abuse, survival, and the ways individuals face or deny all of the above. From the boys' mother, Liz, to Cameron's wife, Ilsa; Uncle Harry, the ranch manager; and the ""backpackers"" who work as hired hands, Harper does an excellent job of casting shade on each of them as possible suspects in Cameron's death.

His latest creation, which cleverly pulls characters and elements from his previous novels and loops them into a new story, lacks forward momentum. There is no overarching plot or ""novel question"" to keep the reader turning the pages. I wasn't about to quit reading, but I wasn't excited to read it either.Utopia Avenue is a British rock band, just making a name for themselves in the late 60s. The band consists of four members: Dean Moss, the heartthrob bass guitarist and lead singer; Elf Holloway, the female keyboardist; Jasper de Zoet, the lead guitarist; and Griff, the drummer. In place of a strong plot, Mitchell delves into the private lives of Moss, Elf, and Jasper, leaving Griff as an afterthought. For the first half of the story, Jasper, from THE TEN THOUSAND AUTUMNS OF JACOB de ZOET, might be described as what we know today to be autistic; in the second half he falls into a full-on psychotic breakdown, wherein Mitchell weaves his signature, science-fiction solution. Elf suffers sexist mores and romantic challenges, and Dean battles the dichotomy of a dark past with new-found fame. What's more—the angle so many positive blurbs cite—is that Mitchell surrounds his fictional band members with the most famous, real-life rock stars of their day. What might have been a reality for a band at the time, it comes across as total name dropping in the worst possible way in the book. The list of musicians they encounter is endless: from John Lennon, Keith Richards, Syd Barrett, Dianna Ross, and Cream, to Leonard Cohen, Janis Joplin, and Jerry Garcia, just to name a few. So many it becomes farcical. Then, the ending. Another disappointment to me. It felt like Mitchell didn't know how to end it, so he gave into cliché. While I am glad to have read UTOPIA AVENUE, I will have a hard time recommending it. If you want to read a great book about a fictional band, pick up (or better yet, listen to) DAISY JONES AND THE SIX. That was a great book.

AMERICAN DIRT, by JIt's difficult to separate this book from its hype and controversy, but I strongly suggest that everyone do just that and read it. AMERICAN DIRT, by Jeanine Cummins, is the story of Lydia, a middle class mother and bookstore owner in Acapulco, and her only son, Luca, who are forced to become migrants, on the run from a drug lord and his gang after he murders Lydia's entire family at a party. Sixteen dead, because Lydia's husband, a journalist, wrote an exposé on the drug lord, a man who Lydia knows from her bookstore. Sixteen.The story, in and of itself, is a page turner. Cummins created well-rounded, sympathetic, likable characters, and then put them in a tragic situation with a specific goal. At first, I feared this book might gloss over the horrors many migrants face, but no. Many scenes are brutal, but from what I know, sadly realistic. It's difficult even to read what these people endure. Along their journey, the mother and son meet other fleeing migrants (and possible gang members), many of whom also suffer at the hands of corrupt officials and police along the trek north. Not everyone makes it across the border.After Oprah selected this book for her book club, controversy arose concerning Cummins' ""right"" to tell this story because she is not a first generation Latina. I understand that logic, but I feel her voice can add to the oeuvre. The more people who read accurate stories about the immigrants the better, I say, because it will open eyes to the reasons most of the migrants want to reach America.

Better yet, listen to this audiobook. It's a fantastic story with A+ performances by a stellar cast. DAISY JONES & THE SIX, a novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid, is a fictional biography of a band in the '70s that feels so real I had to check the internet to see if they had existed and I had somehow missed them. Reid excels at voice and dialogue, not to mention setting and emotion. The Six began as a band formed by Billy and Graham Dunn, two brothers with a deadbeat dad. Four other friends join in, including Karen Karen the keyboardist. Billy is the lead singer/rockstar/heartthrob. He gets married early in the story to Camilla. After a decent debut album, they get introduced to Daisy Jones, a wild, sexy, beautiful singer/songwriter. When Daisy and Billy collaborate on the band's second album magic happens. And yes, it causes problems for everyone. With dozens of insightful, powerful lines, Reid has delivered a novel as heartbreaking as the song you and your first love listened to in high school, the one that still tugs at your heart when it comes on the Oldies station in the car. But arguably the best part of this story is how strong the women are. Camilla, Karen, Daisy (while sober), and Daisy's best friend, Simone, each stand their ground, support each other, and make (mostly) good decisions, all while maintaining their femininity, grace, and sense of self.

The old woman lived in Italy with her aging niece, so the American decided to weasel his way into the lives of the women in order to get his hands on the papers. James changes the name from Byron to Aspern, but it seems he keeps most of the story the same (though the legend doesn't say what happened to Byron's papers in the end).In this novella, an English man worms his way into the home of these women, promising to do anything, including sleep with the niece, if necessary, in order to get the papers. Not surprisingly, the story is very well written and captivating. We must know whether or not the papers exist, and if so, will the man be successful in getting the papers before the old woman destroys them?!The ending is as poetic as one might hope.FOUR STARS (subtracting one for lack of an original plot)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 06, 2020","Jun 10, 2020","Jun 06, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/214528.The_Aspern_Papers

James mystery, and chose INNOCENT BLOOD from a list of the Top 10 Mysteries of the 20th Century. It must have made that list because it's unique, meaning it holds an odd twist that separates it from a typical mystery. Other than that, I would not put it on my personal list of Top Mysteries of any century.Written in 1980, INNOCENT BLOOD is the story of Philippa Palfrey, an adopted girl who lives in London. Though her adoptive parents are well-to-do, she imagines her birth parents to be star-crossed aristocrats. On her 18th birthday, she can legally learn their true identity and finds that not only are they not aristocrats, they are a rapist and a murderess. Her father died in prison, but her mother is soon to be paroled. Philippa decides she will move out of her cushy home and get an apartment so she and her birth mother can spend time together before Philippa goes off to Cambridge. Meanwhile, the father of the little girl who was raped and murdered by Philippa's parents has vowed to kill the woman who killed his daughter. While Philippa and her mother are exploring London, the man trails them with his single-minded mission. Things don't go as planned. The novel, in and of itself, is about 100 pages too long, in my opinion. While P.D. James is a skilled storyteller and writer, I don't know how this book compares to her others.

The story takes place over twelve months (each chapter = one month). Her writing is clean, evocative, and as sharp as the climate and geography there.Praised as one of the Top 10 Books of 2019 by the New York Times and others, Disappearing Earth gives us glimpses of how the disappearance of two young girls in an insular community reverberates throughout a land as remote as an island, so isolated it is from the mainland. But there in lies the knock, too. Each chapter focused on a different woman (though many lives intersect). Thus each chapter feels like its own short story. The problem is that starting each chapter with new characters robs the novel of momentum. Indeed the cast of characters overwhelms the reader, as we try to keep the women straight while also figuring out how they tie into the story. What's more, Phillips chooses not to tie up the lives/loose ends of all but the primary story. She leaves us in the dark about the characters we tried so hard to care about.

The case goes unsolved for eighteen months, then two detectives get a clue that reopens the case. Together, they solve it in a single day. What I didn't like about this story is that French alternates the POV between the primary detective, Stephen Moran, and Holly Mackey, a student at the girls’ school and the daughter of Frank Mackey, an undercover detective who works with Moran. I enjoyed the psychological insight into and between the two detectives, but I was completely uninterested in the lives of the eight high school girls, one of whom was probably the killer.

THE TURN OF THE KEY is the story of a twenty-something girl who leaves her job at a London daycare to be the private nanny for a wealthy family in Scotland. The parents, Sandra and Bill Ellincort, are architects who have refurbished an old Victorian estate in the country, turning it into a ""smart house."" The Ellincorts have four daughters, one of whom is fourteen and away at boarding school for most of the book. The parents are desperate to fill the position of nanny because the previous four have all quit, possibly because the house is haunted. Indeed as Rowan spends her first few nights at the house (while the parents are out of town), she is terrified of creepy noises and moving objects and local lore and their poison garden ... More importantly, the novel is told in a first person account of Rowen writing a letter from prison to a high-powered defense attorney because she has been arrested after one of the daughters is found dead under Rowen's care. She pleads innocence and begins to tell the entire story. In the end, my biggest issue with this book is in the truth about what happened to the child.

She was found guilty and committed to The Grove after being found mentally unstable.

Told in chapters alternating between their POVs, Jordan McBride, Ian Graham, and Nina Markova, all have a connection to ""die Jaergin,"" German (I think) for ""the huntress,"" a cold-blooded Nazi who escaped after the war. Jordan, a feisty young Bostonian with a new step-mother, wants to be a photojournalist but wrestles with her father's expectations to stay home, run the family business, and marry her childhood sweetheart. Ian, based in Vienna, was a war correspondent who gave up journalism to track escaped Nazis. And Nina Markova, an angry young Russian, flew U-2 bombers in an all-female regiment until she had to ""disappear"" or risk being denounced and sent to a work camp. I thought Quinn could have included a few more characters as red herrings, but she did a great job with these characters and more.THE HUNTRESS is a well-written, engaging, WWII novel. Quinn did an incredible amount of research for this novel, and wrote detailed descriptions of the locations, weather, and occupations. I enjoyed it and kept turning the pages faster and faster as I read even though it was a little too pat (ie. full of conveniences).

Though NIGHT BOAT TO TANGIER, a novel by Kevin Barry, tallies around 250 pages, they are small, with much white space. The white space, I discovered, is crucial as it gives the reader room to contemplate the beautiful, complex sentences. This story has been compared to Samuel Beckett's WAITING FOR GODOT, but I don't remember that play having near the gravitas of this novel. In NIGHT BOAT TO TANGIER, two Irish, former-drug dealers, Maurice Hearne and Charlie Redmond, wait one night at the Spanish port of Algeciras, hoping to find Maurice's daughter who they have been told will be taking the ferry that night. That sounds innocent enough and interesting, but that doesn't prepare the reader for the devastation and heartbreak to come, including the possibility of wether or not ""Dilly"" really is his daughter. The phrase ""If it weren't for bad luck, they'd have no luck at all"" most definitely applies to Maurice and Charlie, whose complicated friendship goes back decades. Thick with Irish, Spanish, and drug-dealing slang and customs, this story presumes a lot. Not being Irish, Spanish, or a drug-dealer, I struggled to work through Barry's terse, though often beautiful, writing. But where this story really hits you is with what is implied rather than spoken or written. It's the ""near miss"" of the father/daughter reunion. It's the heartbreaking realities of survival. It's the pain of love and loss.I found this book very powerful, but I took off one star because ultimately I don't want to work this hard while reading a novel.FOUR moving STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 19, 2020","Jan 22, 2020","Jan 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43256597-night-boat-to-tangier

If you just go with the premise that kids can catch on fire and be perfectly fine (you know, the way you believe the scientists in Jurassic Park bring dinosaurs back to life) then it's simply a story about families.

Basically, all good things happen for Madison, and all bad things happen for Lillian. Fifteen years later, Madison, now the wife of Jasper Roberts, a senator from Tennessee, turns to Lillian for help. The two ""fire children"" are Madison's step-children, and she needs someone to care for them after their mother dies.

Marianne comes from a wealthy family, though her now-deceased father was abusive. Connell's mother was the housekeeper for Marianne's family. The two kids are star-crossed lovers on a teeter-totter of concern for public opinion; first one cares more, then the other.

RIPLEY, and later CAROL, adapted from THE PRICE OF SALT, I think Highsmith might end up relegated to the footnotes of twentieth century literature. It's easy to see why Hollywood (director Anthony Minghella, producer Sydney Pollack, etc.) would chose this story for a star-studded big budget film. They upped the ante and the stakes for the conniving, murderous Tom Ripley, but the creation of this antihero is all Highsmith. Written in 1955, TTMR is a nod to Henry James's THE AMBASSADORS, but again, Highsmith takes her characters to new heights.

As Atwood's sequel (35 years later) to THE HANDMAID'S TALE, I expected superb writing and that I would have to brace myself for horrifying new scenarios for the oppressed women of Gilead. Instead, the book was dull. (Not that I was rooting for female torture!, I had simply braced for more unimaginable scenes, of which there were a couple that I skimmed over.)I read THE HANDMAID'S TALE in the 1990s and could barely make it through what I now know as dystopian fiction. The treatment of the women was more than I could stand. I have since watched the HULU production of THE HANDMAID'S TALE, and while I am still horrified by what happens (it is set in the future, though Atwood never says what decade or even century), the ""shock of the new"" has evaporated. Intentionally vague in her earlier book, Atwood gives us a few more details in THE TESTAMENTS about how the new country known as Gilead came to be: In primarily the northeast section of the United States, the radical Sons of Jacob terrorist group staged a coup. They ""liquidated Congress"" and took over control of the US Government, installing Puritan males as their leaders and suppressing all women. During the revolution a nuclear catastrophe occurs, thereby sterilizing most women (and presumably some of the men). The ""Commanders"" get to choose their young and beautiful wives, and if they are sterile, then the couple gets a Handmaid to act as a surrogate mother for the couple. You can see how this might go badly. Anyone, male or female, who disobeys the strict, puritanical laws (or whom the Commanders want out of the way) gets killed in the most gruesome, public manor you can imagine. Probably worse than you can imagine. In the acknowledgements of THE TESTAMENTS, Atwood says she had been working on The Testaments on and off for much of the past 35 years. That must be true, however this book feels rushed, like an early draft not a final draft of such an accomplished writer. My guess is that because HULU is about to release Season 4 of their version of THE HANDMAID'S TALE, Atwood felt she had to get her version out before them. This book ""tells"" most of the story in dry, clichéd scenes, alternately narrated by Aunt Lydia, Baby Nicole, and Agnes. (If you know anything about this story, you will know who those women are.) I was eager to learn how Atwood would end her story, but it was exactly as I would have guessed. The final chapter of the book is a scene from the ""Thirteenth Symposium on Gileadean Studies,"" held in 2197. TWO HUNDRED years in the future. Except the lecturers are still doing a slide show and talking about handing out paper versions of their studies. That is NOT how I expect information to be traded two hundred years from now. For someone who's mind could come up with a story like THE HANDMAID'S TALE, I was hugely disappointed that she didn't have a much more creative view of life that far in the future.

As controversial and popular as it was in the sixties and seventies (after the movie came out), its reputation and aura seemingly warped, twisted, and gathered steam over the past five decades. Whenever this book came up in conversation, people I know still slightly blushed and giggled about it. I decided to read this “dirty book” for myself to see what all the hype was about. Fifty-three years on, it seems almost tame! Though, obviously, the book stayed the same, and the world changed. This novel tells the sad story of three women (Anne, Neely, and Jennifer) in the entertainment industry over twenty years, from 1945 to 1965. The women meet in New York City through an agent named Henry Bellamy when they are young, gorgeous, naive, and eager. In the closing pages, they are none of those. Money, fame, drugs, men, and time ravage them in different ways and to different degrees. Contrary to what I expected, “dolls” are pills: uppers and downers, mostly; the “valley” is certainly the depth of their destruction. This story is well-written, but very long and overly detailed in some parts. Plus the dialogue is often stiff and formal. I imagine when this book came out, there was a lot of speculation (or knowledge) about who each character was supposed to represent (a roman à clef), because the details were that specific. Today it reads as almost tedious, because it seems Susann tried overly hard to keep it accurate.

WARLIGHT is the story of two teenage siblings (Rachel and Nathaniel) who are essentially abandoned by their parents near the end of WWII and left with their mother's colorful, though shady friends. Part I is narrated by Nathaniel in 1945, and Part 2 is told via multiple characters in 1957 as Nathaniel is supposedly trying to unravel what the hell happened. Certainly Michael Ondaatje created colorful characters and wrote picturesque, engaging scenes. The stakes are high for the kids and the setting is exciting. The problem for many people (myself included) is the nearly-impossible-to-follow plot. So, it's ""character driven."" I can accept that because I love literary fiction. The problem with this book is the loose and fractured POV. The back cover of the novel states, ""... A dozen years later, Nathaniel begins to uncover all he didn't know or understand during that time, and it is this journey—through reality, recollection, and imagination—that is told in this magnificent novel."" IMAGINATION? Seriously? Here we have a high-level, literary, WWII, coming of age, spy novel, and the protagonist (Nathaniel) gets to IMAGINE what really happened? I don't think that's how high-level, literary, WWII, coming of age spy novels work. Many chapters in Part 2 are written in the POV of various characters from Part 1. However, roughly 150 years ago Mark Twain said, ""Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to the possibilities, truth isn't."" In other words, maybe in real life we can imagine events we were not privy to, but high-level, literary, WWII, coming of age, spy novels have to follow the rules. Otherwise, the book should be shelved in science fiction. Nathaniel needed to discover the answers to his crazy childhood through legitimate means. If he had, I might have loved this book.

That being said, I think one of the qualifications for the prize must be that the story educate its readers. Indeed, this book leans pedantic. The Overstory is about trees and their importance to the health and longevity of the Earth, and therefore humans. I loved learning more about the history, gestation, and growth of trees. I have a new appreciation for old trees as I go on walks in my neighborhood. This book made me care about trees in ways I never did before. Thankfully, Powers wrapped the information about trees inside stories about nine unique and diverse characters. Each of them has an entirely different experience with trees. By weaving these characters together over multiple generations, Powers developed a plot and created suspense worth reading. I think the audience for THE OVERSTORY will be small. But people who like nature and deep, elegiac novels with beautiful writing will love this book.FOUR glorious STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 19, 2020","Apr 14, 2020","Sep 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40180098-the-overstory

If one of those writers was Colson Whitehead, a Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winning black author, it's not a stretch to think he might produce the best story of those hundred entries. So maybe my expectations were a tad high.THE NICKEL BOYS, by Whitehead, felt rushed and superficial, like a first draft. For a story based on such a tragic reality, this novel skimmed the life of one boy, Elwood Curtis, who was arrested and sent to the ""Nickel Academy"" on entirely trumped up charges because he was a black youth in the wrong place in the sixties. Elwood, who Whitehead says is entirely fabricated, was a near-perfect kid, working at every turn to be good and excel under the harshest of conditions. (He was picked up on his way to take college classes as a high school student.) Regardless, Elwood was horrifically punished for his transgressions. The best part of this brief story, IMHO, was Elwood's inner dialogue as he contemplates the preachings of Martin Luther King, Jr, which he heard on a record album his grandmother gave him and read about in news clippings she sent him at Nickel. Elwood struggles with how to follow King's teachings, specifically: ""Throw us in jail and we will still love you."" Elwood did not love his captors. He tries to follow King's belief that blacks will prevail by holding out hope and love. Instead, this is what leads to his undoing.I found this 200-page novel to be slow and full of TELLING. (Contrary to the adage: Show, don't tell.) For what could have been a book as powerful as Whitehead's THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, I must say this seriously disappointed me.

Normally when I finish a book, I know how I want to rate it and what to say here on GooI am terribly conflicted about THE GUEST BOOK, by Sarah Blake. Normally when I finish a book, I know how I want to rate it and what to say here on Goodreads. Not this time.For starters, I think this story is told backwards. In mysteries, the crime happens at the beginning and the ""detective"" solves it in the end. In suspense, it's the opposite. We know something bad is going to happen, and we keep turning the pages until it does, followed by the resolution. I think THE GUEST BOOK needed a lot more action up front. On page one, a random boater says, ""Somebody drowned there."" Yes, that kept me reading near the end, but the missed potential of this book is so much bigger than the action.Though the writing is often evocative and sensory, Blake presents multiple storylines for three generations of the wealthy Milton family, including Nazi sympathizers, racism, homosexuality, pre-marital sex (in the 50s), familial secrets, childhood death, and more—but all the subplots basically fizzle out; the characters don't address the issues they uncover, they just ponder them as they turn up. Blake or her editor might have thought this was more realistic, but there was no climax, no awakening or solution for the youngest generation. The ending was extremely unsatisfying.And the titular guest book? It's barely mentioned throughout and scarcely plays a part in the storyline. (I have no doubt the publishers chose the title from a list based on what would ""sell."") Plus, while jumping between the three storylines, Blake does not give us timestamps. At the beginning of each chapter it takes several frustrating sentences to figure out which era we are in. This doesn't add to the story, it slows it down. Additionally, it's told in the omniscient POV, jumping between a handful of characters in a single scene. Again, this slows down the story more than it adds. She could have used third person POV and relayed the same emotion and information via dialogue.I got the sense that Blake was trying to recreate a THORN BIRDS-type book. IMHO, she would have been much more successful if she'd pulled in the story and kept a tighter focus.Two-and-a-half watery Stars (rounded up to three)...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 30, 2019","Jul 11, 2019","Jun 30, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41138424-the-guest-book

When I heard Owens's life story, a sixty-nine-year-old woman publishes her first novel which has now been on the NYTimes Best Seller list for 36 weeks, I was thrilled for her. I bought the book as soon as I heard about it in an interview on CBS. Set in North Carolina in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is the story of Kya, a young marsh girl, abandoned by her family, who knows just enough to survive on her own. A few years later, when a local boy is murdered, she becomes the town's first and only suspect. She is arrested and tried for his murder. That right there is a decent premise. A story-worthy idea. Unfortunately, this book needed a LOT of editing that it didn't get. The writing goes beyond evocative, quickly becoming flowery to the point of purple prose, yet I never felt I was THERE. There is little to no talk of snakes, bugs, calloused feet, mud between her toes, etc. The dialog (especially that of the white characters: Kya, Tate, Chase) is stilted and too perfect. Kya, a natural beauty, stunning artist, and unparalleled collector of shells, feathers, and grasses who was taught to read by a handsome young boy, becomes an award winning non-fiction author of several books on nature. In other words, her success (leading up to the trial) was farcical to the point of ridiculous. It's a case of an author falling in love with her protagonist. I kind of liked the ending but not enough to elevate my rating. All writers should be as fortunate as Delia Owens, but I wish for her sake that someone along the way had given her honest advice about how unrealistic the story is. It could have been so much better.One marshy Star...more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,"May 22, 2019not set","May 27, 2019not set","Mar 21, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing

I picked up THE MURDER OF ROGER ACKROYD, written in 1926, after reading a reference to the excellent plotting.

She plants a lot of needles in the haystack! Like a magician who keeps her audience focused on her right hand while the left is playing a trick, every character—at least in this book—is guilty of or hiding something.

Dr. Paul Kalanithi, author of the memoir WHEA lot of people struggle with existential questions like What is the meaning of Life?, and Why am I here? Dr. Paul Kalanithi, author of the memoir WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR, struggled with those questions, too, but in my view, he lived the ""perfect"" life to have the authority to write a book on the subject.Curious as a child, Paul Kalanithi was always looking for answers, turning first to Nature, then to literature and poetry. Kalanithi went to Stanford to study English, where he received both a Bachelor's degree and Master's degree. But studying literature led him to more matters of the mind: How does the brain turn function (like the firing of neurons) into feelings, emotions, and personality? So Kalanithi took a few science and premed classes which led to a second Bachelor's degree in Human Biology. Fast forward a few years, and he also received a Master's of Philosophy from the University of Cambridge, and then his M.D. from Yale. He then returned to Stanford for his residency in neurological surgery, and earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience on the side. Kalanithi, during his decade of medical training, was singularly focused on the quality (and therefore value) of life, especially when confronted with the eminent possibility of death. He had THOUGHT he would study this via his patients in need of the most delicate brain surgeries. Then, at 36, Paul was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.When I say he had a ""perfect"" life to write this book, what I mean is the pieces of his ""pre-diagnosis"" life, in the end, seem ideal to create an amazingly beautiful work of art, which he named WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR. Few authors can organically ask literal questions like ""What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?"" and ""How much neurologic suffering would you let your child endure before saying death is preferable?"" These questions segue smoothly into the subject of science vs. God. A quote from page 170: ""Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue."" Not only is Kalanithi able to address the major questions of Life from the medical side (both doctor and patient), but his early studies in literature and poetry gave him the ability to write about them in beautiful, poignant, and powerful prose. His story reads like a novel; I could barely put the book down, though at times I had to because the stories he tells about his patients and his own life are often tragic. It's a tough book to read, emotionally.Shortly after his diagnosis, Paul Kalanithi and his wife, Lucy, also a doctor, got pregnant and gave birth to a little girl. It was something he wanted more than anything. Five months later, Paul passed away, leaving behind this incredible work of literature, including the letter he writes to his daughter in hopes of being remembered. I, for one, know I will never forget this man or his story.FIVE brilliant STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 06, 2019","Feb 16, 2019","Jan 14, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air

THE TRESPASSER, by Tana French, her sixth installment of her Dublin Murder Squad stories, is more than just a captivating detective novel. THE TRESPASSER goes deep into the head and heart of its protagonist Detective Antoinette Conway, a young biracial female on the otherwise all-male murder squad. French's series takes on one case at a time, each told from a different detective's point of view. In each of these books, you learn about the inner life of the lead detective. Great idea, that. I haven't read them all, but so far, this is my favorite.The particular case of this detective story is of a young ""Barbie doll"" who is murdered, allegedly by her new boyfriend, a cookie cutter domestic violence case, at first glance. Except, of course, it might not be, and therein lies the story. The thrilling brilliance of this novel is in the first person mentality of being an outsider. Antoinette is suspicious of everyone of her coworkers, including her choirboy partner, Steve. After years of being bullied, specifically for being female, she doesn't trust any of them. I was as captivated by the subplot about which, if any, of her coworkers was indeed out to get her and trying to force her off the squad. Would this case be her last? THE TRESPASSER is gritty and crude at times, what we have come to expect from detective novels, I think, but it has more to offer than just a good read. The victim and the detective, both women, share a common factor, one that ends in death for one and a hotshot career for the other. It could lead to an interesting discussion on how girls are raised. The other plus for this book might be mainly for writers, but I was really impressed by how French mastered the skill of a first person narrator. I highly recommend this to anyone who writes or wants to write from the first person POV.I hesitate to give a contemporary mystery five stars, but ultimately my ratings are about readability. This novel is unputdownable. The writing is clean, the story is fresh, and the outcome is satisfying. I believe Tana French is the new Agatha Christie.

THE GREAT ALONE, by Kristin Hannah, hit me deeper than any book I've read in many years—and that's a lot of books. At 438 pages, it is both epic and a quick read. In that regard, I would compare it to THE THORN BIRDS.Set in 1974 - 1986, the protagonist of THE GREAT ALONE is a girl named Lenora Albright, Leni, for short, whom we meet as a thirteen-year-old, living in Seattle. Her father, Ernt, is a Vietnam veteran, a former POW with PTSD. We would know that now, but they didn't in 1974. Leni's mother, Cora, loves her husband so deeply she forgives his repeated abuse and beatings. The man should be in therapy or prison, instead, the family of three heads to Alaska, aka the Great Alone, after Ernt's war buddy bequeaths him a homestead in the wilds of the harshest state in our country. They manage to survive five years in Alaska before tragedy strikes, then another, then another. By the half-way point in this story, I could not put the book down. The writing isn't perfect. In fact, I found the first fifty pages a bit pedestrian: story, story, story [insert atmospheric paragraph here], story, story. Meh. But when Leni starts school in her tiny new town, everything changed. Maybe I was distracted or maybe Kristin Hannah would have benefitted from one more rewrite, but this book picked up steam and turned into a freight train. The tale is in turns lovely, tragic, horrific, happy, sad, hopeful, and heart-breaking. I've never been to Alaska, but Hannah tells us in her acknowledgments that she (and three generations of her family) lived in the region where this story takes place. When she describes the realities and brutalities of life there, I believe her. I also imagine she has suffered the loss of loved ones. The scenes where she describes death and dying are real and raw.

In the book, he is an unnamed narrator—a writer, yes, but without a name and without a wealthy benefactor. Capote was such an excellent writer, creating vivid, sensitive characters, that it's easy to see why Blake Edwards wanted to turn this little story into a movie.

Boyne has created a truly psychopathic character who is ""hella fun"" to read about (to quote another er). This one will get a reaction out of everyone! Can't wait for my book club to read it.Now here's a book worth talking about. A LADDER TO THE SKY, by John Boyne, is a complex, creepy, well-written novel that sticks with you long after you've finished the final pages. The London Times compared it to Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley novels, and rightfully so. A LADDER TO THE SKY is the story of Maurice Swift, a handsome, talented but unimaginative novelist who learns early in life that people (both men and women) will open up to him because he's so ""beautiful."" He uses this knowledge and ability for evil, not good. Told in three parts plus two interludes, each from a different character's POV, we are shown the depths of Swift's depravity—each section darker than the last. His ambition (his ladder to the sky) trumps all. He cajoles, steals, seduces, even kills whoever is necessary to publish his next book, sparing no one in his quest for fame and glory now, and to be remembered forever. Boyne, author of THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS and THE HEART'S INVISIBLE FURIES, makes some bold stylistic choices in this novel. It seems right on the verge of trying too hard, but I feel he succeeded. Especially with the ending. It is poetically perfect. A LADDER TO THE SKY won't become one of the classics of 21st century literature, but I think it will rank high on mystery/psychological thriller lists for decades to come.

It got attention because it brought to light an important subject: how horrifically the early American settlers treated the indigenous people, now known as Native American Indians. However, I can't say this is a great book.THERE THERE has a prologue and an interlude that read like non-fiction. (I have not heard for certain if they are true or imagined to be true.) Those sections are gut-wrenching and shameful. Native American Indians were treated worse than the buffalo and other wildlife. It's sickening to imagine what the ""white man"" did to other human beings just because their skin was darker and their clothes and language were different from the Europeans'. Again, I'm not sure if those sections are factual or not.The bulk of the novel, however, is made up of short, fictional bits from multiple present-day Native Americans' points of view. Each of the characters Orange creates is working his or her way to a big, present-day Powwow in Oakland, California, where we know ""something bad"" is going to happen. There's nothing wrong with that premise, except that the characters all blur together to the point that I didn't care who died in the end because I couldn't remember who was who. Though the characters are divergent in sex, age, status, and socio-economic background, their ""voices"" are mostly interchangeable. Maybe Orange was trying to make the point that the average white American can't differentiate between Indians, but that seems a stretch. A lot of very smart people I know (plus the NYTimes Book Reviewer) couldn't keep the characters straight. That sounds more likely to be the ""fault"" of the (young) author. In the assorted clips from the dozen or more characters, Orange used present tense, past tense, first person POV, third person POV, even one chapter in second person. They are all well-written, but this books reeks of a ""THESIS"" compilation, not a well-edited, focused novel. THERE THERE is indeed an important story, and Tommy Orange has great promise. I indeed hope he continues to write and brings to light more truth about Native American Indians. This is a topic America needs to wake up to. I do hope, though, that his next work is more straight-forward.Three enlightening Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 05, 2019","Aug 18, 2019","Oct 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36692478-there-there

Maybe her publisher wanted to raise a red flag or embolden the Left to band together in opposition to Trump and the Right, but I wish this book would have been presented as a wake up call to all Republicans. They are the ones who need this information the most.FASCISM, A WARNING, is essentially a summary of (primarily) twentieth century European leaders who are now known as Fascists (they didn't ""run"" under that political party banner), and the ways in which they each came into power. In other words, it's a cautionary tale to Americans who say, ""It can't happen here. We have too many checks and balances."" Well, according to Albright and other scholars, yes, it can. Italians and Germans of the early twentieth century were not all horrible people, they were simply frightened, struggling people who fell under the spell of charismatic men who promised to solve all their problems.Beginning with Mussolini, Albright concisely presents the paths that he, Hitler, Milosevic, Chavez, Erdogan, et al, ending with Kim Jong-un, the only ""true Fascist,"" took to become leaders of their countries. She then cites the ways in which Donald Trump is utilizing many tactics these Fascist leaders used, including stealing many lines from their ""scripts,"" right down to ""draining the swamp."" This book definitely hit me in the gut. It scares the hell out of me to think of how Trump capitalizes on fear and xenophobia to win supporters. America was built on freedom of speech, religion, and welcoming the ""huddled masses."" Not only that, but America has been a major contributor to Global Warming, hitting the globe in its warmest spot, the Middle East and the Equator. It's no wonder people in those regions are fighting and starving and looking for refuge. I would recommend this book to anyone who asks, ""How is it possible, what's happening to our country?""

Ultimately, the first whodunit scene is fifteen pages long as the characters and police ""break the case.""

Naturally, I thought I would love THE WITCH ELM, her first stand-alone suspense novel. However, at over five hundred pages, The Witch Elm is too long.The premise: three Irish cousins, now twenty-eight, return to the family home of their beloved, childless Uncle Hugo who is dying of brain cancer. The story follows these three: Toby (the protagonist and narrator); Leon (who is single and gay); and Susanna (now married with two children), who walk us back through their high school days after the skeleton of a classmate is found inside the family's ""wych elm"" tree in the back garden. It becomes clear that someone, most likely one of the four people I have mentioned, killed the boy, Dominic, years ago. The question, of course, is which one? Or, was it suicide after all, the way everyone believed at the time of his death?As the book opens, Toby, the narrator, works in PR for an avant-garde art gallery that is preparing for an edgy exhibition. Except things get off track, Toby is reprimanded, and then late one night, Toby's apartment is broken into and the thieves beat Toby to a pulp, causing serious injuries and significant brain trauma. As Toby is healing, he and his lovely girlfriend, Melissa, go to the home of Uncle Hugo to take care of him in his final days. That's when the skeleton is found, that's when the mystery begins. Because of his brain injuries from the robbery, Toby is an unreliable narrator as he works through what might have happened to Dominic.The theme of the book, I believe, is how immensely one person's small actions can affect another person. Tana French doesn't get preachy, but she does explore how seemingly insignificant actions can snowball into tragic events. I fully agree with that idea, and applaud her efforts to inform us via a good story. And yet still, the book drags on a bit too long.Don't get me wrong, French is an excellent storyteller. Her writing and details are focused and clever. This just feels like the publishers told her to take it from, say, 350 pages to 500 to give readers ""more."" There is too much ""navel gazing"" (aka pondering of a partial-amnesiac). ""Did I do it?"" ""Could I really have done it?"" These aren't spoilers ... it's pretty obvious that we're going to find out one of family members is the guilty party.

Both readings were for a book club, which is ideal because this is definitely a book that needs/deserves serious discussion. In short, though, my opinion hasn't really changed: A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY is one of my favorite ""really boring"" books. A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY is the story of two childhood friends growing up in Gravesend, New Hampshire, in the 1950s and '60s. The narrator, Johnny Wheelwright, is the illegitimate son of a single mother. (One of the driving questions of the novel is who is his father?) Johnny's best friend is Owen Meany, the only child of the town's quarry owner. Owen Meany is one of the most unique and memorable literary characters of all time. He is tiny his entire life and his voice is like ""a permanent scream."" Not only that, Owen knows things, he is never wrong, and he is very smart. In the summer of '52, the eleven year old boys were playing Little League baseball. Owen's first and only hit struck Johnny's mother in the head and killed her. Because of that moment and several others, Owen Meany believes he is is an Instrument of God. He thinks he was destined to kill her. He thinks everything about him and everything he has done or will do is preordained by God, including his size and his voice. His life quest is to find out why.With that premise (what if a young boy never grew up?—not in the Peter Pan way; in the never went through puberty way), John Irving created a story about WHY that might be. Though Irving states he is not overly religious, this novel is centered around religion, specifically the various differences between the Christian religions. A major point of discussion for this story is: Is a person's life predetermined? Or can a person's thoughts turn their life into a self-fulfilling prophecy? Or is this just a fictional manipulation because everything that happens in the world is random?My paperback copy of this book clocks in at 629 pages, plus the PS. pages of interviews and observations of the author. It FEELS like a bible in my hands. I can't help but believe Irving made the story intentionally long to give it that feeling! John Wheelwright, who narrates the story nearly twenty years after the death of Owen Meany (not a spoiler!), introduces us to nearly every person in the town of Gravesend, NH, or so it seems. I truly don't know why, other than to drag out the story for added emphasis of the final, dramatic pages. There is a lot to like about this book; there is also a lot to not like, eg. Irving's overuse of the semicolon and the exclamation mark! Every word that Owen Meany speaks is written in ALL CAPS. That would be extremely annoying if it weren't a necessary reminder of his high-pitched ""wrecked"" voice. My biggest struggle with this story is that Johnny Wheelwright never struggles, not even for a second, with anger or resentment toward Owen for killing his mother! That seems implausible to me.The second reading of A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY doesn't hold the same gravitas as the first reading did, but it allows the reader to focus on numerous finer points of the story. It's still a very good boring book.FOUR screaming STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Sep 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13504494-a-prayer-for-owen-meany

Because Updike won TWO Pulitzer Prizes for his ""Rabbit"" series (one for RABBIT IS RICH, and the second for RABBIT AT REST), I thought I would invest my time in the series of four books. I read the first one, RABBIT, RUN, to learn who is who and what is what. Meh. I skipped the second one, RABBIT REDUX, because the summary didn't entice me enough. Now this: RABBIT IS RICH. When I finished this book—astounded it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982, beating out Marilynn Robinson's HOUSEKEEPING—I literally googled the Pulitzer committee, looking to see who thought this book deserved such an esteemed prize. (It also won the National Book award, so clearly I'm the one who's the idiot, right? Either that or times have changed ...) It came as no surprise to me that the committee consisted of 15 men (13 who appear to be white, two appear to be minorities) and two white women. If Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom, the protagonist, is a ""typical"" male, which is essentially how the entire series is pitched, then the ""typical male"" is a low-life, sex-crazed, egomaniacal, disgusting Homosapien. I'm more surprised that the Pulitzer committee not only acknowledged how ""typical"" men think, but they lauded it. In RABBIT IS RICH, Harry is now forty-something and has inherited a third of his late father-in-law's Toyota dealership, along with his wife and his mother-in-law. He is unforgiving and unloving to his son (despite the fact Harry and his wife Janice lost a baby girl in RABBIT, RUN). He lusts after every young female who comes into his view. He stays with his wife, though wishes she did more to please him. He is racist and judgmental and not terribly bright. Money and sex, sex and money, that's what Harry Angstrom cares about. When, near the end of the book, Harry is told that one of his former girlfriends had to have a mastectomy, his first thought is: """"My God."" Breast he had sucked."" If I end up reading RABBIT AT REST, which I unfortunately already purchased, it will be only to hope that Harry Angstrom gets his comeuppance.

The author/characters refer to ""the accident"" and ""what happened at Bennington"" so many times I groaned out loud. The story is of Alice and Lucy, roommates at Bennington College in Vermont in the early 1950s. They develop a close, almost obsessive relationship. When Alice, an orphan with a lot of baggage, meets Tom, a boy from a nearby university, things start to go eerily wrong. The accident happens, Lucy disappears, and Alice drops out of school.Told in alternating points-of-view, first Alice, then Lucy, etc., the book opens (after a dark Prologue) years later with Alice married to John and living in Tangier. Who turns up on her doorstep? None other than Lucy, the suspicious roommate she left behind. They become reacquainted and share bits and pieces of their history. It's not until Part 2, the second half of the book, that this book lives up to its hype. Think Hitchcock all the way to the devastating end.

Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT is certainly one of those books. I chose this book for my book club, which means I also did some research on Fyodor Dostoevsky himself. That research added a significant layer to the story and illuminated many scenes and emotions in the book which were drawn directly from Dostoevsky's life. Most directly, in my opinion, was that FD wrote this book while simultaneously writing another book under dire pressure from a crooked publisher. Perhaps that explains why C&P is filled with adverbs and exclamation points.CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, as most people know, is a novel in six parts about Raskolnikov, a bright young man who has a theory about ordinary and extraordinary people; the extraordinary are able or allowed to do whatever the hell they want, including murder, pillage, and seize land and property. Napoleon, for example, was an extraordinary person according to this theory. When Raskolnikov hits dire straits, he decides to murder an evil old female pawnbroker (and incidentally her innocent sister who walks in at the wrong moment). But much to Raskolnikov's surprise, he is not the extraordinary man he thought he was, and therefore the murders nearly drive him mad because he has a conscience. (A truly extraordinary man would have gone on to kill more people and spend their money until he had acquired great wealth and power.) What follows is Raskolnikov's journey through torment to redemption. [Sorry, but I don't think spoiler alerts apply to a book that's 150 years old. Besides, you learn all that by reading the back cover.]I am fascinated by how guilt, and sometimes lack thereof, weighs on a person. I had wanted to read this book for years for Dostoevsky's insight on the psychology of a criminal. He was highly regarded during his lifetime—and still is—for his keen understanding of humanity under the pressures of poverty, society, and the political atmosphere in 19th century Russia. Two topics were the focus of my book club discussion. First, religion. Dostoevsky was an extremely pious Orthodox Christian. He, more so than his peers, saw Christ as the answer to redemption and the evils of the world. Second was his portrayal of women in this novel. The men in C&P range from hideous (Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov, Raskolnikov's sister's boss) to the kind and hard-working Razumikhin, Raskolnikov's only friend. But the women are almost without exception well-meaning, hard-suffering, supportive and caring people. They—specifically Raskolnikov's mother, sister, and Sonya, the woman he falls in love with—take care of the men in their lives despite their despicable behaviors. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT was a much easier read than I expected it to be. I read the 1992 translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, which is arguably the most accurate translation, and the 550 pages read very quickly, aside from the aforementioned overuse of adverbs and exclamation points which I can forgive in light of the overall brilliance of this book.FIVE rewarding STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 17, 2019","Apr 06, 2019","Jun 21, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28348.Crime_and_Punishment

It's no more about wolves than TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is about mockingbirds. In other words, it helps the reader find the theme, but doesn't give us a hint to what the story is about. Oddly, ultimately, the novel seems to be a vehicle in which to bash Christian Scientists. Linda (aka Mattie), the fifteen-year-old protagonist in History of Wolves, is the daughter of ""hippies,"" just trying to find her place in the world. They live in a remote house on a remote lake in a remote region of Minnesota. Then a young family moves in across the lake, and soon Linda starts babysitting their young son, Paul. Told as a reflection after the young, Christian Science parents were tried for the death of their son (we learn this in the first paragraph), Linda attempts to piece together her role in the boy's death, and also why people do what they do. The motto of Christian Scientists, ""It's not what you do but what you think that matters,"" becomes her jumping off point from which she develops her own motto: ""It's not what you think but what you do that matters."" Because she did nothing (or not enough) to save Paul, she struggles with what kind of a person she is deep inside. Mostly we learn she is a girl starved for love.Although I didn't love this book, it made for a good book club discussion. I think Emily Fridlund has a lot of potential, though I hope her next book is more creative story and less a diatribe against the evils of a specific religion (because, this is America and we do have that whole ""freedom of religion"" thing going for us).THREE curious STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 26, 2020","Feb 03, 2020","Jun 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30183198-history-of-wolves

I fully agree with the comparisons to GONE GIRL and GIRL ON A TRAIN, which is to say that it's a gripping female-oriented mystery. After many years as an accomplished journalist in the UK, it seems Barton decided to turn her investigative journalism into a fictional story. Gene Taylor, the title character in this novel, is the young, submissive wife (now widow) of Glen Taylor who died just before the story opens. Reporter Kate Waters wrangles the first interview with ""Genie"" who is newsworthy because Glen, a known pedophile (we learn through interviews and subsequent flashbacks), was acquitted for the kidnapping and possible murder of two-year-old Bella Elliott years ago. The haunting case was never solved. Now that Glen is dead, the reporters and detectives are hoping Genie will tell all. The little girl's grieving mother—and the entire UK—still want to find her. Over the course of the book, we begin to wonder if mousy Genie Taylor has a darker side—and possibly a hand in the girl's disappearance. This book came HIGHLY recommended to me as UNPUTDOWNABLE. That usually ruins a book for me. For the ""average"" reader, or someone who just wants to get lost in a good story, this is a great recommendation. Taking a more critical look, the POV jumps all over the place. Told with alternating POV chapters (the widow, the detective, the reporter, etc.) and a jumbled timeline, the story unfolds well, but Barton does not stick to her chosen POV. Even when we think she's in the head of the detective, for instance, Barton tells us what his partner is thinking.

As soon as I finished it the first time, I started it again, partly because it was so moving, partly because the format and style require it. And partly because at 177 pages with a lot of white space, it's doable. DEPT. OF SPECULATION, the second novel of Jenny Offill, reads almost like a poem—think stanzas instead of paragraphs— as opposed to a flowing narrative. The storyline isn't unique, even according to the author in an interview. It took her more than a dozen years to write this book because she was hesitant to tell the tired story of a tired mother and cheating husband. In a literary sense, this book is the result of ""necessity is the mother of invention."" How can I tell this story in a new way? she asked herself. In fighting against ""standard,"" she lifted her book to ""shimmering,"" ""smashing,"" ""startling,"" ""sparkling,"" and several other blurbed adjectives that don't begin with the letter s. DEPT. OF SPECULATION is a precious, heartrending story of a woman who is struggling with life's challenges. Offill's style is brilliant. Leonard Elmore would give her a standing ovation: It's like she wrote a long novel and took out the parts people normally skip anyway. For example, Offill gives us a paragraph about ""the wife"" and ""the husband"" (most of the characters are unnamed), followed by a seemingly random fact from science or literature or history. At first, I thought, What??? Soon I realized the ""random"" parts aren't random at all. We readers actually have to use our brains to connect the dots. I really really liked this book.

Wharton, in 1921, was the first woman to win the prize for fiction. For that reason alone, I would like to give this book Five Stars, unfortunately, I don't think it rises to the level of greatness of earlier novels by women like MIDDLEMARCH and JANE EYRE (both written before the first Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded in 1918).THE AGE OF INNOCENCE takes place in New York City in the late 1800s. It was fascinating to hear about New York City at the time, how so few houses were above 14th Street, the early days of the Metropolitan Museum, and other tidbits like restaurants, clothing, transportation, the opera, etc. However I struggled to stay interested in the storyline—how Newland Archer felt torn between his fiancée/wife May Welland, and her cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, who returns to NYC after leaving her husband, a Polish Count. Archer and Ellen were friends as children, and when they meet again as adults, Archer becomes frantic to marry May Welland before he can get himself in trouble with Ellen, who wants to divorce the Count.  In the late 1800s, her divorce would have brought shame on their entire family. In essence, the story is a love triangle. Will he or won't he leave his wife for her cousin? Perhaps with a second reading I would pick up more subplots and more themes behind the story, but I highly doubt I will ever re-read this book. In fairness, I listened to the audio version, narrated by Lorna Raver. I did not like her reading, so that might have affected my feelings about this book.

Told from the perspective of thirteen-year-old Frank Drum, a preacher's son, ORDINARY GRACE is part mystery/part bildungsroman. In the hot summer of 1961, four people die in the Drums' tiny town of New Bremen, Minnesota, one by natural causes, one by accident, one suicide, and one murder—starting with the death of a young boy on the forbidden railroad tracks. Soon another body is found. Then we get the heavy foreshadowing line: ""And the next [death] would be the most painful to bear."" My thought, as I was reading, was that maybe the accident wasn't an accident, the death by natural causes wasn't natural, etc. If Krueger had done it my way, I might have given the book five stars. It turned out to be pretty straightforward. By making the narrator the son of the town preacher, Frank is privy to a lot of ""insider information,"" though too often the kid is eavesdropping and downright spying on the adults. I'm sure some boys would behave exactly as Frank does, but it felt like more of a literary technique to keep the narrative in the first person POV. This also gives Krueger the opportunity to speak about God, but not too heavily. The passages about ""Is there a God or isn't there?"" seemed true to character, not forced by the author.This is the first book I've read by William K. Krueger, and I really liked it. It will be easy to recommend. The writing is evocative though occasionally inches ever near purple prose. It starts out strong, then gets a tad tedious, but by half-way through, I couldn't put it down.

A former advertising copywriter, Moriarty wrote THE LAST ANNIVERSARY, in the early 2000s. It was her second novel. Now known as the author of THE HUSBAND'S SECRET and BIG LITTLE LIES, the book that became an HBO series, Moriarty creates complicated, believable characters—they're just like us! Her plots are original, too, or at least fresh.THE LAST ANNIVERSARY is a bit complicated, which is my biggest knock on this novel. Plus there are a lot of characters. In other words, this story was entertaining but hard to follow. I had to get a piece of paper and draw a family tree just to keep the players straight. So there's a small island, named Scribbly Gum Island, off the Australian coast near Sydney (Moriarty's hometown), accessible only by boat. The island belongs to the extended family of Connie Doughty. In 1932, 19-year-old Connie rents a house on the island to Alice and Jack Munro to help pay her family's bills. The Munros have a baby girl. One day, the Munros invite Connie and her younger sister Rose over for tea. When the girls arrive, they discover the baby alone, in a bassinet in the kitchen, but Alice and Jack are gone. The tea kettle is boiling, the bread is still warm, and there is blood on the floor. Soon Connie and Rose are giving interviews and tours of the house. It turns into ""The Munro Baby Mystery, one of the great unsolved mysteries of the twentieth century in Australia."" The family becomes famous and improbably rich.Now jump to the present. Connie has passed away and left her home on Scribbly Gum Island to Sophie Honeywell. Sophie dated Connie's grandson Thomas for one year, then jilted him just as he was about to propose. However, when eightysomething Connie met Sophie, she adored the girl. Sophie reminded Connie of her deceased husband because of her dimples and enthusiasm for life and Scribbly Gum Island. But Sophie hasn't seen Thomas or been to the island in over three years, so this surprises everyone. Sophie meets up with Thomas (who is now married to someone else and father of a baby girl) and learns she has inherited Connie's house which brings her back into the mix of the wealthy, screwed up family. Chaos ensues.See what I mean about complex/complicated/confusing? Add to that, we realize along the way that much of what we've read so far (see above) isn't even true. Figuring out what IS true is what keeps the reader turning the page. The story is fun and lighthearted even as we (and certain family members) begin to wonder if Connie and Rose murder the Munros themselves and kept the baby.I enjoyed this book, but I am happy to know that Moriarty grew as a writer and learned to hone her plots and casts of characters down to a manageable level. I very much enjoyed her later novel THE HUSBAND'S SECRET. This book also reiterates my theory: Novels are like photographs: some are very pretty, but most people like the ones with people they know in them. A writer who can create true-to-life characters can sell a book.Three Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 06, 2018","Mar 15, 2018","Mar 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1282954.The_Last_Anniversary

THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, a 1961 novel by Muriel Spark, is on many Top 100 Novels lists. I've heard reference to it by multiple writing teachers, and it's short, so I thought I would give it a go. How this book has withstood the test of time is beyond me. Maybe it was really something in 1961, but it should have dropped off the list long ago, IMHO.Miss Jean Brodie, a woman in the ""prime"" of her life, is a fascist grade school teacher at a proper girls school in Scotland in the late 1930s. Miss Brodie has chosen six girls (who show promise) to guide in an education of the world. She feels she can teach these girls more about Life and the World—and make them the ""crème de la crème""—if she avoids the textbooks and instead tells the girls about what she has seen and whom she has loved. She says often, ""Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life."" Indeed, as the girls grow up, they remain ""the Brodie set,"" and tend to behave in the self-centered way Miss Brodie taught them until we learn (in a flash forward) that one of the girls has betrayed her by telling her secrets to the headmistress who has been trying to fire her for years for loose morals. Jean Brodie, who was modeled after one of Spark's own teachers, is in a love triangle with two male teachers from the school. She's in with love the married art teacher, but has an affair with the short-legged music teacher because he is single. But then later, when the girls are seventeen, Miss Brodie encourages one of her girls to sleep with the married Catholic teacher while his wife and six kids are away for the summer. It's bizarre.Muriel Spark wrote the book about twenty-five years after the time period in which the story takes place. I assume she was trying to jovially illustrate how some people fell for Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco. That's fine and interesting, in a way. But what turned me off so much about this book is the jumbled timeline (the novel is well-known for its flash forwards) and the repetition. Either Miss Brodie or someone else mentions that she, Miss Brodie, is in her ""prime"" over fifty times! This woman is an insufferable narcissist. In fact, almost every adjective and point that Spark is trying to illustrate is repeated ad nauseam. Even though the book is short, I could barely slog through the story.Two Boring Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 27, 2018","Mar 02, 2018","Feb 07, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36315686-the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie

I was so pleasantly surprised by this book, and I have recommended it to dozens of people already. This is my first time to read anything by Quinn. She writes primarily non-fiction, which is how she came upon a real-life female spy from WWI who went by the code name Alice Dubois. With further research, Quinn knew she had to tell this woman’s story, but not via non-fiction; she took some historical people, places, and events, then created fictional “friends” and a plot, and wrote this unputdownable novel. The story begins in 1947 with a 17-year-old American girl named Charlotte (Charlie) St. Clair who arrives in London with her French mother. They are on their way to Switzerland to take care of Charlie’s “little problem.” But Charlie is more distressed by the disappearance of her French cousin Rose. Charlie runs away from her mother in order to chase down the only clue she has about her missing cousin who is presumed dead from events surrounding WWII. This clue leads her to the home of Eve Gardiner, an angry, damaged woman who may or may not know something about Rose. The chapters then alternate between Charlie’s story in 1947 to Eve’s story in 1915. It turns out, Eve was a spy in the Alice Network in WWI. Eventually the two stories converge.The Alice Network does not shy away from the realities of war. In other words, Quinn does not gloss over the factual, real horrors that happened to both militants and civilians during the wars. Some chapters are very difficult to read.

The fact that I had never read Jane Austen grew to be my big literary secret over the past ten years—the years I've called myself a writer. But I was not an English major in college and somehow Jane Austen's books escaped my notice. They are long and detailed and well, old, and I always had newer, more exciting books to read. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen's first novel, published in 1811, came well before George Eliot's MIDDLEMARCH, and Charlotte Brontë's JANE EYRE, both of which I've read and loved. In that context, S&S must be regarded as brilliant. The characters were detailed and delightful or dastardly, and the plot was realistic if somewhat convoluted. Plus, the idea that ""women did not write novels"" in the early 1800s adds to the celebration and importance of this book.That being said, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY did not rise to one of my favorites. I feel like every one of these nineteenth century British Literature classics could be renamed MONEY AND MORES, I and II and III, etc. Obviously, money and mores (or manners, perhaps) were vital—a woman's reality—but it gets so tedious and disappointing to hear everyone talk about a person's wealth to determine whether or not they are worthy of marriage.

I would like to watch a movie version of this book now (I've held off in order to read it first). I'm sure it's a farce with a mostly happy ending. Austen used so many pronouns that I was often confused about who was saying what to whom. So, yes, I'm happy to have read it, but it didn't change my life.

Guilty as charged! When I described bits and pieces of DEEP WORK, by Cal Newport, to my friend, she teased me about skimming a book called DEEP WORK. Guilty as charged! This intense book outlines Newport's extensive plan for most working adults in the 21st century to reach their highest level of productivity and creativity. It's not a simple process. As a writer with ADHD, I thought this book would be very beneficial to me. Unfortunately, according to Cal Newport, my best plan would be to move to an isolated cabin for weeks, if not months, at a time. That sounds like a dream to me (I'm an introvert) but my husband would not be very happy if I did, nor would my dog, my kids, my friends, or parents. I would probably miss them as well. Newport also wants everyone who cares about reaching this deep state to quit social media. Completely. Could I cut back on social media? Absolutely. But there are benefits to social media from a writer's perspective, not to mention it saves me time, in a way; it's easier to keep up with distant friends and family via Facebook, for instance, than it is to call or write everyone letters. In other words, Newport's advice simply isn't practical for me. He says in his Conclusion, that his ""year of extreme depth was perhaps a bit too extreme ..."" Even he will ""moderate this intensity"" going forward. Imagine how the rest of us feel.Newport does give us a multitude of baby steps we can use to help on a stay-at-home basis which I found useful. For example, he advises reframing the work/break pattern. Instead of dragging yourself away from television or social media to work, he advises getting straight to work, and then scheduling breaks for your distractions—almost like recess at school. You can set breaks every hour or twice a day ... whatever works for you. That is doable.There is a lot more to this book but I can't elaborate, because I indeed skimmed most of it. It is highly acclaimed as one of the top business books of 2016. Just be prepared to take his advice with a grain of salt.

TENTH OF DECEMBER, by George Saunders did the same, but I loved that book. This one I just admire. The similarity is the brilliant, creative, quirky, probing writing. The difference is the subject matter. Most of July's stories seem near-autobiographical while Saunders' stories are broader, more universal.Published in 2007, NO ONE BELONGS HERE MORE THAN YOU is a collection of 16 short stories, mostly about a young, bisexual girl's tales of discovery. Who am I? What should I be when I grow up? What is sex, what is love? Most of the stories are on the spectrum of quirky—>strange—>freaky—>bizarre. Some are funny, others sad. All are imaginative, powerful and fresh, about survival and growth, including picking oneself up after failure and moving on, somehow. I am not familiar with July's other work, but her writing has a way of mining for deep, deep emotions and translating them into words (much easier said than done). Her ability to find a character's POV is fantastic; they, the confused characters, often speak or think in hyperbole, as a broken-hearted teenager would, for instance. I underlined and starred dozens of lines, even entire paragraphs, in this book, but each story is so unique that pulling out random lines as examples would be like showing you a snippet of just Mona Lisa's mouth; beautiful, sure, but powerless compared to the whole painting. The title (which is not the title of any of the stories) seems like an answer to the questions the characters ask: Who am I? Am I lovable? Do I fit in? And July's answer is Yes, you do. You are good enough. You are good. No one belongs here more than you.Four Probing Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2018,"Jan 06, 2018","Jan 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/113429.No_One_Belongs_Here_More_Than_You

Ward delves so deeply into each character's POV, and the writing is so evocative, that the pace is much slower than most contemporary novels. Perhaps I should have expected that from a title with not one, but two commas. Regardless, I found myself easily distracted.SING, UNBURIED, SING is the story of Leonie, a Black woman in Mississippi, who takes her two biracial children and a friend on a road trip to pick up Leonie's White boyfriend (the father of her children) when he is released from prison. It is told in the alternating voices of Leonie; her thirteen-year-old son, Jojo; and one other character they meet at the prison. Leonie is ... not a good mother. She's a drug addict. Fortunately for the children, they all live with Leonie's parents, Pop and Mam. Pop, though also an ex-con, is a wise and loving grandfather. Mam is dying of cancer. (Yes, it's a difficult story.) Many members of the family are able to hear animals and also the ""unburied"" souls of people who have passed. One of the blurbs describes this as a ""road novel turned on its head."" I'm not sure what that means, but the plot is vague. After the family returns from the disastrous trip of picking the father up from prison, the plot centers around Richie, the character they met along the way. His mission becomes the plot, until that is concluded, and then it's about Mam. This isn't a knock, per se, because Ward makes us care about each character so much that we want to know how everyone is doing, but it makes the story seem longer than 285 pages.When I finished this story, I wrote down three words: devastated, exhausted, awed.

Both stories are about dysfunctional families (is that redundant?) in Ohio. Both are set in the near past, this one in the 1990s. Communication, or lack thereof, amongst family members is a strong theme, as well as race relations. In both books, there is also a hint of mystery. However, Ng's first novel is definitely the better book.LITTLE FIRES EVERYWHERE is primarily the story of Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl who rent a home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, from the ""perfect"" family of Elena and John Richardson and their four children. Mia, an artist, and her daughter have traveled from city to city across the country so that Mia can continually find new inspiration for her photography. But the more Pearl embeds herself in the Richardson family, the more suspicious Elena Richardson becomes about the secrets in Mia's past. Ng is very good at creating characters, and her writing is clean and solid. However, Little Fires Everywhere lacks the focus of Everything I Never Told You. There is too much backstory, too many subplots, and way too many coincidences. What Elena uncovers about Mia links directly to the hottest news story of the year in Shaker Heights, which all began to unravel when a class trip leads the Richardson kids to the museum where they spot a twelve-year-old photograph of young Mia holding baby Pearl. Plus, Elena just happens to be a journalist who knows how to dig up dirt, and her husband happens to be an attorney who takes the big case in the headlines, and Mia happens to work at the restaurant where ... You get the picture.Ng's two novels are so similar, it makes me wonder if her publisher asked for her new novel to be in the same vein as her first novel. Or maybe Ng didn't feel she said all she needed to say about dysfunctional families in her first book. Regardless, Little Fires Everywhere feels derivative.

It carries much more gravitas than the cover and title lead one to believe. Yes, the story is about a single thirty-year-old from the UK. Yes, she pines over a handsome man way out of her league. Yes, they use an adverb IN THE TITLE. But, it is not a reboot of the Bridget Jones series, nor is it fan-fiction of Fredrik Backman's books, regardless of the similarities therein.Eleanor Oliphant is a flawed character, inside and out. We find out around page 25 that she has scars on her face, but it takes a while until we learn how she became disfigured. Honeyman does an excellent job of sprinkling hints about her past through the story until the chapter where it all breaks loose. Eleanor is awkward, antisocial, and troubled, yet she is educated, hardworking, and self-sufficient. She works in accounts at a graphic design firm and has no friends and no family. She works, eats, drinks, and drinks some more (to squelch her inner demons), then falls asleep and starts over the next day. One day she is befriended by a scruffy coworker named Raymond. They see an elderly man collapse on a sidewalk, and rush to his rescue. Through their interactions with this man and his family, Eleanor and Raymond start spending a lot of time together. Raymond is compassionate enough to draw out her story and set her on a path toward healing—because the reason she is scarred is a tragedy that she has suppressed. Meanwhile, Eleanor has developed a mad crush on a young rock star. In her efforts to garner his attention, she begins to take better care of herself, which helps others to see her differently.ELEANOR OLIPHANT IS COMPLETELY FINE has many laugh out loud moments, many heart-wrenching moments, and ultimately ... well, I won't say how it ends.

Soon after he is elected, a horrific anti-Semitic wave takes over the country, forcing Jews to relocate, and causing riots that kill hundreds of innocent Americans, who happen to be Jewish. The story line is eerily similar, if you substitute ""Muslim"" for ""Jewish,"" to current events in 2018, and that's what makes the premise of this novel so frightening.

Jende came to America in 2007 to pursue the American dream, and got a job as a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers—the year before Lehman (and so many other financial institutions) went bankrupt. As a driver for Clark Edwards, his wife Cindy, their sons Vince and Mighty, Jende is witness to the family's private life.

Ivy Pochoda's previous novel, VISITATION STREET, a book I loved, told the story of disadvantaged girls in Brooklyn, while this book tells about disadvantaged people in Southern California.

Though it begins in traffic on an L.A. freeway and spends a little time on Skid Row, most of the stories takes place in the desert outside Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. When I think L.A, I think palm trees, Hollywood, the Hills, the ocean, etc., etc. This novel is not about the good life.WONDER VALLEY asks several questions: What defines a person? Are we each the sum of our experiences and what has happened to us? Can we overcome our past (mistakes) and escape our demons? Do our circumstances define us? How do some people come to terms with their past while others feel tortured by their mistakes for life? Can people atone for their mistakes if their mistakes include murder?I wanted to like this book more than I did. Maybe my expectations were high because of VISITATION STREET. In the end, I couldn't relate to the characters—thank goodness, I suppose, because we are talking Skid Row here. I also felt like the jumps between 2006 and 2010 added unnecessary confusion.

Published in 1847, JANE EYRE is the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan raised by an aunt who virtually hates her. After being abused by her aunt and cousins, she is sent (gratefully) to a school for girls. From there she becomes a teacher, then a governess, and eventually meets Mr. Rochester. What I love about Jane is that her character is so solid in who she is and what she believes in and stands for. She is sure of herself, even when compromising her principles would lead her straight to the altar with the man she loves. Jane is smart, well-spoken, and bold. Interestingly, she is not pretty, and basically every character in the novel comments on her looks. Neither is Mr. Rochester known to be a handsome man, though he, too, is a man who holds tight to his principles (in all but one instance, i.e. asking Jane to marry him). Let’s just say he has a few skeletons in his closet.Though I loved this story, I have to deduct half a star because there are too many very convenient happenings. When Jane runs from the altar, for example, she ends up at ... her cousins' house, cousins she'd never met before. If Ms. Brontë had just said she was searching for them and finally, finally found them, I would have liked this completely.

Langdon and a stunningly beautiful, sensitive, intelligent woman must save the day—because I do think the entire story takes place in less than 24 hours. Brown is a master at not giving his protagonist what he wants until the very last scene, which is what keeps readers turning the pages. In my humble opinion, if Dan Brown had a better editor, I could like his work much more. ""Stop with the italics,"" someone should tell him. ""Langdon doesn't need to have seen EVERY WONDERFUL THING before. Let him discover an occasional marvel along with your readers."" ""Quit reminding people he has an 'eidetic' memory."" Brown name-drops many artists, architects, authors, paintings, books, buildings, historical figures, etcetera, etcetera, and says in the opening pages that all of these are ""real."" It's almost like he's trying to justify his travel expenses for his accountant and the IRS. Anyway, I like art, architecture, traveling, and history, so I enjoyed the references, but I can see how others might skim right over names and places as boring filler. The book seems overly long, but I imagine he’s contractually bound to turn out 150,000-word books.Brown has an interesting message in this book, his own idea (I hope and assume), about where we are going as a human race. I'm not sure I disagree with him, although I hope his timeline is off by a few decades. I liked this story, I just don’t think Dan Brown is a very good writer.Three (and a half) original-if-not-eloquent Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 06, 2017","Oct 12, 2017","Oct 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32283133-origin

IN A DARK, DARK WOOD, the debut novel of Ruth Ware, did just that. IN A DARK, DARK WOOD is the story of Nora (aka Lenora, Lee, and Leo at different stages of her life) who is invited to a bachelorette party at another friend's house in a secluded wooded area. Nora doesn't know why Clare, the bride and her former best friend, even invited her (they haven't spoken in ten years), but a mutual friend talked her into going. Another friend, Flo, Clare's current BFF, is hosting the party. She is ""Single White Female"" creepy. The girls and one gay male hang around the house, drink copious amounts of alcohol, play games and do a Ouiji board. With no cell service, no landline, and mysterious footprints in freshly fallen snow, the mood quickly becomes dark. Then an intruder breaks in in the middle of the dark, dark night. Bad things happen. Nora wakes up in the hospital with no memory of how she got there or where everyone else is. She over hears cops in the hallway say the word ""murder,"" but they won't tell her who's dead. Nora flees the hospital and fights to fill in the missing hours before she is arrested as the killer.Ruth Ware does an excellent job of setting the mood for her stories (I recently finished her second book THE WOMAN IN CABIN 10). Her dialogue is realistic, character development is spot-on, and the book is well-written. My only knock on this one is Nora is a tad whiny. She wonders why the hell she even went to this bachelorette party so many times it became annoying.

And if it's a mystery, like THE WOMAN IN CABIN 10, you're probably hoping the ending is logical, but one you didn't guess along the way, right? THE WOMAN IN CABIN 10, by Ruth Ware, reminded me of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, by the great Agatha Christie. While the latter took place on an island with only 10 characters, this novel takes place on a high-end (read small) cruise ship with only 10 rooms. Though the cast of characters is a bit larger (and a tad confusing), the self-contained mystery held the same a-murderer-is-among-us creepiness. Ware gave us just enough red herrings to cast doubt on many players.In this book, Laura (Lo) Blacklock, a British travel writer, is booked to take the maiden voyage of the Aurora Borealis, a Norwegian-based ship. Lo is a troubled (sympathetic) character from page one. On her first night on the ship, she hears a scream and a splash, certain someone (the woman in the cabin next to hers) has been thrown overboard. Yet no one is missing. Because of her troubled past, Lo won't let this mystery die (no pun intended). She pushes and pushes and pushes, until, duh, she pushes too far and the killer has to shut her up. Ware skillfully makes life more and more miserable and desperate for Lo—which makes the book more and more of a page turner. I could barely put the book down for the last 100 pages. All of my guesses along the way of who actually died, and who actually killed that person were wrong. Even the very final pages had a twist I didn't see coming. Now isn't that what you hope to hear about a novel? It's not going to win the Pulitzer, but it is a very well-written, engaging mystery.Five Creepy Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 20, 2017","Sep 26, 2017","Sep 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28187230-the-woman-in-cabin-10

Originally written by Camus in French in 1942, the edition I read was translated by Matthew Ward in 1988. The Stranger is a strange story about a young, disenfranchised Frenchman named Meursault living and working in Algiers, then under French rule. The story opens with the famous line: ""Maman died today."" Meursault travels to his mother's funeral (she's been living in a ""home,"") then returns to his lonely apartment. His life spirals momentarily up, then quickly downward. Meursault seems to lack all emotion, or at least, basic human empathy. He simply doesn't seem to have a heart. Then he kills someone. (I don't consider it a spoiler if the book is 75 years old.) In Part II of this book, Meursault goes to jail and awaits trial, and potentially a beheading. There we see a glimpse of his soul—or lack thereof.I have no doubt this book deserves Five Stars, but the story is so bizarre (because the protagonist is so cold and withdrawn) that I would need to read it at least once more before I fully understood it. I'm not even sure if ""The Stranger"" is Meursault himself or the man he killed. This is a book that begs for discussion.

His use of verb tense (past, then present, then future) and POV (first, then third, then second) are astounding. Scenes flowed through time like fairies through a forest. My vocabulary improved because of this book, as well as my knowledge of history, specifically the Vietnam War. Nguyen's perspective and ability to tell this story is probably unique; I can't imagine anyone else telling this story as well as he did. But what is this story really about? War is the backdrop; the story, I believe, is about identity. Who are we? Paraphrasing a late passage: Who we see in the mirror is not the same person as how others view us. We often deceive ourselves, forgive our own flaws, rationalize our behaviors; most of us live with cognitive dissonance, somehow splitting our personalities and justifying conflicting beliefs. (Ever known anyone who's had an affair? Exactly.) Given those questions, who are we really? And what happens when we change, grow? What happens when the child becomes the adult, the student becomes the teacher, the revolutionary becomes the ruler? Who among us hasn't said, If I were in charge, I would do it differently, only to ""become our parents"" or instill stupid rules for others because in reality, rules are necessary. THE SYMPATHIZER is challenging, intellectually and emotionally. It is difficult to get into, and takes a commitment to pick it up—not because it's heavy, because there is so little white space. It clocks in at 382 pages (paperback version), but Nguyen and/or his editors chose to NOT separate out most of the dialogue. If printed in classical format, it would have easily topped 500 pages. Many of the scenes (of war and interrogation at their worst) are horrifying and difficult to read. But they're real, or so I believe. There are also beautiful scenes—or at least sentences—that made me laugh, and made me underline/star/dog-ear as ""universal truths"" or ""incredible writing."" This book is dense, but important.

Gyasi weaves a narrative from the POV of one member of each generation (think: sixteen linked short stories), culminating with two long-distant cousins meeting each other in the year 2000 in California. No easy feat! Gyasi is an excellent storyteller. Her writing is evocative, and the stories are gut-wrenching. As you can imagine, this is not an easy book to read. Gyasi doesn't gloss over the realities of slavery, tribalism, superstition, drug abuse, abandonment, death, or prejudice. I found the book to be very heavy, though others in my book club saw hope emerge, especially in the final pages. Beyond the harsh realities of what each character endured, it was difficult to keep the characters straight. If not for the character chart at the beginning of the book, I would have probably cast it aside because I wouldn't have been able to follow both sides of the family.

It's a Western,NEWS OF THE WORLD, a novel by Paulette Jiles, is one of those book club books I never would have read on my own, but I am happy I did. It's a Western, set in Texas in 1870-71, and tells the story of Captain Jefferson Kidd, a septuagenarian who is hired to return a little girl to her relatives. She had been captured four years previously by Indians who killed and mutilated her parents and sister. As expected, the girl is troubled. The unlikely pair start out in north-central Texas and follow winding, rutted trails south to San Antonio where her aunt and uncle are said to live. The road is treacherous at best. They must be on constant guard for cowboys, Indians, even crooked US Government troops, during a time when citizens were not allowed (legally) to carry handguns or powerful rifles. Along the way they stop in towns so Captain Kidd can read the newspapers to the townspeople to earn money. The book is only 209 pages, and I wish it would have been longer. I enjoyed the characters so much that I wanted to ride along with them for more adventures. They develop a grandfather/granddaughter relationship, and he tries to teach her English, manners, and civilized customs (like sleeping indoors). Captain Kidd is a cranky and rather sad man after losing his wife and being trapped on the opposite side of the Mississippi from his children. Escorting this little girl, Johanna, gives the man purpose. She teaches him a few things, too, including how to love again. By the time they arrive at the home of her aunt and uncle, he is heartbroken to leave her. I was eager to keep reading to see how it would end. Jiles makes some interesting style choices in this book, e.g. no quotation marks. I can almost appreciate why (she wants us to be disoriented like the girl, I assume), but I found it rather annoying.

It's the tale of Harry Fukuhara and his brothers who fought against each other in WWII. Harry's parents, a Japanese couple who immigrated to Washington State in the 1920s, had five children in America (four boys and one girl). The children were American citizens, and for years, the the family was free to travel back and forth to Japan by ship. Until Pearl Harbor.

It's obvious she tried to make the story exciting, but there were way too many details and facts included in the book to make it exciting to me. I found it positively boring. In my opinion, this story should have focused more on the years 1940-1946 or so, with flashbacks and snippets of their childhood and their lives following the war. Instead we get a near cradle-to-grave account of Harry's life plus his siblings and a lot of Harry's mother's life before she had children.

First, Ian McEwan is, or at least comes across as, brilliant. His many books are so different from each other, yet all so good, and I can picture him laughing through tears as he wrote this one. It is indeed laugh-out-loud funny in many parts. It's also a mystery of sorts, or at least very suspenseful. Yet in the end, it missed the mark for me.NUTSHELL is a riff on HAMLET, with many obvious nods to Shakespeare's greatest tragedy. However, and this is why I deducted two stars, NUTSHELL is told from the POV of a fetus. The baby, an unborn male in his third trimester, can apparently hear everything that happens surrounding his mother. The book opens with the fabulous line, ""So here I am, upside down in a woman."" His mother, Trudy, (taken from Hamlet's Gertrude) has separated from John, the baby's father, and is currently enmeshed with Claude (taken from Claudius), John's brother. Trudy and Uncle Claude are plotting to kill John so they can sell the valuable family home and split the money. The characters are well developed, though I'm not sure I liked any of them. Trudy and Claude are laughably despicable.I could probably have gone along with the premise (fetus as narrator) because the writing is brilliant. However, this unnamed baby ""speaks"" not only in the first person, he's also omniscient. He knows things that even his mother doesn't know. Sorry, no. As a writer, I could never release my sense of the rules or my sense of belief to just go along with this all-knowing baby's point of view. It wouldn't have been as catchy, for sure, but if McEwan had made the son say, a 15-year-old blind or autistic child that the mother and uncle dismissed, or something to that effect, then I might have loved this book. Then there's the ending. I can see McEwan's case for ending it the way he did, but I wanted it to end differently (as did others in my book club). That being said, if you are open to the premise and love good, intelligent writing (I had to look up so many words!), then you might get a real kick out of NUTSHELL.

In a story that could have been overwhelmingly sentimental or depressing, Khong found a light-hearted way to present her narrator as an astute and observant girl who is fighting her way through a difficult time. The premise—that the end stage of life is, in a way, parallel to childhood—isn't an original idea, but Khong's voice (the way she tells the story) is fresh and smart. It is written in the style of a diary, as the daughter reflects on the time she spent with her family. I'm very happy to have read this book.

Several members found it to be a gripping story with the ever present possibility that the government would change their opinion on the Count and have him executed after all. But Towles never hinted at that. There is no mention of the Count being checked up on, or interviewed past 1922. He is free to roam and enjoy himself for nearly forty years. Here is my summary of the book: An educated, erudite, and humorous upperclassman reconciles himself to this life of luxury—on page 28. Yes, he sleeps in a small attic room, but he can roam free throughout the enormous hotel. He can receive friends and make new friends, dine in the hotel's five-star restaurant and drink the world's best wines. He reads newspapers and literature and poetry. He meets and sleeps with—no, not the quiet, sweet seamstress—he sleeps with Russia's most famous and most powerful actress! And the little girl he takes care of? She grows up to be a world-renowned musician. Did I mention she is beautiful? How can the reader sympathize with this man? He never wants for anything, not one thing. We don't even hear mention of the very special dinner the Count and his friends want to have with very rare ingredients until, Presto!, they acquire the final ingredient. There is no character arc in this book. No transformation of mood or priorities. Until page 388, there isn't really a plot; before then the novel feels like a collection of short stories with related characters. And then there's the alliteration. Every single word in every single chapter title begins with the letter A. Only the letter A. And, the alliteration spills into the prose to the point of being obnoxious. This book had so much potential. The educated, erudite, and humorous Count shouldn't have reconciled himself to being trapped inside one building for at least half the book. He should have had to earn his privileges and his meals. He should have had a dying mother he was unable to visit. He should have yearned for the actress but later realized it was sweet Marina who was the love of his life. Towles could have built an enormous amount of tension by making the Count be randomly searched, interviewed, threatened, etc., etc. throughout. The plot, of course, should have kicked in no later than page 50. But none of that happened.Three Imperfect Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 20, 2017","Nov 14, 2017","Jul 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430012-a-gentleman-in-moscow

A friend had given me a copy, and then a woman in my book club chose Towles's second novel, A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW, for an upcoming book. I saw that as a sign to read Rules of Civility, his debut novel, first. Published in 2011, Rules of Civility became a NYTimes Bestseller, so it had to be good, right? And it was! I read it in less than a week—not quite ""unputdownable,"" but certainly more captivating than gardening or bingeing on any TV shows. One thing I know for sure, Towles is brilliant. His bio says he graduated from Yale and then Stanford. Now he's an investment banker in NYC. Ho hum, right? Anyway, Rules of Civility is about Katey Kontent, as in, ""She is quite content with her life."" Katey is as smart as Towles must be, quick witted and observant. But here's the thing, as Kurt Vonnegut said, a character should ""want something right away, even if it's only a glass of water."" And other than ultimately wanting a good life, Katey Kontent doesn't want anything in this story. If there was ever a story about life ""happening"" to a character, it's this one. She meets a girl named Eve. They're in a car accident with a handsome stranger, Tinker Grey, wherein Eve is badly injured and scarred. (Towles even names that chapter ""Deus Ex Machina."") After that, Katey fumbles around, makes nothing but minor decisions, and eventually gets a better than average job. We know from the prologue that she ends up married, but the story has virtually no plot. It's simply the unfolding of a year in Miss Kontent's life, the year being 1938 in New York City. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this story. For reasons yet unknown to myself, I could barely put it down. It was never ""Does Katey finally get ____ ?"" It was more like, ""I hope Katey is okay. Maybe I should read a few more pages."" Ultimately, as Katey puts a few retrospective clues in order, the book has the taste of a mystery novel. It unfolds nicely and ultimately satisfies, and concludes with many poignant observations. I really enjoyed Rules of Civility, and I am truly looking forward to A Gentleman in Moscow.Four Chivalrous Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 27, 2017","Jul 02, 2017","Jul 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10054335-rules-of-civility

She is forced to apply for a job for the first time in her unplanned and not-overly happy life. In other words, a lot of life just ""happened"" for Britt-Marie and, not knowing how to assert herself, she went along with it. As a child, Britt-Marie and her family suffered a horrific accident. Ever since, she has tried to make things perfect (or at least appear perfect) as a misguided way of making up for the long-term effects of the accident. After a trip to the unemployment agency, she is sent to a small, failing town to run a community center. While there, she meets a host of colorful characters, and is more or less drafted into becoming the local kids' soccer coach—a sport she despises. When her estranged husband Kent comes to find her and bring her back home, Britt-Marie must, for the first time in her life, make a decision about what's best for her and what she wants. Does she return to Kent, or does she make a new life with Sven?Backman, also the author of A MAN CALLED OVE, asserts his authorial voice a little too loudly here for my personal taste, and I never quite got an image of most of his characters. I know many authors keep character descriptions to a minimum so that the reader can fill in their faces with their imagination, but I often couldn't picture the characters doing some of the things they did—everything from swearing to running after soccer balls, etc. I wish Backman had developed them a bit more. That being said, I could relate in many ways with Britt-Marie, which is often what readers hope for in a novel. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends.FOUR assertive STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 27, 2017","May 03, 2017","Apr 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27406704-britt-marie-was-here

I am so glad I did. The first time I read it (see my  below), I was stymied by Marra's choice of using the omniscient vision to tell us of minor characters's pasts and futures. While some women in my book club liked this layer, I still don't. But on the second reading, I was able to focus on Marra's beautiful and poignant writing. I would still give the book four stars because of these ""odd choices,"" (see below) but on the second reading, I have to admit I cried at the ending. I knew what was coming, yet I was less distracted by his writing and more in tune with the characters's emotions. That is powerful writing. This is still a difficult story, but I would definitely recommend it to readers who appreciate deep literature.FIRST REVIEW:I mostly loved A CONSTELLATION OF VITAL PHENOMENA, by Anthony Marra. It paints the chilling story of ""the world's worst doctor,"" an orphaned girl, and a bold surgeon who are brought together under the brutal circumstances of Chechnya's two modern day wars. It feels broad and epic even though it clocks in at only 350 pages, but maybe that's because a blurb from the New York Times Book Review calls it ""A 21st-century WAR AND PEACE."" ACofVP is sad and horrific at points, but if it teaches us anything, it's that behind the headlines of every war there are people—parents and siblings, children and doctors—who suffer tragically along with the soldiers and rebels who are commanded to fight, kill, and conquer.Marra's writing is evocative and touching, yet he made what I consider to be odd choices. Told mostly in third person, past tense, Marra inserts occasional omniscient glimpses into random characters' futures. For example, on page 57: ""The guard, thirty-one years old, had never received a paycheck, and wouldn't have known what to do with one if he had; in three years, when the hospital issued paychecks again ... the guard would frame his in glass and hang it on his wall without ever depositing it. For the rest of his life, he wouldn't trust the numbers people put on paper."" It's as if Marra wants us to know that each of his characters are round, fully-formed ""people"" with full lives and futures (or not, if they die on the page).Though many passages are difficult to read, ACofVP is a deep, heartrending story in the best possible way.

She said she writes her novels in one draft—no revisions. Okay, whoa. I cannot begin to imagine the intense thought and foresight that goes into the planning stages of a novel with no revisions.LILA is the third book in Robinson's prize-winning trilogy; the first two books being GILEAD and HOME, which I have not read. In LILA, we learn the backstory of Lila, a neglected child who is taken (in) by a gritty, migrant-worker character known as Doll. Lila grows up on the road in a scrappy, hard-luck life, to be sure. She does things to survive that she can't bear to speak about. The timeline is jumpy in this novel, but we soon know that the grownup Lila is married to John Ames, a minister in Gilead, Iowa. The bulk of the narrative tells us how she went from a child on the run to the minister's wife. The novel is, needless to say, eloquent and lofty and literary, but we turn the pages as quickly as a genre novel in order to learn her fate: Lila is married to the minister, but she continually dreams of fleeing him and Gilead—even though she is pregnant with his child—because she never learned love and trust as a child.If you have read the first two novels of this trilogy, LILA might seem to fill in the blanks. But, because I haven't read them, this book feels to me like a discussion on whether or not there is a God. Lila, being mostly uneducated and naive, knows nothing of God or the Bible. John Ames, of course, has lived a life dedicated to Christianity and the Bible and the Church. He schools her on it all, very gently. I didn't object to the religious nature of this book, but it did feel to me like Robinson intentionally chose such a naive character so that she could write both sides of the ""Is there or isn't there?"" discussion about God. While this is a beautiful novel in which I underlined many passages and dogeared many pages, I can't say I will recommend it to very many friends.

I wish I had finishedI learned that THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, by Colson Whitehead, won the Pulitzer Prize when I was about half way through the book. I wish I had finished it before I heard the news. It is an astonishingly brilliant book, with many layers and nods to great literature of the past (e.g. Anne Frank's time spent hidden in an attic), but it's harder to be objective when you know a book has won the Pulitzer Prize. The Underground Railroad follows the path of Cora, a feisty young slave who escapes from a Georgia plantation, as did her mother a decade earlier. Whitehead uses allegory to turn the underground railroad into a tangible, primitive subway system. It wasn't a real railroad, we know, but a secret network of brave, righteous people who were willing to risk, indeed sacrifice, their lives to fight the abhorrent system of slavery. I liked his decision as I felt it made the book more physical and relatable (many of us have been on subways; few of us have been secreted through the night on a flight toward freedom). I read this book with my book club, and interestingly, my biggest knock against the book was a welcome relief to others in my group. The Underground Railroad has no ""info dump"" in the early pages. Whitehead gives no backstory or grounding about who the multitude of characters are when he first introduces them. Instead, every other chapter is a stand alone backstory for one important character. Where my friends found this as a necessary breather from the ""pornographic violence,"" as one described it, I felt it robbed the book of forward momentum. As Cora is escorted from Georgia to South Carolina, then North Carolina, Tennessee and beyond, her trek is put on hold so we can learn more about the people who either help her or brutalize and murder slaves and their accomplices. I also found certain passages to be didactic. Maybe that's a necessary evil for true events that took place nearly two hundred years ago, but it came across as ""the voice of the author"" as opposed to the life of the characters.The Underground Railroad is undoubtedly a book that would reveal more and more brilliance with subsequent readings. As I said above, there are many subtle layers in this novel. I'm sure this is one factor that swayed the Pulitzer Prize committee to name this as the best work of fiction in 2016. It is a very difficult read—Whitehead does not whitewash the extreme violence (think DJANGO UNCHAINED) that blacks, both slaves and freemen, endured—but it is a story that I wish millions of Americans would read so that, by chance, history will not repeat itself in this way ever again.FOUR tenacious STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 09, 2017","Apr 27, 2017","Feb 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30555488-the-underground-railroad

This genre, not just historical fiction (a story takes place at least fifty years before the author wrote it), walks the fine line between memoir and fiction. Many of the people, dates, and actions are true, but the author gets to make up much—or all—of the dialogue and emotion. A skilled author or movie director can affect or rewrite history, much like Oliver Stone has done with his movies like JFK, NIXON, SNOWDEN, etc. What is true, vs. what do we remember from the book? This concept, in and of itself, bears a separate discussion.While well written, Circling the Sun focuses on Markham's childhood instead of her years as a pioneering aviator. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the cover and blurbs didn't make such a strong point that the story is about ""the aviator."" Other than the prologue, Markham doesn't even learn to fly in this book until page 332 (out of 355). I imagine is because other biographies of Markham focus on that period, but also it is widely reported that the aviator and the author share a unique trait: both girls were abandoned by their mothers at age four, and both mothers returned when their daughters were about twenty years old. Markham lived a colorful life. She grew up ""wild,"" and became unapologetically promiscuous, including a supposed affair in the 1920s with the then Prince Harry, and also Denys Finch Hattan, a man made famous by Isak Dinesen, aka, Karen Blixen of OUT OF AFRICA. In fact, McLain seems to have borrowed heavily from that novel/movie in creating her characters, with too many similar scenes.I enjoyed reading Circling the Sun. I found it to be an intriguing page turner. However, I feel McLain loved Markham too much. She made her too perfect, smart, and without a conscious. I would have liked it better if Markham was a little more conflicted.THREE circuitous STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 02, 2017","Feb 08, 2017","Feb 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23995231-circling-the-sun

I am a huge fan of George Saunders' short stories, but because of the format he chose to tell this story, I never really got into it.""Bardo"" is a state of flux, in this case, similar to purgatory for our souls. ""Lincoln"" refers to Willie Lincoln, Abe Lincoln's son, who died at age 11 while his father was in office. The story takes place in the cemetery at night (possibly over one single night? I am not positive on that) where Willie was temporarily interred. Saunders got the idea for the story years ago, when he heard that President Lincoln went alone to visit his son in the dark of night and pulled his dead body out of his coffin to hold it one more time. From that image, Saunders, who now studies a form of Buddhism, asked himself the question: What would the other ""members"" of the cemetery think of that? If they could think, of course. That led to a cast of characters! Literally. As in 160 different ghosts and historical figures weighing in on the events of Abe and Willie Lincoln.And that's where Saunders lost me. The story is told in choppy bits and pieces of (both real and fake) historical letters and books about the Lincolns, plus the thoughts of countless ghosts. The book is mostly dialogue from, yes, 160 different people. I both read the book and listened to the audio version. The audio version was fun and fascinating (using several famous voices, including Saunders himself), but it was also frustrating. The parts that were ostensibly non-fiction accounts ended with a proper citation of the source, and had hundreds of ""Op Cit"" notations if he used sources more than once. That was very jarring and repeatedly pulled me out of the story. Plus, trying to keep track of every ghosts’ name and story was nearly impossible. I really wanted to read this book, so I am glad it was chosen for my book club. George Saunders is one of the most creative storytellers of our time, but the format of this novel was gimmicky and a fail, in my opinion.

The best part of this keen book is Johnston's writing. DESCENT is Johnston's first adult novel (after a YA novel and a collection of short stories), and I am in awe of his turn of a phrase and his extraordinary description of the ordinary. I underlined many uncanny, unique observations that are instantly perfect and spot-on. (I would retype a few to illustrate my point, but I'm afraid they would lose their power as excerpts.)DESCENT is the story of the Courtlands, a family of four from Wisconsin who go on vacation in the mountains of Colorado. One day, the son and daughter go for a run up the mountain, but only the son comes down; the daughter goes missing. For the next year and a half, the mother, father, and son struggle to hold on as the search for Caitlin continues. The premise is great, the characters are well-developed and round, the plot and minor characters are solid. I have two relatively small issues with the book. First, Johnston begins each chapter with pronouns—it takes a page or more each time to figure out who the heck he's talking about. At the opening of a book, or the opening of a short story, this can be intriguing and fun; but chapter after chapter—for 74 chapters—this became really frustrating. Second, the story was a little long. It would have been a stronger book if the mini-adventures the characters go on were eliminated or shortened.If you love beautiful sentences (as I do), and you appreciate an elevated thriller, I recommend DESCENT. The last one hundred pages are as ""riveting"" as the cover blurbs claim.FOUR Chilly STARS...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 12, 2016","Jul 27, 2016","Jun 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20312459-descent

While I am glad to know more about Josephine and Napoleon Bonaparte and their era, I cannot say I liked or would recommend this book. I have to believe there are better books out there if you want to immerse yourself in this world. This book reads like an old history text--the kind that made generations of kids hate history. Based on the bibliography, it seems probable (and it felt like) Kate Williams simply read and regurgitated facts. There was very little mood, emotion, or sensory detail in the chapters. There is precious little mention of the flowery or fowl scents that must have filled each and every day, nor the lustful feel one gets when stroking velvet or satin, no clips of horses hooves or peals of laughter and music at the multitude of balls the Bonapartes threw. I don't hold Williams responsible for how hideous Napoleon or Josephine or any of the rest of them behaved. As far as that goes, reporting just the facts was appropriate. But she could have made reading about these crazy historical figures a lot more interesting.

Forget that one author even evoked the name of Charles Dickens in her blurb. Ignore the deckled edges and the linen-textured cover paper. This book is a farce. The Improbability of Love is the name of a painting that an innocent, yet self-taught, world-class cook named Annie stumbles upon in a thrift shop, then buys and carries around as if it were a loaf of bread, as does her alcoholic mother. Annie then ""coincidentally"" gets a job as a personal chef for London's top art dealer, and meets a young painter who falls in love with her and knows how to begin restoration on this masterpiece. Next she fixes dinner for the world's foremost expert on the artist who happened to have painted this masterpiece, and then ... you get the idea.

Now throw in a Nazi war criminal, gay decorator, a shady heiress, plus rap stars, Russian mafia-types ... There's no doubt that Rothschild is a very smart, worldly woman with much to say.

Is that not one of the greatest lines in literature?H IS FOR HAWK, by Helen Macdonald, is a memoir from 2015 about a British woman who uses hawking as a way to overcome the sudden loss of her father. Macdonald, a lover of falcons and falconry since the age of nine, chronicles her time training a young goshawk (whom she names Mabel) as she also works through her grief. Her writing is lyrical, and her knowledge of hawks is vast. The story is both timely and historical in that she references multiple master falconers over the past several hundred years, including E.B. White, author of THE SWORD IN THE STONE, CAMELOT, and a non-fiction book called THE GOSHAWK. The quote, above, is from the first day that Macdonald carries her young hawk on her gloved hand out in public for the first time. In her state of near-depression, Macdonald had been somewhat of a hermit, using her bird as an excuse to avoid the real world. When they go to a park and Macdonald removes Mabel's hood, Macdonald herself is ""overwhelmed by light and detail ..."" and ""heightened perceptions"" as if someone had spiked her tea with acid. I love that line.H is for Hawk is a fascinating book full of detailed passages about the sport of falconry, but I was more interested in Macdonald's personal story of healing after her father's death. It seems she is trying—perhaps not undeservedly so—to insert herself into the centuries old canon of falconers.

I've read several of McKenzie's books, and I expected this to be a light-hearted chick lit novel much like her others. While McKenzie always has something real to say in her books, SMOKE pulled me in a lot deeper than I expected.SMOKE is the story of two estranged friends in the town of ""Nelson,"" a thinly disguised version of Jackson, Wyoming. One of the women, Beth is a former fire-fighter now arson investigator whose marriage is falling apart. Mindy, her ex-best friend, is a married mother of two searching for her authentic self. The novel is framed by a forest fire that has burned down one man's house, and is threatening to burn the entire town if the fire fighters can't stop it. Beth has the unenviable job of determining who started the fire—in a town the size of ""Nelson,"" it's bound to be someone she knows.

McKenzie did a great job of offering up potential culprits and options, and the story has quite the cinematic climax.

Morgenstern has created a world that swallows you whole. It's fantastical, and it makes you want to immerse yourself in the story as long as possible. I found it difficult to put this book down. (I've been looking for a book this all-encompassing since I read CLOUD ATLAS, by David Mitchell.) Set at the turn of the 20th century and told in present tense, The Night Circus is the story of Celia Bowen, the daughter of Hector, aka Prospero the Enchanter; and Marco, the adopted son of ""the man in the grey suit."" The two men have had an ongoing contest about whose prodigy can outdo the other's for years. In this instance, the circus becomes the framework for the ""game"" between Celia and Marco. Morgenstern reveals the plot to the characters at the same time she reveals it to the reader which adds wonderful tension and mystery to an already mystical and enigmatic tale. Her writing is superb, and the story is unique, creative, and layered with deep meaning. I loved trying to puzzle out the story, and where it was going, and how it would end.The Night Circus is full of luscious descriptions of the circus tents, as well as the clothes and houses and manners of the day—but maybe it's a little too full. At times the cast becomes unwieldy, and several questions (and peoples' fates) are left unanswered, but ultimately, that didn't ruin the story for me. I have a couple other quibbles, too, but I don't want to mention any spoilers. I can't say this is my favorite book ever, but it is one of the best books I've read in years.

(Steve) Watson, is a seriously creepy book that reminded me in ways of Stephen King's MISERY.The premise of this, Watson's debut novel, is that the protagonist, Christine, a forty-seven-year-old amnesiac wakes everyday with almost no memories of her life. Every single day, she is shocked to find a man (her husband, Ben) in bed with her, and shocked to realize she's ""old""—she thinks she's twenty-seven. Her husband has hung photographs of the two of them in their bathroom with stickers of their names so she can try to reorient her life each morning. Every day she asks him questions about her life, like what happened to her (she was hit by a car). But every night when she goes to sleep, she loses all the memories she created or asked about that day, and the entire process must begin again. Watson does an excellent job of showing us this happens each day, but not putting us through the agonizing repetition of reliving it with Christine. As the novel progresses, Christine receives a phone call from a Dr. Nash, a man who is also trying (unbeknownst to Ben) to help her recover her memory. Dr. Nash has her write everything she learns in a day in a journal that she then hides from Ben each night. Both men repeatedly tell her to trust them. And that's where things get tense. With the help of the secret journal, Christine begins to have flashes of memories that lead to the culmination of the story. Watson embeds hints so sneakily that I did not realize what was really happening to Christine until late in the story. The final twist and the climax are excellent. Before I Go To Sleep is a page-turning thriller.

No, Des Moines isn't THAT small, these are all just happy coincidences.In the 1970s, Bryson moved to England. He has gone on to write more than a dozen non-fiction books, mostly about travel, but this memoir is about his childhood. Born in 1951, he covers the decade well and touches on life in the 1960s in middle-America, too. I have a particular interest in this era, so in addition to getting a kick out of the history of Des Moines, I was as delighted to read about the mood and the overall attitudes of Americans at the time. I feel like there's not much to say about a memoir. You can't really argue the facts because that's the point of a memoir (as opposed to a biography): it's told as he remembers it.

THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE, by Audrey Niffenegger, clocks in at nearly 600 pages (the paperback version), or 17.5 hours (in the audio version, which is how I ""read"" it). I wanted to read this book because dozens of top lit agents say they'd love to find a new book ""like The Time Traveler's Wife."" As a writer, I decided I should know what's so special about this book that, thirteen years later, agents still cite it on their wish lists.Niffenegger, who I learned is a visual artist, apparently one day got the idea to tell this story as a graphic novel, but discovered the difficulty of representing the choppy timeline visually. So she wrote it out. The title tells us what the story is about. We have a time traveler, named Henry, and he is married to a woman named Claire. Though not the first to tell a time-travel story, or an intimate love story with a complication (even Shakespeare liked it), the story did feel fresh. However, this book was at least 200 pages too long, in my opinion. The story would have been much improved if we didn't have to hear every single event of Henry's time travel. Time after time (no pun intended), we get another scene in which Henry jumps out of ""now"" and lands in ""then."" Often, nothing significant happens ""then."" It just happens. Over and over. I imagine this story, with it's jumps through time, was an editor's nightmare. The verb tenses alone had to be insane to get right, but why did the editor allow it to go on for 600 pages? I have one more problem with this story, and I feel compelled to say it. This book has many graphic sex scenes. I have no problem with that, but more than once ""Claire"" uses the c-word. At one point, after just having given birth, Claire is talking about how painful the birth was. She starts with her breasts and nipples and works her way down. No one is going to deny that childbirth is painful, but why oh why did Niffenegger have her use the c-word instead of ""vagina""? And why did the editor allow it. Claire, the character, is a wealthy, educated woman in her 30s. It was totally out of character for her. And that's not the only time she used what I consider one of the most vile words in the English language. It was so unnecessary.Yes, I took off one star just for her use of that word.On my journey as a writer, I will try to retain Niffenegger's lyrical, evocative writing, try to retain her attention to detail and description. I will also remember what I didn't like about this book.Three belated Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 10, 2016","Mar 30, 2016","Mar 10, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/18619684-the-time-traveler-s-wife

Albom has him interact with the true greats like Elvis, Duke Ellington, Little Richard, Hank Williams, etc., throughout his life.The book is a quick read, and the story, though often unbelievable bordering on miraculous—finally explained in the final pages—is decently intriguing, but I have to say every time the narrator bragged about his own abilities, I cringed.

I never read it as a child, nor LORD OF THE FLIES, by William Golding, written in 1954, has always held a sort of mystical, horror-movie aura for me. I never read it as a child, nor did I see the movie (either version), even though it is a modern classic, or at least a book that is commonly taught at school.I listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Golding himself long after he wrote it; his scratchy voice warbled like a old man's. I envisioned him sitting in a thread-bare, overstuffed chair near a fireplace, telling the story to his grandsons. The performance would have been substandard if he weren't the author, but because he was, I loved it. Yes, we hear him inhale and swallow (Say it ain't so!), but he emphasizes the dialogue just as he intended it. Golding's writing is evocative and vivid and terse. I felt as if I were running through the weeds and forests, and climbing up the rocks and swimming in the ocean with the characters. The story is about human nature at its very core. A group of British boys (maybe two dozen?) wash up on a deserted island after their plane crashes during WWII. All the adults and any girls perish in the crash. Once the boys realize what has happened to them, they convene and attempt to make a plan. One boy, Ralph, takes charge in the beginning and prioritizes being rescued by lighting a fire so ships might find them. Another boy, Jack, leads his friends to find food. They become the ""hunters."" As you can imagine, the two sets of boys diverge. The hunters become ""savages."" Not everyone survives. What an exciting premise! How would human nature develop under such dire circumstances, especially in children who, in theory, are still innocent and naive? If I had read this in junior high, I imagine I would have been horrified by it. As an adult, and after so many years of hearing about this book, it wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be. I suppose that speaks to my expectations, as well as the types of books and movies being made today (e.g. Alive, Hunger Games). My knock on the narrative is the flatness of the characters. Ralph spoke incessantly about lighting a fire (yes, I realize the foreshadowing purpose, but still); ""Piggy"" was a victim of his poor eyesight and asthma; Jack was singularly focused on finding ""meat."" If I had had the genius to write this story, I hope I would have made the characters more ""round"" and given them more depth. The book is short, so I suppose Golding didn't feel had time to develop the boys and still keep the book as brief as he wanted, but I think deeper characters would have made this a five-star story. Also the title ... It's a fantastic title, but I wish Golding had developed the ""Lord"" as the power of our imagination more fully.Four Bloody Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 24, 2016","Feb 27, 2016","Feb 24, 2016",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/524.Lord_of_the_Flies

Second, because the ladies in my first book club disagreed on what they think happened, and I wanted to know what the ladies in my second book club would think about it. They disagreed, too! The ambiguity definitely makes for a lively, divergent discussion.""Lydia is dead."" That is the opening sentence of this family drama, set in the 1970s in small-town Ohio. One morning, the Lee family wakes up for school and work, but the middle daughter, Lydia, is gone. A few days later, the police find her body at the bottom of a nearby lake. Problem is, no one in this bi-racial family—with a Chinese-American father who hated being ""different,"" and blonde wife who wanted to be different—is open enough to communicate ANYTHING about their true feelings, motivations, or suspicions. No one will tell the others or the police what they know, so the family begins to disintegrate. There are three possibilities for what happened to Lydia: murder by a neighborhood boy, suicide, or accident. Different members of the family believe different scenarios. Although this is a tragic, cautionary tale (some members of my book club thought it was awfully depressing with no reprieve), it is a deep story with themes ranging from communication to discrimination to how NOT to behave as parents. Lydia was the favorite child; both parents showered their two oldest children with extreme vicarious pressures, while the youngest child was often invisible to them. I have an overwhelming desire to tell every tight-lipped person I know to read the book to understand the value of communicating, not just in the face of a tragedy, but on an everyday basis about our hopes, dreams, and desires. Families must communicate. On second reading, I still give the book Four-and-a-half Stars, but this time I'm rounding up to Five Stars, just to be fair to the author.REVIEW FROM FIRST READING: Mar 2016EVERYTHING I NEVER TOLD YOU, by Celeste Ng, is unique in so many ways. Ng (pronounced Ing) made several bold choices, including the godlike, omniscient point of view, and the narrator's ability to see into the future. Given the way this story ended, it could only have been told in the omniscient voice, but I am still debating whether or not I liked being told what would or wouldn't happen at a future moment in this family's life.Everything I Never Told You is the beautifully written story of the Lee family who live in a small town in Ohio in the 1970s. The father, James, is a Chinese American who felt ""different"" his entire life. He married a bright, blue-eyed girl named Marilyn who wanted to stand out. They had three children, Nathan and Hannah, both dark-eyed like their father, and Lydia, who inherited her mother's blue eyes. Lydia, the ""chosen child,"" dies, and that is where the novel begins. ""Lydia is dead."" is the first sentence of the book. The police investigation runs parallel to the storyline of each family member trying to deal what happened to Lydia and why. Each character knows bits and pieces of information that none of the others do. Based the title, obviously, we know one of the themes of this novel is communication: how important it is to talk and be honest with those we love. Another message from Ng is about the dangers of parents who live vicariously through their children, and/or the overbearing expectations that some parents put on children. Lastly, this story speaks to prejudice. At the time and place of the story, the Lees stand out as the only ""Oriental"" family of this small town. We learn that even though they often forget they're ""different,"" others don't let them forget it for long. Ng does an excellent job of showing what childhood events shaped each character, and his or her motives for how they behave ""today."" Each character is round and sincere and believable. ""How did Lydia really die"" is the question that keeps the reader turning the pages. Ng casts doubt on several characters, thus making us wonder if someone killed her, or if it's a suicide like the police think. The ending, which I won't give away, does not disappoint. It was brilliant, in fact. Plus, Ng makes many astute and memorable observations about people, families, life, and love. I underlined many passages.So why didn't I give this book five stars? I was eager to know what happened to Lydia, but I thought several quiet, everyday scenes dragged a bit. Plus, as I mentioned above, the narrator occasionally tells us things like ""Later—and for the rest of his life—James will struggle to piece words to this feeling ..."" Now, I realize an omniscient narrator would know these things, but I didn't like being told what would happen at a time past the end of the novel. Just a personal preference, I guess. Everything I Never Told You is a well-written, poignant story with a compelling storyline. I would recommend this book to almost anyone.

But, I am surprised by how much I didn't like this book.My Name Is Lucy Barton is the story of an older woman looking back on her painful life. It opens and focuses mostly on a nine-week hospital stay when Lucy was younger and married with two young daughters. Lucy's mother comes to stay with her in the hospital for five days out of the nine weeks. It's the first time they have spoken in many years. Lucy survives, obviously, but the rest of her life is plagued by sadness and guilt due to certain events, revelations, and decisions she makes. (I would be more specific, but don't want to include spoilers.) This book doesn't have a plot; it consists of multiple scenes from Lucy's life, almost all of them sad. By the end, we realize the book is about familial love. Familial love is deep and undying, yet so often, too often, it's our family members who cause us the most pain. Whether the pain comes from your father or mother, your spouse or children, the pain is horrendous because it's nearly impossible to reconcile so much love and so much pain coming from the same source. Yet the reality of this is almost universal. Name one family that hasn't had some inner strife.My biggest issue with this novel, though, is Lucy's ""voice"" (her word choices). It's not distinct enough to show us her personality as does, say Holden Caulfield's voice or Humbert Humbert's. In this book, the voice (i.e. the writing) comes across as bad editing. Lucy Barton is looking back on her life as an older, successful writer. She says she ""comes from nothing,"" yet she's obviously an educated adult. This ""voice"" is a style choice by two brilliant women, Elizabeth Strout and her distinguished editor Susan Kamil, but I feel differently about it. C'est la vie, I suppose.I read this book for one of my book clubs, and I feel confident that after I hear my wise friends speak about it, I'll probably like it more.

No, I don't hate it so much as I hate thinking that there are undoubtedly people in our world as horrible as ""Dark Meadow.""Fortune Smiles is a collection of six short stories by Johnson, who won the Pulitzer Prize for The Orphan Master's Son, a truly incredible story. Johnson is without a doubt one of our best living authors. His writing is flawless, his imagination astounding, his research impeccable, although he picks such obscure situations that I certainly wouldn't spot any errors. For this collection, it was as if Johnson chose six of the most unusual occupations he could imagine, and then asked himself what their personal life stories might have been like. For instance, ""What kind of family man would an East German prison warden have been?"" or, ""How would a UPS driver deliver packages after Hurricane Rita if he suddenly had sole custody of his two-year-old son?"" Those are two of the stories. There's also the husband of a paralyzed woman; the dying wife of a Pulitzer Prize winning author (this is so touching it makes you wonder about the health of Adam Johnson's wife); two North Korean defectors trying to survive in South Korea, one is happy to be out, the other can't survive in the ""chaos""; but the most disturbing story was about Dark Meadow, a damaged IT guy who fixes pedophiles' computers for cash—he both steals images and leaves something behind on their computers. That last story hit me emotionally. But beyond picking unique characters and situations, Johnson excels at being in the head of these characters. His POV and the depth of personal details he touches on is remarkable. No one is ""just"" a UPS driver. This guy, for example, called ""Nonc,"" has an ambitious girlfriend who does not like the fact that they now have a kid to take care of. (When and how can they have sex? They found a way!) Plus, Nonc's father is dying in California, his baby-mama is in prison, and he can't understand the child's made-up words. Did I mention this was in the wake of a major hurricane? What's more, each story has a message. Not in a pedantic, moralistic way, just in the ""Hey, people, if you think you've got it rough, imagine this ..."" way. Talk about opening our eyes and our hearts! So, what to rate it? Fortune Smiles deserves five stars for its writing and originality, but I can't say I LIKED all the stories.

It's almost as if the original draft was twice as long and she edited out every other sentence, or perhaps most of the words from each sentence. Brilliant, if you're willing to work a little. And the POV? It's essentially third person omniscient, but Groff adds in bracketed narrator-voiceovers, almost like a wink. It's quite clever.Fates and Furies is a two-part story about a larger-than-life couple: Lotto and Mathilde. The first half, Fates, focuses on Lancelot, called Lotto, a ""Golden Boy"" in his mother's eyes, though he grows up to be pock-marked and too tall (6'6"") for his chosen profession as an actor, so he stumbles into becoming a playwright. He's the kind of guy who gets all the girls and all the attention. Here, from page 42, a female friend discussing Lotto: ""He's the sluttiest,"" Danica said. ""He gets away with it because of the way he looks at you. Like, if he were actually good-looking, he'd never be as deadly, but five minutes in a room with him, and all you want to do is get naked.""Things just seem to happen for Lotto, to the point that a person might hate him. But no one hates him outwardly because he's too important. He's the boss or the President or the uber-wealthy father that you can't afford to hate. Lotto is like a sex-crazed, melodramatic, drunken Roman Candle, though he deeply loves and is faithful to his wife.Furies, the second half of the book, focuses on Mathilde. She plays the loving, supportive wife in the first half of the book. But if Lotto is a Roman Candle, Mathilde is the one who lights and holds the firework while it's shooting its flame into the dark sky. Furies not only shows us who Mathilde really is, it shows us how egocentric (daft) Lotto is. Groff hinted at the darkness behind Mathilde in Part 1, but it's not until we read Mathilde's life story that we realize how deep a character she is. Deep and dark, very, very dark. If everything went right for Lotto, it's safe to say almost everything went wrong for Mathilde. Out of necessity, she created herself as she was growing up.Groff must be brilliant, at least she is in the world of literature. With Lotto as a playwright, Groff can use her knowledge of the Classics, specifically the Greek myths, to guide his career. Now, I know very little about the Classics so much of this was over my head, but she did a decent job of explaining it so I could appreciate that there was a deeper meaning without losing the storyline. I do have a couple issues with this book. One, I hate the GONE GIRL twist. It's not until Part 2 that the reader realizes the female lead is so dark. I wish Groff had alluded to that a little more in Part 1 instead of trying to shock us like Gone Girl did. Also, this book takes off at a sprinter's pace, but Groff can't or doesn't sustain it through the 390-page marathon. It was almost as if she was in love with Lotto herself, and that came through brilliantly. I would take off a half-star for these if I could.Ultimately, Fates and Furies is an explosive love story with a brilliant perspective on life and love. Groff nails certain relationships and personalities so squarely that I underlined and dog-eared numerous sentences and paragraphs.

His mind is as creative as a young child's, building tales as tall as a mountain. He is one of the best living writers, almost too good, perhaps, because it's so hard to keep up with him.SLADE HOUSE, Mitchell's latest gem, is a perfect example of his cryptic tales. As a stand alone novel (or probably novella because it's short), Slade House captivates and excites the reader. With equal parts literary, horror, and fantasy, it tells the story of people who disappear from Slade Alley in London on the last Saturday of October every nine years. Each of the five chapters begins on that day (starting in 1979 and ending in 2015) with the tale of ""the chosen"" visitors to Slade House. This is where the horror part comes in. If the residents of the house (that doesn't exist on any map) can convince them to enter and imbibe something, they don't leave. Mitchell does a lyrical job of making this seem elegant and plausible.But it's difficult to take Slade House as a stand alone novel. It links directly back to his last book, The Bone Clocks. So much so that I had to go back and reread the ending of The Bone Clocks because Slade House feels to me like a link from that to a new novel. I felt by the time I finished Slade House that it was written as a business decision to lay a path toward another book. All that being said, it's difficult for me to criticize David Mitchell. He IS one of the best writers of our time, and I will absolutely read any book he writes.

Written in 1992, BOOC was recently reprinted as a 20th Anniversary Edition with a new afterword. I'm surprised this book isn't more well-known. It's powerful and heartbreaking, and so well-written. BOOC is the story of Ruth Anne Boatwright (known as ""Bone), a little girl born out of wedlock in South Carolina in the 1950s. The Boatwrights are poor and dysfunctional, but the women are wise. They understand each other and they take care of one another. The men, though loyal to their blood relatives, are badass drunks who are in and out of work, women, and jail. Bone's mother, Anney, is a pretty girl with no luck. She's fierce, and yet mostly helpless (not unlike any poor woman in the 1950s South). It's a tough world for Bone. We never learn who her father is, we just know she looks different from the rest of the family. She struggles to understand who she is and how the world works. Bone loves gospel music, the Church, and Shannon, an Albino friend who suffers tragedies of her own. As you might imagine, incest is a strong theme in this book. Incest, love, and hatred are linked so tightly that you really can't put this book down. The end is ... not what you imagine. It's worse.This story is not a memoir, but Allison states in the afterword that the experiences and the emotions are real. So real, in fact, that the book was banned from several schools. Its message is loud and important, but the reality is so painful that not everyone will want to read it.

These chapters are juxtaposed with Arden recounting her life's story—which she insists is essential to Holt believing that she is innocent—from the age of four.

Though I primarily read literary fiction, I like to throw in an occasional commercial fiction mystery because of the pace and intrigue. CAREER OF EVIL, by Robert Galbraith, aka JK Rowling, definitely qualifies because we all know Rowling is an excellent storyteller.That being said, this is my least favorite of the three Comoran Strike detective books. This series is about a former British soldier who started his own detective agency after the Afghan war. He is an amputee, and he's apparently very attractive. In The Cuckoo's Calling, the first Strike novel, he hires young, attractive Robin Ellacott, and together they beat the British Police in solving major crimes. It's the pull between Strike and Robin that keeps me coming back for more. Otherwise, the stories are a bit like Law & Order. (No knock there; I like L&O.) In Career of Evil, a woman's severed leg is delivered to Robin at Strike's office. Yuk. Because Strike is an amputee, this event has several layers of mystery and innuendo, not the least of which is who's leg is it? And who sent it to Robin and Strike? The police have their ideas, and Strike has his ideas. And the race is off! Who will solve it first? I don't dislike this premise.The problem was that this book is nearly 500 pages of ""Is it him? Or is it him? Or is it him? Or is it them?"" I finally decided that either Rowling's editor was afraid to say, Cut out 100 pages!, or that her publisher told her to make it 500 pages so they could charge more for the book. Either way, many stretches felt repetitive and tedious. I can say the the ending, perhaps the last 75 pages, were quite exciting ... especially the last five pages. That means I will most likely buy the next Strike book. I just hope the mystery story is worth my time.Three and a half bloody Stars (rounded down to three)...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 16, 2016","May 02, 2016","Oct 03, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24106033-career-of-evil

I listened to the audio version, which clocks in at 25 hours—that's long—yet I finished it fairly quickly because I was always eager to get back to the characters' lives. Purity is the story of Purity ""Pip"" Tyler, a bright, twenty-something Californian who lives with her reclusive mother. The mother, Penelope, is ... a basket case. We don't get an official diagnosis (because she's a recluse) but she is clinically sociopathic in many ways. We meet Pip when she's working at a bad telephone sales job, overwhelmed by $131,000 of school loans that her mother keeps telling her not to worry about. The hook is that Pip has no idea who her father is, and her mother won't divulge it no matter how Pip tries to get it out of her. Pip wants to find him in hopes that he can help pay off her student loans. When Pip meets a woman who convinces her to join The Sunlight Project, an organization that exposes secrets much like WikiLeaks, she jumps at the chance and flies to South America to join up. She thinks she can use the organization's fact-finding tricks to discover who her father is, and what her mother's real name is (she is living under an assumed name with the guise they are hiding out from an abusive ex-husband). The bulk of the novel is Franzen's plunge into each of the major characters' backstories. This is both good and bad. IMHO, he goes too deep into too many lives. I felt as if he was trying to elevate this novel into Pulitzer Prize territory. Instead of being awed and fascinated, it turned me off.Franzen proves he knew his characters inside and out, up and down, frontwards and backwards. There are no flat characters in this book. They are all so round, they're obese. Usually that's great, but I found long stretches of this story boring. Once we finally learn who Pip's father is, we get SO much detail on her parents' relationship I had to skip ahead. It was painful to hear their problems go on and on and on. One other character worth mentioning is Andreas Wolf, the Julian Assange-like founder of The Sunlight Project. Whoa. Wolf is from East Germany, raised by a father who works for the GDR, and a mother who has serious problems of her own. Andreas Wolf is so screwed up, he is one of those fictional characters that I might never forget. Franzen says he thought of the name/theme ""purity"" long before he decided to name the primary character Purity. It follows that the message of this novel is: Honesty is the best policy. It seems every character's lies came back to haunt him or her in devastating ways.Purity could not have been an easy book to write. The writing was clean, the story was captivating, the characters were real. I just wish Franzen hadn't tried so hard.Four Pure Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 09, 2016","Apr 22, 2016","Sep 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23754479-purity

My frustration with this book was its lack of focus. The first two chapters are backstory about the Milliron men. (Only a renowned author could get away with that.) The story is told mostly in flashback from the first person POV of the oldest son, so naturally we think of him as the protagonist. But ... the back cover of the novel leads an uninformed reader to think the story is about Rose, the housekeeper, who doesn't arrive until Chapter Three. Rose does play a vital role, but this book is billed (on Goodreads, et al) as ""the first of three Morrie Morgan books."" In fact, I learned at my book club discussion that the Milliron family isn't even in the two other Morrie Morgan books. Other than The Great Gatsby, this is the only book I can think of where the narrator is not the protagonist (and The Great Gatsby has a good reason for that).

The reader must suspend her disbelief, but that's easy because the premise is a familiar one: The movies TRADING PLACES and BIG used the same concept. But this novel cuts right to the core the themes of Who are we, really? and What makes us who we are? Achterberg strikes a nerve with these meaty questions, and she does it well.The two women in the story are polar opposites: Carin, the pretty, blond, wealthy, high-achieving, yet somewhat-miserable single girl; and, Leann, the obese, poor, unhappy, unhealthy, unhappily-married mother of a six-year-old. One day, when Carin is in Leann's check-out lane at the Shop N Save grocery store, a sign falls and hits Carin on her head. At that moment, the women ""trade places."" Carin, who knows nothing about being a mom, has no place to go except Leann's filthy, low-rent apartment. By the end of the first page, I couldn't stop reading to find out how each woman would fare in the other's world. Like all good books, the characters' situations go from bad to worse to OMG! This book is definitely a page turner.Achterberg is an excellent writer. The prose is clean and honest—deceptively simple, I like to say. I dog-eared and underlined numerous well-turned phrases. She truly gets inside the heads of both women, and writes the story with their alternating perspectives. She also nailed the voice of each woman (one educated, one who dropped out of high school). It's rare that a novel makes me stop and think as much as this one did. Achterberg (through her characters) asks the questions: What makes us who we are? Our mind, our body, and/or our situation? How much of ""us"" is defined by things we didn't choose for ourselves? We don't pick our parents or our hometown or our social class, but those factors generally define a person. Yes, some people are able to rise above any hardship and succeed despite our shortcomings, but not most people. I'm Not Her is a story I will recommend over and over.

Her observations, descriptions, and mastery of language is some of the best I've ever heard/read (I listened to the audio version). Truly beautiful writing. And the story? Oh, the story ... Set in London just after WWI, The Paying Guests starts out as a sad but realistic account of an upperclass woman named Frances Wray. Frances lost her two brothers and her father in the war, so now she lives with her mother in their large but deteriorating home on Champion Hill. After discovering that the father squandered their family fortune, Frances and her mother are forced to lay off their servants and take in boarders. Okay, so it's historical fiction. Check.Their boarders, a young married but childless couple, Lillian and Leonard, move into the Wray's home. They are just slightly younger than Frances. As we might guess, shenanigans happen. Frances falls in love. Then we get a handful of surprisingly graphic sex scenes. (Is this the path that Fifty Shades of Grey paved?) Anyway, okay, so it's a tangled romance novel. With a twist. Check.Then, someone dies. In fact, they are murdered. The guilty party/parties go to great lengths to cover up the murder, but in the end, it is discovered and the book turns into a courtroom drama. When an innocent man is put on trial, the guilty person(s) must deal with enormous amounts of ... guilt. Will the man be convicted? Will the real killer step forward? Will the lovers prevail or end up hanged for murder? Okay, so it's a courtroom drama. Didn't expect that! The Paying Guests is nearly 600 pages long (21 hours to listen). Though it's an interesting story, and beautifully written, I think it was at least a hundred pages too long. Frances does an enormous amount of whining! I had to fast forward through one section because I just couldn't bear the ""oh poor me"" syndrome. And I'm a bit surprised by the title. I don't think it aptly describes the real story here.

For both books, I was reading and reading and reading, then suddenly, bang!, you understand what's been happening all along. In Owen Meany, that bang doesn't hit until about page 600. Thankfully, Last Word is much shorter (only 86 pages long), and that bang hits about page 84.Last Word is the story of the Langers, a Jewish family: Kip, the father; Eric, his chubby thirteen-year-old son; Andi, the second wife; and their two younger daughters. Eric is having trouble at his private Jewish academy, and the parents are continually being brought in to discuss his behavior. The story takes place over most of a school year, so at only 86 pages, Blum has done a remarkable job of focusing on just this one storyline. The book is very well written. The father in this book upset me—I imagine he was supposed to upset me. He was so out of touch with his son that I wanted to shout at him. Like Annie Proulx (and many other writers), Blum has, in a way, used the setting for this story (inside a strict Jewish family and school) as another character; it's that integral to the story. Not being Jewish, I was ignorant of some of the words/holidays/traditions and history that were referred to often. That didn't detract from the story, in fact, it opened a door to a rich world that I know very little about, but I did feel like an outsider.This book has stuck with me since I finished it.

The first time, I loved it. The second time ... I still loved it, but I took issue with a few things. TSOAE is the story of Tony Webster, a sixty-ish Englishman who is bequeathed five hundred pounds from his college girlfriend's mother whom he met only once. Tony has no idea why she thought of him at all—he hasn't even seen the ex-girlfriend for forty years—so he sets off to figure it out. This introspective journey turns into a mystery of sorts, which makes the already short novel (155 pages) read very quickly.The primary theme of TSOAE is memory, and how it warps and wafts with time. There's also a secondary theme, and that is remorse, which Barnes describes as, ""A feeling which is more complicated, curdled and primeval. Whose chief characteristic is that nothing can be done about it: too much time has passed, too much damage has been done, for amends to be made."" (p108) This second idea makes the novel a sort of cautionary tale: Be careful with your words and deeds because they are more powerful than a young person might imagine and cannot be undone. TSOAE won the Man Booker prize in 2011. It was Barnes' fourth nomination, and first win. There's no question he's an excellent writer, and this is a wonderful story. My teeny, tiny knock against it is that what I originally read as wise and eye-opening became pedantic on my second reading. Others in my book club described it as painfully slow, but I disagree with that. I consider it literary. (Maybe that's the same thing?)

The plot is fresh, the pace is quick, the writing is superb. I could barely put the book down. Time after time, Mandel nailed keen observations of today's world ... and then created a world in which everything humanity has become dependent on is simply gone. Then, of course, she gave us characters to care about, people who we want to survive and thrive. The book opens in modern day Toronto. An actor named Arthur Leander is playing King Lear and dies of a heart attack on stage. That is where we meet Jeevan and Kirsten and Arthur's circle of friends and family. That same night, the ""Georgia Flu"" arrives with a planeload of Europeans and proceeds to decimate 98% of the human population. The novel jumps back and forth from Year Twenty (of the post-flu era) to Arthur's life from about age seventeen until his death on stage. The survivors suffer a much hotter climate, illness without antibiotics, and other people who turn evil in order to survive. In an extremely realistic vein, one man leads ""his people"" as The Prophet. All that being said, I feel Mandel lost an enormous amount of impact with her ending. I don't want to give too much away, but I kept waiting for certain characters to meet, and maybe even fall in love. One of the stars of the first chapter (the character I first fell for) never really showed up again. Plus, some of the bad guys died too easily.

For anyone who has heard that the illustrious, heroic Atticus Finch is portrayed as a racist here, and therefore refuses to read it, I say, Open your eyes to the bigger picture. For those who don't know this already, Go Set A Watchman was written BEFORE Mockingbird. As the story goes, young, eager Harper Lee presented GSaW to her editor who read it and, instead of having her rework it, she asked Harper for the story about what happened to Scout Finch as a child. That story became the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. In other words, if the manuscript of GSaW hadn't had so many problems, we might never have gotten To Kill A Mockingbird. Imagine ...GSaW takes place when twenty-six-year-old Scout (now called Jean Louise) Finch goes home to Maycomb, Georgia, for a two-week visit. She now lives and works in New York City, and has new eyes with which to see her backwards hometown. And what she sees horrifies her. What she sees is real, not the glossy-eyed, little-girl view of her righteous father. Yes, it's upsetting to everyone who also held Atticus Finch as the Good Man during the difficult racist years of the early 20th century in the South. But here's the thing ...GSaWatchman paints a truer picture. It tells us what was True in the 1950s in the South. Anyone who doesn't want the truth, the whole truth, is not being open-minded. The truth is important, even if it hurts. But exploring the bigger picture opens our eyes to issues that seem to be presenting themselves all over again with the tragedies happening in Syria and the entire Middle East. it's easy to draw parallels between the tensions between the blacks and whites in the South, and the ""potential"" Syrian immigrants today. That's one reason this book is important.As a stand alone book, Go Set A Watchman would probably not have been published today if it hadn't been written by The Harper Lee. It rambles, it's unfocused, and it switches between third-person and first-person without warning. Yet Lee's passion and potential ring out so clearly here that it's obvious she was destined to write an important novel—who knew it would be her first published book?Three Stars (if taken as a stand alone book)...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 11, 2015","Nov 17, 2015","May 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24817626-go-set-a-watchman

The story is focused and perplexing, and Stevens' writing is terse yet smooth.For the uninitiated, Vanessa Michael Munroe is a tall, strong woman who can pass as a man when she so chooses. Michael, as she is then called, is an ""informationist"": she finds information for her clients. Her work is complicated, dangerous, and often violent—extremely violent. Munroe was raised in Africa by missionary parents and tortured as a young girl by evil men. She survived that childhood and now carries her anger, intuition, and survival skills with her. (Think female Jason Bourne.) The Mask takes place in Osaka, Japan, where Munroe has gone to visit her boyfriend, Miles Bradford. Bradford, a security contractor, is working for a tech company that suspects one of its employees of selling trade secrets. Soon Bradford is arrested (framed) for murdering one of the employees, and carted off to prison. Munroe must step in (as Michael) to determine who really killed the employee, and at the same time, she must determine who is selling the secrets because the two crimes are linked.Another reason I think The Mask is Stevens' best novel yet is that her character, the kick-ass, not-afraid-to-kill Vanessa Michael Munroe, has become more complicated. In The Informationist, Stevens' first novel, Munroe killed a lot of people. (Note: James Cameron's production company has bought the movie rights for all of Stevens' Munroe stories!) In this novel, Munroe has become less-eager to kill. She still does, but she now lets the minor bad guys live. Munroe has developed a conscious about killing, and does so only when absolutely necessary—when her life or another innocent person's life is on the line. One thing is sure: Stevens, and by extension Munroe, is brilliant. You have to stay focused when you read her novels. The story here is complicated, and the players numerous, but Stevens excels when she writes the most violent scenes. In those, you feel Munroe's pain, motivation, and rage. Stevens spent many unpleasant years in Japan herself, and the personal flavor she brings to this story comes blasting through.Five Unmasked Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 04, 2015","Jul 14, 2015","May 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23308405-the-mask

The story is poignant and weighty, but Bakopoulos has written it in a way that keeps it from being downright sad or depressing.

In other words, both of them have hit rock bottom, and now their marriage is crumbling. One day Don Lowry (as he's called throughout the book) stumbles upon a young girl called ABC who has also hit rock bottom. Her lover died, and now she wants to die. That same night, Claire meets Charlie, a guy who has returned to this tiny Midwestern town to clear out his father's office. (Yes, Charlie, a failed actor, has hit rock bottom, too.) So Don Lowry and ABC start ""a thing,"" and Claire and Charlie start a thing. Oh, and Charlie and ABC start a thing. (read: varying levels of flirtation --> hooking up). They all smoke weed, and drink, and wander through the night, and skinny dip, and ... You get the picture. They're busy!What I liked best about this book is that the main characters seem real; they are really hurting, and they're finding ways to ease their pain. Anyone who's been through a bad breakup will relate. (Some of the minor characters seem less realistic.)

Koch (will someone PLEASE tell me how he pronounces his last name?!) weaves in details and backstories about his four main characters in the most distinct yet subtle way. I rank his story/character skills right up there with Patricia Highsmith and Kazou Ishiguro, two of my all-time favorites. Koch has a keen, cutting view of humanity; it is in turn, both honest and chilling.The Dinner is the story of two brothers and their wives who go out for dinner to discuss a situation their sons are involved in. (That's like calling a tiger a kitten. It's a pretty serious ""situation."") The adults' solutions are as diverse as North, South, East, and West. And at least two of the four suggestions will rip the tablecloth out from under your dinner plate. Koch adds another layer, though: the structure. The novel takes place over dinner, one single, elegant meal—plus quite a bit of backstory parsed out as slowly as the pompous waiter serves the meal. It starts with the Aperitif and continues through the Digestif. With each course, we learn a tiny bit more about each character, until it feels like Koch dumps a pot of stew on the table that splashes on the two couples and you, the reader.

The twelve women range from young to old, single to married, straight to gay, mothers to non-mothers, poor to wealthy, and on and on. And Cherry gets them all right. Of the twelve stories, I have my favorites, of course. ""Au Secours"" is about a wheelchair-bound woman who awaits her husband's return from prison—he shot her and left her paralyzed. It goes from sad to tragic in a very realistic way. ""The Starveling"" is another favorite. It tells the story of Calista, a woman whose mother left home when Calista was six. Now Calista must sort through her distorted definitions of love (motherly, and also romantic) in order to learn to love herself. But I underlined, dog-eared, and starred many passages in every story.

She is an excellent observer of humanity.As a disclaimer, this book was given to me pre-publication. (I was asked to read it to consider it for my book club; It would be an excellent choice!)

Instead, they embark on the ""Father Project"" to find Rosie's true father (Rosie's now-deceased mother told her that she was the product of a fling).

Just so happens she looks exactly like a detective in the Dublin Murder Squad. (The first of many coincidences!) To find her killer, the lead detectives pretend the girl didn't die and send their detective in to live as the dead girl in hopes of freaking out the killer.

(In fact, there's an artist named Francois Brunelle who's doing a book of photographs of unrelated twins. It's freaky and fantastic, and helped me go with this premise.) But the story is so complicated that it's extremely confusing: the dead girl was actually pretending to be a fictitious girl that the detectives created years ago for another undercover case ... yeah, exactly. If it hadn't been explained to me in advance, I'm not sure I would have made it to page 50. There are also references to character names and police cases that may have been subjects in French's previous book (In the Woods), but I haven't read that and she didn't explain them well enough to make it clear. As I pushed on, I realized the premise is extremely similar to The Secret History, by Donna Tartt. One character ""infiltrates"" a group of intelligent but odd college students who have banded together in a creepy way. Then one of them dies and we watch the survivors implode. Great idea, but The Likeness felt to me like a watered down version of the phenomenal The Secret History. That said, French sprinkled in some wonderful truisms and observations on people and the world, and I highlighted many sentences that rang true to life. In the end, I felt this book was a hundred pages too long. Many scenes could have been eliminated or condensed to make the story more clear and powerful. If you like puzzles and are willing to suspend your disbelief, then you might like this book. I hope to read more of Tana French's work someday because I think she has a lot of talent (she just needs a better editor).(Three and a half, rounded up to, like, ...)

I can't say it was as good as Doerr's book, but it was beautiful and heartrending in its own way.The Nightingale is the story of two sisters: Vianne, the older, wiser, married sister; and Isabelle, the younger impetuous rebel. The girls' mother died when they were little, and their father, emotionally ruined from WWI and his wife's death, sent them away to be raised by others. They both have issues with him. Now, Isabelle wants to fight the Germans, so she joins the Resistance. But Vianne, a mother, wants to keep her head down, protect her children, and follow the new government no matter how much she must suffer for it. These characters (all the characters) and their actions and motivations ring true. As Vianne suffers the long, brutal winters with no heat and little food, my heart hurt for her. I cannot imagine the hell people suffered at the hands of the Nazis, but Hannah made me feel their pain.

Ishiguro, one of my favorite authors, THE BURIED GIANT, by Kazuo Ishiguro, is a multi-layered fable that takes place in rural England, circa 600 A.D. Ishiguro, one of my favorite authors, tells the tale of an elderly British couple, Axl and Beatrice, who go in search of their long lost son. However, they can't remember much about him (or anything else for that matter) because Querig, a mystical she-dragon breathes a mist that has erased everyone's memory. Along their journey, they meet and are joined by three people: Edwin, an orphaned Saxon boy; Wistan, a Saxon warrior on ""an errand"" to slay the dragon; and an elderly knight named Gawain, also on a quest to destroy the dragon.Ishiguro writes in a beautiful voice (one of his best qualities), and thus this is literary fiction at its finest. The loving couple, Axl and Beatrice, though eager to find their son after all these years, realize that if Querig is indeed slain, they will be able to remember their worst memories as well as their best memories. But their love today is so strong they promise themselves they will not relive or rekindle their bad memories because whatever happened, at least they now know they made it back to each other. That's pretty sweet—but will they be able to keep that promise?On a broader level, we have the Saxons who, shortly before our story takes place, were vicious enemies of the Britons. Because of Querig's fog of forgetfulness, the two factions are now able to be friendly. But they too know if Querig is slain, there will be repercussions; their people will once again be on a rampage to slaughter each other and their women and children.Thus we have the story: Is it better to remember the past, and atone for our sins? Or is it better to forget and move on? Ah, an excellent discussion for a high-level book club! Ishiguro argues both sides of that question in this story. And he does it perfectly.

It wasn't until page 54 (I read the ebook version) that this story got rolling. That's when Megan, the woman that Rachel ""stalks"" from her train window each day, went missing. What I liked best about The Girl On The Train was that I couldn't guess who was responsible for Megan's disappearance. A good whodunit has to keep the reader guessing—and this did! Hawkins also threw in a few poignant and insightful lines that I loved. My favorite was something ""Megan"" realized while in therapy: ""... the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete ..."" I believe that to be true, yet I'd never thought of it that way.Unfortunately, I felt Rachel was an unrealistic character, even taking her alcoholism into account. She inserts herself into the mess of solving the crime (I imagine most alcoholics would be too self-centered to go to the trouble).

It's not like we can fact check it, or argue with people's own feelings and memories. But I found no faults with THE COLOR OF WATER, by James McBride. His is an amazing story. Or, more accurately, The Color of Water is the story of McBride's remarkable mother. If this were a fictional tale, you'd swear it couldn't possibly be true.McBride's mother, Rachel Deborah Shilsky, aka Ruth McBride Jordan, was a white, Southern, Jewish woman who had twelve children from her marriages to two black men. Dennis McBride, her first husband and father of eight children, died of cancer just before James McBride was born. Ruth met Hunter Jordan shortly after Dennis's death. They married and had four more children. When James was fourteen, his step-father died of a stroke. Ruth was left with twelve biracial children and no money. So you know what she did? She kept herself together, kept her children focused on school and Christ (whom Ruth had found when she married her first husband), and got them all through college—all of them. They became doctors, professors, computer engineers, and at least one (James), a writer, who recently won the National Book Award for Fiction. Then Ruth earned a degree in Social Work from Temple University at age 65. The tragic tale of Ruth was told without sympathy, anger, or blame. McBride relayed his mother's story, juxtaposed with his own—so eloquently that it felt he was here, on my living room sofa, talking about his ""mommy,"" as he still calls her. The title comes from Ruth herself. When a young James began questioning his mother about race, she deflected his questions. When he asked what color God is, she replied, ""God doesn't have a color. God is the color of water. Water doesn't have a color."" Don't get me wrong, this is a sad story. The struggle, violence, racism, and hatred that Ruth and her children endured is heartbreaking.

The fact that it's told as a graphic novel (read: comic book) makes it readable, even through the sadness. Because Roz Chast is a cartoonist for ""The New Yorker,"" to name one of many publications she has graced with her talent, it follows that her memoir would be a graphic novel. It's her ""voice,"" if you will.CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING MORE PLEASANT? is the story of the decline and death of Roz's parents. She has no siblings, so as her parents aged (they were married for 69 years), she was the only one to take care of them. As the children of Russian immigrants, her parents, George and Elizabeth, lived in Brooklyn. Fortunately, even as teachers they managed to save quite a bit of money. They both lived into their nineties and needed extensive care for the last few years of their lives. Elizabeth outlived her husband by two years and needed round-the-clock care for her final year. This story would be heartbreaking for any family, but the unique and excruciating element here is the fact that Roz did not have a happy childhood. Her parents (specifically her mother) were harsh. Elizabeth had a temper and she ran the show. Basically everyone was afraid of her. Roz could have sugar-coated the story, been sentimental and attempted to show her family in a rosy, Facebook glow, but she didn't. She was honest to the point of touching a nerve for anyone who has been in (or near) her shoes. Whether or not you've watched your parents age, requiring extensive medical treatment, you probably don't want to imagine the duty of having to bathe your ninety-year-old father. Or pay tens of thousands of dollars EVERY MONTH for their care home and nurses. These are the realities that Roz had to face. The most striking (for lack of a better word) situation that Roz relayed was concerning her mother (Page 176 in the hardback book). At that point, her mother had been in Hospice, essentially bedridden, with 24/7 care for several weeks. Roz was, naturally, mentally preparing for her mother's death. Then one day, Roz goes to visit her mother, and Elizabeth was sitting on the sofa, fully dressed and eating a tuna sandwich—all thanks to the help of a Jamaican nurse. To see her awake and revitalized was shocking, an emotional roller coaster. Roz admits how difficult it was adjust to her mother's resurgence, especially because these two were never close, never ""friends."" Instead, her decline stretched on for another year, thus draining Roz's emotional resources, her time with her family and work, and the funds her parents had saved. (If that sounds harsh to you, I imagine your parents are still young and healthy.)I read this book for my book club. I probably wouldn't have picked it up on my own for two reasons: first, because as the title states, this is not a pleasant subject; second, because my parents, specifically my mother, are now in their eighties and I can see the end approaching like a freight train in a tunnel. I don't want to think about their deaths. Worse yet (in my opinion) would be a slow, messy, amnestic death. But we don't get to choose. Bravo for Roz Chast for sharing her tale so honestly. In a way, she gives the rest of us permission to have conflicting emotions about the wild ride most of us will eventually have to take.Five weepy stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 24, 2015","Mar 28, 2015","Jan 28, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18594409-can-t-we-talk-about-something-more-pleasant

But strong and destructive, too ... Like water, we mostly follow the path of least resistance."" But that's it, that's the only thing in this entire book that I liked. I suppose I might have liked the original premise. I can imagine Lamb saying, ""I want to write a story about a mother who leaves her husband, the father of their three grown children, and marries a woman. I want to tell that story."" That could have been a good story, especially considering the woman is an artist who marries her art dealer. (As a former art dealer, I was eager for a dip back into those waters (no pun intended).)This is the first book of Lamb's that I've read so I don't know how it compares to his others. I ""assume"" they were different and much better because Oprah chose two of his previous books for her book club. However, I know this: This novel in five parts is told from the first person point of view of multiple characters in alternating narratives. There was quite a bit of ""stream of consciousness"" in the narrative which authors like Virginia Woolf did very well. These characters, though, came off as whiny idiots—especially the wife. Lamb made her sound like an eight-year-old with a mental disability. (That's as nice as I can state my true feelings.) He also failed the two daughters, especially the couple's youngest, Marissa. Is Lamb a misogynist?? The females were ridiculous, and he did marginally better with the male characters. Still, I EXTREMELY DISLIKED every character's dialogue, actions, reactions, motivations, and inner thoughts. This book was melodramatic to the point of being painful to read. The only reason I finished it is because I read it for my book club.One last point ... (This might be a spoiler, but I won't go into any details.) We find out through the course of the book that Annie, the wife, was sexually abused as a child. Lamb gives her abuser 50+ pages of his own, as he details the shitty life he had growing up. I imagine this was Lamb's acknowledgement that most pedophiles and rapists were also victims in their youth. BUT, the way Lamb delivers the abuser's story it comes across as if he's defending the man!! Like, Hey, readers, it's not really his fault. Look how life failed him first! Give me a bleeping break.

AT THE CAT'S PAJAMAS by Marie-Helene Bertino would have been a fantastic short story. No book has ever made me want to be an editor more than this one. I love the title and the premise of this book: Three disparate characters mashup fantastically in a unique setting. (That's essentially the premise of every Ann Patchett novel, and I love Ann Patchett.) The trouble with THE CAT'S PJs is that it lacks focus and Bertino tries way too hard to have a unique ""voice."" When I say ""lacks focus,"" what I means is there are so many characters that it's nearly impossible to track what's happening to whom at any given moment. Soon enough, I just didn't care.The three main characters, all residents of Philadelphia, are Madeline, a nine-year-old motherless, blues-singing protégé; Sarina, Madeline's freshly divorced teacher; and Lorca, the owner of a nightclub called, yes, The Cat's Pajamas. The entire story happens in twenty-four hours, and the ""chapters"" are short, some as brief as a sentence or two. This makes for quick reading and an easy page-turner—a good thing because otherwise I probably wouldn't have finished it.My biggest gripe with the book, though, was the improbability factor. First, poor Madeline's widowed father is essentially comatose with grief. She is being ""looked after"" by a neighboring deli-owner woman who was a friend of Madeline's mother. Madeline's house is so filled with roaches that she names them. (How is the father who never leaves his bedroom paying rent?)(If Madeline is ""so much like her mother,"" why isn't the dad enamored with her?) Second, in the first five pages we learn that Madeline is nine, and in fifth grade. Unless she's a girl-genius (she's not), she would be in third grade. Third, supposedly Madeline sang along with a Billie Holiday record absolutely perfectly ""before she'd ever spoken her first word."" WTF? I could go on with more and more examples of this nonsense, specifically Lorca's completely unrealistic relationship with his drug-addicted son Alex, but you get the picture.Bertino did scatter a handful of lovely truisms throughout the book, but for each one, I have a dozen passages underlined with negative comments—everything from my aforementioned ""WTF?"" to ""This makes no sense to me."" to ""Ridiculous!,"" ""Completely unrealistic!,"" ""Who is this character again?"" and ""Why are we in the head of a dog?!"" Because, yes, the novel is written in the omniscient POV to the point we even get into the head of a dog during one chapter. How did Bertino's editor let that happen? If they were going for funny/quirky, they should have referred to WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE, a funny/quirky novel that was at least well-written.Enough said.

It is the kind of book people want to read over and over because the brilliance is so subtle.Briefly, two men, Guy (an unassuming yet ""genius"" architect) meets Bruno (the bored and twisted son of a wealthy widow who is now married to a man Bruno hates) on an overnight train ride. Bruno comes up with the idea that he could murder Guy's cheating ex-wife, and as a quid pro quo, Guy could murder Bruno's stepfather. With enough inside information and no apparent motives both would get off scot free. Except it doesn't quite work like that. Not only is Highsmith's writing style impeccable, she also paints vivid scenes and detailed profiles of mentally disturbed characters. We quickly learn Bruno is crazy, and slowly realize that Guy is losing his mind as well. Plus, Highsmith makes the reader wonder if it's true that ""anyone could commit murder under the right circumstances,"" even us!If you or a friend loves a classic murder mystery, this is an excellent choice.

Intelligent and well-written, A GREAT DELIVERANCE definitely earns its spot on the aforementioned list. It is layered and complex with several red herrings and complicated characters. I could barely put it down. Set in England in the mid-eighties, A GREAT DELIVERANCE is the story of Sergeant Barbara Havers and Inspector Thomas Lynley of Scotland Yard who are sent to York to investigate a murder. Nineteen-year-old Roberta Teys was found sitting beside the decapitated corpse of her father with an axe on her lap. She says, ""I did it. I'm not sorry."" Yet the case isn't that simple, of course. Not only are the suspects and central players varied and complex, so are Havers and Lynley and their respective families. George has linked the multitude of layers in this novel together so deftly that they become intertwined and begin to feed off each other. One interesting thing I noticed in the story is that George continually strikes contrasts. For instance, Havers is an unkept and brooding woman; Lynley is handsome and suave. We meet a set of sisters, again one is beautiful and one is frumpy. This continues with locations, buildings, and other characters. In the end, I think George was trying to make the case that the world is full of good and evil. My knock on this book is that it is so long and complex there were quite a few threads left untied. It makes me wonder if George's next book continued with some of the same characters. I guess I'll find out the next time I'm looking for a good mystery.Word of warning: The ending is difficult to read.

I bought the book because it was listed by USA Today as one of the top mysteries of the twentieth century. I liked it, but I wouldn't rank it that high. I wasn't familiar with Macdonald, but I am a fan of Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon) and Raymond Carver (The Big Sleep, etc.). Macdonald is said to have ""inherited the mantle"" of the two earlier greats; I can see that.Noir is an interesting genre. It was probably the prototype for the TV series Law & Order, et al. Each novel/episode fits a cookie-cutter mold. Hard-boiled detective seeks bad guy; insert lovely dame, big money, dark sets, and good people who end up being the bad people. The formula is extremely addictive. That being said, I got rather bored with this book. Not because it's not well-written with interesting characters (it is), but because it felt a bit like the James Patterson syndrome: change the names and cities, and I would think I've read it before.If you love noir, you'll love this book.Four dark stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 25, 2015","Aug 02, 2015","Dec 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/648640.The_Moving_Target

In fact, I think it may be the most powerful story I've ever read. The NEVER LET ME GO, by Kazuo Ishiguro, is one of my five all-time favorite books. In fact, I think it may be the most powerful story I've ever read. The beauty lies in Ishiguro's writing—as well as everything he doesn't write. He gives the reader no backstory until it's absolutely necessary. He lets the reader intuit so much of the story—and we do! He writes as if he has been living as the narrator (Kathy H.) for her whole life. Ishiguro is the master of this.Never Let Me Go is the quintessential ""high-concept"" book. Meaning, the true subject of this powerful story cannot be told without major spoilers. Here's what I can say: This is the story of three friends (Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth) in England in the late 1990s. The story is told from Kathy's POV, much of it in flashback. Ishiguro, most famous for his Booker Prize-wining Remains of the Day, gets Kathy's voice just right—she sounds like a sheltered 31-year-old woman, not the 50-year-old man Ishiguro was when he wrote the book. To that end, the only knock against this book is the disjointedness of the story; it repeatedly jumps from a present scene to a past scene as the narrative makes a particular point. But I believe Ishiguro wants us to feel disjointed. This is not a happy-go-lucky tale. (I imagine some people might hate it for the same reasons I love it.) Never Let Me Go touches on ethical and moral issues that are extremely divisive. If that's confusing and you want to know why, READ THIS BOOK.

So perfect, she said in a later interview, that she realized she had to write an epilogue to the book so those of us who are not brilliant mystery writers could figure it out. The premise of this novel is well-known: A group of people are lured someplace and killed off one at a time until ""there are none.""

These ten are the only people on the island because their host never arrives. After their first evening meal, the butler is instructed (via a letter) to play a record. The record, instead of music, is a voice that lists the guests one by one and names people they are supposed to have killed. In other words, each of the ten people has secretly murdered somebody and gotten away with it. Then the guests begin to die, one after the other, according to an old poem about ""Ten Little Soldier Boys"" who die one at a time.Agatha Christie is the master of sprinkling red herrings and vital clues throughout her mysteries in order to throw the reader off track.

The male writing partner, as you might expect, also throws a complication into the story.Georgie is a lovable mess who can at times think brilliant thoughts, and at other times be frustratingly dense.

It is a textbook example of ""literary fiction,"" yet it leads the reader on an unputdownable journey through the hells of war, specifically the early 1940s in France and Germany.Let's start with the characters: Marie-Laure, a precious, curious, motherless young girl who loses her eyesight at age six; her father, a man who loves her so much he teaches her to be independent and brave; Werner Pfenig, a brilliant and curious orphaned boy, frail but too smart for the Nazis to ignore; Werner's sister Jutta, wise beyond her years and able to see good from bad; these are just a few of the fully developed souls of the story. The two main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, don't meet until near the end of the book, yet ATLWCS feels like a love story because of the descriptive writing. Doerr has succeeded at one of writing's biggest challenges: He has mastered a lyrical yet distinct voice. The story, told in present-tense (so much harder to pull off than it sounds), puts the reader in the story, walking beside the characters through war-torn villages.The plot also amazed me. Doerr wove two independent stories into one, like a magic trick. We kind of know where the story is going, but then, Voilá!, it happens and we cheer. I fell so deeply into the world he created that I didn't want it to end. In fact, with twenty pages left, I made myself set it down because I didn't want it to be over yet. Do I have any quibbles with this book? Yes, but only because it's so near perfect that I studied every element, picking it apart with the hope of becoming a better writer myself.

The second clue is the blurb on the front cover by Alice Walker (THE COLOR PURPLE): ""There is no book more important to me than this one."" But still, I hadn't expected it to touch me so deeply.The bulk of the novel is told as a flashback by Janie, a beautiful biracial woman living in Florida in the 1930s. She is pushed, at age 16, into a loveless marriage by her grandmother, but soon leaves her husband for Joe Starks, a flashy man who promises her ""riches."" Indeed, Starks becomes mayor of a small town and gives her a life a ""privileged"" (yet miserable) life. He controls her. He is jealous and abusive. But as oppressed women often do, she stays with him and becomes a shell of a woman. When Joe Starks dies, Janie does not grieve. She soon finds a lively, younger man named Tea Cake. And, though everyone warns her off Tea Cake, he quickly becomes the love of her life. Janie is a romantic. She believes in flowers and spring and bees and love. But the best thing about Janie is she believes in herself. She knows as a child, a young woman, and into her second marriage that she deserves to be treated well—and to be loved. It's this belief that leads her to the relationship that lives up to her dreams and values. Janie and Tea Cake aren't just a married couple, they are best friends. This is rare and heartwarming. And it makes the tragic ending so much harder to take.THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD is filled with brilliant thoughts and sentences, though I had to work a bit to get into it. It's told in an authentic dialect that takes several pages (chapters?) to get into. But I'm so glad I did. I can honestly say I related to Janie as much as any other literary character.

MY BRILLIANT FRIEND tells of the relationship between LilaElena Ferrante's novel, MY BRILLIANT FRIEND, reads like a memoir; that's both good and bad. MY BRILLIANT FRIEND tells of the relationship between Lila and Elena from age four until they are sixteen. There are not two but three more books in this series—a total of 1700 pages—about these two girls growing up in Naples, Italy, post WWII.Translated from Italian by Ann Goldstein, the story is descriptive and entertaining. Ferrante skillfully paints each scene so that we feel we are there, on the inner streets of a poor, desperate neighborhood. Not unlike children in American slums, each child (Elena, Lila, and their friends) must struggle to find his or her way to survive. Education, especially for young girls, must be fought for; most parents would rather their children work or help around the house. Abuse, physical, mental, and sexual, is rampant. Multiple scenes tell of shouting and beatings by fathers, mothers, even brothers.My favorite element of this book is the complex characters. The girls' friendship is co-dependant at best, dysfunctional or destructive at worst. Both girls are highly intelligent, though only Elena has the support and resources to continue her education beyond grade school. Lila both helps and hinders Elena with her schooling—her presumed ""way out"" of the neighborhood. Lila must find another way.The prologue of this book tells us that Lila, as an older woman, has disappeared. The ending is left so wide open that it's difficult to NOT pick up Ferrante's next book. However, I found the story a bit tedious. It's 325+ pages of scene after scene after scene of Elena's emotions and self-esteem being whipped around by her ""friend."" By the time I finished this book, I felt worn out.Another interesting point that can't be ignored is the story about ""Elena Ferrante"" herself. That's not her real name, and in fact she may not even be a woman. Ferrante never does interviews or public appearances. She believes the work should speak for itself. Many people, primarily Italians, believe she's a man. I'm not sure if it matters either way, but the mystery behind the pseudonym threatens to overshadow the story. Maybe that's his/her plan.

Let me start by saying that almost every sentence in THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH, by Richard Flanagan, is My feelings about this book shock me. Let me start by saying that almost every sentence in THE NARROW ROAD TO THE DEEP NORTH, by Richard Flanagan, is lovely—even when he is describing the most horrific events of war. Flanagan's writing is evocative, lyric, and spare. He has incorporated many poems, mostly haiku, which lofts the novel into a higher realm. However, despite all the lovely sentences, I still didn't like this book. Seriously didn't like it. Largely based on true events as told by his father, Flanagan, an Australian who lives in Tasmania, depicted the war scenes so vividly I started to itch when he spoke of the lice that infected the soldiers. TNRTTDN has many characters, but the protagonist is Dorrigo Evans, a surgeon and an Australian colonel who is captured by the Japanese during WWII. As a colonel, he is in charge of the other Australian POWs at a camp in Siam (now Thailand). Their mission, under the hands of several ruthless Japanese soldiers, was to build a railway through Siam to Burma. Even today, this task is thought to be impossible, but these POWs were forced to attempt it in a fraction of the time it would have taken with heavy equipment, proper tools, and adequate food and clothing. Of course the POWs had none of those. The scenes are difficult to read, and even harder to fathom that much of it might really have happened. The story of the Australians as Japanese POWs is juxtaposed with Dorrigo Evans' life at home, before and after the war as he ponders why he is now a famous and lauded war hero. Dorrigo is a lost soul, a man in search of love. He marries a woman named Ella, but he's ""in love"" with a woman named Amy. When he's not with either of those two, he sleeps with whoever's handy. Now, I understand that characters are supposed to be complicated, but Amy, for starters, was the most ridiculous female in literature. Flanagan never showed me ""love"" between Evans and Amy (who was married to his uncle). They went from curious to lust to confusion to despair, and back to lust ... but never did they seem like they were in love. If one sentence said his love for her ""defied poetry,"" the next sentence asked if he really did love her at all. And she was worse. She was supposedly so conflicted about her life and her love for her husband and Dorrigo that I finally had to skip her scenes altogether. I was honestly relieved to get back to the war scenes! They were horrifying, but the sections about Dorrigo's love life were horrible. Another oddity: Flanagan used the word ""strange"" so frequently that I have to wonder WTF. It was as if ""strange"" was a theme he was trying to subliminally weave into the novel, but if so, strange is a terrible word choice. It's entirely vague. It really means nothing—or too many things. It's not a theme. I think it was just sloppy writing and/or editing. TNRTTDN won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 2014, an award I highly respect. But I have no idea how or why they could have picked this book (politics, I suppose). I believe that the world was overdue to have a book that told the plight of the Australian involvement and POWs of WWII (I certainly learned a lot from the book), but the love story element ruined this book for me.

I had been waiting impatiently for THE BONE CLOCKS, by David Mitchell, for four, five, six months—since the moment I saw it would be released in September. I expected to love this book ... but I didn't. Mitchell's 2004 novel, CLOUD ATLAS, is among my Top Five all-time favorite books. I have heard incredible things about his other work, too, (namely GHOSTWRITTEN and NUMBER9 DREAM), but I haven't read them because I've heard they were early (weak) variations of his masterpiece, Cloud Atlas.Well, so is The Bone Clocks. Like Cloud Atlas, Mitchell's latest novel is divided into six parts, each segment taking place years apart from the others. The Bone Clocks follows protagonist Holly Sykes through her life, beginning as a teenager in 1984, and ending in 2043 when she is an octogenarian. Holly has ""heard voices"" since she was seven. Because of this, she has drawn the attention of two warring factions of ""atemporals,"" humans whose lives don't follow the standard rules for life and death. In fact, she becomes the nexus for an ultimate showdown between the two groups. Though I ""cared"" about her, I found her motivation throughout the novel rather timid.Every sentence in this novel is perfect, but what David Mitchell does best is Voice. He is brilliant at making each character sound unique. Plus, his imagination as far as settings, wild twists, and new worlds is phenomenal. However, (and then I'll stop beating this horse) none of the characters or futuristic scenes shine as brightly as they did in CA. As an example, in 2043, we no longer use cell phones, we use ""devices."" As in, ""Device me when you're finished here."" Device? I'm disappointed that Mitchell couldn't have found a unique or specific word to replace ""phone."" Although I have no way of knowing how I'd feel about The Bone Clocks if I'd never read Cloud Atlas, I can say that it falls short of his masterpiece. Thank goodness, though, that every writer doesn't follow Harper Lee's example of quitting after writing their masterwork, or the world would have missed out on a lot of great literature. If you haven't read Cloud Atlas, make sure you put it on your TBR list—today. If you have read Cloud Atlas, just lower your expectations for this novel.

And most of us know that before her cover was blown, the first novel in this series, THE CUCKOO'S CALLING, had paltry sales. It wasn't until the world discovered the true writer that these novels became bestsellers. I, for one, probably would not have picked up (hell, I probably would never have even heard of) The Cuckoo's Calling if not for the truth behind the pseudonym.THE SILKWORM is a good story, but not a great story. It's a well told, mentally challenging whodunit. In this case, a mediocre novelist is killed in the same, horrific manner in which the protagonist of his latest novel is murdered. There are a handful of potential killers, and Galbraith indeed fooled me. I had picked one character (in retrospect, I can see that Galbraith wanted me to guess the person that I did), yet when the real killer was revealed, I wasn't surprised. In fact, I was more disappointed in myself for not getting it right. However, the reason that crime shows and mysteries are so incredibly popular is not just about a particular case; it's because the audience/reader becomes connected to the detectives and their personal lives. Cormoran Strike is a deeply flawed, entirely sympathetic detective. His assistant, Robin, is eager and attractive. Galbraith teases us with their interaction. It's reminds me a lot of the old show MOONLIGHTING with Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. They were attracted to each other, but never hooked up—until they did, which ruined the will-they-or-won't-they excitement. It seems to me that Galbraith is walking the fine line between detective series and literary fiction. I think I'd like the series better if ""he"" amped up the mystery and let go of the intellectual, psychological character development. What remains to be seen with the Cormoran Strike series is will I or will I not read them all. The novels are long, and simply not that exciting. Galbraith better kick this series into high gear!

Interesting considering she blames her ""failure"" as an artist on the fact that she's a woman (maybe that's why she goes by Harry). Harry marries an art dealer named Felix and they have two children together, a daughter and a son. For years, Harry stood in her revered husband's shadow, and never reached the level of success that she felt she deserved. After Felix dies, Harry arranges three exhibitions of her work, though they are presented under the name of male artists, her beards. The first two go swimmingly; the third implodes. From there, Harry spins out of control of her life.Hustvedt must be a brilliant woman, possibly too brilliant for me. This story is told through interviews with Harry's friends and family, and excerpts from her diary entries—both sources bounce over philosophy, literature, art, and body fluids to the point that she lost me on multiple occasions.

So, BEND, NOT BREAK is either a perfect example of why I don't, or it's simply a terrible book. Ping Fu must be a brilliant person. She apparently overcame great odds as a young girl in China, was then ""quietly expelled"" from China, and eventually succeeded in America as the head of Geomagic, a software company that works to create 3D products. This memoir, however, is poorly written (style-wise), full of inaccuracies (many since recounted by the author), and begs for, alternately, pity or admiration. It goes from ""Poor, poor me,"" to ""Aren't I amazing!"" in 0 - 60 words. She generally takes all the credit for her successes, but none of the blame for her failures. For example, on page 260 of the paperback edition, she says, ""Still, I don't know how my thesis research [on female infanticide in China] had gotten me in trouble."" Really? Such a smart person, and yet she couldn't figure out why the Chinese government under Chairman Mao would object to that? Alternately ... on page 130, Ping Fu tells about the birth of her daughter: ""The birth was easy. Nurses said that in all their years of midwifing, they had never seen a delivery like mine: I didn't push my baby out with cries of pain, but with hysterical laughter."" Okay, people, I've had four children. The second one I delivered by myself at home (it happened that fast). Giving birth was easy for me, but NO ONE laughs their way through it. Trust me.If those examples aren't enough, I could cite numerous passages of Ping Fu's false modesty. To summarize the temporary failure/setback of her company, Geomagic, Ping blames her lack of confidence to trust herself. In other words, I am so smart, I should have never hired another CEO. He was just a front, and I would have done better. And, including this comment from Stuart Frantz, one of her board members: ""I always thought you were a visionary, Ping. You're also psychic."" just enforces her gigantic ego. I view this book as a failure and a bore.

It's all about Melinda sleeping with every single single guy who moves into their tiny northeastern town of Little Wesley. Seriously, that's all it's about. Melinda has affair after affair, while Vic sits back and does nothing (until he does ""something""). Highsmith's writing is clean and crisp, though the dialogue is stilted and overly formal.

In deed, the opening chapter presented an intriguing situation and left me with many questions about the rest of the story. So I bought the book. In brief, THAT NIGHT is about a teenage couple in the early 60s that is torn apart after the girl gets pregnant and sent away. Published in 1987, THAT NIGHT by Alice McDermott, is one of the rare books where the narrator is not the protagonist. The most famous example of this technique is F. Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY. In that book, the protagonist, Jay Gatsby, dies before the end of the story—thus the reason he can't be the narrator. McDermott gives us crumbs of personal information about her chosen narrator (a young neighbor-girl who remains unnamed throughout), so little information, in fact, it made me beg for more, it made me keep reading to find out why this particular girl is telling the story. (We don't even know she's a girl until late in Chapter one.) By the end, I was disappointed that my questions were not answered satisfactorily. There are nothing more than vague reasons why this girl is telling the story. It feels forced, as if McDermott simply wanted to attempt a story like The Great Gatsby.McDermott sprinkles this novel with some beautiful, astute observations and clever ticks of humanity, though to pull them out of context to list them here would diminish their impact. My biggest issue with this novel was the POV. The narrator, the young neighbor, tells the story in an omniscient point of view. She tells us the story with God-like knowledge, getting in the minds and lives of the other characters, knowledge she simply couldn't know unless she was the protagonist's psychiatrist or pastor or ultimate best friend. She ends up being nothing more than a neighbor on that crucial night. I think McDermott should have either eliminated the narrator, or given us her viewpoint, not an omniscient voice.Ultimately, I feel this was a failed attempt at a challenging literary technique.Three Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 04, 2014","Jul 20, 2014","Apr 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12071679-that-night

Capote artfully recaps the horrific, seemingly random murders of a Kansas family in November, 1959. The book was published in 1966, and in 1967, it was made into a popular and highly acclaimed movie. You see, I grew up in Kansas in the 60s and 70s, and the story of the Clutter family murders was legendary in my little-girl world. The name alone ""In Cold Blood,"" is intended to send a chill up your spine, as it did mine. I was too afraid to watch the movie or read the book—until now. IN COLD BLOOD is touted as the first non-fiction novel. (Novels are fiction, and tell a story with a plot. Theoretically, the reader wants to keep reading to find out how it ends. We, of course, know the ending of this story before we pick up the book.) The beauty of Capote's telling is that he reveals the facts in such a suspenseful, captivating way that the reader is continually engaged and fascinated. I think this is due to the chronological format Capote uses to walk us through the crime, the depth of the details he includes, and the way he alternates chapters between the investigators trying to solve the crime with the two criminals' life stories. He puts the reader in the story.Capote was a brilliant writer, and by all accounts a very colorful person; I would love to have known him.

DEFENDING JACOB, by William Landay is a riveting story, but I can't say it was perfeOnce again, I wish Goodreads would let ers give half-stars. DEFENDING JACOB, by William Landay is a riveting story, but I can't say it was perfect. Nonetheless, in debating between four stars or five, I rounded up this time. DEFENDING JACOB is the story of fourteen-year-old Jacob Barber who is accused of killing a classmate. Jacob's father, Andy, is the Assistant District Attorney who would have been in charge of the case if it hadn't involved his son. This is a very well-written, unsentimental story. It is gripping and a bit scary—well, scary as in unsettling.Much like the technique Vladimir Nabokov used in LOLITA, Landay has the father narrate the story from a witness stand. We know he's testifying before a grand jury, but Landay peppers in anxious comments and oblique hints that there's more going on than just the trial of Jacob. This was brilliant. During Jacob's trial, we are never quite certain which way the jury will vote, guilty or not guilty. The primary characters, Jacob, Andy, and Laurie, the mother/wife, are so well-drawn that they feel like your neighbors. (I imagine that's why they have such common names.) Landay portrays the father's stern professionalism, the mother's emotional distress, and the teenaged boy's reticence so accurately that I felt I knew them. Plus, Landay adds a sense of humor in the early pages—where it still seems appropriate—that makes me think he could write for a sitcom if he wanted. Landay is an excellent observer of humanity.What's more ... The ending comes an incredible shock. Talk about a twist! It inches toward unbelievable, or maybe it begs for a sequel, but it was very powerful. It's one of those elements that make me want to talk to other readers to see what they thought about it. (To be more specific would be a major spoiler.)All that being said, DEFENDING JACOB was a bit too long. Landay was a lawyer/assistant district attorney before he began writing. In other words, he knows too much. I'm sure no good lawyer could stand to present a partial case, and I imagine that carries over into his writing. My biggest knock of this book is that the technical details of Jacob's trial bog it down a bit. I listened to this as an audiobook so I couldn't skip over the boring parts because it's difficult to flip back if you missed a key line. So, despite my minor grievances, I highly recommend DEFENDING JACOB, especially for anyone who likes courtroom dramas.Five Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 18, 2014","May 21, 2014","Mar 29, 2014",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/13551922-defending-jacob

It addresses the inside life of Augustus, a severely disfigured young boy. Specifically, it follows him through the fifth grade, his first year in a public school. It deeply explores his emotions, as well as those people close to him. WONDER is well-written and extremely touching. I challenge anyone not to get choked up at the end of this story (and possibly several places throughout). Palacio chose to give Augustus and several other key characters their own (First Person) chapter, thus getting inside each person's head one by one. This was probably the right decision, as it would have been tough to pull off an Omniscient point of view for all characters at the same time. My problem with this choice, however, was that it slowed down the narrative and made the story a bit tedious. So that Palacio could illustrate specific events through multiple characters' eyes, she had to repeat these key scenes multiple times. I also felt the narrative was a bit preachy at times; a little more subtlety might have made it a stronger book.Everybody has at one time or another encountered people with visible disabilities—whether it be a bald head due to chemotherapy, someone in a wheelchair, or someone, such as Augustus with a birth defect—and this book truly, deeply addresses that awkward moment.

Munroe is a woman who typically dresses and behaves like a man to travel and work in a world that doesn't treat women well. Munroe is a troubled person. She grew up in Africa in an abusive and violent environment where she learned survival skills the hard way. Her childhood shaped her and has never left her. Instead, she uses the knowledge and skills she learned growing up to exact information from terrorists, kidnappers, and the like. In THE CATCH, Munroe has traveled back to Africa to keep herself away from the man she loves—because she brings violence and heartache to those she loves the most. She is soon forced to join the crew of a security team aboard a ship traveling through the pirate-infested waters off Somalia. When the ship is indeed taken over by pirates, Munroe is called to action to help good triumph over evil. I have read all of Stevens' novels, and can say THE CATCH is the most cerebral of her stories. For much of this book, the action takes place in Munroe's head. After being injured in an early fight, she must out-think and out-scheme several nefarious delegations, including Russian, Somalian, and Kenyan. If thriller heroes have ""superpowers,"" Munroe's is her intelligence, with lightning fast reflexes as a close second. She speaks more than a dozen languages and can learn a new language in a matter of days. This is how she can play one team off the next while staying one step ahead of everyone. Stevens' writing is terse and gritty, just like Munroe. Any flowery or sentimental writing would be out of place here. Stevens, who herself spent much of her childhood in Africa, knows that continent and its ways very well. I referred to a map multiple times to get a better feel for where the action was happening. (I wish the publisher would print a map at the beginning of her novels!) If you like a brainy, thrilling story, you should read THE CATCH.Four thrilling Stars.[Note: I won an advanced copy of this novel in a contest, but would absolutely have read it anyway!

Since I am none of the above, I can say this: Stoner is a near-perfect book, though I found it a bit ... quiet for my taste. If you've read very many of my other s on Goodreads, you know I prefer a stronger plot. STONER is the story of William Stoner, a Midwestern farmer who disappoints his family by studying English at college (and then becomes an English professor) instead of returning to the family farm. Stoner soon falls in love with a young lady he barely knows, marries her, and they have a child. Over the next forty years, Stoner's life is one disappointment after another. He lives a life of quiet desperation.The beauty of STONER is the study of humanity that Williams illuminates for us. He relays a depth of character that few writers can describe, from falling suddenly in love to falling painfully slowly out of love, from elation to depression, from isolation to escapism, and on and on. The levels of mood and thought that Williams touches on cross an impressive range. One unique quality that I noticed in STONER is Williams' use of oxymorons. Time and again, Williams describes people or events with adjectives such as: ""safely irresponsible""; or, ""a frail strength""; or, ""a distant closeness."" Taken out of context like this, they may seem reckless or nonsensical, but in the story, they shine a brilliant light on the characters.

I loved THE GOLDFINCH, 2013's Pulitzer Prize winner of Fiction, and I loved THE SECRET HISTORY, her debut novel. Having read both books, I can say they share a theme of sorts: What does the weight of a secret do to your mind? THE SECRET HISTORY is the tale of Richard Papen, a smart but poor kid with negligent parents, who aches to assimilate with a group of five eccentric Classics students at a small Vermont college. These five—four boys and a girl who is a twin to one of the boys—are under the tutelage of Julian Morrow, a brilliant yet out-of-touch professor who does not prevent his insular class from taking their ancient studies to their extremes. Did the rituals of ancient Greeks create the myths they are so famous for? The story builds until the group has their answer; then chronicles the group's implosion as they deal with the consequences of what they learned, and what they did. Yes, things happened. Thus the history of their secret.Tartt has become one of my very favorite writers. Every sentence in this novel is perfect: packed with detail yet still lyrical. She has created seven unique characters (Richard, plus the five students, plus the professor). They are distinctly different, yet completely familiar. Each is drawn with his/her own voice, quirks, and responses to the pivotal point of the book. The conclusion is surprising yet completely realistic.About three-fifths of the way through the story, I felt it dragged a bit, but not enough to alter my opinion. Both Donna Tartt and The Secret History are incredible.

At 850 pages, and written in 1870, MiddReading George Eliot's MIDDLEMARCH once won't be enough, though I'm thrilled to say I have indeed finished it. At 850 pages, and written in 1870, Middlemarch is not for the feint of heart. It is deep and dense and arguably perfect. Many individuals and ""Best Books"" lists rate it as The Best Novel Ever Written. I don't disagree, once you get into it. Middlemarch enforces the adage ""People never change."" The emotions, reactions, behaviors, and inner thoughts of the characters are no different than any of us today. It further supports my belief that a person, any one specific person, CAN change; it's humanity on the whole that hasn't changed for at least hundreds of years. And that's what makes this book a classic for all time.Where to begin? First, George Eliot was the pen name of Mary Ann Evans, a mostly self-taught journalist and philosopher who later turned to fiction. She was a progressive, much too smart and headstrong to let the mores of her day stop her from fulfilling her ambitions which is why she published under a man's name. Her other notable books include SILAS MARNER, ADAM BEDE, and DANIEL DERONDA. (I admire her so much I named my dog George Eliot.)Middlemarch is a fictional village in the middle of England, filled with middle-class people. I imagine Eliot wanted to illustrate that every life is full and deep and complicated, not just Charles Dickens's orphans or Thackery's socialites. And so she sets off to tell us about seemingly every resident of the town. The novel began, however, as two separate novels of two specific characters, Dorothea Brooke, a ""handsome"" yet headstrong young woman; and Tertius Lydgate, a progressive doctor who seems to have no luck at all, so these two tie most of the others together. Eliot ""knew"" her characters better than (or as well as) any other novelist has ever known his/her characters.Middlemarch, the book, is a perfect example of the Omniscient point of view. The unnamed narrator knows all and tells all. The story is both broad sweeping and intimately specific. Eliot leads us so smoothly between characters that the book reads like a ""single shot"" movie, wherein directors like Hitchcock (or a recent favorite, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, director of Birdman) never seem to stop the camera; each character leads us to—then leaves us with—another character who continues the story. This stresses the point that ""No man is an island."" We are all interconnected in our circles. How we treat our barista in the morning could affect how he treats his coworkers which could affect how they treat their spouse and children that night. This technique is both realistic and humorous because the characters of Middlemarch are quite serious and busy, yet taken as a whole, we see the ridiculousness of people. Exaggerated by the customs and mores of the time (the novel is set in 1830s, England), Eliot illustrates how honest communication trumps all. When people are dishonest, or simply don't speak up, then misunderstandings occur. Again, this is, in turn, either quite serious or quite funny. This even becomes a driver for the plot: the fact that women weren't allowed to speak their minds, and that even men were not supposed to defend themselves, kept me turning the pages to find out how each storyline would play out and who would speak up for whom. (I am not being very specific because to give one illustration would lead to another which would lead to another, and this  would never end.)One last accolade ... I listened to the audio version of this book, performed by the brilliant Juliet Stevenson. Stevenson has recorded many, many books (look her up), and she does an award winning job with Middlemarch. She switches between languages and accents and genders flawlessly throughout this broad-sweeping story. She is unparalleled.As a writer, I view Middlemarch as a prototype: The perfect novel has been done; now take bits and pieces of this book to create your own. And by bits and pieces, I mean ""Do not write an omniscient POV story about an entire village"" lest all novels would be 850 pages.Five Perfect Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,2,"Jun 08, 2017Sep 10, 2015","Jul 18, 2017Feb 08, 2016","Feb 24, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/271276.Middlemarch

This novel speeds it up into a ""little infinity."" THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is brilliant and funny and heartbreaking and perfect. It touches the deepest human emotions, including humor. In a way, it's an instruction manual on how to talk to people who are dying, and how to live while we're dying. Read this book. In fact, I think I'll heed my own advice and read it again.

He pursues typical worldly comforts (women, prestige, salary, a fine home, etc.) until he becomes ill. His illness overtakes him (on about page 35 of my copy), and as he suffers more and more until his eponymous death, he examines his life to figure out why he must suffer so much.I won't explain what he discovers (that would be a spoiler), but the more you know about Tolstoy's life post-ANNA KARENINA, the less of a surprise the ending will be for you.

This novella (118 pages) is written as one paragraph. No breaks, no chapters, no help at all for the reader. In deed, there are numerous 400+ word sentences. Yes, single sentences that run for nearly two pages.By Night In Chile is the deathbed rambling (confession?) of Father Sebastián Urrutia Lacroix, an elderly Chilean priest who is mentally searching for ""the wizened youth,"" a young man whom Urrutia wants to confront. A scholar, poet, literary critic and world traveler, Father Urrutia recounts the major events of his life (seemingly without pause for a breath!) where he crossed paths with ""the wizened youth."" This rambling leads him to a startling revelation. Bolaño's skill in pulling off this literary feat—and it is no less than astounding—is unparalleled. This book should come with a warning to young writers: ""Professional writer at his best. Do not attempt this on your own."" It has been criticized by many for being pedantic (or worse), and it wasn't until halfway through the book that I began to appreciate it for what it is. In retrospect, this story would have lost all its power without the nonstop, stream-of-consciousness telling. Bolaño knew that.This is a book that would become deeper and more brilliant with subsequent readings, or being discussed with others who've read it. at 118 pages, that's doable.

Loren has ""created a world,"" a story that she seems intimately familiar with, but one that is probably foreign to most of America. Set in the Colorado prairie, as well as the desert of New Mexico, and touching on an Indian Reservation, her setting is an integral element of this novel. Essentially, this is the story of Willa, a woman called in to search for Zeb, her older brother who's running from the authorities. Loren expertly weaves in flashbacks from 1980, the tumultuous and pivotal year of their childhood days. Now Willa hasn't seen Zeb for decades, and of course she's torn: She wants to see him, but she does not want to turn him over to the authorities. Normally, Willa tracks wolves on a New Mexico National Forest. Her goal is to reintroduce them to the wild. She works with and against the authorities at the same time. At the beginning of this novel, she is tracking two particular wolves. Loren intertwines this subplot with Willa and Zeb's story. It's a good parallel, and works well, but maybe a tad didactic. It feels like Loren wanted to educate readers on a serious issue so she wrote it into her story. A wild animal lover might have been ecstatic about this part of the book. What I liked most about THEFT was the characters. They were conflicted in many ways that felt very natural. From a young girl's fears and sadness over her mother's battle with Parkinson's, to a grown man's frustrations with an overbearing government and the true value of right vs. wrong, Loren did an excellent job of fleshing out true emotion.The title, THEFT, also deserves a little discussion. The novel is not about a physical robbery; it is a metaphor for multiple things that are stolen from us in life. I love the title. It's punchy and enigmatic at the same time.THEFT is a novel of layers. There are many themes woven in the plot and subplots. I think this is a book that would continue to unfold with subsequent readings.Four Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 23, 2014","Apr 05, 2014","Jan 15, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13239398-theft

LIFE AFTER LIFE, by Kate Atkinson, received a lot of press in 2013; some of it glowing, some of it critical. I am SO glad I read this acclaimed book. LIFE AFTER LIFE, by Kate Atkinson, received a lot of press in 2013; some of it glowing, some of it critical. I don't want to shy away from books just because some people find them challenging. But, you can see from the number of stars I gave LIFE AFTER LIFE, that I came down on the critical side.Atkinson ""swung for the bleachers"" with this book. (It's the first of hers I've read.) In my opinion, she struck out. There's no question Atkinson is a skilled writer. Her prose is lovely (I underlined many poignant phrases), her characters are distinct, and the concept is captivating: ""What if you could live again and again, until you got it right?"" Unfortunately, the format failed. This story is about Ursula Todd, who is born and reincarnated multiple times in the 525 pages of the novel. She is always born in England on the 10th of February, 1911 to the same parents, but her life takes different paths until, I suppose in the author's mind, she ""gets it right."" I imagine all the pieces to this jigsaw puzzle of a book are here, the reader just needs to fit them together the way Atkinson did in the months she wrote it. Yeah, well, I have too many other books I want to read to spend that much time fitting the pieces together in order to deem it brilliant.(Here come a few spoilers …)In addition to Ursula, there are many key characters: siblings, parents, an aunt, neighbors, friends, boyfriends, etc., who all factor in to the story. One of my primary criticisms is that Atkinson never explains why many of them behave the way they do. Brother Maurice is obnoxious throughout yet we never learn why; Sylvie, Ursula's mother, goes from loving to bitter to suicidal, but Atkinson never tells us what happened to her—there were multiple hints of infidelity, yet no revelations. If an author's going to make such a big deal about a character's personality, she should explain his/her actions. My biggest criticism of this book, however, comes between pages 300 - 450 (approximately). [Spoiler alert:] Ursula finds herself in Germany, best friends with Eva Braun, Adolf Hitler's real-life mistress and later wife of forty hours. During Ursula's final (I think) incarnation, she murders Hitler—this is in the prologue! Atkinson gives us 150 pages of Ursula living through WWII, aiding the wounded, and eking out an existence at what has to be one of the worst periods of history. It was TEDIOUS to say the least. ""We must bear witness."" Yes, I realize that, but Atkinson gave the best part of that storyline away in the prologue! Instead of just putting her in the room with Hitler, with a gun in her purse, Ursula kills him on page 2! That seems to be the ""seed"" of the novel much like Stephen King in ""11/22/63"" sends his protagonist back to see if he can stop the assassination of President Kennedy. So, not only is the basis for the novel NOT original, it's tedious. Plus, while Ursula's in Germany, we assume she's going to meet her cousin who was adopted by a German family at birth. Ursula meets several German men, yet none of them turn out to be her cousin (or do they? It was never made clear!). Atkinson set this subplot up like a slow-pitch to a slugger, yet it was never completed. There was one character, Jürgen, who might have been him, but we never find out! Argh! What I liked best about this book was Ursula herself. Ursula learned from her ""mistakes,"" and she had strong, independent thoughts (at least in her later lives). She wasn't strong enough though to save the book.Two and a half stars, rounded up to Three Stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 12, 2014","Feb 09, 2014","Jan 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790842-life-after-life

Excitement or frustration, both inspire immediate actSometimes when I read a book, I want to  it right away because it sparks excitement in me. Excitement or frustration, both inspire immediate action. THE FLAMETHROWERS by Rachel Kushner is not one of those books. THE FLAMETHROWERS was on beaucoup Top Books of 2013 lists, including the NYTimes Top Five Novels. Because of that, because I can admit those critics are probably smarter than I, I wanted to let this book resonate to see how I felt about it days later. My opinion hasn't changed: This book is highly overrated. Kushner can laugh herself to the bank with that, I'm sure.Don't get me wrong. There are dozens of brilliant observations and comments about life throughout this book. But there are also entire chapters that are bizarre, tangental, and confusing. My comments through the book range from ""Great observation. Relatable, and universal"" (Pg. 24), to ""Preachy"" (Pg. 123), to ""WTF?"" (the entire 10th chapter), to ""This is the stuff of brilliance"" (page 325). Kushner weaves two stories together—one begins in Italy in 1916; the other in Nevada and New York in the 70s—and deftly links them through Sandro Vallera, the son of the Italian protagonist. Gold Star for that. ""Reno"" is the protagonist for the later story, an artist who moves to NYC to follow her dreams. Reno and Sandro are both artists, as are most of their friends. As a former art dealer, I was really excited for that storyline. Unfortunately, Kushner disappointed me by dropping random famous names to make her story seem more authentic. It felt like she found the answers to a Jeopardy category: ""New York Artists from the 70s, Alex."" The names she mentions and the actions of these artists had little or nothing to do with her story. Mentioning them felt forced as a way of marking the correct decade.My most particular critique is this: Reno, the young, female artist who's trying to make it in NYC, is without a doubt the protagonist. But who exactly is the antagonist? This is Reno's story, the other characters just float through for a few paragraphs or chapters. Even Sandro, the character with the second most scenes, doesn't seem to be the antagonist. He screws up their relationship (literally), and then Gianni comes in. Before and after Sandro, we had Ronnie. Perhaps ""life lessons"" is the driving antagonistic force? That seemed vague to me.I suppose that when a book gets such superior accolades, it's human nature to look for its faults. Damn expectations! I could go on with a few other rants (How does Reno speak such fluent Italian after so much time passed from her only trip there? Why make such a big deal about Reno's skiing acumen if she doesn't ski in the final scene at the ski slope?), but these are starting to sound picky.Suffice it to say, lower your expectations and you might really enjoy this book. There's a lot to enjoy with THE FLAMETHROWERS, but it won't make my Top Five books of the year. I am left hoping that one of my close friends reads this book so that we can discuss it. I'd love to know what I'm missing.Three and a half stars, rounded up to Four Stars for its occasional brilliance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 13, 2013","Jan 11, 2014","Dec 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15803141-the-flamethrowers

The first time I read it (see my original  below), I loved it for many reasons. While most of them still hold true for me, I have to say I didn't find it worthy of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction which it won since my previous .Donna Tartt is a storyteller extraordinaire. I love the depth of her details and the reaches of her imagination. I am surprised however by her abundant usage of adverbs and clichés. This alone should have knocked it out of contention for the Pulitzer, in my opinion. Beyond that, while I grew extremely tired of Theo and Boris's use of drugs during my first reading, I accepted it because I was so into the story. The second time through (plus hearing how tired everyone else grew of it too) made me realize that it was truly way over done. I would recommend this book only to people who love an epic novel. I would also knock this down to 4.5 Stars if Goodreads would let me. FIRST READING: Jan 31, 2014You know how sometimes a person, or a thought, or a book hits your life at just the right moment, and you learn something from him/her/it? And you somehow know that if it had happened at any other time in your life, it might never have touched you in the same way? Well, THE GOLDFINCH hit me at just the right moment. I loved this book.THE GOLDFINCH is 771 pages. Is that too long? Probably. Yet I can't think of a single scene I would remove. Even during the passages where I wondered, What's the point of this? Where is it going? Yeah, Donna Tartt always answered those questions in due time.Where to begin? The prose, the plot, the characters, the theme? All wonderful and unique. Tartt's description of each character is so vivid, so fantastically specific that I could picture each one in turn. What a lesson in flawed characters! Even the ones we're ""supposed"" to like, we don't always. And isn't that the way it is in real life? Don't you even dislike your best friend every now and then? Get a little mad at your spouse on occasion? Exactly. THE GOLDFINCH is the story of Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old boy who finds himself in possession of a masterwork of art from the Metropolitan Museum after a terrorist bombing that killed his mother. The way Tartt leads him from that shell-shocked boy to a damaged man of twenty-eight feels so realistic, so deep and probable that if someone told me this was based on a true story, I would probably believe it. Not that I have much in common with Theo or his childhood friend, Boris, or his mentor, Dobie, or any of the other characters (at least not the big stuff), but I loved them all because of how this story ended. The ending was perfect. Plausible, yet not sweetly Hollywood-slick. Though, the book is so descriptive, it could easily be turned into a movie.I would love to discuss the theme of this book and the character development (Theo is the perfect example of a reluctant hero), but I don't want to give too much away. If you're debating on this book due to the length, let me say, Yes, it's long and winding, but the journey is fabulous and the ending will feel like a reward. I have a few knocks against the book, but they're not important enough to alter my rating.I will be choosing this book for my book club because I am eager to discuss so many elements. Also, if anyone is curious, not only did I read the book, I listened to it on audible.com. The narrator, David Pittu, does an excellent job with a multitude of characters and foreign accents. The audio version added so much to my reading experience. I highly recommend it.Five drunk, gritty, gorgeous Stars (Read the book; you'll understand.)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 15, 2014","Sep 02, 2014","Nov 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

I wouldn't even have picked it up if it hadn't been chosen by a friend for our book club. Thank you, friend.GIRLCHILD is fiction, listed as a novel, though it's not by any means typical. Each ""chapter"" is more like a diary entry, some as short as a paragraph. In fact, as a writer, I felt that many of Tupelo Hassman's ""entries"" were more typical of ""backstory notes"" or ""research"" or ""mind-mapping;"" the details that authors must invent, yet typically don't spell-out in their novels. But Hassman's technique worked beautifully.GIRLCHILD is the gritty story of Rory Dawn, a young girl growing up in a trailer park outside of Reno. She's the only daughter of an alcoholic single mother who herself is the daughter of a gambling addict. Most of their troubles go down hill from there. Rory, though, is very bright, bright enough to see that there is more to the world than their dysfunctional existence, and bright enough to set her sights beyond the gravel road that leads to her dead-end development. The question is, Is she bright enough to escape the world that most have no hope of escaping?Any  of GIRLCHILD would not be complete without comments on Hassman's writing, or rather the ""voice"" of Rory Dawn. Hassman's bio says she received an MFA from Columbia (!), yet in interviews she explains that she spent many of her childhood years in a trailer park. That explains so much because Rory's point of view and language sounds tragically authentic. There was at least one scene that brought tears to my eyes, and a few scenes that made me cheer. Hassman is known to be a poet, and her sentences reinforce that. Even as she describes squalor, alcoholism, sexual abuse, bullying, and desperation her sentences sing. I underlined and dogeared many, many passages. As is typical of me, I want to BEG Goodreads to let us use half-stars. I would give GIRLCHILD 4.5 stars, but I'm rounding this one down. There were a few inconsistencies that kept it out of Five Star territory, namely the epistolary entries from Rory's grandmother.

That's like seeing a movie that just won a Golden Globe for best picture: It's held to a higher standard from the opening lines, all the way through. Third, I grew up in Kansas. We studied John Brown and the abolitionists intensely in the fourth grade. Unfortunately, that memory made this book feel a bit like homework. Ooh, just thought of a fourth knock. Historical fiction that is centered on real people frustrates me to no end. I'm particular enough that I have to look up every character's name to see if he/she was real or is part of the author's poetic license. That can really slow a book down.Now that I have that out of the way, Yes, I liked THE GOOD LORD BIRD; no, I didn't love it, nor would I have voted for it for the National Book Award (I thought George Saunders' TENTH OF DECEMBER was the best book of the year). James McBride is an excellent writer, no argument there, but he gave himself a nearly impossible task: THE GOOD LORD BIRD is written in the first person, from the POV of Onion, a young boy who's masquerading as a young girl. Plus, he, Onion, is an uneducated black kid in the late 1850s. Imagine trying to get that dialect right, and still make the text understandable to those of us in the 21st century. McBride did a great job, but there seemed to be a number of inconsistencies. I love an authentic voice, but most of all I like consistency. Also, I noted several paragraphs where I felt the prose was redundant/repetitive. McBride would ""show"" us and ""tell"" us the same thing in a single paragraph. If I had been his editor, I would have eliminated several sentences throughout that I thought detracted from his prose. McBride (via Onion) presents John Brown as one crazy, religious zealot. Again, I have to stop and wonder if Brown was known to be as McBride depicted him, or if that just made for a better story. My fourth grade teacher never mentioned his personality traits. Does that matter to anyone but me? If I hadn't been reading this for my book club, I might have just sunk into my sofa and rode along with Captain Brown, Onion, and the gang, suffering through the icy winters and bloody battles on the plains. I love history, and I love fiction, but somehow mixing the two brings up the aforementioned frustrations.One curious point that McBride made repeatedly was Onion's desire to run off from John Brown and his small army, but he never does. Now, it's apparent that Onion has no place to go, but that never seems to stop his desire to break away. Is McBride trying to illustrate Hope? That as long as we think we can better our lives, we can keep going? Or, what? This comment was repeated so many times, that I fully expected Onion would follow through and leave, but he doesn't. Obviously, in first person POV, the character must be in each scene for us to know the story so Onion needed to stay with Brown up until the bitter end, but I have to wonder about McBride's point was in repeating that so many times. I'm going to go with the message of Hope. I like that idea best. I had thought that because of the Prologue, McBride would end his book with an Epilogue that could wrap up the story without Onion being present.In the closing pages, specifically page 414 in the hardback edition, THE GOOD LORD BIRD's themes jump poetically off the page. To me, the themes seemed to be ""Perspective"" and ""Authenticity."" John Brown (a religious, white optimist on a mission) and Onion (a non-believing, black orphan who just wants to grow up) are intentionally opposite characters. It's natural that different people see the world differently, and this story helps us to ""walk a mile in their shoes."" On page 415, Captain Brown teaches Onion the importance of being true to one's self. ""Whatever you is, Onion, be it full."" Plus, the lessons we learn in life, if we share them, will empower those of future generations. Those are powerful messages. I'm giving THE GOOD LORD BIRD Four Stars. I might like it better after my book club discussion, but as it registers in my personal library, it doesn't rise above four....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 21, 2013","Dec 11, 2013","Oct 31, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16171272-the-good-lord-bird

The front flap will tell you that VISITATION STREET is about the disappearance of ""June,"" a fifteen-year old girl who goes out in a raft in the bay off Red Hook, Brooklyn, with her best friend Val. But somehow, the story isn't really about June's disappearance in the typical police procedural/crime novel way. The story is about the people of Red Hook—the imperfect, struggling, conflicted people of a disadvantaged neighborhood—who are connected to the event in very different ways. Pochoda, who used to live in Red Hook, wrote this novel in present tense. She leads us down the local sidewalks and makes us feel like we are walking along the broken, eerie streets with each character as he or she tells us how they are affected by or dealing with June's disappearance. The story is quiet, yet captivating.I should say that it took me a few chapters to really get into the story, but I think that was because I was expecting something much different, a typical mystery, if you will. VISITATION STREET is Literary first, Mystery second. But the more I read, the more I loved this book. Pochoda's turn of a phrase or description of ... well, basically, anything, is phenomenal.

I can't take three or four hundred pages of that anymore. This is the story of Willa, daughter of a famous theorist, wife of a tech-demi-god, friend of a daredevil … But Willa seemed too weak throughout the story to be the ""heroine.""

I would not have picked it up on my own because I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction. That being said, Kathleen Grissom did a wonderful job with this, her debut novel. Grissom's writing is clean and formal, as it should be when relating a story from circa 1800 set in Virginia. The premise—that a seven-year-old Irish girl who is orphaned on her trip to America becomes an indentured servant of the captain of their ship, and then is raised by his slaves until she is sixteen—must be historically accurate because the author did years of research for this book. However, let me start by saying that this shocked me. Were little white girls truly made ""indentured servants"" in the late-18th Century? Why was she indentured in the first place? The girl, Lavinia, was a red-headed, freckle-faced, traumatized orphan who looked a lot like the ship captain's wife? Wouldn't her parents have paid their way BEFORE they got on the ship? Yes. Then why would she be indentured to anyone? But if there was reason for her to be ""indentured,"" would they really have sent her to the kitchen house to be raised by the slaves? Isn't it more likely that she would have served the family in the ""big"" house? Beyond that, Grissom created realistic characters that I really cared about. Her portrayal of the slaves seemed spot on, the Pyke family also seemed highly authentic (based on other books and movies I've read and seen over the years), but the most captivating aspect was the interaction between the Pyke family and their slaves. It was in turns both tender and horrifying. [On a side note, I went to see 12 Years a Slave, a movie directed by Steve McQueen, while reading this book. His portrayal of the true story of Solomon Northup, a free white man who was kidnapped and enslaved in Georgia, was eerily similar to Grissom's portrayal of the same time period.] My biggest knock on this book, other than I never understood why Lavinia was indentured in the first place, was this: Lavinia, from about age nine to twenty, is remarkably (unbelievably) wise and insightful, except when it came to the white men in the story. Perhaps, after losing her real mother and father, she lost her natural teachers about matters of the heart, but her ""black family"" taught her everything else about life and love. Lavinia was completely blind when it came to Marshall and Ben's actions, the two white males who were about her age. That dichotomy frustrated me. My favorite part of this book was the plot. It became more and more exciting near the end. Yes, that's as it should be, but it's not always the case, especially with literary fiction. My favorite books, in general, are well-written, plot-driven stories.

THE SILENT WIFE is far better (miles beyond!) GONE GIRL. They are often compared because they have similar plots, though they were released so close together I am sure that's just a coincidence. In THE SILENT WIFE, Jodi and Todd are a couple; they've been together for twenty years, though they never actually got married. Todd is a real estate developer who has multiple affairs. Jodi is a part-time therapist with her own issues. The back cover of the novel tells us that Jodi kills Todd, and that more than anything keeps us turning the pages to find out when and how. After it happens, the final fifty pages are even more riveting because the reader is dying to know if she gets away with it. A.S.A. Harrison, who died of cancer before this book was published, was a wonderful writer. Her sentences are clean and sparse. Her observations of people are often startlingly poignant. She dove deeply into her characters psyches. Harrison wrote four non-fiction books before THE SILENT WIFE. I am curious if she was a psychologist herself (there is very little biographical information about her online).My issues with this book center mostly around money—income, expenses, costs, etc. The characters seemed to live way beyond their means … but that's a trivial point considering what a great story this is.

I actually made a list with LIKE and DISLIKE elements. Although I would say I liked this book, my dislike column was twice as long as my likes.Briefly, NIGHT FILM is the story of an investigative journalist, Scott McGrath, who sets out to discern wether a young girl's death was suicide or murder. The young girl, Ashley Cordova, is the daughter of an eccentric and reclusive movie director known for his horror films. McGrath has had previous dealings with the father, Stanislas Cordova, and McGrath's career was nearly ruined because of it. Additionally, the book is FILLED with multi-media images: fictitious web pages; newspaper clippings; pages torn from phone books; polaroid images; and most importantly, a symbol that lets the reader (via the book's very own phone app and QR reader) scan a symbol to ""find out more!""Let's start with what I liked: Marisha Pessl's imagination must roar through her brain in techni-color! Wow, the plot of this book (plus the story lines of all of Stanislas Cordova's ""films"") is amazing. The best way I can describe it is like this: Imagine taking a 24-hour roller coaster ride, with harrowing climbs, terrifying falls, sharp turns and twists and loop-de-loops, all while traveling through NYC's Central Park, witchcraft stores, abandoned warehouses, creepy forests, mile-long mazes of pure darkness ... Then, in the final pages, your roller coaster pulls back into the station and stops. You look at your friends in amazement and wonder, ""Did that really happen?"" It's almost mystical. Pessl has ""created a world"" that sweeps the reader off his/her feet. Pessl's plot is definitely the driving force in this book—it's a page-turner. We really want to know the ""truth"" behind the Cordova mystique. Okay, that's all the Likes I had. Now for the rest of the story:I felt the writing was sub-par. Not as bad as Stephenie Meyer's TWILIGHT series, but way below what I expected for a book with this much press and praise. (I have long felt that ""Concept"" trumps ""Quality"" in many books.) Pessl's sentences are clunky, often slowing down the narrative. Her excessive use of ITALICS made me want to scream and throw the book down. Did she think her readers weren't smart enough to get what her characters were trying to say? Her best writing, in my opinion, was when she wrote the ""copy"" for her fictitious news clippings. Why did she have to ruin the book with her italics? Why didn't an editor overrule her desire for said italics? Additionally, I felt her metaphors and similes, for the most part, fell flat. They often didn't seem to make sense, or have any relation to the characters and situations. (I could list numerous examples, but this  is already stretching quite long.) Her male protagonist was unconvincing. He ""thought"" like a girl. Plus, McGrath, the freelance journalist is apparently quite rich—there's an oxymoron! He owns a home in NY's West Village, and throws money around like a hedge fund manager. Later, he is joined in his search by two young people who had had interactions with Ashley, the deceased daughter. I thought their trio felt forced and unrealistic. My last point is the interactive element, the app and symbol-reader. So we all know that most movies don't live up to their books, right? One of the book's best qualities was its creepiness. (The cover is fantastic!) I hesitated to download the app because I wanted to read the book on its own merits. Near the end of the book though, I thought, I should at least check it out, know what it's about, to give a full . I was so disappointed when I did. The few symbols I scanned led me to shiny, pretty, Hollywood images of beautiful girls applying firetruck-red lipstick in million-dollar bathrooms. It completely ruined the spooky feel of her story! If Pessl wanted to make movies, she should have done so. (Yes, she has already sold the movie rights to this book, so it shouldn't be long before her glossy film is in a theatre near you.)In closing, while Pessl has a great talent for storytelling, I think she spent way too much time on the concept and interactive elements, and not enough time on writing good sentences. At her level, verb tenses in each sentence should match. I would give this book 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down on this one.Three black stars to NIGHT FILM....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 25, 2013","Oct 15, 2013","Sep 16, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10112885-night-film

This is one of five that I purchased. I haven't gotten through them all yet, but I think it's safe to say that this one will fall to the bottom of my favorites.How To Write A Sentence and How To Read One feels a lot like a fireside chat—a very intense fireside chat. My guess is that Stanley Fish is a storyteller, a man who loves deep, intellectual discourse. He probably also likes to hear himself talk (but that's totally a guess because I've never met the man). This book discusses sentences, the key word being ""discusses."" It's more of a narrative than it is a primer. Fish offers lengthy commentary about the hows and whys of sentences. Most of his examples are old, I mean, really OLD. I haven't counted them out, but I think it's safe to say that he uses more examples from the 17th century than he does from the 20th century.Now, here's the basis for my Three Star : Mr. Fish is undoubtedly a brilliant man and a superb writer, but I'm not looking for didactic discourse from works that are nearly 500 years old. If any contemporary writer tried to write like John Milton or Francis Bacon, he or she would probably suffer great criticism and possibly even literary rejection. Yes, it's good to learn from the classics, but writing in the 21st century is a different ballgame (in certain ways). In the epilogue of this book, Mr. Fish says, ""My hope is that this discussion will be continued ..."" Again, discussion is the key word.

My first response to this book is: How in the world did any literary agent PASS on this novel? It is brilliantly written, and an expertly told whodunit. It's not a thriller by any means; it's much more literary than that. In fact, I don't think I've ever had to refer to a dictionary more times while reading a mystery novel than I did for this one. It's a high-level mindbender at its best, yet it's still a quintessential detective story. So, a brief synopsis: Cormoran Strike is a down-on-his-luck detective. He's a disabled ex-military cop. A big guy. In walks Robin, a secretarial temp—but not by any shades of grey like Anastasia! (Forgive me if I got that reference wrong; I have not read that book.) Robin is smart, attractive, and engaged to another man, though Galbraith/Rowling has definitely laid the groundwork for a relationship with these two. The case in The Cuckoo's Calling is about a supermodel who plunges to her death, which was ruled a suicide by the police. The girl's brother hires Strike to investigate because he's sure she was pushed off a balcony.I'm not sure what I liked more about this novel: the character development; or the plot. They were equally brilliant. I suppose once an author has learned how to describe characters like Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore, it's not too difficult to describe a man like Cormoran Strike. Each of her characters feels very real and very ""round."" Each of them, especially Strike and Robin, had a nice arc of enlightenment in this story. But the plot ... it too was fantastic. It never strayed from the primary line (except to briefly elucidate a character's backstory). By page 170 (out of 455), Rowling had cast doubt on every minor character as a possible murder suspect. In fact, with 50 pages remaining, I had only narrowed down the possible villain to one of three people. I love NOT being able to guess ""who did it."" Then, lo and behold: the bad guy wasn't even one of the three I had on my list! Bravo, Ms. Rowling! In the end, the unraveling of the case was just slightly a stretch (the ending of some mysteries are impossible to believe), but Strike does an excellent job of pulling all the loose threads together to determine the killer. Additionally, the writing in this novel is very smart. I underlined many well-turned phrases and descriptions. Last year, critics called Dennis Lehane's Live By Night a top literary-mystery. Well, The Cuckoo's Calling easily trumps Lehane's novel in that category. This is my kind of book: a well-written, perfect mix of plot-driven and character-driven.

Except I was afraid to. I know a few people who battle terminal illness, so I was afraid that reading this book would be too difficult (emotionally) to bear. Yet I also knew how much I wanted to because Hitchens was such a brilliant man. Now I wish I'd read it sooner, because that would have given me the opportunity to have read it many times since.Mortality is a powerful book. It is essentially a collection of articles Hitchens wrote for Vanity Fair Magazine after he was diagnosed with Stage IV esophageal cancer. Hitchens, a renowned atheist, was a force of nature. In his own words, he knowingly burned ""the candle at both ends,"" and found ""that it often gives a lovely light."" He speaks so clearly and wisely about what it's like to be sick, and how naive those of us who love a sick person can be. He speaks of his treatments with no pity or whine. He speaks about his religious friends and their efforts to pray for him. He speaks on Prayer, and Religion, and Death so brilliantly that I feel confident in using the word ""brilliant"" twice in the same short . (A more religious person may disagree with me there.)Mortality is a tough book to read because ""none of us are getting out of here alive."" This could be our own story one day, or that of a loved one. But read it. It's valuable and interesting and thought provoking. It makes me want to read everything Hitchens ever wrote, and watch the YouTube videos of him speaking.

Chris Bohjalian has written sixteen novels, several of which were NYTimes Bestsellers, one of which was an Oprah book. So he must be a good writer, right? The Light in the Ruins was my first Bohjalian novel, but unfortunately, I can't say that I liked it. In fact, I barely made it through.It's difficult to succinctly put my finger on why I didn't like it, but here are a few thoughts. One publicity blurb I read said it was a retelling of ""Romeo and Juliet."" Yeah, no. Just because an Italian woman falls in love with a man who her family does not approve of, does not make it a retelling of Romeo & Juliet. Also, I'm not a fan of Bohjalian's writing style, his use of grammar rules. Incomplete sentences. Extra details. Didn't work for me. They say the great writers can get away with NOT following the rules, but I think this book is an example of what happens when a writer tries, but fails. Third point: Mr. Bojhalian lost me with too many minor characters (red herrings?) and too many WWII facts as the various contingents fought their way through Italy. That may be the first reason that I started skipping pages. At some point, I said, Who did what? Bohjalian didn't make me CARE enough about the characters to keep them all straight. The only reason I hung on to the end was to find out whodunit. And when I found out, I was disappointed. The killer wasn't who I wanted it to be.There's no need for me to belabor my point here.

That is to say, it requires the reader to take a leap of faith. In my mind, this is a wonderful jumping off point to begin a novel.  THE ENCHANTED LIFE OF ADAM HOPE is an epic tale of three generations of a family, centered around Evelyn Roe. The story begins in 1944 when Evelyn finds ""what she takes to be a badly burned soldier"" and nurses him back to health. This ""soldier"" first becomes Evelyn's mirror image, and then he becomes Adam Hope. They marry and have five daughters. Adam Hope is obviously not ""one of us."" We learn all of this from the front flap, but I SO wish there'd been a way to hold back that information. I would love to have discovered those magical facts as I read. According to the back flap, this is Rhonda Riley's first novel, though it's evident that she has been writing for a long time. Her prose is lyrical and lovely. She writes with a unique candidness, an unabashed honesty, a rare openness concerning love and sex and even bodily functions, but not in an overtly sexual way; it has a medical sense that makes me think Ms. Riley might have been a nurse before she was a writer. Either that, or she's a very open mother. The story reminds me in ways of THE THORN BIRDS. (I can imagine Ms. Riley smiling at that.) Descriptions of the setting—first North Carolina, then Florida— evoke images of McCullough's Australia. The perfect love, and also lost love, in ADAM HOPE is reminiscent of Maggie's life in THE THORN BIRDS. If you love a lyrical, romantic tale, you will love THE ENCHANTED LIFE OF ADAM HOPE.Three stars...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 13, 2013","Jul 24, 2013","Jul 10, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15818218-the-enchanted-life-of-adam-hope

Though I have not read any of Sylvia PlatThere are undoubtedly many reasons why THE BELL JAR has become a classic American novel (published in 1963). Though I have not read any of Sylvia Plath's poetry, she was a very talented writer (she was the first poet to posthumously win the Pulitzer Prize (in 2006)). I was captivated by the story of THE BELL JAR, a thinly veiled memoir, because of its deeply personal and tragic nature. However, I must say that I think the reason this book is still actively read is because of Plath's poetry and her tragic personal life and eventual suicide—not necessarily because this debut novel stands out for its own merits.It's quite remarkable that a writer, specifically a woman in the late 1950s-early 60s, could tell the world such a devastating, heartbreaking personal story. In THE BELL JAR, Plath (1932 - 1963) retells the story of her own downward spiral—one that led her to a six-month stay in an asylum and sent her through many rounds of electroshock therapy. I cared for the protagonist, ""Esther,"" and I hurt inside when I read what she was going through. This story takes place when Esther (Plath) was 18 years old and struggling to become a writer, a time well before her troubled marriage to the poet Ted Hughes. In certain ways, Plath owes her legacy to Hughes. He inherited her estate and saw to it that much of her poetry was published posthumously, but he also burned or ""lost"" other important works after her death that allegedly incriminated him as an adulterer. They were separated at the time of her death, but not divorced. If Hughes had not inherited her estate, Plath might have been best known for subsequent novels.THE BELL JAR is a well-written, captivating story. I highlighted many lovely phrases, and Plath did an excellent job of building Esther's anxiety and chronicling her madness and pain. However, I was surprised that the writing was as simple as it was. It's very good for a debut novel, but not outstanding like I had expected it to be for a novel that has remained so well-known after all these years.

Neil Gaiman is one of those people you want to hate, but you just can't because he's so amazing. Gaiman makes everybody else feel like a first class slacker.This past week, I was going to be driving for twelve hours, so I decided to look for a new audiobook to keep me company. I think Twitter is the reason I looked this book up to consider it for my ride. Gaiman is a Twitter freak (he even thanks his 1.8M Twitter followers in his acknowledgements.) He tweets a lot, and retweets a lot. This is the first work by Gaiman I've read, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was getting a lot of raves, and the audio version is about six hours long; perfect for my trip. Knock my socks off, it did! First, the multi-talented Gaiman (that's an understatement) performs the story himself. Now, one might think that any author would be the best reader of his own story, but that is very seldom true. I equate Gaiman's performance to that of Colin Firth's THE END OF THE AFFAIR, and very close to my all-time favorite: Jeremy Irons' version of LOLITA. This is a story about a man who goes to his childhood hometown for a funeral, but pays a visit to the farmhouse of his neighbors when he was seven. When he sits beside a pond that his then-friend Lettie called an ocean, his memories come flooding back and he recites the fantastic story of himself and Lettie. And when I say ""fantastic,"" I mean it in the true sense of fantasy. Lettie is not an ordinary girl, but I'll let you discover for yourself what kind of girl she is. Now, I don't read fantasy novels, nor science-fiction, and yet I loved this story. And you will too. Gaiman makes us feel as if this fantasy world actually exists, parallel to our own. He writes about this alternate reality so vividly that we feel as if we'd known about it all along, but had simply let the knowledge recede deep into our brain like our own childhood memories. The vulnerable, inquisitive, yet unnamed narrator, at age seven, recalls a string of events that change his life. I can't say much more without getting deep into the plot, so let it suffice to say that the story is engrossing and exciting. Gaiman's imagination will delight you.

That shouldn't have surprised me considering TELL THE WOLVES I'M HOME was on beaucoup Best Books of 2012 lists, but I did. The protagonist in this story is a 14-year old girl, and I read very little YA lit—maybe that's why I didn't pick it up before now—but this is NOT a Young Adult book. Nor, according to interviews with Carol Rifka Brunt, was it supposed to be a coming-of-age story. Yes, the young girl, June, grows up (emotionally) in this story, but the story itself is so much more than that. Briefly, The Wolves is about 14-year old June, the younger of two daughters, whose Uncle Finn is dying of AIDS. Set in 1987, the story has a palpable gravitas that it wouldn't have if it were set in 2012. Back then, AIDS was new, unknown, and very scary. June and Finn are best friends, at least in June's mind. It's not until after Finn dies (that's not a spoiler; we know that from the first sentence) that June learns Finn has a lover, Toby. In fact, June is the last to know everything in her family. The story is about how she starts to take charge of her world. The ending is happy and heartrending at the same time. So what makes The Wolves so good? Brunt has managed to channel core emotions—the emotions EACH of us has—through the voice of a child. When these thoughts and fears come from the mouth of a teenage girl, they seem real but not threatening to us as adult readers. Do you know a single person who isn't insecure to some degree? Who doesn't feel like everyone else has more friends than she does? Who doesn't wonder what she's missing out on? Today, this is known as FOMO, fear of missing out. ""Kids"" are desperate to NOT feel like June. But we all do, to some degree. In fact, I think June might be the literary character to whom I most closely identify.But it's not just well written characters that make this book worth buying; the plot is riveting and real. June's sister, Greta, and their mother, Dani, each have significant subplot stories. Some readers say they ""hate"" Dani, Finn's sister, but again, that's because Brunt has done such a marvelous job of showing how fear manifests itself in relationships.If I haven't convinced you yet to run out and buy this book, let me add that Brunt has a lovely way with words. She has captured universal feelings and cloaked them in seemingly innocuous, yet powerful sentences. I highlighted dozens of passages, the most amazing being two paragraphs in the middle of Chapter Forty. (I have the ebook, so not sure what page that is in the hardback.) In this chapter, June is talking with Finn's partner, Toby, about dying. Toby's observation on dying is touching and beautiful and important for all of us. Buy the book just for that.Is TELL THE WOLVES I'M HOME sad? Yes, but it's also lovely.

In the opening pages, I thought Maggie Nelson was describing love, but not for another person, for the color blue. Ultimately I came to think was that ""blue"" is essentially a code name for whomever one might love, kind of a more poetic form of ____________.

(Um, duh. Right?)Foer does an excellent job of chronicling how this book came about, and how he became the USA's Memory Champion. In essence, he says any of us could have done the same if we put in the same amount commitment and hours of practice that he did. He relates stories and studies of both extremes of memory: a man known as S who remembers everything (to his own detriment); and a man who can't remember anything for longer than about 30 seconds. Foer goes into the science of the brain just enough to explain how it functions. He does give us the basics of how it's done, but it certainly isn't a training manual.Best of all, the story is told like a novel. He begins at the germination of his idea for an article, and ends with a suspenseful recounting of the competition that he won. He wraps up his final thoughts well. I enjoyed this book. I underlined and dogeared a lot of wisdom, suggestions, and facts about how memory works, and I do believe that I will be able to commit more to memory—if I so choose.

I don't think, even if I purchased a paper copy of this novel and read it again, that I could get Ms. Wilhoite's voice out of my head as I read it for myself. When reading Bee's lines, the narrator used a childlike voice; that was okay for the most part. When she read Bernadette's lines, I believe the voice was pretty natural for her. That was okay. But when she launched into foreign accents, I shuddered! East Indian? Russian? Australian? Irish? No! STOP! Not working. The amazing part—and probably the reason she was chosen as the narrator—was in the second half when Bee goes to a Christmas Concert, and Ms. Wilhoite begins singing Oh, Holy Night. Wow! The lady can sing. So the story. Ms. Semple did an excellent job of telling the story from a 12-year old's point of view. Bernadette's daughter Bee is a genius. (That's convenient, because a genius 12-year old can say and know things that most kids don't know.) The story is told as an epistolary recounting of Bernadette's final days (before she disappears), and Bee becomes an amateur detective who's trying to find her mother. Bee is funny, precocious, and sweet. Bernadette, however, is a mess, and I had a difficult time accepting her as a realistic character. She has issues (Don't we all?), but they've stretched on for over twenty years! And Elgie, her husband, seems to barely notice.

She is married and lives in Maine. These characteristics undoubtedly figured in to her creating her Pulitzer Prize winning novel (or rather linked short stories) OLIVE KITTERIDGE. I loved that book. Wikipedia does not, however, mention if Ms. Kitteridge has any children.In THE BURGESS BOYS, Strout chronicles the unraveling of a family, or perhaps the self-accualitzation of the family members, depending on your point of view. While Ms. Strout expertly described the life and inner workings of Olive Kitteridge (a retired school teacher), I don't think she hit the same mark with the Burgess brothers or the Burgesses's children. Many times I felt she missed the mark of how they talk or think.For example, a third Burgess family member, sister Susan, has a son named Zachary. Zach, though we know he's a troubled seventeen-year old, often calls his mother ""Mommy."" Also, the older Burgess brother, now in his 50s, continues to call his younger brother Bob ""knucklehead."" Even though we also know Jim has issues of his own, I found these two stereotypical catch-phrases to be very off-putting. As the mother of four grown boys, I think I can speak with some authority and say that these behaviors (by Zach and Jim) are not very realistic. More importantly though, I felt this novel got off to a very slow start. Yes, Zach's dilemma (he threw a frozen pig's head into a mosque during Ramadan) happened by page 19, but that's not really what the novel is about. The novel is about how lies affect lives. Strout doesn't get to the heart of that until about half way through the book. That's when it started getting interesting to me. If this book hadn't been written by Elizabeth Strout, I don't think I would have made it to that point.So, I'm no Pulitzer Prize winning critic, but I am an avid reader.

I read The Cider House Rules for three reasons: One, I remember loving A Prayer For Owen Meany (I remember it being long and boring until BANG, it blew me away); two, this book is a classic so I wanted to be familiar with it. The movie—which I intend to watch soon—won multiple Oscars; three, I wanted to read a story with a rogue doctor, and Wilbur Larch is that. But, hello, nearly 600 pages of wildly omniscient voice, capturing way too much detail about thoughts/actions/facts/details about history/characters/Burma/etc. that have nothing to do with the plot? Sorry, but it seemed only to show off Mr. Irving's incredible depth of knowledge. Mr. Irving is a master-writer; no doubt about that. But I found the pace sluggish. I know, I know ... Who am I to slam John Irving? No one. This is just my humble opinion.What I'd love to discuss with others are these three points:[Attn: spoiler alert]1) How does a character as seemingly humble and ""salt-of-the-earth"" as Homer live with two such substantial lies? What kind of man would spend 16 years living in the same house with his lover and her husband, and settle for sneaking off with the girl in the dark of night? And to wait 16 years before telling your son that he is your son? Come on ... And then to perform abortions if you feel like you're killing children? No, you either believe in the act or you don't. I cannot imagine a person (orphan or not) being that UNTRUE to himself. Homer has character—this is obvious in the way he raises his son—so I don't think he would live with ""Wait and see"" for that long. A week, two weeks, tops. Not that Irving doesn't try to justify his decisions, not that Irving doesn't show Homer's struggle with this, just that in the end I felt Homer Wells was not a realistic character.2) Who's the worse character, Homer Wells or Candy Worthington? Dear God, woman, make a decision. Either that, or join a commune, but don't, for Heaven's sake, live with the lies. 3) The title: The Cider House Rules ... I found that an odd choice. My guess is that our take-away should be ""Everyone has their own set of rules for life."" Any opinions on that? Mr. Rose certainly had his own cider house rules. Wilbur Larch had his own rules on abortions. Candy had her own rules (""I can live with both the men I love and my son whom I will never acknowledge if I want to.""). I suppose Mr. Irving said, ""My hero can be a wishy-washy, two-faced, non-licensed doctor if I want him to be."" My favorite characters with the two we were supposed to hate: Dr. Wilbur Larch, the criminal abortionist and drug addict; and Melony, the wild, angry lesbian. Not that I can relate to either of them, it's just that they seemed to stay in character throughout the story. All right, I'm starting to feel badly about my own opinions. I gave a lot of hours to this novel. I wish I had read it and discussed it when it first came out so I can figure out what I missed. I still plan to watch the movie, if only to see what Irving did to the story with some constraints.Three non-shining stars.Final note: Since I finished this book, I have watched the movie adaptation. For maybe the fist time ever, I can say I liked the movie better! In the movie, Homer and Candy don't turn into idiots at the end. Homer goes back to the orphanage when Wally comes back from the war. And, Homer doesn't come across as such a hypocrite. Lastly, I thought the movie did a better job of offering up an explanation for the title. I now believe the title suggests: one group of people cannot--and should not--try to impose rules on a different group of people. The cider house rules imposed on the ""negro"" migrant workers by the farm owners were essentially ridiculous, AND, the rules were written on a piece of paper despite the fact that none of the workers knew how to read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 24, 2013","Mar 17, 2013","Feb 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/98937.Cider_House_Rules

It contains several of my favorite subjects: art, literature, family relationships, and it's set in France. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. This was my first book by Houellebecq, so I can't put TMATT into context with his other work, but I would like to read at least one more.This novel is broken into three parts plus a prologue and an epilogue, but it felt more like related short stories than a novel. The book was at times comically cynical, touchingly sensitive, wildly unfocused, and infuriatingly pedantic. I felt like much of the novel was nothing more than a medium for Houellebecq to attempt to impress the world with his knowledge, though Slate Magazine accused him of plagiarizing French Wikipedia, so how much of his rambling was personal knowledge is up for debate.Essentially, this is a story about an artist named Jed Martin. Jed is basically a sad sack. His mother committed suicide, and he has a distant relationship with his father. He has no friends to speak of, other than a girlfriend named Olga for part of the book. Jed becomes wildly successful despite himself.There's one line in particular that sums up this novel for me. On page 129, Jed's gallerist Franz says: ""we're at a point where success in market terms justifies and validates anything, replacing all the theories."" Well there you go. Houellebecq is ""famous""—or at least famous enough—that he can apparently get away with a novel that wanders all over hell and back plot-wise. Jed's meteoric success as an artist must be Houellebecq's jab at how unrealistic the art world can be (not that I disagree with him), but it really became laughable.

This is the first book I've read by Lethem, but of course, I've read a lot about him, about what a wonderful writer he is. No disagreement there. Second, a neo-noir? I'm in! I love the old Raymond Chandler/Philip Marlowe novels (although they can move a bit slowly for my taste). So, combine Lethem with a noir, amateur detective novel and I expected to love this book.I didn't.MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN is a story about four orphans who are ""chosen"" by a small-time mob guy to help out with his dirty work. The narrator and protagonist is Lionel Essrog, a man with Tourette's Syndrome. Lethem does a fantastic job with this character, making him smart and sympathetic at the same time. I can honestly say that I feel I understand this syndrome better than I did before reading the book, and if/when I encounter someone afflicted with Tourette's, I will not be as shocked or scared as I might have been before. That's good writing. Lethem's manipulation of the English language through this character voice is funny and brilliant. However, the story failed me. Chapter 1 opens with Lionel and one of his buddies on a stakeout. Fantastic! I was really into the plot and the writing. Then Chapter 2 goes deep into the characters' backstory, almost an info-dump, if you will. The backstory is not incorporated into the novel, it's laid out for the reader in one chapter. By the time I got to Chapter 3, I had to go back to the beginning to remember what was happening in the plot. Now, are the characters interesting and well-rounded? Yes. But I thought he could have done smaller flashbacks instead of lumping that all into one stand-alone chapter. Plus, there are essentially seven ""main characters;"" that's a lot to keep track of in a whodunit.Most importantly for this , I thought the mystery, ""the case,"" got lost. Why exactly is Lionel on a chase when he basically knows ""whodunit""? And, how do all these characters link together? Apparently I'm not the only one who felt this way, because the penultimate chapter, Formerly Known, spells the whole story out. If the mystery had been well told (sorry, Mr. Lethem), he would not have needed to walk the reader through the plot in this chapter, at least not to the extent he did. He gave us new information, a no-no this late in a mystery. The reader should be able to piece it all together if the mystery is well-told. Again, in my humble opinion, most of these facts should have been incorporated into the story so we could get CLOSE to the truth on our own. While I loved Lionel Essrog, I did not love this book.

This book is brief, yet packed with powerful ideas; I think a reader could talk about it for more hours than it takes to read it. It's obvious Ms. Woolf did a lot of research for this essay, but she kept her focus admirably narrow. I imagine she could have written a dozen volumes on the subject ""Women and Fiction"" if she had wanted. So, ""a room of one's own and five hundred a year"" ... Woolf says that's what a woman needs to write. Certainly that is a good place to start, but what about a passion, an opinion, a voice? Maybe she has these qualities in spades so she takes them for granted. I know a few wealthy women with more than a few extra rooms who could never write a decent book. I also know women who've had neither, yet have written best sellers. But, as I keep reminding myself, this book was written almost 90 years ago. It wasn't very long before she wrote it that women got the right to vote, the right to hold certain jobs, and the right to own land. She also discusses children, and the fact that most of the few notable women writers before her had no children. Wow. It's difficult to imagine being a woman back then—but I imagine women of 2113 will look back and think 2013 was a horrible time to be a woman! Weird.Anyway, like many others who have ed this book on Goodreads, I expected a much harsher feminist rant from Ms. Woolf. But I found her opinions quite democratic. She notes the harsh attitudes pertaining to women from the days of Shakespeare to 1928 (when she presented the essays that became this book), but I felt she did so in a matter-of-fact manner, not an angry diatribe. Some men might disagree.I enjoyed A Room of One's Own, but I can't say that I loved it.

Because to give this book FiThis book, TENTH OF DECEMBER, by George Saunders, makes me want to reduce every other book I've ever rated down one star. Because to give this book Five Stars, along with the twenty or so other books that I have given Five Stars, just isn't fair.This book proves that it's possible for ME to LIKE short story collections written by white, middle-aged American men. (See previous s for Hemingway, Diaz, Denis Johnson, JD Salinger.) Saunders is able to do in a few pages what most authors will never be able to do: rivet the reader's mind and heart to the story at hand—and that comes from a lady with ADHD.Take ""Escape From Spiderhead,"" my hands-down favorite of this collection of ten stories. I was so captivated/appalled/awed by this story that, unlike every other story in the book, I didn't even slow down enough to underline the amazing sentences like I did in all the other stories... other than beside one paragraph I wrote: Fantastic! This is easily the most powerful story I've ever read. It is original, emotional, and poetic—yet scarily brutal. Every story has new characters (as opposed to other collections that are linked by one main character (Diaz), or collections that have a common character in different settings (Hemingway)), and this presents the reader with a welcome challenge: with each new story, the reader must pay close attention to determine who the protagonist is, where and what is involved with the new setting and plot, and the protagonist's backstory. Saunders never hands you that on a lovely platter; he greedily holds onto the important facts until way late in the story, making you work at what's really going on. Then, as he drops a delicious morsel, you hungrily snatch it up and say, Thank you, Mr. Saunders! This is the best story I've ever devoured! In each of the above mentioned stories, the characters have such a distinct voice, so spot-on and pitch-perfect, that the reader feels he/she IS the character. A chubby 12-year old kid with a fantastic imagination? Yes, that's me! A murderer, in a lab, participating in horrendous experiments? Yes, that's me! A mother afraid to give her baby to her own brother? Yes, that's me! But you don't have to take my word for it.

Written in 1949, this essay is lyrical, magical, and honest, and only 31 pages long. White, of CHARLOTTE'S WEB fame, packs more sentiment into each sentence than some writers can squeeze into an entire paragraph. Though many of the landmarks he mentions are long gone, White sweeps the reader from Ellis Island to Harlem with stops in the LES, Greenwich Village, Broadway, and Central Park along the way, offering vignettes of the characters, smells, sounds, and emotions peculiar to each neighborhood. His words are not sugarcoated; he clearly describes the dirt and crime and challenges and still makes the reader feel they would be lucky to live there and experience the city first hand.It's like wanting a puppy even though you know it's going to pee on your floor and chew on your shoes. You still want the puppy.The greatest quality of New York, according to White, was the apparent unwritten agreement between the vastly disparate demographics; it's like the immigrants inherently knew the rules of getting along in the city, and they (mostly) followed those rules. The balance therein was what made New York City the greatest city in the world. I'd say that's more true today than it was in 1949.E.B. White is the antithesis of the Pied Piper. White tells you everything bad about New York, and yet you still want to follow him into the city.Five Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 31, 2012",Jan 2013,"Dec 31, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10814.Here_Is_New_York

She reads for the beauty each sense imparts. She also worships the work of Anton Checkov.Oops. That's not exactly how I've been reading all my life. I've never read Checkov (although I did just order a book of his 100 best stories because of her.) I generally read for plot and action, quickly, so that I can get to the end and start another book. Ms. Prose suggests slowing down, which I will now that I understand why. READING LIKE A WRITER is a book that everyone who would like to write a book should read. She pulls myriad examples out of classic novels (as well as many books I've never heard of) and illustrates how and why they are outstanding examples of good writing, writing worth striving for. I suppose that there are some readers out there who have no inkling to write a book who would appreciate her guidance on how to appreciate literature, but the book has the feeling of a masters' level writing class. (That's a good thing.)My only knock on this excellent book is that I would have liked more examples taken from contemporary writing, more examples even from the 20th Century, as opposed to centuries old passages. Writing has changed, what readers expect from a book has changed, and more recent examples would be more applicable to those of us trying to become better writers in the 21st Century.That being said, I consider this book a MUST READ for any writer who doesn't have an MFA.

I cannot do justice to rating this book with just Five Stars. Even audible.com gives us three categories (Overall, Performance, Story). Goodreads should have Ten Stars, or else categories: Overall, Writing, Story/Information. I want to start a Goodreads revolution! Please, Goodreads, give us more stars with which to rate books!Junot Diaz is the master of his own sui generis. I would give him Ten Stars for his writing ability. He writes like Rihanna sings; his voice is distinct and instantly recognizable; that is the ultimate talent of a writer. I don't understand all of what he writes (I'm not up on my Spanish swearword slang), but he certainly gets the gist across—powerfully. This book is packed with emotion, and by the final story (out of nine), the reader actually feels immense sympathy for the lying, cheating, sex-crazed bastard Yunior. (Forgive me, Mr. Diaz, if this is more autobiographical than fiction.) Now, as a white, middle-American female, can I relate to the story? Not so much. Do I aspire to write like Diaz? Again, not so much. That would be like me trying to pass off Kimchi as an old family recipe. Is this the kind of book I love? No, sorry, can't say that it is. I prefer novels with characters to whom I can relate. For that I'd give him Four Stars (out of Ten). However, the fact that he made me care about the aforementioned man in the end does speak to his talent as a writer, I have to say.Junot Diaz won the Pulitzer Prize for his last book, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, so for me to give this book Three and a Half Stars (the average of both categories) is almost laughable. (Who am I to give a writer of this character such a low score?) So, based on the painful restraints of Goodreads existing scale, I'm giving this book Four Stars.

Silly me, I thought it would be—Elmore Leonard being a ""Grand Master"" of the Mystery Writers Let's just start here: ROAD DOGS is not a mystery novel. Silly me, I thought it would be—Elmore Leonard being a ""Grand Master"" of the Mystery Writers of America, and all. ROAD DOGS is my first Leonard novel. I picked it up for a number of reasons, the primary one being that I'd never read this master writer before. He's known for terse writing, fantastic bad guys, even better dialogue, and ... wait for it ... mysteries. ROAD DOGS is literary fiction about a bank robber, Jack Foley. You can't call him the hero because he never does anything heroic in the story. He simply lets the other characters (mostly bad people) ruin themselves. In this story, Jack Foley befriends Cundo Rey, a murderer, while they're both spending 30 months in a Florida jail. When they're released, they go to Cundo's home in Venice, California. Jack Foley's story, from beginning to end of this novel, is a quintessential literary fiction character arc as he goes from ""bad guy"" to ""not such a bad guy."" (I can't really call him a good guy.) The writing here is exactly what I expected from Leonard: terse and crisp. He has prison/gang/Cuban slang down cold! It's the plot that threw me for a loop. Not that this was a bad story by any means, but Leonard trots us down one path, then suddenly veers off to a completely unexpected story line, not once, but twice! In a mystery novel, a crime is typically committed at the outset, which is then solved by the protagonist. Well, that's not this story.So, if you're interested in reading a good story about interesting bad guys, you'll like ROAD DOGS. If you're looking for a great mystery novel, keep looking.I'd give this 3 1/2 starts if Goodreads would let me, but I'm rounding up to Four Stars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 27, 2013","Sep 07, 2013","Dec 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7110142-road-dogs

The s for this were quite strong; one said something to the effect of: The twist at the end will delight you. Yeah, no. I thought the end was disappointing. I absolutely wanted another chapter about the current day life of the protagonist (the opening pages tell you the story is a flashback). Plus, the story seemed awfully pedantic. McEwan seemed to be showing off his knowledge of 1950s - 1970s World politics and British literature. Some, of course, was necessary, but for my personal taste it was simply too much. I suppose at his level, he has a lot of erudite friends to impress. I imagine McEwan got quite the kick by talking about the nascent Man Booker Prize (which he won in 1998 for his novel AMSTERDAM), and that the writer in this story hung out with an unknown Martin Amis.I bought SWEET TOOTH because I wanted a good read with a female protagonist. I was forty pages into it before I said, this is kind of boring. Any person who skips exposition and jumps to the dialogue will finish this book in about ten minutes. It's mostly telling, less showing, very little speaking. But then, ""telling"" seems to be a British trait. All that being said, I highlighted many delightful phrases.

They just don't normally cross that all-important line into violence. The Wisdom of Psychopaths is about 220 pages, so not a long book. Dutton mixes a keen sense of humor in with his stories and anecdotes so it reads pretty fast. My only knock is that some of the stories/studies start to feel redundant... although, maybe that just goes to show how many and how long psychopaths have been around.

I don't want to run a marathon, but I want to say ""I have run a marathon."" Hemingway is not one of my favorite authors, but I feel obligated to read his work. (My opinion would undoubtedly be different if I were a twenty-something male.)I admire—and would not begin to argue—the importance of Hemingway's work on American and therefore world literature. His writing style is distinct, spot-on, and unique. Trouble is, I'm not very interested in the laconic, macho man persona. In fact, I wonder how many women would say they honestly LIKE Hemingway's stories. That being said, of the sixteen stories in IN OUR TIME, four stood out to me as my relative favorites: The End of Something; The Three-day Blow; The Battler; and Mr. and Mrs. Elliot. These four seemed to have a little more depth, a little more motivation behind the characters' actions. I also enjoyed the layers in The End of Something. The title could refer, in varying degrees, to the end of the town mill, the end of trout season, and most significantly to the end of Nick and Marjorie's relationship. I like that Hemingway gave the story a vague title and more than one subplot. Also, we see at the very end how upset Nick is at having ended the relationship; I like to feel the characters' emotions in literature. I do admire Hemingway's trademark short, sharp, declarative sentences typically tucked into the middle of a paragraph. For example, in The End of Something, just before Nick is about to break up with Marjorie, and she is rowing the boat back onto the shore, Hemingway writes: ""Little waves came in with it."" That is very likely literal, but it also applies figuratively. Waves of anxiety? Waves of dread? Maybe all of the above, and that's what makes it such a great sentence. But, back to MY  of this collection. Meh. Too many of the other stories did nothing for me.

I'm so glad I did. Firth's performance of Greene's words was gorgeous.The novel, let me just say it, is heartbreaking. That shouldn't come as any surprise considering the title; the beginning of an affair is (according to literature and Hollywood) the most exhilarating feeling in the world, thus, the end of an affair might be expected to be the worst feeling in the world. But Greene doesn't focus on Sarah's husband discovering the affair between his wife and their friend, Maurice. The story, set during WWII in London, focuses on WHY Sarah broke off her affair with Maurice. Maurice was madly in love with her, and he was destroyed by her decision. But the novel is about more than that. It's also about religion, specifically about the existence of God. In the beginning of the book, none of the three main characters, Sarah, Henry and Maurice, believe in God. Throughout the story, Sarah begins to believe in Him, and Maurice struggles to understand that as well. This, of course, figures into why Sarah ended the affair (but not as directly as you might think, so I won't spoil it for you by elaborating).Graham Greene would undoubtedly be on a list of The Greatest Writers of the 20th Century. His sentences and explanations of our crazy world are beautifully elucidated. If you're considering this novel, I most definitely say, Read it. It will touch your heart and lock inside your head.

I agree with most of the big s of Live By Night: it's a high-level gangster novel, and it is very well-written. But in my opinion the plot is not necessarily fresh, and it never reaches the brilliance of Shutter Island.Live (rhymes with give) By Night chronicles a good-hearted though misguided young man named Joe Coughlin. Lehane elevates him by making him a non-racist in a time when almost everyone else is driven by racism. Also, for the first half of the novel, he doesn't kill anyone. How can we not like this guy? But he learns to kill... and then he learns to love... So we like him again, and of course we root for him.What sets this novel above the average crime novel is Lehane's literary gift. One example: ""Far off at the horizon line, thin bolts of lightning carved jagged white veins in the skin of the world. Their faint and sudden light would reveal swollen clouds as dark as plums massed out there like an enemy army.""

Rowling is a stellar example of the fact that acclaimed authors can get away with things that novice writers cannot. There is nothing mystical or fantastic about The Casual Vacany; in theory, anyone could have written a 500 page book about small town life. But in today's literary climate, few novice writers could have gotten it published.Which came first, Ms. Rowling's cinematic stories or the first movies of her books? The Casual Vacancy opens (after the death of Barry Fairbrother) with the teenagers of Pagford traveling on their school bus around the small town picking up the kids who figure into this story. [The story is about a slew of Pagford's adults and their teenage children, and the interaction between them.] I could clearly imagine the scene: Andrew's face pressed against the glass, trying to act cool, but aching to see Gaia, the new girl, get on the bus. The end of the novel has a similar feel: A handful of the characters storm from their homes (for many different reasons) and all cross paths near the park and the river. Very cinematic, indeed.In between those two scenes, the novel is thick and detailed, but not in a boring manner... if you have come to care about the people. If. The Casual Vacancy is a sprawling, omniscient tale about the inner feelings and relationships that we all have or have had, it's just rare these days to read a contemporary novel that goes into such detail. But then, Ms. Rowling is British, so maybe it's a birthright for her to continue in the vein of Dickens, say, and his caricatures of stereotypes. For example, the enormous deli owner, Howard Mollison, who has heart troubles, etc., etc.One other interesting technique that Ms. Rowling uses is her parenthetical explanations. Where some authors might jump to a flashback scene, Rowling just includes a few paragraphs of backstory. Perhaps this is because the novel was already quite long and she couldn't justify adding another 100 pages or so, but it certainly felt odd in today's literary world.All that being said, The Casual Vacancy is a beautifully written, elegiac tale of the vagaries of life. Most of the story lines did not end happily, but it was a very fulfilling novel, and I am glad I read it.

And not only does Stedman have a good hook, the plot intensifies as it nears the end of the book—as a good book should. Part 3 is hard to put down.M.L. Stedman (I'll try not to hold it against her that she goes by initials) writes gorgeous prose. I highlighted dozens of phrases, too many to list, but here are a few: when describing the ocean, ""... she had the impression she could walk to Madagascar in a journey of blue upon blue."" later, ""... the darkness curled around her lamp like a closing fist."" and, ""...thunder grumbles at being left behind by the lightning."" and so many more. So why only 4 stars? Bear with me for an analogy: You know how, when you go to a nice restaurant and look forward to a good meal, but your food is cold, or they put the dressing on when you specifically said to put the dressing on the side, and how when that stuff happens it's so easy to blame the waitress and give her just a slightly lower tip even though the screw-ups weren't necessarily her fault? Ok, this book is like that. It's difficult not to blame the author when the real question is, Who was the editor here? THE LIGHT BETWEEN THE OCEANS is told from an omniscient point of view, with a cast of characters so long it becomes almost comical. And on top of that, Stedman switches between present tense and past tense at random points and intervals. Who let her do that?! There seems to be no rhyme or reason for her choices, and it was very disconcerting. She can write either tense beautifully, and if she had stuck with past tense for Parts 1 and 2, then switched to present tense for Part 3, I could appreciate that. But no. It's not chapter by chapter either. The book is filled with tiny little snippets of scenes that could be any number of character's point of view and either verb tense. (Please, if someone can explain why it was done the way it was, I would be grateful.) Also, her ability to enter scenes at the last possible moment, and leave them at the first moment (a strength in writing) is exemplary, until the second half of the book where it becomes so choppy that I longed for her to eliminate some so that she could develop and strengthen others.Ok, I said my piece. I don't want to knock the author for what an editor should have caught. I've tried to find background on this novel, but there's next to nothing: no listing of Stedman's agent or editor or friends or reading groups. I am eager for her next work, but I hope it gets a little more polish.Four Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Sep 2012,"Sep 03, 2012","Sep 01, 2012",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/13537618-the-light-between-oceans

But if you've read any of my other s, I speak from the heart here on goodreads. (The minute I get hired by the NYTimes Book Review, I'll be a bit more objective.)11/22/63 is an excellent story, but in my opinion, about 200 pages too long. There is no doubt in my mind that King is one of the best storytellers of our time. That's even better than being a great author. Of course, he's both. King writes a story like he's talking to his best friend over a campfire. I love that about him, but this story would take an entire summer-camp worth of campfires to finish. And that is my only knock.In this book, the protagonist is shown ""a rabbit hole,"" through which he travels back in time to September 1958. It doesn't matter how many times he travels through the rabbit hole, each time he goes back to the exact same moment in time. When he is convinced by a friend (in the present) to go back and stop the assassination of President Kennedy, he must ""hang out"" in the Land of Ago for more than five years. Okay. It's King's choice, so it's difficult to knock, but those five extra years take up those 200 pages that I could have done without. Now, I know, being Stephen King you can't throw out a half-baked plot—he's got to live up to the world's expectations—but I still felt he could have shortened the intervening years a tad.Getting past the length, this is a perfectly hatched story. And, not too gory for me. I must admit, this is my first Stephen King novel because I don't have any desire to read about people smashing/hatcheting/drowning others in gallons of blood. Yes, there are a few murders and knifings here, but they weren't the focus of the story. King's imagination and thoroughness in relaying the details are superb. He dotted every i and crossed every t. I even really liked the ending; I was so afraid after all the time I'd spent with the book that I wouldn't.I listened to this book via audible.com. Every time I do that, I have a hard time separating the story from the performance. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting the soft voice of Craig Wasson as Jake Epping, but once I got used to it, it felt right. (Jake is a high school English teacher, so I guess it was fitting.) Wasson does imitations, as I suppose most professional book readers do. And because the bulk of this novel is set in Texas in the early 60s, it's not surprising that some of the characters sounded... familiar, e.g., the one guy who sounded like Bill Clinton. All in all, he did an excellent job.If goodreads would allow us to give half-stars, I would give this four and a half, with only half a point deducted for the length. (Hello, goodreads, how about it?) But for now, Four Stars, Mr. King.

Denis Johnson is certainly one of America's greatest living authors. I am also a big fan of JD Salinger's Catcher In The Rye. Both Jesus' Son and CITR have the gift of voice. Both are about struggling white males in America. Both are written in first person POV, so deep and so real, that I felt like I was the protagonist, and I'm a middle class white lady! Jesus' Son is a novel told in 11 short stories. Each one gives us a snapshot of the protagonist's life (Did Johnson ever give him a name? I think he mentioned it somewhere in this book, but I can't find it. I believe that was intentional to help readers relate to him.) Anyway, he starts as a college-age kid in Iowa City and grows up—literally and emotionally—as the stories progress. He is surrounded, in the first stories, by crooks, alcoholics, drug addicts and poor people, then, in the final story, he is working in a care home and makes several references about going through detox. He even begins to care about other people in the end.So the good and the bad about this book? The good: Johnson's writing is amazing. His sentences hit lyrically and emotionally. And he's often funny! Johnson loves to juxtapose adjectives, and the affect is powerful. [""It was a sad, exhilarating occasion."" ""A bull elk stood still... giving off an air of authority and stupidity.""] The endings to each story are great, too, very enigmatic. So, why not Five Stars, Karolyn? The bad: Even though this is a very short book, I felt the dysfunction and despair was starting to feel redundant, although in retrospect, that might say more about me than this book. I'm sure Johnson wanted the reader to see this guy hit rock bottom, then climb out just at the end. There was one fantastic line in ""Beverly Home,"" the final story: (Our guy is now working at a care home, helping a young man (33) with multiple sclerosis, whose wife was divorcing him. The patient could barely speak anymore due to his condition.) Johnson writes: ""No more pretending for him! He was completely and openly a mess. Meanwhile the rest of us go on trying to fool each other."" Wow! How true is that?Well, that's enough.

Jessica has all kinds of problems—family, relationship, work—and the author, Shawn Klomparens, sorts them out one by one, taking the reader rapidly through her associated emotional states.This book has a lot of subplots and red herrings. Klomparens does an excellent job of keeping the reader on his/her toes about several of the characters, namely Josh, Gretchen and Emily; the reader stays wary, and therefore engaged, until the very end of the book. On the surface, this book might seem like Women's Fiction (because of the female protagonist) or even a Romance (based on the cover), but it is quite suspenseful—almost a whodunit. The most impressive part, in my opinion, is immediately following a tragedy (I won't say what). Klomparens expands upon Jessica's emotional state so that the reader truly feels the impact of what she is going through. Then he deftly leads her out of it to tie up one of the many subplots that ties right back to the main plot: how a person's past shapes their present day persona. Very well done.Written in 2008 (or slightly before), this book carries the angst and anger that Americans felt post-9/11. Reading it in 2012, I am reminded of the day to day anxiety we felt then; I think it's important that we Americans do not forget that time in our history.Jessica Z. is an engaging read.

I just finished this book and I have so many conflicting emotions that I had to write this  immediately. First, the story is extremely compelling and well-written (except for a couple points I'll make in a moment). Flynn alternates short, intense chapters from the two main characters. From the very beginning, the husband, Nick, and the wife, Amy, have mostly contradictory recollections of their marriage (Amy's chapters are excerpts from her diary because it opens with her missing). Nick, of course, being the primary suspect in her disappearance. Flynn does an excellent job of hinting at various minor characters with potentially nefarious motives; possible red herrings, if you will. I like that in a book. At this point I found it an exciting whodunit.The book is divided into three parts, and each break is a major twist in the tale of Nick and Amy. Saying too much right here would definitely spoil the story... so I won't. I liked the book a lot until (it's very difficult to put down... until) I had about 100 pages to go (my e-version had 507 pgs). At that point, Flynn lost me. The characters who started out as so ""relatable"" became caricatures (at least one of them). And then the ending... Sorry, but I hated it. I found it completely bizarre and improbable. But then, maybe it was appropriate for the caricatures and Flynn knows much better than I do about how a story like this really would end. Like I said above, the novel is well-written; Flynn is a talented writer. But, she jumps from 1st POV to 2nd POV just often enough that it's very jarring. I suppose she and her agent and/or editor made the judgement call here, but it still didn't work for me. I also thought the verb tenses jumped around in Part 2 when they shouldn't have.

And I'm glad I did.A critic from the Washington Post says this book ""never slips entirely into magical realism..."" Really? I thought it did, but if not, then let's call it Mythical Realism. First we have Natalia, a young, modern day doctor in a Balkan country, doing her part to help the needy and the orphans. Then we have her grandfather, who we find out has just passed away. While Natalia is on a missionary trip to help the children at an orphanage, she tries to unravel the mystery behind her grandfather's death, and in doing so she recalls and/or relives the mythical stories that her grandfather told her when she was a little girl. This story is wealthy with layers. It meanders to depths of imagination that are beautiful, dramatic and detailed, but at times (a la Jonathan Franzen) Obreht goes so far into the backstory of semi-minor characters that I actually yearned for the primary plot; these backstories do, however, subtly weave depth into the final tapestry of The Tiger's Wife, and earned it a spot on the New York Times' Top 5 Novels of 2011. In fact, the title character, the tiger's wife, is one of these minor characters. Like The Great Gatsby, the protagonist/narrator is not the title character. That's tough to pull off. The tiger's wife—and the other storyline about the deathless man—are, to some degree, the myths by which Natalia uncovers the truth behind her grandfather's life and death.Obreht is a supreme storyteller. The lyrical prose and the detail she imbues into the scenes make the book seem much longer than 338 pages. (That could be good or bad, depending on the reader's personal preferences.) This story slips in and out of different points of view and periods in time. The plot of Natalia lasts approximately one month in time, yet the book goes back many decades to fully tell the whole story. To say it's confusing would be unfair, but I would say the reader must want to concentrate on the gorgeous details or risk getting lost in the colorful threads.If you're looking for a deep, engaging read this would be a wonderful book for you to pick up. I think this is a novel that I would enjoy more with each reading. In other words, you may have to ""work"" at this book a little, but the reward is there if you do.

This is the second in Lehane's Kenzie-Gennaro detective series. I nearly put the rest of my life on hold while reading this book, but it didn't quite reach the level of Shutter Island. There were many beautiful, dramatic passages in this novel describing the weather, or voices, or friendship... dramatic right up to the tipping point of being overwritten. I wonder how Lehane views his writing in this novel today.Point of note: I listened to this book via audible.com performed by Jonathan Davis, so I will try to separate my opinion of the reading from my opinions on Lehane's story. (For the record, Davis' performance was solid, gritty, emotional, but slightly overdone when it comes to the characters' accents and the direction of ""he said"" or ""she said."" Often times Davis held on to those phrases too long and they became cumbersome.)First opinion: Don't give this book to your grandmother for Christmas. Brutal, gruesome, violent, and sadistically evil, are all appropriate adjectives for the work. There are also a few steamy sex scenes, but those pale in comparison to the violence committed by multiple characters. The degree to which Lehane takes the horribleness is, of course, his call, but it was a bit tough for me. I thought during this book that Lehane is probably a fan of Stephen King. That being said, the plot was gripping and compelling, and I didn't know ""whodunit"" until Lehane wanted me to—he skillfully dropped hints and suggestions to make the reader suspect multiple characters as possibilities. Also, I admire the way he drew out the ending. Too often the end of some novels wrap up too quickly, like the writer is tired of the story and just wants to finish the book. Lehane's ""bad guy"" is bad until the very end.Second opinion: Anyone who loves a gritty, gripping mystery will love this book, even if ""cellular phones"" were a novelty back then. Lehane does an excellent job with his characters, making them sympathetic, flawed, brave and scared in equal parts, and emotional to the point of being quite real—at least they felt real to me—I've never actually met serial killers or even detectives. Lehane is also one of the best writers when it comes to ending chapters with hangers: time and again I would say, ""I'll just read till the end of this chapter,"" but Lehane would drop some enticing clue that compelled me to keep reading.Not only do I give this book 4 Stars, I'm going to read another Lehane book as soon as possible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 15, 2012","Jun 16, 2012","Jun 15, 2012",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/13416561-darkness-take-my-hand

The last six months of my life have led me directly to this book.I am not the person to tell you that all of what Ms. Browne says is true and that you must believe her, but I can tell you that my beliefs, rough as they are, match identically with what she says is true based on her sixty years as a psychic. She sites thousands of interviews with people from all over the globe who have had ""weird"" things happen to them, and from those experiences plus her own, she ""knows"" what the Afterlife holds. I think my agreement with her would come as no surprise to Ms. Browne. Good news for any skeptics: Religion really plays no part in her beliefs, other than there definitely is a God. After that, Catholicism, Judaism, Buddhism, Protestantism, et al, are Earthly interpretations that have no distinction in the Afterlife as long as you ""do good"" on Earth.

It's as though her words float in on a cloud that gently settles around me; I feel calm when I read her books. On that merit, I give it Five Stars. Real life is difficult to recount, because everyone's life overlaps simultaneously with everyone else's; in the hands of a lesser writer, this story could have been a jumbled mess.This is the story of Ms. Patchett's eighteen year friendship with the well-known writer Lucy Grealy. The two women became roommates and then friends at the Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1985 (oh, how I'd so love to interject personal tidbits here!) (Ah, what the hell... If you've read any of my other Patchett s, you know I love her writing, to the point that my name is probably on a watch list somewhere in case she senses she has a stalker who's creeping her out. I lived in Iowa City and moved away just days before she moved there. I sometimes wonder what might have happened if I'd met her all those years ago. Now my son is a student at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. I feel an odd connection, a symmetry, if you will.) Lucy Grealy was no average person. She survived cancer of her face at a very young age. This (and perhaps a dysfunctional family) shaped her, literally and figuratively, into a massively insecure person. Not that I'm criticizing or being unsympathetic; I cannot fathom living the life she did; I'm not sure if I could have survived it as long as she did. But what I find interesting—in a way that makes me doubt my Five Star rating—is why Ms. Patchett loved her so dearly. My harshest knock against this book is that I never quite understood WHY Ms. Patchett loved her so deeply. Near the end, (pg. 225) Lucy offers a reason which Ann rejects. Later Ms. Patchett says, and I paraphrase, she felt that only Lucy spoke her, Ann's, native language. That's beautiful, don't you think? I believe that this book is brutally honest, and that is of utmost importance. If so, EVERYBODY loved Lucy Grealy. But to love Lucy, from what I gathered, is to subject oneself to the puerile behavior and clinginess of a baby monkey, and I mean that in the sweetest way. Seriously. Lucy must have been brilliant. She was an acclaimed writer and teacher, she loved animals and people, she loved to dance and play pool, and she loved sex to the point that sh must have equated sex with love—she was always searching for love—even though most of us know ""sex isn't love."" We learned that in St. Elmo's Fire.If I were a psychologist, I might analyze this book based on the previous paragraph and come up with a different rating.

Rob Lowe performs the audio version so well that to read the printed version would to cheat yourself out of half the joy. Rob Lowe does imitations of his friends, business associates, and fellow actors—a near perfect Cary Grant, for instance, and Liza Minnelli, and Chris Farley, and Bill Clinton... After a compelling first chapter, Lowe begins his memoir at the beginning. I found this part a bit slow, but it was necessary to inform the reader how long (since the age of 10) and how deeply (more than anything else) he wanted to become an actor. Then he dives in to his high school days when he's naively hanging out with Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen, Sean Penn, Holly Robinson (Peete), Sarah Jessica Parker, Melissa Gilbert, and so many others before they became famous. This takes off, of course, exponentially once he hits the set of Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders.Lowe is (to my surprise) an excellent writer. Maybe he had a ghost writer, but by the end of the story, I feel he might very well have written every word himself; apparently, over the last few years, he's done a lot of script writing. In any case, Lowe is not just a pretty face. He has lived a rich life with so many amazing, worthy stories that this book seems as though it were inevitable. He did indeed mention his sex tape fiasco, but he whitewashed it... as I guess most people would. I've never seen The West Wing, but after listening to Lowe's story about the show, including its cast, director, and White House fans, I want to go out and buy every season!This is one of the first memoirs I've ever read—normally I read novels—and I'm very glad that I took the advice of one of my friends and listened to this audiobook.

I expected to LOVE this book, based on several different reasons (I loved Bird by Bird, and several of my trusted friends love Lamott's work). But I didn't. However, I think it says more about ""Hollywood"" and ""commercialism"" than it does about Anne Lamott. Ms. Lamott's characters are atypical. In addition, they are atypically honest. In today's world, characters (books, movies, TV) are generally beautiful people who have solvable problems. The characters in Blue Shoe are poor, overweight, missing teeth, some with dreadlocked hair (not that that's bad, it's just different from what we're normally exposed to). As quoted in the New York Times Book Review, Blue Shoe is ""messy."" That's a perfect word for it. Lamott describes the quotidian routine ad nauseam. Somehow, even though the book spans a couple years, it seemed to drag on, with lots and lots of routine and facts about the characters' lives. I know this pushes the novel into Literary Fiction and away from a plot-based story, but I have to admit I skipped huge chunks of the book that didn't seem to add much to the story. I may have missed good information, but in reading the last chapter, nothing came as a surprise (i.e., I didn't miss anything too important). Ms. Lamott is a wonderful writer. I underlined and dog-eared several passages. One of my favorites is a quote from the protagonist, Mattie: ""I realized that all I ever have to do is tell the truth, and let go of the results."" Wouldn't life be simpler if everyone on the planet subscribed to that? Well, maybe that would make real life as messy as this book... and then I wouldn't like real life as much. Anyway, call me brainwashed, but I guess I prefer the escapism of beautiful people solving life's problems in a more tidy fashion.Three Stars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 18, 2012","May 21, 2012","May 18, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/91700.Blue_Shoe

But if you think it's going to be about a man who receives an enigmatic bequest from the mother of an old girlfriend, and so the man goes back through life to figure out why... Well, it is and it isn't. This is a novel about Time and Memory. The Sense of an Ending is a gorgeous novella, precious, poignant, and (ooh, I so want to say ""perfect"") honest. Julian Barnes, thrice shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and finally winner with this work, sees people, sees their minds and hearts and souls, and can articulate it all so well that the rest of us are better for it—an amazing talent. His strength lies as much in what he doesn't say as what he does say. He has mastered ""showing not telling,"" except for the little blurb (chapter?) (I listened to this as an audiobook, so I'm not sure how it was separated out in print) in the middle where he says, and I paraphrase, ""I got married, had a kid, got a job, got a better job..."" Only a master can break the rules so masterfully.As I said, I listened to this on audible.com (huge shout out to audible!). It was read by the talented Richard Morant, a British man, appropriate because Barnes is British, as is his protagonist. Tony, the protagonist, receives 500 pounds and the promise of his deceased school mate's diary, but Tony has no idea why he's receiving either. The story starts back in their prep school days and he tries to remember it as clearly as he can, now some 40 years later. Tony talks at length about how memory, history, and perception are clearly inaccurate, but that's the best we have to go on. And so he walks us through all he can remember about his deceased friend to figure out why he has now inherited his diary, a soul-searching journey, to be sure.Many other s of this book say, ""I didn't get it."" And by that they mean the ending. Well, sorry, but if you don't get it, just read the last part again. It's obvious and it's brilliant. Tom Perrotta (The Leftovers) once said about literary fiction, ""... you should be more interested toward the end of a book than you are at the beginning."" Well this is that. The Sense of an Ending is literary fiction with a gripping story. And the ending is fantastic in a sad, quiet way. I love the fact that at the end of this book, the reader really only has a ""sense of the ending."" I think most readers had to give this some serious thought after they finished it... and if that's not brilliant, I don't know what is.It's not that I didn't have a few minor quibbles along the way with this book, but that's only because I'm a writer.

This is an audiobook which Ms. Patchett (I wish she'd finally say to me, ""Please, call me Ann."") narrates as a brief memoir about her current marriage, but explains that she must first tell the tale of her lineage: four generations of failed marriages. (Ironically, for me, she begins the story by saying that she was never fond of audiobooks until she heard the fantastic Jeremy Irons read Lolita; I had just finished listening to that very recording. Kismet, don't you think?) (I also agreed with her wholeheartedly.)This is the Story of a Happy Marriage is deeply personal and told in a calm but not syrupy voice. It would be tempting, I think, to just talk about her current husband and why it is so strong that one of Ms. Patchett's friends implores her: Tell the tale of your happy marriage. But she is bravely honest and reveals in seemingly great detail (who knows how much she left out?) how unhappy her first marriage was at age 23, and then her second major relationship (they were engaged but never married), also very dysfunctional, and she admits to a few loves along the way before she finally meets Carl, the love of her life and how she finally (after 11 years) agrees to get married again.From her own dysfunctional upbringing, to her relationships with her (divorced) parents, her step-parents and step-siblings, it's easy to see where the depth comes from for her novels. The best line in the book was the question a friend asked her when she was contemplating leaving her second relationship. In order to help Ms. Patchett make her decision, Edra (sp?) asks, ""Does he make you a better person? If yes, then work out the problems. If no, then you'll know whether or not to stay.""The audiobook is only 1 hour 18 minutes long, a bittersweet true story that goes a long way to make the rest of us realize that everyone has a story.I see no reason not to give this Five Stars....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"May 11, 2012","May 12, 2012",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/13191935-this-is-the-story-of-a-happy-marriage

But while we're on the subject, did anyone else notice the similarity of format? A person who has been arrested, telling their story to a jury/lawyer as part of their defense... But that is where the similarities end. I wanted to like this book more than I did. Ms. Rogan is a good writer, but I can't say she's a good storyteller; there's a big difference. There are several poetic sentences, and wonderful insights about life and people. Ms. Rogan did not rush the ending—it was nicely drawn out. It's obvioous she poured her heart and soul into the novel.In the story, Grace Winter, the protagonist, is on trial for murder, and yet she is calm, placid, naive, clueless... The only thing believable this woman did was to intentionally ""accidentally"" meet a wealthy man (who was already engaged), and steal him away. She was portrayed as a victim all the way through to the end. Larry Brooks of Storyfix wouldn't like that!The novel, on the whole, could have and should have had so much violence, tension, and fear, but it really just skated over the surface of the narrative; just try to imagine 21 days at sea in an overcrowded boat with dozens of scared, hungry strangers! The narrative timeline felt disjointed to me, jumping back and forth and forth again between the past, the lifeboat, and the trial, sometimes all in the same paragraph. Also the dialogue did not ring true to the time period (1914). Lastly, and I don't know why this hasn't been talked about more, is the undeniable similarity to the Alfred Hitchcock movie, also calld The Lifeboat, which was written by John Steinbeck. In all the press I've read about his book and author (everywhere from People magazine, to Oprah Magazine, to the New York Times!), I've not heard her give any credit to either of those men. Coincidence? Yeah, no.I'd like to give this 2 1/2 stars, but I'll round up to Three stars because I feel a connection to Ms. Rogan: a wife, mother, and self-taught author throwing her heart out there for people like me to critique.

Each time I read and/or listen to it, I get more out of it. This time through CLOUD ATLAS, I grasped the theme and message more clearly. In each of the six related stories, David Mitchell shows us how, through time, those with power used and abused those without power. It would make you cry about the unjust nature of man if it didn’t also give us hope for our individual possibilities. This is definitely a story about the triumph of good over evil. Mitchell’s beautiful last line (not a spoiler!) is this: “ ‘... only as you gasp your dying breath shall you understand, your life amounted to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean!’ Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?” In other words, each of us is as important as any of us. And together we are one. Five eternal Stars (SECOND READING: MAY 27, 2013) The first time I ""read"" this book (see below), I actually listened to it on audible.com. It's fantastic via the audio version because of the brilliant choices for readers. Then I saw the movie (typical movie response). Recently, I purchased the hardback version of CLOUD ATLAS, and read along with the audio version. You might think I'm crazy, but really I'm just THAT in AWE of David Mitchell's work. Any bit of excitement that was lost in my third ""reading"" of this story was replaced by admiration for the genius of David Mitchell. Okay, you get my gist. For me, this book is better each time you read it. And you will see I loved it the first time: (FIRST READ: NOV. 23, 2012) Finally! Now I know what book I will take to my proverbial deserted island. You know, What's the one book you would choose if you could read only one book for the rest of your life? CLOUD ATLAS, by David Mitchell. Yes, it's that good. I have two reasons for saying that.First, Mitchell's imaginative story and his mastery of the English language—as well as Olde English, and two languages he adapted from English—are phenomenal. Each of the six segments of this novel (told as six linked short stories) is fully developed and full of unique, round characters. The settings are—can I use the word phenomenal again?—as different from each other as Jane Eyre is from Star Wars. But Mitchell's talent goes beyond language and physical descriptions; this book is smart. I'm not giving too much away to say that all of the stories happen on Earth, the first segment taking place in the 19th Century, and the last in the 26th Century. Mitchell lets the reader figure out what has happened to the world in between each segment. And the title is perfect: CLOUD ATLAS: the novel is the legend of moving parts, i.e., clouds.The second reason I would take CLOUD ATLAS to my deserted island is because it might take me the rest of my life, reading and rereading this book, to fully grasp it all. This is a thick, literary, epic novel (528 pages). The book was originally released in 2004, and I have wanted to read it for a long time but was slightly intimidated by what I'd heard about it. When I saw that it had been turned into a movie, I moved it up on my TBR list to read before I saw the movie. Instead, I listened to this as an audio book (beautifully narrated by six different actors). I must admit I was so lost at several parts of the story that I didn't know what was happening, but I also couldn't stop listening. I saw the movie halfway through my audio experience which made me able to understand a movie that many people could not follow. The two experiences (audio book + movie) truly increased my enjoyment of each other. One day (soon, I hope) I will read the paper version, and I am sure that will further enhance my enjoyment. Reading CLOUD ATLAS will take some commitment, but this is a prime example of ""you get out what you put in."" If you love a story that pulls you in so deep that you don't even want to come out, AND you like a story that challenges your intellect a bit, AND you admire a wonderful sense of imagination, CLOUD ATLAS is your book.Bravo, David Mitchell. This novel should have won the National Book Award.

My copy of this book is now worn, dog-eared and underlined so thoroughly that a judgmental person might laugh. Not that I care; I only care about how right-on Ms. Lamott is, over and over and over again. It's like when a friend tells you your ex-boyfriend is a creep, and you scream, ""Well, sure. NOW I see it!"" She doesn't sugar coat anything, Ms. Lamott. She shoots from the hip, as they say. Writing is hard, taking criticism is harder, and being published is no holy grail. In essence, writing is a job. BUT, the gem here is that the true reward, she tells us, comes from learning to see the world and seeing one's inner self more clearly. Once a writer can honestly, tenderly see the world and communicate that vision to others, then and only then, will he or she realize how important writing can be. Lamott also shares with us deeply personal and raw emotions that she has felt. Fear of humiliation, fear of rejection, and self-doubt; and if an excellent writer like her feels that way, it must be okay for the rest of us to feel that way... AND KEEP GOING. It's easy to see that Ms. Lamott loves writing and wants to encourage the rest of us to keep going, day after day, for the rest of our lives. How fantastic is that?To save this  from becoming too kiss-ass or sentimental, let me offer a few facts about the book. Ms. Lamott has basically transcribed a semester's worth of lesson plans from a writing class she has repeatedly taught (presumably at UC Davis). She explains many fundamentals and tricks on getting started as a writer, moving through ""writer's block,"" learning how to ""observe"" the world, and advancing toward writers' groups and the perils of publication. Lamott, in equal parts, quotes literary giants, friends, and personal vignettes. But the ultimate compliment I can pass on about Bird by Bird, is a quote from a non-writer friend of mine. She LOVED this book for all the insight it offered into humanity. If a non-writer sings the praises of a writing book, it must really be worth reading.Bravo, Ms. Lamott.

The way I see it, if you're looking for an objective opinion about Flannery O'Connor's A Good Man Is Hard To Find you can find that on Amazon or Wikipedia. If you're reading my , you must want MY opinion about this book. If I were being objective about this short story collection, I would give it Five Stars. The writings is superb, the stories are deep and visual, the realm (Southern America in the first half of the twentieth century) is wide. Another er might mention the absurdity of O'Connor's use of the ""n"" word, and the horrendous predjudice against African Americans in the book. But, as with the case of Tom Saywer and the brouhaha of editing out such words is, in my opinion, is a dishonest depiction of our history and reality. I think it is beneficial to Americans in the Twenty-first century to see how wrong our ancestors were, and to see how far we've come, and think about how far we still have to go. But back to my . This is how I see each of O'Connor's stories: La di da di da di da... Boom... La di da. Seriously, the story begins, the story progresses (casting a slightly unsettling vibe because her world is so different from mine), then whamo!, something crazy happens, and then she quietly wraps up the story. It's beautiful in such a subtle way. Also in each story, there are at least two significant characters; each one plays a roll in the ""bang"". Because of that, I thought of two alternative titles for this collection: It Takes Two To Tango, or I've Got A Brand New Pair of Rollerskates; You've Got A Brand A Brand New Key. But since her title has become an American cliché, I guess I'll let it stick.This collection contains ten stories. The title story blew me away, probably because I (wrongly) assumed it would be about a woman looking for a man. It wasn't, at all. it was shocking and fantastic in the worst possible way. You owe it to yourself to read at least this one story. I would love to elaborate on each of the stories, but that would take hours.

Well, of course I don't hate her so I must love her, but she did make me cry and lose a lot of sleep this past week. This is the second time I've read The Thorn Birds, and I also watched the mini-series way back in 1983. (Am I that old? Maybe I saw it as a rerun.) In any case, it's been a few years and I had forgotten a few of the finer plot points, but the epic novel was still as powerful as I remembered it.The Thorn Birds is an elegiac, family saga set in Australia across the better part of the Twentieth Century. It deals with love, loss, religion, weather, emotions, and all kinds of other things over which we have no control. As a synopsis, if you mix the Cleary family (mother, father, eight sons (maybe more), and one lovely daughter) with a bitter old Aunt, stir in a gorgeous priest, an enormous ranch, and ton of money; cook that for 700 pages; out comes a bucket of tears and one small question: why are we even alive? Nothing is sacred in her book, most specifically and dramatically—okay, also ironically—God Himself. The characters in the novel are Catholic to varying degrees, and therein lies the grief.McCullough's writing (although I found the editing a little cumbersome) is deep, insightful, lyrical, and spot-on when she analyzes the interactions between her characters. A dozen passages or more spoke directly to me, asking those big-life questions that a person ponders during life's difficult moments or at least on quiet, introspective days. This book makes you think, people. Interestingly, one line jumped out at me; on Page 632 of the edition above, is the now well-known phrase ""only the good die young."" Interesting because McCullough wrote that line before Billy Joel's song of the same name was released (although both are attributed to 1977). Was it a common saying back then? I'm not sure, but if you Google it, the credit for coining the line goes to Mr. Joel. In any case, the novel is dramatic and heartrending, and if you're looking for a tear-jerker that you can't put down, this is your book. I reread it now because I was going through a Downton Abbey withdrawal, and it was just what I hoped for.I marked all Five Stars but only because I can't give it 4 1/2. I would dock it slightly for the aforementioned editing issues, and I can see where some would say it's over the top sappy... but that is exactly what I was looking for. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 13, 2012","Mar 20, 2012","Mar 13, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7602256-the-thorn-birds

I chose this one first (even though he's better known for his ""pure"" spy-thrillers) because I was curious about the medical aspect of this novel. In it, the protagonist is a ""genius"" scientist whose daughter has a very rare genetic disease that he sets out to cure, while also trying to figure out why other scientists studying similar diseases are being killed off. Because I'm not comparing The Immortalists to Mills' other works, I can say that I found it very engrossing—quite the page-turner; some ers feel it's less so than his other works. Mills' writing is high-level and pure; it never gets in the way of the story. He is a very good writer with superior story-telling abilities.This book is definitely plot-driven, which comes as no surprise. The flip side of that is that the storyline gives way to the plot. Meaning, I felt a few of the elements of the story were far-fetched (e.g., the parents leave their sick daughter in the hands of a man they barely know).

Writing level, e.g., absence of unnecessary adverbs? Plot strength and suspense? Sympathetic character development?If you're reading this , I'm guessing you fall into one of two categories: Those who like Sue Grafton novels and want to know how this one compares to the rest, or my goodreads friends who follow my s because you think I'm brilliant. If you fall into the first group, I won't be of much help. In my previous life (about 15 - 10 years ago), I read Grafton's early entries into the alphabet series. I liked them because they were fun, easy, mildly tense and suspenseful. Then my life changed, and I haven't read many since then.I recently read and ed Bolaño's The Skating Rink. While that was my first Bolaño, that is certainly more similar to what I like to read today. I guess I've grown up and am looking for more of a literary challenge these days. But enough about me. A few months ago, I saw a quote from Tom Perotta (The Leftovers) in the NYTimes Book Review. Perotta is a highly respectable author, although I must say I have not read any of his books yet. But he had a quote that I remember and respect. He said—and I paraphrase–that while he's writing a book, he reads mysteries because they are typically so strong in plot. He notes that acclaimed literary fiction can often lose that page-turner quality, and he wants to avoid that in his work.And that is why I read S is for Silence. I read it as research for my own work. How does Grafton maneuver her female detective? How does she handle character development for a new reader when most of her readers have probably read each novel in the series and know the main character so well? How does she handle the plot of her mystery? That is why I read this book. And I'm glad I did.Grafton knows what she's doing (obviously by now), she's a very good writer (obviously), she has a flawed but intelligent and likable character. I was extremely interested in finding out whodunit. That being said, I thought the book was awfully long (maybe because I wasn't looking for a beach read, this was more like homework for me). There were so many characters involved, that when I found out who the bad guy was, I had to go back and remind myself about his background and involvement with the victim (which I thought was on the thin side). I certainly didn't guess him ahead of time.I took copious notes on my iPad while I read this book in keeping with my 2012 reading goal (read fewer books, fill them with marginalia, and LEARN from them). (I love my iPad for that reason: so many highlighting color options, so easy to !) Also, in keeping with my ""grading"" philosophy, I give S is for Silence 3 Stars because, while it's a very well written mystery, it holds little literary merit. You gotta save the 4 & 5 star s for works that might endure, don'tcha?Three Stars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 30, 2012","Feb 02, 2012","Jan 30, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/142079.S_is_for_Silence

In 2013, his stories seem chock full of clichés, but back in the 50s, I imagine they were original and irreverent, possibly even laugh-out-loud funny! Chandler's detective, Philip Marlowe, kicks ass—very quietly. He never gets ruffled, and he continually outsmarts the bad guys (naturally) and even the cops (sweet!). Nothing is sacred in Philip Marlowe's world. He can tell a beautiful woman she's full of $h!t, and still end up in bed with her.

There are about a dozen people on the trip, anyone of whom might be the killer. But there are twists and developments that are very exciting (scary? compelling?). Box planted just enough clues along the way that I narrowed down the characters to who the villain might be, but he left it vague enough that I didn't know exactly how it would turn out until Box wanted me to.Beware: There are a lot of gory deaths in this book. (Stephen King fans take note!)One more caveat I must add: I listened to this as an audiobook, performed by Holter Graham, and I did not like his storytelling. I understand these characters are cops, and from Montana at that, but the way Graham read the dialogue was stilted and stiff. It almost ruined it for me.

The closer I got to the end of this book, the more obsessed I became with it, wanting to make sure that everyone was going to be okay, at least in some sense of the word.

I cannot imagine a more perfect way in which to be immersed in this masterful yet nasty novel. Forgive me if my words seem to flow, not from my American, middle-class, prudish fingertips, but through the unfiltered, unabridged, unspeakable truths disseminated by a worldly maniacal genius. Ah, who am I kidding. I can not for a moment write as brilliantly as Nabokov no matter how powerfully I try to channel him.Two thoughts overwhelm me upon the completion of twelve or so captivating hours at the proverbial knee of Jeremy Irons' storytelling best. First, in Mr. Irons' hypnotic voice, the alliterations of Nabokov sang so loudly that they nearly overtook the story. I wonder, do they jump out at a reader they way they did for me as a listener? I could give countless examples if only I had been taking notes as I listened or had this book in hand along with a pencil to underscore and scribble notes about as I read page by page. Alas, I chose the audiobook version because a., it was my free-trial book from audible.com, and b., I thought it was a book I would never read, mostly because of my disgusted prejudice against the storyline. Which leads me precisely to point two. My second thought, now that I've completed the book, is why was I so afraid of this book for so many years? I imagine it's because until ebooks and audiobooks became so easily available, the mere sight of the cover would surely elicit judgement, comment, possibly sneers were I to brandish it in public. And, for those of you who don't know me, I will do just about anything to avoid conversation with strangers. But my point is that never mind the hideous imagery of a forty-year old man repeatedly ravishing a twelve-year old girl, this is a gorgeous story, written in the most poetic and powerful words I have ever read. I hate to admit that it took me nearly one year, start to finish, to listen to these twelve odd hours of Lolita; myriad excuses could explain, but they are not important. Last summer, I would take walks around my neighborhood and listen to Jeremy Irons recant the story of Humbert Humbert. You see, my neighborhood claims one or two playgrounds and a sculpture garden to which schools regularly take field trips. Through the powerful combination of Nabokov and Irons, it made me, a forty-something mother of four, feel like a... creep. Yes, a total creep. (This might be why it took me so long to get through the audiobook.) Ironically, about halfway through the story, I began to let go of my disgust for H.H. and listen to his story. (Those of you who have read the book will know what happened at that halfway point; those of you who haven't, well, I'll just say, the book is a most remarkable story, disgusting storyline aside.) If you, my reader, (ah, Nabokov is speaking through me after all) do not know, dear Mr. Humbert is reciting the tale of Lolita in his own defense or at least confession of a crime to a jury. We first-time readers do not know until about 2/3 through the book, what crime he has committed, and not until very near the end do we know the victim of said crime. I would not dream of spoiling that for you here; I will only say that the suspense, the glorious, cinematic climax is so enthralling that had I been a student or random employee, I would have had to call in sick today just to hear the end of the story before I did one more task. And the end of the book, the very end, is so beautiful (a trite word here) and poetic and powerful that as soon as I hit ""save"" on this , I am going directly to a bookstore to purchase a hardback copy of this book so that I can reread my favorite passages if not the entire book today or one day or any day I am in need of seeing (not just hearing) a literary genius at work.

To date, I had read all her other novels; this was my final one to read. If you've followed my previous s, you know by now that I love her work, but I have to say this is my least favorite.Patchett has a formula—that is not a bad thing. She twists the stories so well that it's difficult to lump them into any single category. Patchett likes to throw total strangers into a bowl and see how they mix. In Taft, she tells the tale of a single-father black man in Memphis who manages a bar. ""A girl walked into the bar."" is the first line. I was immediately expecting a bit of humor, but there was little humor to be had.The story is told mainly in first person. Ok, so first person black man in Memphis told by a lovely white woman who did not grow up in Memphis. That is an undertaking. The voice of the primary character (whose name we don't learn until halfway through the book) does not come across to me as a black man. In fact, I didn't even know he was supposed to be black until a hundred pages in. I may have missed it, but none the less, it was not obvious. The character (John) didn't sound black, he sometimes sounded like a 30-year old Holden Caulfield.It's possibly unfair to judge an author's early works against her later works; becoming a better writer is always the goal. However, this novel did not draw me in as her other works do. I might have put it down after 50 pages if I wasn't such a big fan of hers. About half way through, I really started to care about the characters and I think the novel had a good (not great) finish. It is well-foreshadowed which created a certain degree of suspense. The title character, Taft (not the hero), is the deceased father of ""the girl who walked into the bar."" Patchett does a back and forth thing with ""John"" and ""Taft"" that is effective but confusing. It picks up the pace of the book, but the two story lines did not seem of equal importance for such a literary task. All in all, I can't give this novel more than 3 Stars. I'm glad I didn't read it before I read Bel Canto and State of Wonder—I might have been turned off. In any case, I still love Ann Patchett's work, and I am eager for her next novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 26, 2011","Oct 07, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9227104-taft

The Art of Fielding is an excellent book, but it received so much publicity and hype that it is nearly impossible to read it without great expectations. And as we all know, it's difficult to live up to such high expectations. For the first quarter of this novel (which logs in at 512 pages), I read it with a grudge: ""This had better knock my socks off!"" It didn't. But by the time I got to the middle, I began loving the story. I truly wanted to know what was happening with my friends Henry, Mike, Owen, Pella and the rest. And by the time I got to page 450, I could not put the book down until I finished it. Tom Perrotta (author of The Leftovers) recently said in an interview, ""... you should be more interested toward the end of a book than you are in the beginning. Which is not always the case in literary fiction... That kind of primal narrative engagement, I don't know why literary novels should give that up."" Mr. Perrotta would like this book. The Art of Fielding is definitely literary fiction, and the plot crescendos in the end like a mystery.Harbach is a great writer. It is obvious that he is well-educated (Harvard and Univ. of Virginia) and well-read. There are many references to the myriad novels on any given English Literature syllabus, primarily and specifically, Melville's Moby Dick. Harbach avoids using too many adverbs and concentrates on clever and erudite adjectives (e.g.: a curdled marriage, the expensive riotous green of the grass). The best element of the book, however, is the subtlety with which Harbach elucidates on humanity. The story is set on a fictitious Wisconsin college campus, and the main characters are members of the baseball team, plus the President of the University. Baseball is the framework for the story, but it's not about baseball; it's about what it's like to be human from many different perspectives.

She's always been one of those authors who fall into my ""One day I should read something he/she wrote"" category. But since I was not familiar with O'Connor, I didn't buy A Good Hard Look when it first came out. I read the great s by others, but my stack of Books To Read already threatens to topple over on me in my sleep. Here enters Twitter. Ann Napolitano is quite engaging, and we have other favorite authors in common, specifically, Ann Patchett.

The story draws you in, then about 2/3 through, it socks you in the face! Wow! One day life is good, then the next... well, you should read this book yourself to see what I mean. And, if there's anyone else out there who has shied away from this book because they're not familiar with O'Connor, don't let that stop you. In fact, I recently purchased A Good Man Is Hard To Find, a short story collection by O'Connor.

Or rather, WHO for art thou?Paul Auster is like a raccoon that picks apart his characters' brains sharing this fact, hiding that fact, mixing up the pieces until even the reader feels she's going mad... in this case, me. Paul Auster is like a master of disguises, inserting himself into his characters and stories and then slipping back out before we know he's gone.The New York Trilogy is, duh, a trilogy, and yet, I didn't know that until the very end of the third short story. A little dense, perhaps (again, I'm talking about myself). Except for a couple hints, I thought this was simply three short stories until Auster expertly weaves them back together. There are a few inconsistencies, and yet I think those might be intentional to leave normal people like me wondering... City of Glass, the first story, is meta-fiction, meaning it plays mind games with the reader. I loved that. Yes, he shows off, but that's part of his beauty. Auster is like a soccer player I once saw standing on a ledge high atop the steps at Sacre Coeur expertly juggling a soccer ball in ways that a mother cannot watch. He's just that much better than would-be writers like myself. The second story, Ghosts, is another mind game, White hires Blue to follow Black who lives on Orange Street, only Black is White and he is watching Blue. Get the picture? Exactly.Finally, The Locked Room wraps up the book. It maybe my favorite of the three, but I might have said that about the other two if I wrote separate s after each story. That's how immediate the trance from Auster's writing, how he pulls the reader in so deeply. The Locked Room has a love element to it, which is might be why I liked it best. Auster's novels are a little harsh, not in a chauvinistic way, just in a gritty guy way. His characters walk the streets of New York, often give up eating, showering, shaving, even talking much. They just tend to go quietly crazy. His characters ask nothing of the reader: You don't have to like me. You don't have to identify with me. You don't have to care about me. If you want to read this, ok; if not, piss off.

This story might actually be my favorite of hers, except that after reading State of Wonder, Bel Canto, and Run, I had a few nit-picky complaints. Do you think that you hold your favorite authors to a higher standard? I think I do. The Patron Saint of Liars is about a pregnant woman who runs away from her husband because she doesn't love him and doesn't want to have his baby. She finds a home where pregnant girls can go (this is set in the 60s) to live out their pregnancy and then give their babies away. Only this woman decides to keep her baby. Like I said, I could barely put this book down, but the element that keeps me from giving it 5 Stars (other than some editing that I would have done differently) is that I didn't like the ending. It wasn't warm and fuzzy and neat and tidy.However, Ann Patchett deserves to end her stories any way she wants.

Without having read any of his other works, it's impossible for me to say how this stands in his oeuvre, but I can say it was a fantastic book to read. In case anyone reading this  has not yet read Bolaño, I can say this novella is an excellent entry for the curious. It is light enough and accessible enough that no one need be intimidated (like I was).On the surface, The Skating Rink is a story about a murder told alternately by three men. They are loosely linked by a beautiful, young ice skater—who may or may not be the one who is murdered. The story is rendered in very brief ""chapters"" from each narrator; each ends in a thought and an ellipse. One er called it another of Bolaño's ""sui generis,"" and I loved it as a style choice. As I read the book, I could almost picture these three Latin men sitting around a massive oak table with a microphone placed directly in the center by a silent director giving each man a turn to add a layer to this delicate creation. There are so many levels on which to talk about this work: the plot, the characters, the writing, the genre, etc. On the writerly level, The Skating Rink receives 5 Stars from me, no question. Bolaño forms some of the most poetic, elegant, descriptive sentences I have ever read, beginning with the opening sentence: ""The first time I saw him, it was in the Calle Bucareli, in Mexico City, that is, back in the vague shifty territory of our adolescence, the province of hardened poets, on a night of heavy fog, which slowed the traffic and prompted conversations about that odd phenomenon, so rare in Mexico City at night, at least as far as I can remember."" I love it! ""... the vague shifty territory of our adolescence..."" The book is filled with these flowing gems.On a plot level, well, this is where I deduct one star. Many might disagree, arguing for the brilliance of the subtle, literary pace of the story and the graceful, loose ending. But this is my  and I like a stronger plot. I expected a different ending, and to be honest, I wasn't thrilled by Bolaño's choice there. That didn't ruin the book for me, but it does drop my  a notch.

Not that the ending wasn't expertly foreshadowed, it's just that I didn't expect it to be so powerful, and probably painful and cathartic for Torres to write. Briefly, this is a first person tale of a young boy with two older brothers, a white mother, and a Puetro Rican father. Life was the opposite of easy for them, but they had so much love between them that the story is heart-breakingly bittersweet. Justin Torres calls this a novel, but it reads like a marvelous blend of novel/short story collection/ memoir. I have not heard enough or read enough to know how true the story is, but true or completely fictional, I thought this was a fabulous book. It's very short and reads very quickly, so I highly recommennd squeezing it into your list (as your next book). Not only was the story gripping, but Torres is an excellent writer.

Patchett, in my mind, has brought back the Omniscient novel. She elegantly and deeply describes each one of her characters so well that I feel as if they are my neighbors and friends. Run by Ann Patchett—who has quickly become one of my favorite authors—is a tale of a Boston family; it's not about politics, as some say. Patchett makes the reader feel as if they are living in her imaginary world, in very tight prose. (Weird thing was, I actually was in Boston for part of the time I was reading it, but I would have felt that, even from Des Moines.) (In her novel, Bel Canto, I felt like I was inside the compound in the unnamed South American country where that story takes place.)My only knock on Run is Chapter 8 when one of characters is in the hospital. I wish I could ask Patchett why she felt the need to take that subplot where she did. I didn't feel it was necessary. In fact, it kind of disappointed me. But, I am such a fan of hers that I will easily let it slide and assume that she knows better than I do.Bravo, again, Ms. Patchett....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 14, 2011","Aug 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/80566.Run

It's not just me... seems all writers flail, cry and scream about their writing! Tom Grimes is an excellent writer. The fact that his fiction has never reached the heights he'd hoped for as a young man is, perhaps, only a matter of time. If any novelist writes more than one or two phenomenal books in his or her lifetime, it's a path to eternal fame. Perhaps Grimes just hasn't written his yet. But this memoir is extremely well written. In fact, it reads like a novel, perfectly paced with a dramatic episode beginning in Chapter Nineteen. Wow! Deep, personal, moving and refreshingly honest. Writers and those-who-love-writers should all read this book to help understand the internal pressures of being a serious writer. As he says on page 142, ""You don't choose the writer's life; the writer's life chooses you."" I think the key is to keep one's expectations balanced with a life outside of the publishing world.

Ann Patchett created an amazing world with an appropriate hero, antagonist, and a long list (but not too long) of supporting characters. The primary location for this novel is deep in the Amazon, and I felt like I was there with the description of the heat, the bugs, the river, and the people. I have spent considerable time in the depths Costa Rica (not the Amazon, but not dissimilar), and the novel felt very true to third-world equatorial countries. The book is told from an omniscient POV, which I enjoyed. The story was engaging, the plot gripping and fast-paced—I read it in less than 3 days—and the characters were very believable. I think I fell in love with Easter, the little deaf boy they meet in Brazil.. This was my first Patchett book, and I am eager to read Bel Canto, Run, and anything else she has written.

About 3/4 of the way through, I was contemplating whether I'd give it 4 stars or 5. As you can see, I give it 4 stars.A Yellow Raft In Blue Water was a remarkable tale of 3 women (daughter, mother, grandmother) written by a man. There is the requisite overlap of scenes, told from each woman's perspective, and yet each part of the novel is in 1st POV from each character. It was so enlightening in that it reinforced that we really know very little about our ancestors' lives and histories.This novel engaged me much more intensely than I expected it to. Michael Dorris did an excellent job of creating characters who were flawed enough that the reader truly cares about each one. I have two criticisms about this book, not that Michael Dorris need to worry about what I think. First, there were way too many metaphors and similes. Many of them were beautiful and elucidating, but they began to overwhelm me, especially in the Rayona section (Part 1 about the daughter). Second, throughout Part 1 and 2, the grandmother is extremely cold and angry. I expected Part 3 to explain why she was so cold, but it never really got there. Yes, it (she) answered many questions, but it didn't explain why she was so, so distant and removed from her daughter. Overall, I truly enjoyed this book. I recommend it, with only slight reservations. Chalk it up, if you will, to the fact that my friend RAVED about it... so it had no place to go but down.

That's how I felt while reading the great novel, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.When this book was first published in 1953, it was labeled Science Fiction; still is. But reading it for the first time in 2011, it feels like ""normal"" fiction. The events/objects/feelings that Bradbury imagined shortly after WWII that are now part of our everyday lives is astounding: ""Seashell Radio"" ear plugs = iPod headphones; 24 hour robot tellers = ATMs; TV shows of ""family members"" that interact with the viewer = reality shows; the demise of books = e-publishing; the panic over the disappearance of books = writers everywhere! This book isn't science fiction, simply a mainstream novel that was published fifty years early. And ironically, it has just been announced that Fahrenheit 451 will soon be available as an ebook. OH MY, the laugh that Ray Bradbury must have had with that decision! So we have brilliant writing, a prescient (now contemporary) story, a love of books and publishing, a gripping plot, and a passion for knowledge—I want to party with Ray Bradbury!The story of Guy Montag parallels another of my favorite fictional characters: Dagny Taggart. Dagny Taggart is, of course, the heroine of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (published in 1957). Dagny went in search of John Galt, propelled by the idiocy of the ""second-handers,"" i.e., those who tried to save intelligence from those who would burn all books in Fahrenheit 451. Perhaps it's not unusual to find a link between these two books considering they are of the same era, as are so many other of my favorites (too numerous to mention!). I love to picture what the world was like outside when these writers were inside putting pen to paper (literally) or pecking away on a clacking typewriter, fixing the tangled keys, replacing the ribbon when it ran out, sliding the return right to left at the end of each line, inserting page after page as quickly as they could type. After Hiroshima, I imagine it was easy to picture the end of the world just over the horizon; thank goodness that hasn't come true (yet).Fahrenheit 451 was received in its day by mixed s. Even now, specifically on goodreads, it has received mixed s. I think it is a wonderful and well-written book, and I'm surprised it's not more popular than it is. I would recommend it to anyone.Five Stars to Fahrenheit 451. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 09, 2011","Apr 16, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7656.Fahrenheit_451

Kazuo Ishiguro is one of the best writers of our time. This novel, written in 1990, takes place over only 6 days. It's a first person account set in the late 1950s of an aging British butler who goes on a journey via motorcar and analyzes his life as he narrates his trip.It took me a few pages to get into the quiet subtleties of the story, but that's only because I typically read newer, more commercial novels. Once I slowed down and savored every word, I began to appreciate it for what it is: simply one of the best literary novels I've ever read. It is brilliant, yet accessible. As ""Stevens"" recounts stories of his personal and professional past, Ishiguro never mentions the words ""love"" or ""jealousy"", yet the personal storyline is about exactly this - emotions that Ishiguro beautifully expresses in the ultimate example of ""Show, don't tell.""I could go on and on with my praise.

Since then, I have lost a loved one, and I now recognize the grief that Didion writes about. Loss is hard and there are no right ways to grieve—or to write about that grief. Even after two readings, I can scarcely imagine losing a spouse of 40 years, especially a relationship as close and constant as Didion's and Dunne's. And now, in what seems like dramatic irony, I know that roughly six months after this book was published, Didion lost her only daughter, the one who suffered so many tragic health issues in this book. I cannot fathom how Didion got through that. I am clueless though on how/why/who chose the word ""magical"" for this title. Maybe Didion felt getting through the year after her husband's death took a fair bit of magic, or maybe the publisher thought that's the only way it would sell. Regardless, this is a sad, heart-wrenching tale of loss. Raising my rating to FOUR STARS.FIRST READING: I had high hopes for such a book by such an insightful author. While it was very moving and sad, I never felt like she touched bone with her emotional descriptions.

Last summer, I read The Great Gatsby for the first time WHAT I THINK TODAY:So, it's certain I'll never be a politician; not that I ever wanted to be. Last summer, I read The Great Gatsby for the first time in my life; my earlier  is below. I'd seen the movie (I've seen just about every movie with Robert Redford in it.), but I'd never read the book. (In high school, my favorite teacher taught British Lit. Perhaps I should have branched out.) Upon further , I shall eat crow whenever anyone reminds me of my earlier dubiousness concerning its greatness.My second reading of this classic truly opened my eyes. Instead of rushing through it so I could say I'd read it, this time I essentially read this line by glorious line. I underlined a hundred well-turned phrases. A few noteworthy examples: ""... high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" And ""... I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."" More: ""he was... second cousin to the devil."" And lastly, ""The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.""A close second, in my opinion, to Fitzgerald's superior turn of a phrase is the sublime subtlety with which he lets the facts of the story unfold. Never too soon, never too obvious. Brilliant!F. Scott Fitzgerald's structure, foreshadowing, verbiage, setting, and plot remain stellar after nearly a hundred years of scrutiny as well. His remarkable ability to tell a story from the first POV of a character who is NOT the protagonist is nothing short of brilliant. Nick Carraway narrates the story—which some would argue makes him the protagonist, but he wants essentially nothing. A protagonist must want something. Gatsby wants Daisy, therefore he is the protagonist. He wants her as much as Frodo wants the ring. He simply cannot narrate his own story because he dies in the end. (I hope that wasn't a spoiler!) The Great Gatsby has become my all-time favorite novel... or at least it's now in my top five. WHAT I THOUGHT IN AUG. 2011:You know what I like about the 21st Century? The ability to say anything I want, and the platform from which to shout it. If The Great Gatsby were submitted to an agent today, as is, by a no name author, I wonder what the response would be. Don't get me wrong, I agree it's a great read, but what would an editor do with it? Is it just me, or could this prose use a little cleaning up? Ok, so in 1925, when it was written, perhaps the rules weren't as stringent (or were they more so?). The Elements of Style wasn't published until 1959—maybe now it would be edited differently. In any case, now that I'm analyzing literature (albeit from a non-editor's background), I'd make a few changes.What's important here, of course, is not the punctuation, etc., but the story. Yes, it's superb. But you already knew that.Five stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"Apr 21, 2021Aug 24, 2011","May 02, 2021May 11, 2013","Jan 17, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby

And if so, I'm curious about what grade level. Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 Do schools still read To Kill A Mockingbird in lit classes? And if so, I'm curious about what grade level. Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was voted the best book of the 20th Century by the Library Journal—unbelievable for a debut novel—so it's very difficult for me to criticize this book in any meaningful way. After all, who am I compared to those two most lofty entities?But after so much time, it is possible to analyze Mockingbird within a historical perspective that gives us a new glasses. Recently, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been in the news because a scholar and a publisher have been working to re-write that book to replace the ""N"" word with the word ""slave"" so that it can fall off the Banned Books list and be enjoyed by children today. I've not heard any such controversy about Mockingbird, even though the same word is quite prevalent. That would be an interesting discussion, why Finn but not Mockingbird? I won't go into the plot lines of Mockingbird; instead here are a few of my thoughts: 1) Harper Lee had such a fantastic way of observing the world and whittling those observations into words. I'm surprised and disappointed that more of her phrases from this novel didn't make it into American jargon. She's also quite witty in the most subtle (my favorite) way. That being said... Point 2) Large parts of the book are boring, or at least unnecessary for the plot. They seem to do little more than set the tone, which is important, just uninteresting in context of the story. 3) Today (2012) the book reads as quite pedantic and transparent on moral and ethical rights and wrongs. Her message is not subtle. Lee wrote the book in the late 50s, about a story that happens in the 30s. What I wonder is (not that this changes anything, I just wonder about it) were there any nine-year olds in the 30s who really saw how wrong prejudice is, and that black-skinned people are the same—in many cases better—than white-skinned people? Or was this a starry-eyed 30-year old who WISHED she had known better as a child how wrong prejudice was? According to Wikipedia, Mockingbird has major autobiographical references.

JD Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is oneWhile all authors strive to write books in a unique ""voice,"" only a handful stand out as shining examples. JD Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is one of them. I have just finished reading TCITR for the third time, specifically so that I could hear the ""voice"" of Holden Caulfield, and recall Salinger's archetype as a foundation for my own ""Work-In-Progress."" Funny thing was, I almost stopped reading after twenty or so pages because the voice felt like TOO MUCH! Focusing on how many times Holden says the word ""phony"" or how often he uses superlatives, sarcasm, and contradictions became nearly overwhelming. This is NOT a criticism of Salinger's choices; I believe the novel is close to perfect. Reading TCITR once versus multiple times is like going for a dip in the ocean versus donning scuba gear for a deep sea dive: The experience becomes infinitely more intense.During the first and even second readings of this book, I focused mainly on Holden Caulfield's sad story. Holden is a nineteen-year-old rich kid struggling against everything that has been handed to him on the silver platter of his father's success. Unfortunately for Holden, that silver platter has not protected the family from tragedy. Allie, Holden's younger brother, died of leukemia several years before this story, and the entire family has suffered and coped with his death in their own way. Holden is extremely observant and sensitive, and through his struggle to make sense of his own luck and good fortune—money, good looks, intelligence, social graces—he is repelled by ""phonies,"" snobs, conceited people, inconsiderate people ... essentially anyone who wields power over anyone else. He has profound compassion for the innocent and less fortunate.Holden's story is heartbreaking. I imagine many people know of a ""rich kid"" who drinks too much or fails to apply himself, so it's wonderful that Salinger could provide a glimpse into the heart and mind of one of those kids. The same could apply to anyone with a handicap, or to a minority. TCITR should teach every reader compassion for others.I believe THE CATCHER IN THE RYE will always be in print, much like JANE EYRE, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, TALE OF TWO CITIES, WAR AND PEACE, et. al. It is that good, and that indicative of an era in time. Bravo, JDS.Undoubtedly, Five Stars (again)...more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,not setnot set,"Sep 24, 2013Jan 2010","Jan 17, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye
