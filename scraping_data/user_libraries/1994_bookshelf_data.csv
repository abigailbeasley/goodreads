That reason may be simple entertainment (ala the pop lit thriller du jour) or it canStorytellers always have a reason for telling a particular story. That reason may be simple entertainment (ala the pop lit thriller du jour) or it can be more English major-y (e.g. wanting to articulate man's inhumanity to man).Jodi Picoult's reason for telling this story seems to be because it is on the bleeding edge of law, medical science, and ethics. That makes for an interesting law school case study or a great episode of Law & Order. But it does not necessarily make for a great novel.Case studies and episodes of Law & Order are not about people; they're about precedents, conflicts, loopholes, and intriguing logical or ethical dilemmas. Yes, there can be intense pain and sadness, but ultimately the ""story"" being told is one of decision making, adjudicating. Truths about the human condition are not being plumbed.My Sister's Keeper thinks it's about people and the human condition, but really it's just a glorified episode of Law & Order.The novel's setup is intriguing because it's clearly a difficult lose-lose situation. Here Picoult excels at presenting the situation and all of its associated pain. But our expectation of storytellers--at least my expectation of them--is that they must do more than just present the situation; they must help us make sense of the situation, extract meaning from it. But Picoult cannot and does attempt anything beyond presentation.Now of course not every storyteller provides answers. It could be argued that the greatest works are those that are open-ended. Can any sane person ever truly understand Col. Kurtz? Is Iago's motivation ever made perfectly clear? Exploring the depths of madness and darkness is fascinating and terrifying--as much as we want to look away, we can't.But exploring a lose-lose situation in which the people you love most will be devastated no matter the outcome is just pure pain. Cheap slasher flicks force characters to agonizingly choose which of two loved ones will be sacrificed. It's cheap because there is no solution and there never will be one--and everyone knows it. In other words: it's a storytelling dead end, unless you concoct some way out of the impossible choice.In a sense, that's all Jodi Picoult has done here with her story, but she's intentionally painted herself into a corner from which there's no escape. Pure pain on one side, pure pain on the other. There's no greater meaning or lesson to be had from the novel, other than the decision that is rendered by the judge on the story's legal/ethical challenge.That's why it's nothing more than a glorified episode of Law & Order.So if you like Law & Order and you like banging your head against the wall just to experience the pain of it, by all means, go ahead and read this novel. Pain and misery is part of the human condition, but the best storytellers give us a deeper insight into that pain and misery or--even better--how to live with that pain and misery. Jodi Picoult has crafted a clever and topical situation that our families and courts will have to deal with sooner rather than later, but that alone doesn't make for notable storytelling. She isn't interpreting the world for us; she's merely presenting us with a sticky problem that most of us have been lucky enough to not have had to have thought about yet.Also, I think she's a bit of a hack. Her reliance on metaphor in EVERY chapter becomes so obvious, repetitive, and annoying that I began picturing her at a ""How to write a novel"" community college class that suggested ""insert a metaphor!"" as an assignment. Having learned that one tip, she then dropped out of the class and it is now the one and only trick in her writer's bag.Her characters are just real enough to be believable, but burdened with hack writer-esque ""character"" forced upon them to give them something to do. There's nothing wrong with a firefighter dad who's also an avid astronomer, but that's really all he has as a character. You can hear hack writers thinking, ""hmm, he's a dad and he's a firefighter, but I need something else to make him more interesting... hmm... ooh! Astronomer! Yeah, that's all poetic and stuff!""I know how this works because I've been guilty of the same thing when I've created characters. Characters created by hack writers have features grafted onto them (the crass lawyer who has a service dog even though he's not blind!) that are supposed to ""make"" them interesting. But all this does is reveal that the writer doesn't understand that it's WHO the person is that makes her interesting--not what she does, what she has, or what her hobbies are.The firefighter dad waxes philosophic about the stars because Picoult has grafted that onto his character--but NOT because such philosophizing is a natural outgrowth of who he is. The attempt to make him interesting, to make him multi-dimensional, only exposes how one-dimensional his character really is.I definitely won't be reading another Jodi Picoult novel, nor will I see the movie adaptation of this novel that's about to come out.And I definitely do not recommend it to anyone else.Pure pain. No answers. No greater understanding of the human condition. No reason to read it or see it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jul 2009,"Jul 09, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10917.My_Sister_s_Keeper

A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking3. The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene--with an optional step 0 that should precede Zukav:0. Zen and the Art of the Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig (but only read the first 2/3 or so)The reason for this order is that Zukav does the best job of explaining the major revelations in physics from Copernicus to Einstein on through to quantum mechanics. Pirsig's Zen is highly recommended before reading Zukav because Zukav takes a more philosophical view of physics; many of Zukav's abstract concepts come across much more clearly in Zen.Hawking is the least satisfying of the three, but goes the deepest into Einsteinian general relativity and the cosmic significance of gravity.With Zukav covering quantum mechanics and Hawking covering gravity, we are now ready for Greene whose superstring theory unites quantum mechanics with gravity.It's not an easy read, but it's not extraordinarily difficult either. I found it very enjoyable to read half a chapter or so in each sitting. He breaks up his discussion into easily digestable chunks, with multiple section headers further subdividing his chapters.He tells a compelling and exciting story, though the latter third of the book gets increasingly difficult. The problem is twofold. First, the physics moves further and further from our ability to visualize and innately understand--we can intuitively ""get"" a black hole, but we cannot intuitively understand a multidimensional cavity within a 6-dimensional clump of space-time. The second problem is that even if we could visualize a 6-D space, we can't see the relevance of it. Most of the core findings of superstring theory come out of these 6-D spaces. His discussion necessarily becomes one of mathematical proofs (though he does it without the math--he expertly talks us through the basic concepts with very little math lingo). The proofs in and of themselves are interesting, but can hardly compete with the cosmic significance of Hawking's black holes and wormholes. Greene puts in a heroic effort to convey the significance of each proof and does keep things interesting. But ultimately a big part of the book reads something like the following (with artistic liberties):""We know that there are 7 flimflams in the universe. This proof shows that the oogy-boogy inside the foobar has three whatsits. The math is extremely complex, but what we've been able to determine is that the three whatsits cause the foobar to generate 7 flimflams--exactly what experimental data confirms!""You get a little caught up in the excitement, but then immediately say, ""uh, sounds cool, but so what?"" The ""So what?"" does eventually come at the end and is worth arriving at, but you'll have to be patient and ride through all the revelations of whatsits and foobars and oogy-boogies that seem almost meaningless until you finally arrive at your destination.This is not a weakness of Brian Greene's writing. This is the inherent challenge of discussing superstring theory.In Wu Li, Zukav gave us a taste of quantum mechanics and its many, many mind-blowing oddities, but the realm of quantum mechanics is still just barely accessible to our minds and our imagination. No, we'll never see a quark with the naked eye, but we kind of get what it's all about. We can invoke a naive view of it as a building block for protons and neutrons, which, in turn, are the building blocks of atoms that we're all familiar with from high school chemistry.Quantum mechanics is the weird reality that underlies the world as we know it. But superstring theory is the even weirder reality that underlies quantum mechanics. It's just so far removed from our experience of reality.But weird as it is, it does seem to be getting us closer to understanding the fundamental nature of our universe--and perhaps even universes--and, more abstractly, it's just cool to marvel at how intelligent and clever human beings can be.It's worth reading, but if you're going to read it, do it right; follow the sequence outlined above....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jul 2009,"Jun 28, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/771.The_Elegant_Universe

Hawking, on the other hand, is much less thorough and as the material gets more complex, he opts to not explain things at all. For example, he discusses his work on a mathematical model of the universe that avoids singularities, but his explanations don't help the reader to understand anything deeper about the universe. One suspects that his work is only interesting because it makes the math easier. Good for him and good for science, but as a lay reader, I couldn't care less.Hawking is still worth reading though. He covers massive gravitation and its effects (i.e. black holes) in much more depth than Zukav and that stuff is just freakin' cool.It's a shame that A Brief History of Time is so brief.

Far from it, in fact.The strength of the book is Zukav's  of the history of physics. He does a good job setting up and explaining the major breakthroughs so that you, the reader, can appreciate their significance in pretty substantial ways. That's quite a feat. His clarity gets weaker as he starts to go into the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics though. At times he's so eager to jump to the scientific and philosophical ramifications of quantum mechanics that he sprints past the reader's understanding. I re-read and re-read and re-read passages until I finally saw that he had left out certain points that would have made things much more comprehensible, had he been more careful.The biggest flaw in the book is his hippie obsession with his Wu-Li metaphor. At times it's elegant and beautiful, but more often than not it's annoying and overblown. He's too eager to yammer on about particles acting as if they were conscious, ties between quantum mechanics and telepathy, and on and on. He's not a scientist so he's free to make these leaps of imaginative fancy, but I was constantly rolling my eyes whenever he started to wax philosophic about some new wrinkle in quantum mechanics.The other thing that grates is that he thinks the book is very funny. He even writes in the introduction that he's amazed and so pleased with how funny the book is, that it is, in fact, funnier than he is in real life. Mr. Zukav? It's not funny. His humor is cloying and totally unnecessary.Still, if you're interested in the history of physics--from Newton to Einstein to the birth of quantum mechanics--this is the book to read. But oddly enough, I'd recommend that you read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as a primer to this book. Zen covers a lot of the difficult philosophical underpinnings that Zukav has integrated into his book. And Zen is a better introduction to those ideas.This summer, apparently, will be the summer of physics. I've figured out a logical progression:0. (Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance)1. The Dancing Wu Li Masters (history of physics + good discussion of Einstein + good intro to quantum mechanics)2. A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking (deeper discussion of Einstein's space-time + intro to quantum gravitation)3. The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene (superstring theory of quantum gravity)To some degree each of the three physics books cover the same ground, but Zukav excels at surveying the history of physics and at describing Einstein's three important contributions. His intro to quantum mechanics is good enough, but that will be covered in more detail later.Hawking rushes through the history of physics so you really need Zukav as a primer. But Hawking then goes much deeper into the implications of general relativity's space-time. I'm halfway through it now and it's pointing towards a unification of general relativity with quantum mechanics (aka quantum gravitation).I began reading Brian Greene's book but realized that Zukav and Hawking really must come first. Greene also surveys the history of physics but does so briefly. His discussions of general relativity also aren't as robust as Zukav or Hawking's.

It won't be.It's an enjoyable read that could be well-suited to advanced junior high readers up to average sophomores and juniors in high school.Why do people love to hate this book?Well for starters the protagonist and narrator, Bella, is kind of an insult to our post-feminist sensibilities. Yeah she has the occasional strong, intelligent moment but for the whole book she's basically just staring into Edward's eyes and feeling her heart flutter. Over and over and over again. She's so weak-kneed she may as well be wheelchair bound.And I suspect that some readers--women in particular--will be reminded of some awful young romance (junior high?) in their own past that was embarrassing and silly and had them acting like Bella. So while you're scowling at stupidly smitten Bella, you're also reliving sad moments of your own adolescence and working up a bit of self-loathing or even pain.We want Bella to do better than we did when we were young and dumb and unable to control our emotions. But she can't--she's just as pathetic as many of us were and we resent her for it.So then should we praise Stephenie Meyer for writing such a true-to-life pathetic heroine? No. Bella is just too pathetic to carry us through 400+ pages.The other problem is that Bella makes for a dry narrator. Meyer's ""voice"" through Bella reads more like a screenplay than a novel--and no one has ever accused a screenplay of being a piece of literature. Again, Meyer does do a good job of situating us back in high school and capturing the thought processes of a 15-year-old. If I met Bella in real life, I think I'd find her enjoyable enough. But I do not think I could sit and listen to her tell me about her love life for five hours. She's just not interesting enough to merit that kind of attention.Twilight is being made into a movie and I hope the filmmakers do a reasonably good job. This story is much more suited to being a 2-hour movie than a 5-hour read.We talked about how we might incorporate this novel into a high school English class. Our unanimous opinion was that we would not devote class time to reading this novel; there's just not enough meat there. However, I would consider showing the movie adaptation in order to get into a discussion of how fate and free will operate differently in this story than they do in Romeo & Juliet (which is at the crux of what we're doing in my Methods of Teaching English class)....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Oct 2008,"Sep 30, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41865.Twilight

Re-reading it twelve years later I can see why I liked it so much--andThis was the only book I remember enjoying from my high school English classes. Re-reading it twelve years later I can see why I liked it so much--and still do.Dickens lays it on pretty thick in parts and is perhaps trying too hard to evoke the passions and bloodlust of the French Revolution. And as lovely as dear Lucie Mannette is, she's pretty unbearable by modern women's standards. But don't worry, Dickens isn't a misogynist. He more than makes up for Lucie in the characters of Madame Defarge and Miss Pross. Their strength, resolve, and particularly Madame Defarge's intelligence and leadership leave no doubts that Dickens respects women.The beginning of the novel is also a bit difficult and choppy. I don't think it's simply a matter of adjusting to his style of English; I think his prose smoothed out considerably after the first few chapters.He also has this annoying tendency towards intentional obtuseness. The technique occasionally pays dividends, but mostly it's just frustrating as a reader to wait for him to explain what the hell he's talking about.But all quibbles aside, A Tale of Two Cities is a remarkable novel.His storytelling is incredibly cinematic--he himself used the term ""picturesque"" to describe his approach--with many scenes and setups that are perfect examples of the sorts of visual storytelling prescribed by screenwriting how-to books. I'm convinced that had Dickens lived today, he would have been an incredible screenwriter.And though the novel is set within and inextricably linked to the French Revolution, it is not about the French Revolution. That setting is used as a spectacular backdrop within which Dickens weaves an intricate and tightly plotted tale. It never forgets that first and foremost it is telling the characters' story, not merely recounting history.And the last chapter is just incredible. I was crying while reading it on the train this weekend. And the famous last line--""It's a far better thing...""--is well-worthy of its fame; it's the most profound, beautiful last line of a novel I have ever read.I'll admit that it's not consistently gripping, that a great bulk of the middle of the novel is merely interesting but not engrossing. But as a means to an end--as a means to that ending--it's entirely acceptable.Took me about 9.5 hours to read. Not a huge commitment.

I think.Something like four different generations are followed and each generation has its own version of each namesake. But it's not just one namesake per generation--the 1865 generation has a Zyllie in America and a Zyllah in South America. Or is it the other way around? Gedder wants a Maddux to get with his sister Zyllah and wants Gwen for himself, but that Maddux is engaged to the Zyllie in America. Confusing? Yes. Does this sound silly? Yes.The first generation's usages of the names is fine. The second generation is interesting but gets a little confusing (like if the families married in the first generation, why are Maddocs still courting Zyllahs?). And by the third generation it's just absolutely ridiculous that L'Engle is still trying to play this name game.All this nuttiness aside, our hero, Charles Wallace doesn't seem to really do much in the story. He travels within a particular person in each generation and kind of becomes them. But only in the first generation is it clear that Charles himself steps forward and directs his host to act in a certain way. After that, Charles' influence on his host--and therefore on the novel--is less distinct.One can infer a few instances where his presence may have made a difference, but overall the effect is to make him seem more like a passive observer than active participant in saving civilization.

An elementary school parking lot and the microcosm of a sub-cellular body just don't excite the way that interplanetary and intergalactic travel do in ""Wrinkle"".She does populate the book with interesting, quirky characters, but again they pale in comparison to ""Wrinkle's"" oddball cast.Worst of all though she retreads a lot of ground covered in ""Wrinkle"". There's a strange lack of reference to the previous book that somewhat befuddled me. For example, Charles Wallace claims he's seen something fantastic and otherworldly but his sister doesn't believe him. Um, after what they've all been through in ""Wrinkle,"" shouldn't Meg be a bit more willing to believe in the fantastic and otherworldly?And my biggest criticism really is about Meg. In ""Wrinkle"" she had a difficult character arc that parallels any adolescent life--she had to grow up a bit and take responsibility onto herself rather than look to her father or others to solve her problems for her. That worked wonderfully in ""Wrinkle"".But older, wiser Meg appears in ""Wind"" as almost completely reverted to the dependant-on-others adolescent she seemed to be at the beginning of ""Wrinkle"". I almost wonder if L'Engle has this little faith in the resolve and fortitude of adolescent girls.It's almost like ""Wind"" is a ""Wrinkle"" reboot/re-do more than it is a sequel. My favorite passage from ""Wrinkle"" (see my ""quotes"" section on goodreads) is even reproduced verbatim in ""Wind"". Is that meant to be a recurring theme and a nod to the unity across these books, or is it a cheap writer's hack? Tough call.Her use of religious language and theology is also more blunt and less well-developed.L'Engle does refine her concept of evil in this book. Rather than a vague shadow evil is corporealized and somewhat personified in the Echthroi. She also introduces the concept of ""kything"" that plays a major role in the next book in the series, ""A Swiftly Tilting Planet"".As a completist I want to know as much as I can about her concept of the Echthroi and kything, but as a pragmatist I'd recommend simply skipping ""Wind"" and going straight to ""Swiftly"". From what I've read so far in ""Swiftly,"" ""Wind"" can be skipped without much loss in continuity (""Swiftly"" continues her odd trend to act as if the previous books didn't really happen--or that their events have been somewhat forgotten by her characters).I think ""Wrinkle"" had to go through many pain-staking revisions and was polished into a perfect gem as L'Engle struggled to get it published. But then her follow-up rode the coattails of the original's success and it just feels much less polished, much less refined.

But that's based strictly on the sentence structure, vocabulary, paragraph size, etc.What the stats don't cover is the depth of feeling and the profound scope and meaning in this book. Madeleine L'Engle's sentences may be rather simple but her notions of good, evil, love, and devotion are taken to a cosmic level (literally). This isn't mere sci-fi or fantasy; it's gorgeous, breathtaking Humanism. L'Engle never talks down to her child/young adult audience; though she aims at their level there are plenty of weighty, inspiring themes for adults to savor. The child-centric focus gives it a level of simplicity, yes, but also a kind of intense purity. She brilliantly weaves in issues relating to childhood, adolescence, parent-child relationships, maturation, acceptance, social stigma--all of which make the book utterly relatable, even when the kids are transplanted to fantastic or awful new planets in far off galaxies.There are some religious overtones, but they're really more cosmic than religious (even the stars in the galaxy are fighting the great darkness). She uses some of the language of Christianity to express her notion of universal love, but I don't think that should be seen as making this a Christian text. As an agnostic-bordering-on-atheist none of the language turned me off. Christians are free to embrace it as a wildly expansive view of Christianity but non-believers should be able to see that she has a vision that goes beyond the language used.I can't do the book full justice here.

It's not that this novel is the most heartfelt or the most endearing or the most engaging story ever written, it's that it perfectly articulates a full human life with all its flaws, mistakes, and failures....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,Jan 2006,"Apr 23, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/78433.The_Blind_Assassin

The stoI have certain reservations about this novel, specifically the latter life-as-Cal section, but its strong points far outweigh its weak points. The story is most engaging and most heartbreaking when it revolves around the young Callie; unexpectedly it's a classic coming-of-age story that is also a modern-day gender identity story.I read this for a class on modern Prizewinning Literature and wrote my final paper on it. Let me tell you, there is a LOT of depth and many layers of meaning to be discovered here, which is what makes it such a rich, engrossing experience (and a hell of a hard to novel to write a final paper on!).My only really serious criticism is that Callie is so endearing and so engaging that her later incarnations (teenage Cal, adult Cal) are rather flat by comparison. But even more damning than that, the later personas show only a factual connection to the earlier Callie; in either of the Cal sections I could see no evidence that the person who was once Callie had any connection to the person who is now Cal. In other words, there was no continuity of character, even considering the vast changes the character goes through.So it isn't perfect, but so few things ever are......more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2006,"Apr 23, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2187.Middlesex

But as something that has withstood the test of time and still resonates today, not so much.Marlowe is the warmup act for Shakespeare; he may have broken new ground but it was Shakespeare who mastered the territory. Faustus partially suffers from its source material and partially from Marlowe's pen. Just as the eponymous Faustus begins to get interesting and introspective, he is immediately distracted. He's basically Hamlet's antithesis.Faustus doesn't agonize over his deal with the devil nor does he relish in it. He rides a wavering middle line that fails to impress in either direction. He doesn't go deep and philosophical and yet with all his powers all he manages are pretty trite parlor tricks.So where's the drama? I'm still trying to figure that one out. The final scene is more dramatic but again there's just a lack of depth, of remorse, of the horror of realization that he could have been saved. Stuff just happens and it's mildly entertaining. Faustus as a character is mildly interesting but fails to really engage.In Marlowe's defense, he was still a young, developing writer whose career was cut short by an inconvenient murder....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2006,"Feb 24, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80897.Doctor_Faustus

It has elements that are oddly light and somewhat comical but it's not quite a comedy. It's not a tragedy either. I think it's more a fairy tale about forgiveness late in life and magically being granted a second chance. This is wish-fulfillment from a writer who must have experienced a lot of personal pain.It's also the most heartfelt and insightful depiction of love and relationships that I've seen in the Shakespeare plays. The tragedies don't have room for love and the comedies are just too simplistic and farcical to show any real insight (e.g. Much Ado About Nothing is charming but is exactly what the title professes). And don't even think about mentioning Romeo & Juliet; puppy love between a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old hardly qualifies as insightful.There's just something so sad about this fantasy. Even as beautiful, wonderfully uplifting events are occurring one senses a deep pain and regret from Shakespeare himself; the events depicted are just too beautiful, the forgiveness too perfect for such a thing to ever happen in the real world. The joy of this fictional world only underscores the pain and heartache and regret of the real world.Shakespeare's wish-fulfillment fantasy is glorious and devastating all at the same time.ps - I highly recommend the Signet Classics editions of all Shakespeare plays....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,Jan 2006,"Feb 06, 2007",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/72986.The_Winter_s_Tale

I loved both.Dune isn't a light, enjoyable readI guess I'm one of the few that bridge the gap between the Pride and Prejudice camp and the Dune camp. I loved both.Dune isn't a light, enjoyable read. At times it reads more like excerpts from geology, ecology, zoology, sociology, pscyhology, and political textbooks. The characters are more like mega-archetypes than real human beings.The appeal of Dune is peculiar. In order to enjoy Dune you have to enjoy complexity. All authors create little worlds in their stories but Herbert created a world.He doesn't just say that Arrakis is a desert planet, he engrosses himself and the reader into the geology.He puts people on the planet, governments, conflicting cultures, conflicting religions, conflicting ways of life that are thought out to the Nth level above and beyond anything else I've ever read. You could write a sociology or politics dissertation on the societal relations Herbert conceived for Dune.Now is complexity itself a thing to be admired in a work of fiction? Generally no, but Dune is so immense and so detailed that it creates and inhabits a category of its own. The very fact that it often reads more like a National Geographic article than a sci-fi novel speaks to its peculiar charm.Admittedly, this will not appeal to everyone. In fact, odds are that it will appeal to hardly anyone. But limited appeal should in no way factor into a work's quality. Compare the Academy Award-winning films against the yearly box office numbers if you don't agree. I'm sure Armaggeddon outgrossed Monster's Ball.And amidst all this complexity lies a kind of new myth that blends mysticism, religion, and crass real-world politics. It's a hybrid; it's not The Odyssey and it's certainly not Star Wars but I do find great appeal in its particular take on Campbell's hero's journey. And the fact that it plumbs the intricacies of Muslim/Arab/desert culture adds another layer of exotic flair to the work.As if all that wasn't ambitious enough, it even articulates a fascinatingly dark but pragmatic destiny for humanity as a whole.And all of these incredibly ambitious elements are all tightly woven together. Take out one element and the story loses its cohesion. Despite all the ridiculous amounts of detail there is nothing extraneous in this novel.Dune is a remarkable, magnificent accomplishment.
