It takes plGo as a River is the debut book of Shelley Read, a fifth-generation Coloradoan.The book takes place over a period of 28 years (1948-1971). It takes place in and around Iola, Colorado.Iola is now an extinct town located in Gunnison County, Colorado, United States. The community was inundated and destroyed by the creation of Blue Mesa Reservoir which came to be in 1963.The book is billed as a coming-of-age story of Victoria Nash. At the book's onset, she is 17 years old.She runs the household on her family's peach farm in the small ranch town of Iola, Colorado—the sole surviving female in a family of troubled men. Wilson Moon is a young drifter with a mysterious past, displaced from his tribal land and determined to live as he chooses.Victoria encounters Wil by chance on a street corner, a meeting that profoundly alters both of their young lives. When tragedy strikes, Victoria leaves the farm. Eventually, she returns to handle all the obstacles she faces.Victoria is a very strong character. As one er states:""Read creates such a lifelike, three-dimensional character that I woke up one morning wondering how my friend was doing, only realizing after a second that the person I was worried about wasn't flesh and blood. While her life is filled with tragedy, Victoria herself is not a tragic figure. She reminded me a bit of Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind, a naïve young woman confronted with hardship. At first, she's overwhelmed but then she rallies, revealing a hidden strength – and it's that strength that readers both admire and love her for.""I strongly recommend this book for its gorgeous scenic descriptions AND its well-developed characters. 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,1,12,1,"Feb 26, 2024",Mar 2024,"Feb 01, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63922271-go-as-a-river

The author reveals to the reader in her author’s note that although fThis book, The Reformatory, by Tananarive Due is spectacular historical fiction. The author reveals to the reader in her author’s note that although fiction, it is based on her true-life relative named Robert Stephens who died at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida, in the 1930s. None of the (main) characters, even young Robert Stephens himself, depict the lives and histories of real people. Gracetown is fictitious. The Gracetown Boy’s Reformatory is fictional.The character of Warden Fenton J. Haddock is also entirely fictitious. The author created Haddock as an amalgam of a system of violence in children’s incarceration—but the truth is that no one person can explain away the reported events at the Dozier School, or the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children, or the Indigenous “schools” in Canada where so many children were buried. No one person can be blamed for our nation’s current nightmare of mass incarceration.The author is on a mission to tell the story of Jim Crow Florida in 1950. She has done a fabulous job.Now the story:Gloria Stephens, 16, and Robbie Stephens, 12, are virtually orphans. Their mother has died of cancer and their father, Robert Stephens Sr, has fled to Chicago, having been accused of raping a white woman. He leaves the children in the care of Miz Lottie. Miz Lottie is old and Gloria feels she can take care of Robbie in her own home. One day, she and Robbie are accosted by a white boy, Lyle McCormack. Lyle makes advances toward Gloria, and Robbie, trying to protect his sister, kicks Lyle in the knee. Lyle’s father owns the town and insists Robbie be punished. The judge ‘sentences’ Robbie to 6 months at the Reformatory.As soon as Robbie gets there, we can tell he has special powers. A horrendous fire occurred at the reformatory in 1920 and killed twenty-five boys. Someone set fire to the shed in which they were locked and they could not get out. As Robbie walks in the vicinity of the fire, he can feel the heat of it.“The June sun in Gracetown from noon until dusk was almost as legendary as the sun in July or August, but the wall of heat he passed through with Boone was packed more tightly, a baking oven. The air was too hot to breathe, stinging his nostrils and throat.”And the ghosts (aka ‘haints’) of the twenty-five are, 30 years later, still haunting the reformatory grounds. The book is divided into eight parts: McCormack Road, The Reformatory, The Funhouse, The Courthouse, Haint Catcher, Lower Spruce (where Miz Lottie lives), Boot Hill, and The Hunt.Each section is written so well, that, you, the reader, just want to keep on reading. What will happen next, and who will we meet, and what will be revealed about each of these characters?This is the 30th book I have read this year, and easily the best. And let me tell you, I have read some GOOD books.Do yourself a favor and read this one. 6 stars (well you know what I mean) ...more",Notes are private!,1,10,1,"Mar 26, 2024","Apr 07, 2024","Nov 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/74891190-the-reformatory

Today, we have turned it into a cheap sweet we consume thoughtlessly, but cacao still comes at a terrible cost.""""Today, almost three-quarters of the world’s cocoa is grown in Africa, with 40 percent coming from the Ivory Coast alone.""The profit margins are slim in this industry of growing the bean. ""Thus, many turn to free labor: modern-day slavery. Too often, that labor comes from children.""The story and characters:Tara Sullivan’s young adult novel, The Bitter Side of Sweet, provides an account of modern-day child slavery in Ivory Coast, Africa. Although fictional, the story highlights the dark reality of the cacao industry as Sullivan chronicles the journey of three children to freedom.Amadou - Fifteen-year-old Amadou is the novel’s protagonist and narrator. His main focus is keeping his brother safe.Seydou - At just eight years old, Seydou is the youngest boy on the farm.Both of the boys were stolen from Mali, the country north of Cote d'Ivoire. According to the map at the front of the book, the cacao is grown in the southern part of the country north of the coast. They ARE far from home.Kahdija -Thirteen-year-old Khadija is the first and only girl to come to the cacao farm. She has her own story of how she got to the Cacao Farm.The story chronicles the relationship of the three and how they finally get away from the farm.

I can picture the Mekong River dividing Laos and Thailand. However, it is the character of Dr. Siri Paiboun that really intrigued me. He is a doctor, 72 years old, and has been conscripted as the National Coroner. And he thought he could retire; the Communists had a different idea.He has two assistants. Mr. Geung has Down's Syndrome, but also a phenomenal memory for detail. He reminds Siri constantly of procedures that Siri has forgotten.Dtui is a nurse and begs to be trained as Siri's assistant, hoping to become the next Coroner. Siri is happy to oblige.The joke between G and S is a daily question: ""Do we have any customers today?"" You know, did any dead people walk in?Most of the time the answer is no. But then things get busy. Mrs Nitnoy dies suddenly. Her husband tries to speed up the coroner's report. Is it murder?Then there are two boatmen who show up dead in the river. What is the story there?Another thing that Siri becomes involved in is answering why politicians from the South are dying faster than flies. Maybe the Hmong have killed them with potions.For the most part, I have been reading 1 book per country, but this series has me hooked, and it might get me to read more.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,2,9,1,"Oct 12, 2023","Nov 21, 2023","Sep 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/243353.The_Coroner_s_Lunch

This offering is worth my five-star rating.Did my mother have a life before she married my father, ask Emily, Maisie and Nell Brown. The answer is a resounding YES. Lara Brown is married to Joe Brown and they manage a cherry farm near Traverse City Michigan. They have three daughters who are in their twenties and are visiting the farm. A man named Peter Duke has recently died. Peter Duke who is known as a talented actor. Lara is coerced into telling her history with Peter Duke. And what a convoluted and engaging story it is.Lara (born Laura) does not think of becoming an actress, but she does, playing Emily Webb in the play Our Town, not one but two times. The first time in her high school in New Hampshire and the second in a summer theatre production, in Tom Lake, set in northern Michigan. Peter Duke is also in the play and her relationship with him as described to her daughters is the stuff of this story. Of course, there are lots of other details as well, very entertaining to the reader.I will be discussing this book with friends and book club in the next few weeks. I am anxious to see if my friends have liked the book as well as I did.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,1,27,1,"Dec 31, 2023","Jan 11, 2024","Aug 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63256933-tom-lake

Very good and included an interview by the author with the two divers: John Chatterton and Rich Kohler. Maybe I did not read the entire book but got the added benefit of this interview. I did get a copy of the book and the photos included are astounding.A German U-Boat was found off the shores of New Jersey in 1991. BookBrowse Review(https://www.bookbrowse.com/mag/...)Kurson brings considerable journalistic experience to his debut book, which combines the derring-do of a great modern-day adventure story with a 60 year old mystery. In other words, it's a book that can be enjoyed by a much wider audience than diving buffs (just as 'Into Thin Air' isn't just for climbers).In 1991 John Chatterton and Rich Kohler, two deep-sea wreck divers, found an unidentified German submarine lying at 230 feet off the coast of New Jersey. Their seven year task of identifying what they found took them to Germany and Washington and, of course, to the darkest corners of the submarine. If you want to know exactly what they found, you'll have to read the book - I'm not going to spoil it for you! 230 feet doesn't sound particularly deep - it's less than the length of a soccer field; but to put it into context, amateur divers typically dive to less than 100 feet; diving much deeper than this requires special equipment including special gas mixtures to reduce the risk of diving related issues (see sidebar).So there you are at 230 feet, with a limited amount of air, and therefore time, ready to explore a wreck - and not a wreck of a nice big ship but a small claustrophobic WWII submarine. It's pitch dark, except for any illumination you carry with you, and you have very little room to maneuver. In addition, at any moment you could bump into a part of the fragile wreck and the whole thing could cave in on you. I don't know about you, but I'm very comfortable reading about all this from the comfort of my armchair!4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 10, 2023","Jul 23, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35448424-shadow-divers

The book is a slow, thoughtful read and full of ideas that require careful consideration.The AuthorRichard John Neuhaus (May 14, 1936–January 8, 2009) was a prominent Christian cleric (first in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, then ELCA pastor and later as a Catholic priest) and writer. Born in Canada, Neuhaus moved to the United States where he became a naturalized United States citizen. He was the longtime editor of the Lutheran Forum magazine newsletter and later founder and editor of the monthly journal First Things and the author of 69 books. A staunch defender of the Roman Catholic Church's teachings on abortion and other life issues, he served as an unofficial adviser to the 43rd President George W. Bush on bioethical issues.In September 1990, Neuhaus was received into the Roman Catholic Church. A year after becoming a Roman Catholic, he was ordained by Cardinal John O'Connor as a priest of the Archdiocese of New York.The Words (Talking Points Presented at Book Club)Preface – The importance of Fridaya.	Good Friday should not be confined to Holy Weekb.	Good Friday, and this book about Good Friday, is for every day of every year.c.	Ever Friday should be remembered with a penance – make a sacrifice because Jesus died for us. d.	He drew a parallel between the Seven Words and the seven days of the week.e.	Also, there are seven Fridays in Lent.""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."" a.	Atonement: Think of at-one-ment: What was separated is now at one.b.	Forgiveness is not forgetfulness; what is forgotten need not, indeed cannot, be forgiven.c.	Be grateful that forgiveness is not limited to the sins that we know.""Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise."" a.	We must hope that all will one day hear the words of Christ, ""Today you will be with me in paradise.""b.	Given the evidence of Scripture and tradition, we cannot deny that hell exists. We can, however, hope that hell is empty. ""Woman, behold your son. Son, behold your mother. "" a.	Since Christ lives in John, when he speaks of him to Mary he says, ""Behold your son""-meaning, behold Christ.b.	Mary, then, did not lose her son on the cross; she gains sons and daughters beyond number, in all of whom the glory of Christ abides.""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""a.	Did Jesus, at the moment he cried out, really think that God had abandoned him?b.	It is true that only Mark and Matthew report the cry of dereliction.c.	Reading the Gospel accounts together, it becomes clear that the secret of the cry of dereliction is that the abandonment by God is the abandonment to God.""I thirst."" a.	I thirst for souls.b.	The crucial point is that those who are saved without knowing the name of Jesus the Christ are nonetheless saved by Jesus the Christ.""It is finished."" a.	""It is finished"" here should be taken in the sense of consaninnowim est-it is consummated, fulfilled, brought to perfection. This is much more than ""It is over.""""Father, into your hands I commend my spirit."" a.	Luke alone gives us this Seventh Word from the cross.b.	Note that in this last word God is once again ""Father.""As stated before by me, this book is very intense. I plan to read it again during the 7 weeks of Lent 2024.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,2,4,1,"Jul 21, 2023","Sep 11, 2023","Jul 17, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19058062-death-on-a-friday-afternoon

A real page turner.Does a great job of describing Namibian culture and geography. The characters are many in number but the secrets they keep are amazing and I believe all gets resolved in the end.Here is what the author has to say:During recent years, my family and I had the privilege of living in Windhoek, Namibia. We found Namibia to be a stunning country. The sheer expanse of the landscape renewed my hope for our planet, while the Namibians we met, as diverse as they are, were funny, fascinating, and welcoming. As an expatriate in a nation where few Americans reside, I was also lucky enough to befriend several U.S. State Department employees and their families. These were delightful, smart, and brave men and women who had dedicated their lives to representing and defending our nation. I admired them greatly. Admiration, however, does not make for good comedy, which is why I took many satirical liberties in the name of a story. I hope the dear friends I made in Namibia will forgive me. Making stuff up is the whole job. Except the part about our American president at the time bungling the name of the magnificent country of Namibia and calling the entire continent of Africa a shithole. That totally happened. It was nuts. 5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 10, 2023","Jun 25, 2023","Jun 10, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57634415-embassy-wife

This book overwhelmed me to such an extent, that I barely know where to start.The story is very complicated but tied together beautifully in the end.The characters are strong and memorable.There are two stories:A young girl, 12 years old, lives in India and is promised to a widower, aged 40. She does not have a name, but when she becomes the stepmother of her husband's son, she is called Big Ammachi (Big Mother). Eventually husband Parambal and Big Ammachi have two children of their own, Baby Mol, a girl orn with a developmental disorder, and Philipos, their son.The novel follows the girl and her new family through the years 1900-1977. The girl will quickly learn that her husband’s family is unique: they suffer from what she terms the Condition. In nearly every generation, there is a tragic drowning among its members.The alternate story centers on Digby Kilgore, a Glasgow, Scotland native who enlists in the Indian Medical Service. The lives of these two eventually intersect in ways that profoundly impact their fates.This book is a long-awaited second novel from Verghese who wrote  Cutting for Stone, published in 2009.Verghese is a polished writer; this book shows him at his VERY best.I would also like to recommend his autobiography:  My Own Country: A Doctor's StoryI was very impressed by it as well.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,1,16,1,"Nov 17, 2023","Dec 16, 2023","May 10, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63429926-the-covenant-of-water

As the CIA watches him closely, the question is not whether he will be killed, but rather who will get to him first.Enjoyed the book.Next Grisham: The Boys from Biloxi.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 06, 2023","May 20, 2023","May 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41730054-the-broker

""I now bear within me day and night the adorable Eucharist."" In other words, she requested and received the grace to allow her body to become a tabernacle. •	Quote from St Therese: May I say, from my vantage point as a very little soul who loves but is terrible at showing it in deeds, that even for me—let alone for one who, like St. Maximilian, loved unto death—fifteen minutes is simply not enough time. (p 122)My ImpressionsSadly, many Catholics do not believe in the true presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Consecrated Bread and Wine of the Eucharistic. Even though there is strong evidence from the Bible that Christ said: ""This is my body; this is my blood"". As I heard one learned priest say: ""Who are you going to believe? Jesus or someone else?""If reading this book does anything to help Catholics change their perspective, I hope it at least helps generate a stronger reverence and desire for the receipt of Holy Communion.The quote of the book that really affected me:""I have a friend whose wife, when they dated, was not Catholic. She eventually became Catholic, but first, when they were courting and he explained to her our belief in the Real Presence in the Blessed Sacrament, she laughed at him and accused him of lying. When he protested that he was telling the truth, she had a convincing (or convicting, to him) objection: If, she said, you really believed this, you would be crawling on your knees to receive Him! You’d at least be going every day to receive Him. There’s no way, then, given your apparent indifference, that this is true.""Touche!!5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 12, 2023","Jul 09, 2023","Apr 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53062842-something-new-with-st-th-r-se

It was that good and that well written and that so full of hope and thoughtful messages about life.Remy Blake when we meet him is 5. His mother has died and his father, Roy, is his only living parent. IMHO, Roy has at least three things wrong with him: a heart condition that he is aware of but does not care for (he smokes); a negative attitude about the world: he is a survivalist and takes his son to the wilds of southern Canada, away from people and comfort; AND he doesn't know how to be a father, he thinks he needs to be Remy's friend.Contrast to that all of the people he meets after he 'wends his way into' the peopled world. Anne-who has fostered two other children and pursues Remy until he is found. She KNOWS no one else will take him in (he is considered to be inhuman and wild) so commits herself to taking care of him.Chris - her husband, who completely warms up to the boy.Janie and Peter-the two other children now adopted by Anne and Chris. They help acclimate Remy to the real world.Catherine Ryan Hyde - you have really hit it out of the park with this book. I have a few friends who really appreciate books with hopeful messages and I plan to let them know about this very worthy example.5 starsATY Prompt Completed: 15.

HA book that was short-listed for the Booker Prize in 2022 and I can see why.Bill Furlong is a coal and timber merchant and the father of five girls. His mother bore him out of wedlock; he does not know who his father is. He AND his mother were both lucky; when she became pregnant, her mother's employer, Mrs. Wilson, took mother and child under her wing. Bill and his mother could not be luckier. Now that Bill is an adult, he wonders who his father is. There is no one left to tell him what he needs to know.Another facet of this story is Bill's customer: the convent on the hill. ""The Good Shepherd nuns, in charge of the convent, ran a training school there for girls, providing them with a basic education. They also ran a laundry business. Little was known about the training school, but the laundry had a good reputation: restaurants and guesthouses, the nursing home and the hospital and all the priests and well-off households sent their washing there. Reports were that everything that was sent in, whether it be a raft of bedlinen or just a dozen handkerchiefs, came back same as new.""Little did I know until I read the Author's Note that this 'laundry business' was an infamous reality. I had heard of the Magdalene Laundries and this was one of them. I have had a book on my TBR since 2018:Whispering Hope: The True Story of the Magdalene WomenI think it is ripe to be read right now!!I thought the writing was excellent and the story mesmerizing. My one complaint: at 70 pages in length, it left too many loose ends.And why titled Small Things Like These?Small Things Like These is a quiet, haunting, atmospheric tale that dwells on how kindness can make a difference in people's lives and how having a purpose can instill a sense of meaning or fulfillment.4 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 03, 2024","Jan 07, 2024","Mar 04, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59016923-small-things-like-these

The book is subtitled A Nicaraguan Journey and relates his travel experiences, the people he met as well as views on the political situation then facing the country. The book was written during a break the author took from writing his controversial novel, The Satanic Verses.After a period of political and economic turmoil under dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (commonly known by the initial FSLN or as the Sandinistas) came to power in Nicaragua in 1979 supported by much of the populace and elements of the Catholic church. The government was initially backed by the U.S. under President Jimmy Carter, but the support evaporated under the presidency of Ronald Reagan in light of evidence that the Sandinistas were providing help to the FMLN rebels in El Salvador.Rushdie's three-week trip to Nicaragua in the summer of 1986 was at the invitation of Sandinista Association of Cultural Workers which was billed as, ""the umbrella organisation that brought writers, artists, musicians, craftspeople, dancers and so on, together under the same roof"". I appreciated both Rushdie's candid appraisal of the situation as well as his trips to both the Pacific and the Caribbean Coast.4 starsSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jag.... ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 09, 2023","May 21, 2023","Mar 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11163751-the-jaguar-smile

Those without hope are content to wish. Proximate hopes are connected to our everyday desires and dreams. Ultimate hope is a theological virtue and is directly connected to the meaning of our life. I’ve gone to church my whole life, and it never occurred to me to wonder how much my parish could accomplish if we helped pick up the crosses of those in need right in front of us. The name Nadia is Polish for “hope.” Hope is the theological virtue that enables us to keep our eyes on heaven—even during those times when our sufferings and trials make our lives here on earth seem like a living hell. If God can make a saint out of an ordinary man like Padre Pio, he can do the same thing with you and me. Final thought:I am in my twilight years having every earthly thing I want. As a Catholic, I am bolstered by the thoughts of this book. My hopes are for spiritual outcomes, not earthly ones.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 24, 2023","Mar 12, 2023","Feb 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36426071-beautiful-hope

Her assignment is to profile Meena, a Hindu villager whose Muslim husband was burned to death in an ""honor killing"" by Meena's brothers. Meena, left disfigured in the attack, has brought charges; a verdict pends. Umrigar's strength is her great storytelling. As always, not a word is wasted as she moves us through urban Mumbai and into Meena's rural village, and into complex encounters and confrontations that Smita views with double vision as an Indian American. Her investigation stirs up painful memories of her youth in Mumbai, during the years when rising Hindu nationalism reawakened the violence of partition, now a fact of life in India. At the center of the story is Smita's developing bond with Meena and with Mohan, the friend of her friend, who is acting as her guide, driver and protector in a village where women are not supposed to work, let alone as journalists (Janice P).A VERY thought provoking book. It will be hard to  this story in a positive way about India and Hinduism, but I will try.I read this book with my book club and the conversation was lively and thoughtful. Everyone LOVED the book. We talked about honor. Contrasts occurred betwen honor exhibited between Smita's father and ""honor"" exhibited by the eldest brother of Meena. DIFFERENT kinds of honor.My favorite character was Abdul, the dead Muslim husband of Meena. He was so optimistic about building a ""new Hindustan"", the name Indians call India!! Alas, it was not to be.Our hostess had lived with her husband in India for many years and they still keep their fingers on the pulse of progress. They both agree that the rural areas are digressing while the urban areas are becoming more accepted of the religious differences between Muslim and Hindu.From Wikipedia:There have been several instances of religious violence against Muslims since the partition of India in 1947, frequently in the form of violent attacks on Muslims by Hindu nationalist mobs that form a pattern of sporadic sectarian violence between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950 in 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982. The latest violence documented on Wikipedia:he 2020 Delhi riots, or North East Delhi riots, were multiple waves of bloodshed, property destruction, and rioting in North East Delhi, beginning on 23 February 2020 and caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims. Of the 53 people killed, two-thirds were Muslims who were shot, slashed with repeated blows, or set on fire. The dead also included a policeman, an intelligence officer and over a dozen Hindus, who were shot or assaulted. More than a week after the violence had ended, hundreds of wounded were languishing in inadequately staffed medical facilities and corpses were being found in open drains. By mid-March many Muslims had remained missing.My hope is that this is the last time this happens. We need to show religious tolerance as a world, not religious hate.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 27, 2023","May 07, 2023","Feb 10, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58311385-honor

Grappling with a family crisis and the pending failure of her beloved family restaurant, the Lakeside Supper Club, she yearns for a break. To top it all off, her mother, Florence, has never gotten over the fact that Mariel’s grandmother left the business to her, not to Florence, sparking further familial tension. Ned, Mariel’s husband, proposes a solution using an inheritance of his own, but, following a shattering tragedy, their familial victories and dreams hang by a thread. J.

My first book written by him was The Road, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. It was the beginning of my re-introduction to reading at an accelerated level.This book is the first McCarthy has published since the publication The Road. That was 16 years ago. I have read that this book was started in the 1970's and McCarthy worked on it off and on until it was finally published in 2022. McCarthy is 98 years old, so this, along with its companion book Stella Maris, will probably be the last offering from McCarthy.Sad to say, I wish he hadn't bothered.The book starts out engaging enough. Bobby Western is a salvage diver. He and his fellow diver, Oiler, are commissioned to search through a downed plane. It has been under water for at least three days. They find 7 dead passengers still strapped into their seats. There were 8 on the manifest. The reader immediately thinks this is to be a story about finding that 8th passenger. No it is not.The salient points of this book are:Looks like the plane accident is being covered up: the same day Western did the dive, his apartment was broken into and things were missing.Western's grandmother left him a large inheritance. The IRS freezes his bank accounts because he did not properly report the inheritance.Western spends time in bars and restaurants in New Orleans with old friends discussing truths philosophical and scientific. Lots of time conversing. McCarthy does not use quote marks nor is the reader sure who is saying what at any given point. Easy to get lost.The s I read managed to say negative things about the book in a positive way.

The painting, which depicts a familiar-looking young woman in a field under a violet sky, stirs a desire in Emily to reconnect with her long-estranged father in an effort to find the grandfather she never knew. Emily and her father travel from Florida to Germany to Georgia and back again, and along the way uncover a family history both beautiful and tragic. In the end, Emily learns about the healing power of art, forgiveness, and love.Historical Event of Note:“I was floored to learn that nearly four hundred thousand Germans had been imprisoned in the United States during the 1940s, but that newspaper coverage of the POW camps was limited, so many Americans didn’t even know about them. Most of the prisoners had been captured in battle or on German U-boats and had been brought to the States to work”.My ImpressionsI love Kristin Harmel and her writing. This is my second 5 star book by this author. I was so invested in the story and could not turn the pages fast enough to see how the various 'mysteries' were going to play out.""An appealing family saga that connects generations and reaffirms love.""5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 06, 2023","Jun 17, 2023","Dec 02, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29434503-when-we-meet-again

I could not put the book down.The book is about vice on the Mississippi Coast in the 60's, 70's, 80's. It is a classic example of good versus evil. Two young boys are fast friends as twelve year olds. But their friendship fractures as they grow up and go their separate ways. Keith Rudy is the son of Jesse Rudy, who became DA of Harrison County. Hugh Malco is the son of Lance Malco who owned clubs on the coast that trafficked in prostitution and gambling. The fathers were bitter enemies and their conflicts are what this story is about.Early on the book mentions the Dixie Mafia. The author's note states the following:""In the middle of the last century, there were a few gangs of outlaws who moved around the South causing trouble. They bought and sold anything that was illegal, and they had a nasty penchant for violence. It was never clear if their activities were related. Someone, probably in law enforcement, tagged them as the “Dixie Mafia,” and the legend was born. A few of these characters did indeed settle along the Gulf Coast around 1950, no doubt attracted by the casual attitude toward vice. Biloxi’s colorful history of its seafood industry and the immigrants who built it are accurately described. Everything else is pure fiction.""I would not have attempted this book except for the convincing  written by my friend Deacon Tom.

It is a mystery and full of compelling themes of caring and family.Summary from BookBrowse:Until recently, Dr. Julia Cates was one of the preeminent child psychiatrists in the country, but a scandal shattered her confidence, ruined her career, and made her a media target. When she gets a desperate call from her estranged sister, Ellie, a police chief in their small western Washington hometown, she jumps at the chance to escape.In Rain Valley, nothing much ever happens – until a girl emerges from the deep woods and walks into town. She is a victim unlike any Julia has ever seen: a child locked in a world of unimaginable fear and isolation.For Julia, who has come to doubt her own ability, nothing is more important than saving the girl she now calls Alice. Then a shocking revelation forces Julia to risk everything to discover the truth about Alice. The ordeal that follows will test the limits of Julia’s faith, forgiveness, and love, as she struggles to ascertain where Alice ultimately belongs.Media Reviews""Hannah's melodramatic 15th novel tells the addictive soap opera story of a feral child and the adults who rally to help her."" - PW.""One of this perennially best-selling writer's most compelling and riveting novels to date."" - Booklist.I found the book a tender read.Strongly recommend.4.25 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 10, 2023","Sep 19, 2023","Nov 24, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43801615-magic-hour

When the Japanese invade the Phillipines after Pearl Harbor, the nurses are separated and become the first female prisoners of war.I have not read much about the war in the Phillipines, so what I read was new to me. The Japanese were very cruel to their captives. They starved the prisoners because they did not want to spend money on food. Worse still, they let Red Cross Care packages rot as a means of punishing the prisoners. Sadly, some of these prisoners were merchants from the US passing through Manila; they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.The book is about cruelty during war but also about the friendships between U.S. Navy nurse Eleanor Lindstrom, U.S. Army nurse Penny Franklin, and Filipina nurse Lita Capel. Their care for each other and the travails they suffered touched me.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 21, 2022","Jan 06, 2023","Nov 09, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61160094-when-we-had-wings

His sister, Sarah, takes the blame. This one event negatively impacts both Theo and Sarah for the rest of their lives. Their father Ben is also negatively impacted as, being a doctor, runs out to help the passenger and moves her and shouldn't. Her neck is broken. The Shenkmans live across the street. Dr. Ben helps to deliver the Shenkman baby on the kitchen floor of the Shenkman's house. The Shenkmans name him Waldo. Waldo turns out to be an exceptionally intelligent young man. His father cannot handle him being exceptional though. There are some very interesting story elements in this book.

His unlikely friendship with Chris Maxey, whom he met at Yale during his senior year, has lasted 40 years. Will, the Nerd; Maxey, the Jock. Will, the Introvert; Maxey, the Extrovert.

I hadn’t, although I knew of Stalin’s collectivisation. In Ukraine, an estimated 3.9 million people perished. In the words of a character in this novel: “Everyone wants Ukraine’s fertile soil for their own, and nobody wants to let Ukrainians rule it.” Any book about that country needs to be read, to widen our understanding of what its people have suffered.In 1929, 16-year-old Katya and her elder sister live with their parents and farm their land, their life bound by seasons and celebrations in a close-knit community. When Stalin’s men come to collectivise the land and impose terror, the graphic horror presents Katya with impossible choices.Alternating chapters take place in the United States in 2004. Cassie, mourning her husband killed in a car accident which rendered their five-year-old daughter mute the previous year, is persuaded to move in with her ailing grandmother. The grandmother, a Ukrainian known as Bobby—a corruption of babusya, grandma—has never talked about her past. She produces a journal written in Ukrainian, which she wants Cassie to read. A young neighbour, Nick, of Ukrainian descent, translates it.*** I enjoyed the book. The characters described are so real. There is a sequel too that I plan to read: The Lost Daughters of Ukraine.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 12, 2023","Jun 07, 2023","Oct 15, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60581739-the-memory-keeper-of-kyiv

Both awesome. It reminds me of my life in 1967. I was still in college and dating a guy who graduated from college in 1967. He decided to teach in the inner city of Chicago rather than be drafted. It is his experience that forms my memory of my feelings about the war. The book and movie are a walk down memory lane.

The inspiration for the story comes from Dom From wikipedia:The book was written nearly nine years after Benson's reception into the Catholic Church. The inspiration for the story comes from Dom Bede Camm's account of the recusant Fitzherbert family in Forgotten Shrines (1910), and from Benson's own visit in 1911 to Padley, home of the Fitzherberts, and scene of part of the novel, to preach at the annual pilgrimage there. The title of the book is taken from a letter of Saint Edmund Campion in which, after torture, he assured Catholics that he had revealed ""no things of secret, nor would he, come rack, come rope."" Most of the characters in the book are historical people; only the hero and heroine, their parents, and some minor characters are fictional.It is perhaps the best known of Benson's novels, and has been reprinted several times.For a Catholic, it is a must read. It so eloquently describes the effects of the Protestant Reformation.Its characters evoke sympathy for some, mistrust for others. One of its strongest characters (to me) is a woman: Marjorie. Robin is a complex and sympathetic character as well.4 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 13, 2022","Oct 04, 2022","Aug 13, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34093228-come-rack-come-rope

We are treated to scenery descriptions of Wyoming and Montana. We also find out that Celine, who is no spring chicken, suffers from emphysema.

This plus my goal to read as many world books as possible spurred me to read this book NOW.I knew nothing of the events of 2013 in the Ukraine. My eyes have been opened.Also, I knew nothing of FEMEN. Once again, eyes are opened.In this , I not only intend to describe what was happening in 2013, but also offer some thoughts on how those events relate to current events.In November 2013, thousands of Ukrainian citizens gathered at Independence Square in Kyiv to protest then-President Yanukovych's failure to sign a referendum with the European Union, opting instead to forge a closer alliance with President Vladimir Putin and Russia. The peaceful protests turned violent when military police shot live ammunition into the crowd, killing over a hundred civilians.Kalani Pickhart chronicles all of this political intrigue, but chooses to place the focus firmly on her characters, ensuring the book never reads like a history lesson. Though they are embroiled in the turmoil caused by the riots, we also see the enduring nature of the characters' more personal hardships. Each of them is struggling with grief in some way: Misha is an engineer mourning the loss of his wife; Katya is a doctor treating the wounded while contemplating her own son's death; Aleksandr, a former KGB agent, is searching for his long-lost daughter; and Slava is a young activist estranged from her parents after a difficult childhood, now forced to hide her blossoming relationship with another woman due to rampant homophobia. While violence rages around them, each is simply fighting for the chance to be with those they love.FEMEN: Femen (stylized in all caps; Ukrainian: Фемен) is a radical feminist activist group whose goal is to protect women's rights. The organization became internationally known for organizing controversial, topless protests against sex tourism, religious institutions, sexism, homophobia, and other social, national, and international topics. Founded in Ukraine, the group is now based in France. Femen describes its ideology as being ""sextremism, atheism and feminism"".Today's Ukrainian war seems to have a sinister purpose to Putin. He once had the Ukraine under his thumb and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has cut off that thumb, hand and all.5 stars No 98 in Reading the World Quest.

I do not agree with all of her beliefs, but the author explains reasons for them with which I can empathize. What I liked the most:1.	Elizabeth’s complex personality: it WAS explained•	Her father’s career as a “God salesman” ensures her atheism and her extremely rational and logical outlook towards life.•	Being left to fend for herself from a young age, including educating herself using books from the local library, contributes to her independence.•	Bold enough to stand up for herself again and again, from her encounter with Meyers, to Donatti’s unjust treatment, and even Lebensmal’s attempted assault.•	Sees the futility of fighting men as did Avery2.

Actual chemistry. And it was no accident.•	Chemistry in cooking•	When women understand chemistry, they begin to understand how things work.•	Despite what Elizabeth Zott will tell you, Supper at Six is not just an introduction to chemistry, he wrote that day on the plane. It’s a thirty-minute, five-day-a-week lesson in life. And not in who we are or what we’re made of, but rather, who we’re capable of becoming.•	Use the laws of chemistry and change the status quo.5 Glorious StarsPlease read!!

In July, 2022, our book club selected The Lost Family: How DNA Testing Is Uncovering Secrets, Reuniting Relatives, and Upending Who We Are to read and discuss. One of our members accidentally read this book instead. Serendipitous. She said she liked the book. I had to pick it up and read it right away.The story takes the reader through three decades - 1965, 1975, 1985 - each told from the perspective of one of the three main characters:Peter - a survivor of Auschwitz who is a famous chef in NYCJune - a glamorous model who works for The Ford AgencyElsbeth - their daughterThe story is both engaging and tragic. Peter is haunted by his failure to save his first wife and daughters in Nazi Germany. June gives up her career as a model to marry Peter, but then begins to question her staid homemaker/mother life. Elsbeth, though pampered, throws herself into the drug-fueled, punk populated art world of the 1980's.All three of these characters frustrated me. But their travails are real and cannot be ignored.Good book for book club discussion. Maybe we should read and discuss this Lost Family too. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 12, 2022","Jul 24, 2022","Jul 05, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36408225-the-lost-family

The book is a work of literary fiction and falls into a rare sub-genre: the literary gaming novel. Spanning 30 years, the book follows two brilliant friends—in love, but never lovers—for whom designing video games is a celebration of romance, art, and immortality. Together, Sam, Sadie, and their creative partner, Marx, navigate loss, jealousy, joy, fame, and finally, inconceivable tragedy, to come into their own. A unique book that immerses readers into the world of video games and storytelling, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow has been hailed by critics, with author John Green calling it “one of the best books I’ve ever read.” The quote that clarifies the title:“What is a game?” Marx said. “It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption.""And even if you die, you can start all over again.This book is awesomely good.

I am a Catholic and gravitate toward novels that feature Catholic Religious.Sister Jude is the main character. She takes a leave of absence from the convent to set up and run a Food Bank called Loaves and Fishes. In the secular world she is known as Rita. I especially appreciate the 'humaness' of Rita. She is both spiritual and 'practical'. Her life is complicated by the plight of her long-standing friend Connie, who comes to her with two children and pregnant, fleeing from her abusive husband.The plot is REAL and beautifully written. I found everything both plausible and compelling. I love all the Catholic allusions.What I am worried about is the picture it might paint of Catholic beliefs and rules. It is the 1960's and the book portrays that divorce is a SERIOUS sin. I only know that now in the 2020's, divorce is not considered a sin at all, if there are extenuating circumstances. Potential readers might not understand that and it bothers me. If the author had just not alluded to divorce being a mortal sin, the book would have been five stars.Strongly recommend to Catholics and all who want to expand their view of Catholic culture.BTW, my copy included Discussion Questions which are unique in their thoughtfulness and approach.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 17, 2022","Jul 06, 2022","Jun 16, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60893930-visible-signs

From supersummary.comThe novel follows the lives of two dramatically different magical beings dropped onto the streets of New York City in 1899.The first is a golem, which is a ready-to-order woman made solely to be a wife. Made of clay, she is not truly human; she lacks free will, all of her actions decided by her master. Yehudah Schaalman created her for Otto Rotfeld, a terribly sad man desperate for affection.The jinni’s most recent memory is from a thousand years ago, but a tinsmith, Arbeely, offers him a job because he is so impressed with the jinni’s skill in crafting tin.Ironically, the jinni feels claustrophobic and trapped in the tin shop, since he can’t safely walk in the rainy streets of New York, and he has no memory or identity. He has to lie about his background to the neighbors who swing by the shop. To them, he is “Ahmad,” a young man who recently moved to America from Egypt.Many other characters make this book a must-read. I have never read a book like this one before and I highly recommend it.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 17, 2023","Dec 20, 2023","Jun 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15819028-the-golem-and-the-jinni

Vincent King returns from prison, where he served 30 years for killing his girlfriend's younger sister when he was just 15 in a hit-and-run accident. His return to the small California coastal town of Cape Haven triggers events that lead to multiple murders and a complicated story.Main CharactersVincent King, of course!! Sherriff ""Walk"" Walker - Vincent's best friendStar Radley - Older sister of Sissy, the girl who Vincent accidentally hit; she is Vincent's girlfriend; is fighting addictionsDuchess Day Radley - daughter of Star; she calls herself an 'outlaw'; she is badass; she loves her brother and takes care of him; takes care of Star tooRobin Radley - Duchess younger brotherHal Radley - their grandfather, Star and Missy's father; lives in MontanaDickie Dark - the villainThe strongest character is Duchess. Just 13 years old, in many ways she is an adult.The main theme of the book centers on the dynamics of grief - the novel’s emotional core is the hit-and-run death of little Sissy Radley over 30 years in the past. The struggle to handle that death is common to all of the novel’s principal characters. It is an accident—no one really is to blame, yet everyone feels guilty.Another theme is the caring of characters for each other. ""Walk"" has always cared about Vincent and goes out on a limb for him. Duchess cares for her mother and brother, enough to let them go.There are also many secrets kept by the characters. Finding out what they are might surprise you.No character in this book is flawless; even the villain has at least one trait that is admirable. Complex characters and great writing.I found it hard to understand the book at first, but glad that I stuck with it.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 19, 2024","Mar 06, 2024","Jun 09, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54280574-we-begin-at-the-end

Her father, Javier Soto agrees to be her coach.The novel opens in 1994 at the US Open. Carolina “Carrie” Soto sits with her father Javier watching tennis players Nicki Chan and Ingrid Cortez face off in the final of the tournament. If Nicki wins, she will have tied Carrie’s record of 20 Grand Slam titles, which Carrie first set before her retirement in 1989. When Nicki wins, Carrie decides to return to tennis with her father as her coach once again. The book takes us through her childhood and through the comeback preparation and 4 slams Carrie competes in. Carrie is extremely hard to like. She truly is a B---H and not a role model in the least bit. I stuck with the book to see if she could grow through her experiences. Many things happened that made this a worthy read.Other Characters:javier Soto- a truly remarkable father and coach.Bowe Huntley - Carrie’s love interest. At 40, he is still trying to show he can play tennis well. Gwen Davis - Carrie’s agent, and as the novel progresses, it becomes clear how much they care about one another as friends.

It borders on the ludicrous: so foolish, unreasonable, or out of place as to be amusing; ridiculous.It is also tragic. Largo, the town in Moldova in which the book takes place, is down on its luck, and its citizens look to Italy for its promise of a better life.From Publishers Weekly:From clergy members such as Father Pataii to politicians such as Voronin, to disillusioned citizens such as the Serafim and Vassily, an often wry narrator chronicles the villagers' cartoonish attempts to escape their impoverished fates. The result is a simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking tale, in which location becomes just as much a character as the people who populate it.I enjoyed the book and was more affected by the humor than the tragedy.It gave me a good picture of Moldovan culture at the time and that is what I appreciate the most.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 24, 2022","Sep 30, 2022","Jun 04, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22020936-the-good-life-elsewhere

I have always loved to read, but a time-consuming career kept me from pursuing any significant reading. Then I found Goodreads and reading good books became a #1 priority.Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is an historical novel by Jamie Ford. The story is told in two parallel storylines, one following 12-year-old Henry Lee's experiences during the Second World War, and the other depicting Henry 44 years later as a widower with a college-aged son. The plot centers around the forced evacuation of Japanese Americans to internment camps; the book depicts the pain and trauma of separation through the friendship of the Chinese-American Henry and his Japanese-American friend Keiko.I loved it.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,3,12,1,"Jul 13, 2014","Jul 27, 2014","May 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3367956-hotel-on-the-corner-of-bitter-and-sweet

If not, I highly recommend you start with this one.Let me quote the author first.""I am not sure whether writers choose their subjects or whether their subjects somehow come to find them. For me, at least, it felt like the latter with The Architect’s Apprentice. The idea for this novel emerged for the first time on one sunny afternoon in Istanbul. My eyes moved across the road to a mosque by the seaside. It was Molla Celebi, one of Sinan’s lesser-known beauties. A Gypsy boy was sitting on the wall next to it, pounding on a tin box that was turned upside down. I might as well begin to imagine a story with the architect Sinan and Gypsies in it."" - and did!!The hero of this story is one of the Architect's four apprentices: Janan. Janan helps birth a white baby elephant. It is gifted by the Shah of Iran to the Sultan of Turkey. Janan steals aboard the ship carrying the elephant to Turkey. He becomes the elephant's 'mahout' (elephant tamer) and also the Architect's apprentice.It is a story rich with descriptions of the Architect, his Apprentice, and the Elephant, Chota. (Yes, the elephant is one of the main characters). Many twists and turns later, the book ends with a surprise. (So I DO challenge you to read this book and see if you are surprised).I could not be more in love with a book that is this clever and also describes a real Ottoman architect.My husband has questioned why I read historical fiction and I am now challenged to read two other (non-fiction) books: The Age of Sinan: Architectural Culture in the Ottoman Empire and The Elephant's Journey5 stars...more",Notes are private!,2,5,1,"Jan 31, 2024","Feb 10, 2024","May 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22571629-the-architect-s-apprentice

Preceded by Beartown and Us Against You, the novel focuses The Winners by Fredrik Backman is the third and final installment of the Beartown trilogy. Preceded by Beartown and Us Against You, the novel focuses on the intertwining lives of an ensemble of characters who live in the Swedish towns of Beartown and Hed. Following a colossal storm, tensions rise as resources dwindle and must be shared. The characters grapple with past traumas that will shape their futures, and the novel ends with a shocking act of violence.The Characters... - Look how many!! (This list obtained from https://beartown.fandom.com/wiki/The_...)Maya Andersson - The daughter of Kira and Peter who becomes a global singer.Benjamin Ovich - Former ice hockey player and the hero of the second book.Ana - Best friend of Maya.Peter Andersson - Former general manager of the Beartown Ice Hockey team.Kira Andersson - Lawyer; the mother of Maya and Leo.Leo Andersson - Younger brother of Maya.Amat - Hockey player on the A-team who eventually goes on to play pro.Ramona - Longtime owner of the Bearskin pub who dies.Tails - Owner of Beartown's grocery store who attempts to cover up the illegal practices of the hockey club's finances.Teemu Rinnius - Leader of The Pack, a group known for violence.Vidar Rinnius (mentioned) - The younger brother of Teemu who died.Richard Theo - A politician who looks out for his own best interests.Lev - A shady man who works in a grey area. He has nieces but lives alone.Bengt - a firefighter injured during the storm.Sune - An old man who had a pet dog he thought of naming ""Bang"". He would take care of Alicia.Alicia - A young girl who will go on to be a star hockey player.Adri Ovich - Older sister of Benji who runs the dog kennels and eventually owns the Bearskin pub.Katia Ovich - Older sister of Benji. Will own the pub with her sisters.Gaby Ovich - Older sister of Benji with two children. Will own the pub with her sisters.Bobo - A hockey coach with a big heart. Falls in love with Tess.Hannah - A midwife who is impressed with Ana, who helps deliver a child through the storm.Johnny - A firefighter who tries to be the hero.Tess - The daughter of Hannah and Johnny, who falls in love with Bobo.Tobias - The son of Hannah and Johnny; 15-years-old.Ted - The son of Hannah and Johnny; 13-years-old.Ture - The son of Hannah and Johnny; 7-years-old.Matteo - Raised in a devout Christian household, holds resentment for hockey players and seeks revenge on those who hurt his older sister.Ruth - The older sister of Matteo who was raped by Rodri. She leaves town though dies from drug overdose. Her death is not remembered by the town; only to her family and Mumble.Elizabeth Zackell - A successful hockey coach who can seem emotionless.Aleksandr - A newly recruited hockey player who is unpredictable on the ice.Rodri - A misogynistic, violent young male who rapes Ruth.Mumble - A talented goalie who feels guilt over doing nothing to help Ruth. Former friend of Rodri.Kevin Erdahl - The former hockey player that rapes Maya in Book 1 and moves away.My favorite character is Benji. You see a whole new side of him in this book. He is a hero and you gotta love him.ThemesThe Effects Of TraumaThe Winners presents characters who have undergone personal traumas, and it explores how traumatic events—even when they seem far in the past—can create present distress that unfolds in often unpredictable ways.The Power Of Rumor And GossipRumor is defined as a circulating story that is of uncertain or doubtful truth, while gossip is defined as conversations about other people that involve unconfirmed details. Both rumor and gossip play a significant role in The Winners, helping perpetuate exclusionary ideologies and inspiring violence between Hed and Beartown. Everything And Everyone Is ConnectedIn the novel’s closing chapter, the narrator says that Alicia will one day become the best hockey player Beartown has ever seen, stating that every story that has been told in fact leads to the beginning of Alicia’s story. The last sentence of the novel is thus devoted to highlighting how every life is interconnected: Although the reader has been following the stories of Maya and Benji, it is from their stories that Alicia’s own will emerge. This closes the novel with the idea expressed in the beginning that everything and everyone is connected. The book is full of violence and negative images. Yet I liked it because of the strong and image-producing character descriptions. This book is SOOOO character driven and I loved that aspect of it.5 starsBut...

Both a writer and an engineer, Manai explores the intersections of past and present, and tradition and technology, in his prose. In The Ardent Swarm (originally published as L’Amas ardent), his first book to be translated into English, he celebrates Tunisia’s rich oral culture, a tradition abounding in wry, often fatalistic humor.The main character of this story is Sidi. Everyone knew he would give his life for his 'girls'. He is a beekeeper and loves them as if they were human. One day a devasting attack occurs on one of his hives. There are smashed and dead bodies are everywhere (30,000 of them). Sidi must determine why and by whom this happened and vows to do something about it.Contrasted to Sidi are two other characters: Douda and Toumi. All three live in the town of Nawa, one that still seems to exist in the 18th century. There have been many rulers in Tunisia. The previous two were named: The Old One and the Handsome One. Neither has done anything to further the advancement of the people of Nawa. Enter the Party of God. With gifts of clothing and food, they convince the citizens of Nawa to vote for THEIR candidate. And tell them to vote for the candidate with the pigeon emblem (these people cannot read)In the meantime, Sidi is bound and determined to find the cause of his hive's massacre. Douda and Toumi assist (read the book, you will see how). I strongly recommend this book. Short but powerful.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,3,19,1,"Jan 22, 2024","Feb 07, 2024","Apr 20, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56449198-the-ardent-swarm

Hernan Diaz' second book.This novel is primarily about Andrew Bevel who shorted the market right before the Great Depression and came out a winner. Trust contains four distinct books in which different characters provide conflicting accounts of the financier and his wife.First we read in Book 1, Bonds, which is a fictional account of Andrew and his wife Mildred. In Bonds, the characters are named Benjamin and Helen Rask.In Book 2, we meet Bevel who is writing his own autobiography with the help of Ida Partenza. We do not meet Ida yet; that happens in Book 3.In Book 3, Ida does very well to get the job ghostwriting Andrew's autobiography. Andrew has 2 goals: 1) dispel the negative impression of him that Bonds has created2) paint a different picture of Mildred, his wife, than that portrayed in BondsBook 4 describes Ida's efforts to find Mildred's journals. She does and they describe Mildred as a much different person than the one described by Andrew.I found this book cumbersome to read, yet filled with lots of food for thought. The book is 406 pages long. It was only half way through that I finally got what the book is about: a person's story can frequently NOT be TRUSTED.Here is the one quote, spoken by Andrew Bevel in Book 3 that absolutely blew me away:""If I’m ever wrong, I must make use of all my means and resources to bend and align reality according to my mistake so that it ceases to be a mistake.”4 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 22, 2023",Aug 2023,"Apr 13, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59039413-trust

Six years later, Edwin will return from the Western Front a broken man, having survived a war that killed his brothers, his lover and all of his friends.In 2203, author Olive Llewellyn, a resident of the second moon colony, travels to Earth for a book tour in support of her novel, Marienbad. The book is about a fictional pandemic, and a real one breaks out in Australia while Olive is on Earth and quickly spreads throughout the world. Olive makes it home to her family safely, but she is haunted by what might have been, and what is for so many around her. The other authors she met on her book tour are dead.Meanwhile, in 2401, Gaspery-Jacques Roberts begins working at the Time Institute, investigating an anomaly that scientists believe may prove that what we think of as reality is actually a simulation. The truth lies in a small Canadian hamlet called Caiette, where an ethereal fragment of violin music rings through a grove of trees.*****Turns out Caiette is mentioned in the authors bo0k The Glass Hotel.

In our four days together, one day was spent in San Francisco enjoying a tour of SF on a tour bus. This experience is easily one of the best travel experiences of my life. Imagine when I found that this book takes place almost entirely in one of my favorite cities.San Francisco 1918 - we meet Dorothea Lange newly arrived from NJ/NY to start a new life as a photographer on her own. Her first experience, though, was devastating: a pickpocket took all of her money leaving her penniless. But luck was on her side. She meets Caroline Lee, beautiful and talented. They bond and Dorothea is eventually able to open her own portrait studio. Caroline is her assistant.There are many historical elements and people discussed in this book: the 1903 earthquake, the Spanish flu epidemic, the racism and exclusion of Chinese in local life, to name a few. Many famous female photographers are included as characters. Ansel Adams, he of Yosemite picture fame, is also a character. I found out that he was a piano player in San Francisco who contracted the Spanish flu. Upon recovery, he left the city and never returned.IN later years, during the depression, Lange left the studio to travel the countryside and take pictures of ""common folk"". Dorothea had polio as a child and a life-long limp resulted. The poor and destitute in the depression camps accepted her more readily because of this impediment. In 1936, she saw a sign Pea Pickers Wanted, found the camp, and took photographs of a woman and her children. The most iconic of these, Migrant Mother, she took that day. This photo is on the cover of another outstanding historical fiction novel, Mary Coin, which I have also read and loved.Upon reading The Bohemians, my understanding of Dorothea Lange is more complete. This book reveals more of her younger life. I DO love my historical fiction, with all it reveals and teaches me.""I always felt lucky to have landed in San Francisco. Despite everything that happened with Caroline and the complicated guilt I carried as a result of it, my life there had brought many gifts. I found friendship like I’d never known, I found love, I found my work and, finally, a life worth living.""5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 05, 2022","Sep 12, 2022","Mar 28, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54762711-the-bohemians

The Tale of Aypi is set in an isolated community of Turkmen fishermen on the coast of the Caspian Sea. With the threat of relocation to the city in order to make way for a lucrative asthma sanatorium looming, the inhabitants face sacrificing their traditions and customs at the dubious altar of progress. But not everyone is prepared to go quietly: loner Araz refuses to leave and flouts the new fishing ban to continue his trade, while, beneath the waters, the ghost of wronged woman Aypi, whose story has haunted the village for centuries, begins to stir and seek revenge.I was blessed to find the wonderful  on ""A Year of Reading the World"".

As he travels from Iowa to the Phillipines, he recalls his childhood in the dumps of Oaxaca, Mexico. His mother is a prostitute and he and his sister, Lupe, are brought up in an orphanage run by Jesuits. When their mother dies, they run away to the circus.The story flows between present and past. We meet many people along the way: Miriam and Dorothy in the Phillipines; Edward Bonshaw (an aspiring priest) and Brother Pepe in Oaxaca.The cover of my edition pictures Our Lady of Guadalupe. Ironically, Dec 12, the day I finished this book is the day Catholics remember her. Juan Diego is named after the peasant who first saw the Lady of Guadalupe, and Lupe’s name recalls that same vision.There are many good things about the message of this book.

Further, it shows the love she has for her half-sisters Katie and Courtney, her birth father Richard Gregson, and her stepfather Robert Wagner.Most people know that the family endured tragedy and its aftermath that occurred on Nov 29, 1981, when Natalie Wood drowned near Catalina Island. The ironic thing is that Natasha had always feared that something would happen to Natalie, and this time she was right.Natasha also provides a compelling argument that there was no foul play involved when Natalie died. In a love story such as Natasha provides, this is more than expected.I learned much about this extended family through reading this memoir. While some people have felt Natalie controlling, Natasha only sees her mother with the eyes of love.What did surprise me was the ugly description of Natalie's sister, Lana.

What was it really about: the wild animal preserve? the ghosts in the cemetary? the father who was dieing from an unknown brain disease? the daughter who was trying to find her way after being admitted to but never attending medical school? the friend who was missing?Ironically, when asked what the book was about, the answer came easily: a man who is halucinating, seeing the ghost of a poet he admired, and seeing animals: cats in his classroom, rats in a restaurant, bunnies in his kitchen, tio name a few. Each section of the book is named after an animal and the stories are imaginative. Amidst all the goings-on, we hear the thoughts of the dead buried in the Everton cemetery.Once I got my mind around what was going on, I really enjoyed the book. Creative and thought provoking.

I am too slowly realizing that I don't like books about somewhat dysfunctional families. And what is the Garrett form of disfunctionality? Poor communicationNot everyone agrees with me though. The Washington post  says the following:""We meet the Garretts in 1959 when Robin finally takes his family on their first vacation, an outing long postponed by his reluctance to leave the store in anyone else’s hands. Convinced they can’t go far or afford much, Robin settles on a week at a rustic cabin near Deep Creek Lake. “Not actually on the waterfront,” Tyler adds, “because Robin said that was too pricey, but close enough; close enough.” Such deceptively casual asides have endeared Tyler to readers for more than half a century. In novel after novel, she catches the mingled strains of affection and exasperation that tie a family together, the love that persists somewhere between laughing and sighing.""And why the title French Braid? The Post helps us with that too.""Meanwhile, the siblings drift into their disparate personalities, adult exaggerations of their childhood anxieties and desires. If what ties these people together sometimes feels constraining, it’s also lovely — a French braid that leaves an indelible impression on the strands of their lives. “That’s how families work,” David realizes as an adult. “You think you’re free of them, but you’re never really free; the ripples are crimped in forever.”If you are an Anne Tyler fan, you will probably love this book. It is Tyler's 24th and The Post says it is ""immediately recognizable"".

But it turned out to be more. An excellent study in the personalities of the characters involved. Major themes of maturity and secrets vs lies were delved. I especially appreciated comparing the 18 year old Marian to the 18 year old Kirby; which was more mature?Toward the end, I found myself turning the pages faster and faster. I have read other books by Giffin and found them somewhat shallow.

She spent extensive time with her husband and colleague, Joseph, fighting the war on terror with skill and wit in the Middle East.

As the mystery deepens, the novel turns into a tense psychological study of a dysfunctional family, the calculating logic of emotional manipulation, the spiral of post-partum depression, and the corrupting power of greed.*******The Summary and My Impression:Anne and Marco Conti are raising their 6 month old daughter in a swank house bought for them by Anne's father. One night they are invited to a birthday party for their 40 year old neighbor, Graham Stillwell. They had hired a baby sitter, but she canceled at the last minute. Rather than cancel their plans with the Stillwells, they reluctantly agree to leave Cora at home and check on her every half hour. Then the unthinkable happens. After their midnight check, the baby has been kidnapped.The tale unwinds from there: the problems of both the Contis and the Stillwells and the inevitable revelation of how and why the baby is gone.Very inventive and surprising. 5 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 20, 2022","Oct 31, 2022","Feb 09, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29426188-the-couple-next-door

I have also read The Red Shoes: Margaret Atwood/Starting Out which I highly recommend.Since this is the third time I have read of Anne Frank, some of the facts have been more firmly established; other occurrences were completely new.Now more firmly established:_ Eight people and three families stayed for almost 22 months in a little cubby hole about Otto Frank's business establishment. After they were found, they were all sent to concentration camps and seven out of eight of them died. Otto Frank, Ann's father, was the only one to survive._ All of the employees that were in place the day the Franks, VanPels and dentist, Dr Fritz Pfeffer, KNEW that the annex dwellers were there.

I have read this book as well and thought it excellent.The Cold Case Team, its existence, and its findings constituted what I newly learned._They started with 30 betrayal suspects and weighed the possibiliy of each being the 'betrayer' against 3 criteria: knowledge, opportunity, and motive._They used AI technology to whittle down the list._They finally settled on one of these and made a good argument that he was the only one who fit all of the criteria._Otto Frank and Miep Gies also SEEMED to know who the betrayer was. If that is true, Otto exhibited no desire to disclose his identity.And finally:I have heard people say not to read the book; it is wrong and at least, misleading.

Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and René Mathis of the French Deuxième Bureau.

She takes great pride in her work, cleaning to perfection and making her beds with tight hospital corners. She is socially challenged, naive but well meaning. Her life is further complicated because her beloved Gran, her mentor, has died recently.Early in the book she finds the dead body of Mr. Black, a wealthy real estate tycoon, sending her life into disarray and revealing the messy, gritty activities going on at the the hotel. Turns out she has been used by many of the people she has come to trust, and must turn to others to help her resolve her dilemma.Molly frustrated me early on, as she seemed too simplistic and unsophisticated. Midway through the book, she seemed to abruptly become more discerning. I was taken aback at the sudden change, but also relieved that she might be able to get over the challenges facing her.In the final analysis, the book was OK. As in any mystery, I had to see it through to its conclusion.

In all fairness to the author, this style of characters conversing undoubtedly matches that of the historical era; it is just not a style I enjoy or appreciate.What I did like: the title of the book helped me to see examples of love vs sacrifice in the novel.Example 1: Mirielle must choose between Love (marrying the man she loves) and Sacrifice (marrying the man her father wants her to)Example 2: the priest must choose between Love of his duties or Sacrifice of them to folllow his heartThe main charactersMirielle, daughter of de MontastrucGeorgette, her companion, care-giverHugues de Romanet, her belovedMarquis de Montastruc, her fatherM.

The book pieces together the stories of several people Bruder follows over three years. It incorporates historical and social context for their decision to live out of vans or mobile homes. It was made into an academy award winning movie in 2020. Three of the people we meet in the book also were featured in the movie. Awesome book and awesome movie. I read one and watched the other. From the book:""After the New Deal, economists began referring to America’s retirement-finance model as a “three-legged stool.” This sturdy tripod was composed of Social Security, private pensions, and combined investments and savings. In recent years, of course, two of those legs have been kicked out.""To a man/woman, this phenomenon has struck the people described in this book. Some lost their homes because of company shutdowns; others lost retirement savings because of the 2008 Market Crash. Many people in their position would have lived with family if possible. But the folks described here yearned for independence and struck out on their own.This book is painstakingly researched and describes the culture of the nomad. Many travel from seasonal job to seasonal job. Three of the ones mentioned are US Forestry Camp Hosts, work in many of the Amazon warehouses through the WorkKamper program and (!) dealing in poker tournaments.I never knew this segment of society existed. I wavered between awe of their lifestyle and guilt because I do not suffer their particularly difficult life.Anybody who will listen is told by me: 'READ THIS BOOK; YOUR EYES WILL BE OPENED'.

Owen teases Hannah about her propensity to lose things.Awesome quote that sets the tone for the entire novel:“The week after Owen disappeared, I had a dream of him standing in that parking lot. He was wearing the same suit—the same charmed smile. In the dream he was taking off his wedding ring. Look, Hannah, he said. Now you’ve lost me too.” Highlights of the book without spoilers ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 19, 2022","Jul 25, 2022","Dec 13, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56169546-the-last-thing-he-told-me

There are good things about DNA Testing: Reuniting separated families, determining possible health risks, finding criminals. BUT.. there are issues as well-privacy compromised; surprises endured (you mean this man who brought me up is NOT my father?), and adoptee rejection.The book was too technical at times. I skimmed through those sections. But the thoughts evoked about privacy, unwelcome surprises, and adoption were well worth the read. Discussed at Book Club last night, the points presented were well-said and thought out. At least one person was not interested in discussing the book and opted out. Our fearless leader revealed that she had her DNA tested. Of the 7 in attendance, she was the only one. She knows she is an Ashkenazi Jew. Her revelations about her heritage made the book even more special to us.Not everyone will appreciate this book, but if you do, it will provide much opportunity for thought and discussion.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 29, 2022","Jul 05, 2022","Dec 11, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/49185598-the-lost-family

The nephew of the landlady writes the preface explaining how he came to know Steppenwolf and why he chose to publish the manuscript. The manuscript, or ""Harry Haller’s Records,"" consists of three sections: events that occur prior to the treatise; ""the Treatise on the Steppenwolf""; and events occurring after the treatise, namely meeting Hermine and visiting the Magic Theater.My ImpressionsI found the story quite a study in the human psyche. Harry was continuously fighting between his dual natures: that of wolf and that of man. Because of his dual natures, he must separate himself from society and is very lonely.He does meet and interact with Hermine, Maria and Pablo who help him to enjoy life as never before.There are three main 'events' in this story: meeting Hermine who teaches him to dance, attending the Masked Ball and visiting the Magic Theatre (very strange thins happen there).Glad I read it.4 stars  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 22, 2022","Oct 17, 2022","Dec 04, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17378652-steppenwolf

Fascinating and I have developed a new appreciation for Crane.I heard of this book while reading Hotel de Dream, a book describing Crane's life and last days.5 starsAnd yes, O'Ruddy falls in love!!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 04, 2022","Jan 19, 2022","Dec 02, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11343056-the-o-ruddy-a-romance

I learned this from his Goodreads biographical paragraph.""Dwight Longenecker was brought up an Evangelical, studied at the fundamentalist Bob Jones University, and later was ordained an Anglican priest in England. After ten years in the Anglican ministry as a curate, a chaplain at Cambridge, and a country parson, in 1995 Dwight was received into full communion with the Catholic Church.""The auhtenticity of the magi story has been a topic near and dear to his heart for a few years.From his Author note:""The idea for Mystery of the Magi first appeared when Dr. Matthew Bunson asked me to write an article about the origins of the wise men for Catholic Answers magazine. I was aware of the opinions of the academics that the Magi story was either a fantasy, or that the Magi (if they existed) were Zoroastrian priests from Parthia.I wondered, however, if there might be more than meets the eye, and I asked whether the Old Testament prophecies about the Magi might indicate their origin.""Here is what I learned.Father refers to the Magi story as related in the gospel of Matthew. It does not name the Magi; it does not say they rode camels; it merely says they came 'from the East'. Seems that over the years the Magi story was embellished to the point of craziness by many, but especially the Gnostics.So....Father answers the questions:Were there Magi? Father believes there IS historical data to support their existence.Where did they come from? Arabia, not PersiaWhat was the 'star'? A comet or a planet? Was Paul influenced by the Magi of Petra?My favorite chapter is Chapter 12 in which Father takes the simple story of the Magi in Matthew's Gospel and disects it line by line. If you read nothing else in this book, read that. I believe the chapter stands on its own.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 05, 2021","Jan 02, 2022","Dec 02, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36543951-mystery-of-the-magi

Early Zen masters recommended tea as the beverage most excellent for cultivating the spirit, and in the centuries that followed, an elaborate symbolism and a carefully contrived ritual encouraged the Zen disciple in his aim to achieve imperturbability.""The characters are many and diverse:Kikuji, the protagonistChikako Kurimoto, a former mistress of Kikuji's fatherMrs. Ota, a former mistress of Kikuji's fatherFumiko, Mrs. Ota's daughterYukiko Inamura, a pupil of Miss KurimotoI very much enjoyed reading this window into Japanese Culture.

This novel described as Tana French’s Irish Western features a retired policeman and a missing boy.The protagonist, Cal, is an American ex-cop who retires in the West of Ireland and spends ample time refurbishing his home before fate has other plans for him. French’s novel has a “western tinge” in being inspired by the American western trope of an outsider coming into a community and changing everything around them. Forty-eight-year-old Cal Hooper moves to the rural West of Ireland from Chicago to undertake early retirement and leave his past behind. Following his divorce, his estrangement from his daughter Alyssa and his disenchantment with his job as a police officer, Cal decides to seek out an existence of fishing, rabbit hunting and home refurbishment in the rural village of Ardnakelty. The close-knit community of locals treat him as a curiosity and attempt to include him by inviting him to the local pub or, in the case of the convenience store owner Noreen, attempting to set him up with her widowed sister Lena.At first, when Cal realizes that he is being watched, he tries to ignore the matter. However, his spy turns out to be the determined 13-year-old Trey Reddy. Despite Cal’s wish to conceal the knowledge, Trey is aware that Cal was a former cop, and he wants him to help find his brother Brendan, who disappeared six months earlier. He acquiesces and the plot continues as Cal interviews locals to determine Brendan Reddy's fate.The CharactersCal Hooper - 48 year old ex-cop from ChicagoTrey Reddy - 13 year old brother of the missing elder brother, Brendan Reddy Brendan Reddy - the reader does not 'meet' him, but the memory of him looms large in the communitySheila Reddy - their motherMart Lavin - Cal's neighbor who portrays himself as the bumbling busybodyMy ImpressionsSlow paced. We learn a lot about how Cal thinks when he shares his thoughts with us and shares them with Trey. The most impressive of these is Cal's idea of good and evil. He describes himself as 'having a code' and he sees Trey that way too.The voice of Roger Clark as audio narrator adds another dimension to Cal. Clark's voice is unique and assists in the listener/reader's ability to really visualize Cal.I am not usually a crime story reader, but the easy accessibility of the audio book so that I could listen as I drive, convinced me to try this novel. Glad that I did.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 22, 2022","Feb 25, 2022","Oct 31, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52699692-the-searcher

Amgash is a town in Illinois in which Lucy Barton grew up. I have read the previous two, but did not enjoy them near as much as this latest entry. I admit I was confused about what was going on or its relevance in the first two books. Not so here. I could follow most evey nuance and identified with many.I was especially touched by the loving relationship between two people who are divorced. Lucy left her philandering husband but remains in his life. They have two girls who are now adults and it seems those relationships have kept them bonded. I will be discussing this book at BookClub tomorrow. I fear that the members will not like the book.I hope I am wrong and will report more.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 28, 2022","Mar 06, 2022","Oct 29, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56570061-oh-william

We have such a name in Jax Diamond, and he owns a German Shepherd named Ace. I assume he is the Ace of Diamonds!!In this, the first book in the Jax Diamond Series, we are introduced to the former policeman, now a detective, and his trusty sidekick, Ace. Jax has been asked to tail Sam Sanders, a playwright. Sam is working on a new play inspired by the lead of the play currently showing at the Ambassador Theater. Sam dies. It seems like a heart attack, but Jax is convinced it is murder. Jax enlists the assistance of his former partner, Sergeant Tim Murphy. He also meets Laura Graystone, the star of the play currently showing. Her nickname is Songbird and the new play is named that as well.Suspects – at least twoThe widow of Sam SandersThe son of the owner of the Ambassador – Robert AshworthIt will probably be somebody else entirely.I especially fell in love with Laura Greystone – a VERY strong female character. She is a beautiful rising Broadway star. She ends up being very ingenious and possesses talents that get her AND Jax out of dangerous jams. Of course, Jax falls in love with her too.5 starsThank you Gail Meath. I plan to read all of this series.

It is non-fiction history and describes the voyage of William Barents and his crew to find a Northwest passage to China. He made three voyages, always turned back because of ice and bitter cold. In the third voyage, he and his crew had to over-winter in the Arctic.Beset by scurvy and polar bears, they almost did not make it.My library website provided this summary:The human story has always been one of perseverance-often against remarkable odds. The most astonishing survival tale of all might be that of 16th-century Dutch explorer William Barents and his crew of sixteen, who ventured farther north than any Europeans before and, on their third polar exploration, lost their ship off the frozen coast of Nova Zembla to unforgiving ice. The men would spend the next year fighting off ravenous polar bears, gnawing hunger, and endless winter.Listen to and read this book.

Hick is a journalist who interviews FDR during his first presidential campain. She meets Eleanor and they fall in love. FDR is described as knowing about the relationship and allows it to exist. Just as Eleanor knows about FDR's liaisons and looks the other way. The story is narrated by Hick. Hick is a strong character and I loved reading her thoughts, at least at first. She describes the event that helped her to realize she was a lesbian. Poignant account. But she shows a lot of anger and resentment too and this became hard to read. She painted FDR in ugly colors and I did not appreciate this picture. But I LOVE Amy Bloom and have thoroughly enjoyed all the other books I have read by her.

I liked the first book better.This story, is based on a real life person, Cathy Williams, who successfully enlisted as a Buffalo Soldier right after the Civil War. How she passed the physical and maintained her secret identity is the stuff of this book.I listened to the audio as I read this book. The narrator is Bahni Turpin, who has narrated quite a few books. I recently read and listened to three of the four Freedman/Johnson series written by Laila Ibrahim. Bahni narrated all of these. The first in the series is Yellow Crocus.I want to share with you the blurb from Audible about this book which describes the story succinctly:""From Sarah Bird comes the compelling, hidden story of Cathy Williams, a former slave and the first woman to ever serve in the US Army “Here's the first thing you need to know about Miss Cathy Williams: I am the daughter of a daughter of a queen and my Mama never let me forget it."" Missouri, 1864 - Powerful, epic, and compelling, Daughter of a Daughter of a Queen shines light on a nearly forgotten figure in history. Cathy Williams was born and lived a slave - until the Union army comes and destroys the only world she’s known. Separated from her family, she makes the impossible decision - to fight in the army disguised as a man with the Buffalo Soldiers. With courage and wit, Cathy must not only fight for her survival and freedom in the ultimate man’s world, but never give up on her mission to find her family, and the man she loves. Beautiful, strong, and impactful, Cathy’s story is one that illustrates the force of hidden history come to light, the strength of women, and the power of love.""4 starsATY Prompt: 2.

And LEARN!!The event covered in this book is the explosion of the SB Pulaski on June 14, 1838. It was taking 37 crew and 150-160 passengers from Savannah to Baltimore Maryland. 58 of that number survived. Only four life boats, two of which were so dried out from the sun that they were useless. The other two carried 21 of the survivors to shore. The rest of the survivors clung to large pieces of the wreckage until they were rescued, some being in the water up to four days. Callahan expertly weaves this story with a present day narrative: Everly Winthrop is asked to curate an exhibit of recovered articles from the disaster.I purchased the audible to listen along while reading and it was an excellent addition. My only problem was keeping track of the myriad passengers on board and their relations to each other.Highly recommend.4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 19, 2022","Apr 06, 2022","Sep 08, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54306882-surviving-savannah

The country modelled bears distinct resemblance to the north-eastern region of Armenia, where the author grew up, although these geographical names are fictional.The three apples of the old Armenian legend, which the title invokes, have been dropped “to earth from the sky: one apple for the one who saw, another for the one who told the story, and a third for the one who listened and believed in what is good.I thought it interesting how specific family surnames were determined!Sevoyants: Anatolia was the only one of Kapiton Sevoyants’s daughters who took after her swarthy grandfather. It was he who had given their family the name Sevoyants: sev, after all, means “black” in Maran.Review in Process: More to come.ATY Prompt: 36.

Belize is a society moving from colonialism to independence.From WikipedCountry No 102 on my World Reading Journey.Country: BelizeTime Frame: 1950's. Belize is a society moving from colonialism to independence.From Wikipedia:Beka Lamb is the debut novel from Belizean writer Zee Edgell, published in 1982 as part of the Heinemann Caribbean Writers Series. It won the Fawcett Society Book Prize in 1982 and was one of the first novels from Belize to gain international recognition. In 2022, it was included on the ""Big Jubilee Read"" list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.My impressions:This is the story of Beka's maturation in the politically unstable Belize of the 1950's. My first indication that I would like the book was the inclusion of the name MY name was derived from. Beka won an essay contest at St Cecilia's Academy. Beka thought she could never win. She cannot really celebrate, though. Her best friend Toycie Qualo has died and the traditional Belizean nine-day wake has yet to occur.From this point, the story is a 7 month flashback leading up to ultimately winning this essay contest and her friend’s death. Only by thinking back on everything can Beka move on.Well written and well thought of, the book is an excellent way to understand Belizean culture and politics. The story ends on a positive note, so I felt my time reading it well spent.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Oct 03, 2022","Dec 15, 2022","Aug 18, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/26497187-beka-lamb

A Jesuit priest arrives deep in the bush to question the colonial administrator there about events of the recent past.Set in French Equatorial Africa (now Chad), the book tells the story of Morel, a crusading environmentalist who sets out to preserve the elephants from extinction as a lasting symbol of freedom for all humanity. He is helped by Minna, a nightclub hostess, and Forsythe, a disgraced British military officer hoping to redeem himself. They reside or are near Fort Lamy. Idealist Morel sees his campaign to save the elephant saving ""the last remaining roots of Heaven.""I thought the book worthy, filled with interesting characters and a laudable story line. It was made into a movie.Interesting Trivia: Minna is described in the book as fair-haired. She is played in the movie by Juliette Greco of swarthy skin and black hair. Greco was, supposedly, the mistress of the producer, Daryll F. Zanuck. Despite the disparity in description, she was cast as the barmaid.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,0,not set,not set,"Aug 16, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/73135.The_Roots_of_Heaven

His answer is that neither the people on the plane nor his family are going to die.Author T.J. Newman worked as a flight attendant for Virgin America and Alaska Airlines between 2011 and 2021. Her years of experience with airplanes and the people on them — crew and passengers alike — give Falling authenticity. (Almost incredibly, she says she wrote much of the manuscript on redeyes while passengers slept.)A planeload of characters would be far too many to follow, of course. Fortunately, Newman tracks a relatively small group: the pilot and his family, the flight’s crew, a handful of passengers, the bad guys, and some key people on the ground. Brief flashbacks illustrate how characters became who they are, making them three-dimensional and sympathetic (and ultimately suggesting the book’s surprising conclusion). We see Bill in flight school, then as a husband and father. We meet the bad guys bonding as children watching an American movie in a faraway country. More than once, crew members cleverly resort to technological Jujitsu and turn weaknesses into strengths. A very old-school skill of Bill’s proves to be valuable precisely because it’s one that most people aren’t familiar with any longer.You might stop breathing during the harrowing final approach, but first-time author Newman lands the story thoughtfully and confidently.Most of this  comes from the following source:https://www.washingtonindependentrevi...Written by Randy Cepuch, he is a retired business writer and million-mile flier who, since writing this , has flown to and from LAX — uneventfully.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,3,24,1,"Nov 05, 2023","Nov 10, 2023","Jul 29, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56957424-falling

Maisie has to do some deep sleuthing in order to determine whodunit and why.There were many clues along the way, but I never picked up on them and was totally amazed when the murderer and the cause were revealed.Supporting the main story were three other subplots: Maisie's friend Priscilla's efforts as an ambulance driver; Maisie's quest to adop a war orphan, Anna; and Maisie's relationship with Mark Scott, a member of the American Embassy in London.There are 17 books in this series and I have now listened to the first 15.

This is differMost of you are probably familiar with Whitehead's Pulitzer Prize winning books: The Underground Railroad and The Underground Railroad. This is different in scope from those, but it too has a message. Set in Harlem during the late-1950s and early-1960s, the novel portrays African American life in New York City during a time of social upheaval. It is a crime novel, but has historical fiction elements as well.Our protaganist is Ray Carney. He is the son of a now-dead Harlem criminal. Ray wants respectability for his family. He owns a furniture store. As the book progresses, though, Ray becomes more involved in crime. From selling the occasional stolen TV, he becomes involved with former associates of his father, very dangerous people. His cousin Freddy is even more involved than Ray and Ray treads on dangerous ground because of trying to protect Freddy.The story is told in three parts and each part has its own antagonist. The scale of the antagonists escalates from street hoodlum and thief to influential community leader to one of the richest men in the city. At each step, the threat of violence posed by the antagonist increases in accordance with the adversary’s material resources. The more money a person possesses, the less they need to worry about legal ramifications.There are many messages in this story, but, to me, the prevalent theme is that of racism in mid-century America. Racism is so prevalent that even ambitious characters like Ray cannot see an end to it.This is my fourth book read that is written by Colson Whitehead. Harlem Shuffle does not fit the mode of story telling that I have associated with the author in the first three. This book is more crime than historical fiction. However I can tell that the message of this book is one near and dear to the author. It contains the author's skill in providing the prettily turned phrase and presents a well written narrative.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 20, 2022","Apr 02, 2022","Jul 28, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56339679-harlem-shuffle

We move to Pyongyang, currently the capital of North Korea. In that year, North and South Korea were not separated. A train ran between Pyongyang and Seoul. I love historical fiction because references within encourage me to do research and I learn much. This book is a prime example of one that makes me want to look deeper. The characters seem real and are well described.I loved what I learned and following the story ofJade-a courtesan in trainingSilver-her original teacherDani-her second teacher (Silver's first cousin)Luna-Silver's love childLotus-Luna's younger sisterNam JungHo-an orphan living in SeoulHanChol-a rickshaw driverNam's Father-saved the life of a Japanese CaptainThe story covers the years 1917-1964.

They live in the Nalibocka Forest. Jerusza spent much time teaching Yona how to survive in the forest. What to eat, how to fish and how to cover her tracks. Jerusza taught her three languages. She taught her how to kill a person quickly. But Jerusza grows old and dies. Yona is alone.All of these skills came to the fore when Yona stumbled upon 11 Jews trying to escape their tormentors, the Nazis.Much of this book relates how she teaches the Jews to survive in the forest and how she interacts with them.I have read many WWII books, but NONE like this. Yona is a stalwart and knowledgeable character. I know I WOULD survive if she was helping me.Kristin Harmel added a beautiful Author's Note to indicate her inspiration for the book and the real places she has described and the real people she has met.

The kindle version is 3.99 and so I 'splurged' and bought it. I am a big Kindle lover because of the interface between Amazon and Goodreads which allows Kindle highlights to be visible on Goodreads. I LOVE this feature, as I can share the highlights I liked with the Goodreads community. I see authors using the same feature for their own books, but that is another story!!The main character is introduced. Highlights from the book describe her: Daiyu was the only child of the immigrant Wu family. A mere four foot eight, she was a tiny thing—but assuming that was all she was would be a grave mistake. But she was both blind and female and had been allowed to live and thrive. Expectations and traditions practiced even in these modern times would have called for Dai's death when she was born—particularly since she was female and the family had no male heir. I fell in love with her immediately. She is a strong character and has talents much to be admired.A green dress has arrived at Dai's family laundry. It smells of arsenic which is used to die dresses green, but not in such excessive amounts. Dai, along with trusty chauffeur, Jacques, immediately begins to research recent deaths for a possible murder. I love Oliver's writing style. This book is 'cosy' and historical too. (view spoiler)[I have determined that the book is taking place sometime between 1930 and 1933. Oliver gives clues such as driving a 1930 Packard and the time frame is Prohibition era, which ended in 1933. So... the reader is challenged to not only follow the clues to the murderer but also follow the clues to the time frame.  (hide spoiler)]This is Oliver's first cosy mystery having written fantasy and sci-fi in the past. Ms. Oliver has made the transition beautifully.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 10, 2021","Jul 16, 2021","Jun 25, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58033272-black-jade

Pelageya Nilovna Vlasova is the real protagonist; her husband, a heavy drunkard, physically assaults her and leaves all the responsibility for raising their son, Pavel Vlasov, to her, but unexpectedly dies. Pavel noticeably begins to emulate his father in his drunkenness and stammer, but suddenly becomes involved in revolutionary activities. Abandoning drinking, Pavel starts to bring books to his home. Being illiterate and having no political interest, Nilovna is at first cautious about Pavel's new activities. However, she wants to help him. Pavel is shown as the main revolutionary character. Nevertheless Nilovna, moved by her maternal feelings and, though uneducated, overcoming her political ignorance to become involved in revolution, is considered the true protagonist of the novel.Mother is the only big novel of Gorky on the Russian revolutionary movement; however, of all his novels, it is possibly the least successful. Nevertheless, it remains the best known work of Gorky among the author's other novels. Modern critics consider it Gorky's most important pre-revolutionary novel because of the vivid image of his ""God-Builder"" ideas.I did appreciate 'Mother's' character growth as I progressed through the novel. But the book was repetitive and frequently boring.3 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 09, 2022","Jun 09, 2022","Jun 24, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43153446-mother

But in order to love this book, you have to like fantasy.A fantastical land with fantastical problems. Girl children are few and far between (actually, none have been born for years). Will the land of Saylock survive?Ghisla - a lost girlHod (pronounced with long O) - a cave dwelling blind boyThey are separated but when Ghisla sings, Hod SEES.From https://thebrowneyedbookworm.com/the-... (an excellent ).""Unable to offer safe shelter, Hod urges Ghisla onward to become a daughter of the temple, where all the kingdom’s girl children have been gathered. But because of a magical rune, the two cannot be separated, no matter the time or the distance.Now, subject to a ruthless king, Ghisla enters a desperate world of warring clan chieftains and catastrophic power struggles. Who among them can be trusted is unknowable. So are the sacrifices Ghisla and Hod must make to defeat the cursed forces that could destroy a kingdom and the fated bond between two souls.""My final anlysis: I enjoyed the book. I both listened and read, the Kindle Unlimited was accompanied by Audible. The Audible REALLY ADDED to my enjoyment of the book. 4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 21, 2021","Dec 16, 2021","Jun 21, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56083451-the-second-blind-son

WRONG. It is 5 short stories and a novella and the time period is NOW. NOW with all the racial problems we are beginning to recognize as endemic in the US. Let me emphasize that I am painfully aware of the cultural problems in the US. However, I cannot rate this book and its stories highly. I just did not appreciate the writing style which in the first two stories were written in a kind of letter format. Especially in the second story, it seemed like scolding.There are 5 short stories in this book take up 28% of the content.SS1: Control Negro (15 pages) A Father uses his illegitimate son in a racial experiment. 3 stars because it is thought provokingSS2: Virginia Is Not Your Home (11 pages) Someone seems to be chiding a woman as she grows through childhood to old age.
