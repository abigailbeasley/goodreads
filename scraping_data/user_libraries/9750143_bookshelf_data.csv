In Little Rot we are taken to a city in Nigerian where we meet four friends. The book opens with Kalu taking his long time girlfriend Aima to the airport because she refuses to live in sin and he is not ready for marriage. After much back and forth Aima decides its time to move away, however she can’t seem to get on the plane so she stays with her friend in Nigeria. Kalu, unaware that Aima didn’t get on the plane decides to go to sex party hosted by his best friend Ahmed. These parties are highly exclusive, invitation only and caters to Nigeria’s rich, everything must be discreet and everyone looks the other way even at things that are illegal. Kalu makes a snap decision and attacks a guest at the party and that puts everyone in danger. The book explores what happens when powerful people are put in position where they don’t feel powerful. How corruption, power, sex and money can get you everything. I am not sure what I expected from this book but this was not it. I was reading it and I thought, “this book feels very lacklustre, it’s not the book I expected them to write, it feels ordinary and lacking any form of substance.” The book felt too long, it was insanely predictable, often times it felt like the author was trying to shock me which made me roll my eyes.

With this act, Black families can claim up to $175,000 if they can prove that they are descendants of slaves or had land stolen from them. What happens in the book is a exploration of how the Act affects Willie and her family. Willie Revel and her family grew up well off but never sheltered from racism. She loves her family and her dream was to be a part of the construction company, that’s until she decided to become a journalist. After a one-night stand she becomes pregnant, moves back home raise her daughter with her family and work in the business.

While I enjoyed Willie’s back story, I wanted more about what happened after the act and I did not get that. Also the book is called, “ACTS OF FORGIVENESS” and little was explored with that.

An unforgettable read  In  The Woman Next Door  we meet Hortensia James, a Black renowne A beautiful book about ageing, friendship, grief and change. An unforgettable read  In  The Woman Next Door  we meet Hortensia James, a Black renowned designer from Barbados whose lived all over the world and decided to make Cape Town her retirement city. She moves into a rich neighbourhood and immediately feels unwelcomed. Hortensia husband is in palliative care at home so she has a lot of free time on her hands. She decides to be a part of the neighbourhood committee where she meets her next door neighbour. Marion Agostino is a white and has lived in Cape Town majority of her life. Recently widowed, she spends majority of her time with the neighbourhood committee, with her grandchild and her dog. Being the chairman of the neighbourhood watch may be Marion’s entire personality. That is until she finds out her dead husband left her for broke and she may lose everything she holds dear if she loses her house. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I don’t know what it is about reading about older protagonist but I could not put this book down. The friendship was unlikely and I think it goes back to what makes this book so lovely. The author showed us the characters’ humanity. They were two miserable old ladies, but you felt for them in a genuine way. I really loved how everything played out. This is my first book by this author and I look forward to reading more.

I have had this book on my list for a very long time and I am so happy I decided to finally read it.  Welcome to Lagos  is a book about humanity and bonds we form when we have no choice. The book opens with an officer leaving the army because he no longer believes in the cause and he is tired of being haunted by the people he's murdered.

At twenty-five-years old Melanie is trying to make a name for herself at the Miami newspaper but she just cannot seem to get her own by-line. With her company being less profitable the pressure is on to perform and write a strong piece. Her opportunity arises that requires her to travel to Colombia for a piece. While Melanie’s Mom is from Colombia, she does not know much about the country except for what the media tells her. Her Mom did not fill her in while growing up and if she’s being honest, she didn’t ask or wanted to know more about her heritage. She finally gets to visit Colombia with her mother and learn about the culture and her heritage. While there, she found a journal from her mother where she wrote about life in Colombia before she left and why she left. Melanie learns so much about her mother, her life before going to America. While in Colombia they connect so deeply that Melanie cant help to fall more in love with her culture. I am always up for an Immigrant story and I loved the premise of this one. I enjoyed reading the mother’s journal entry and what it was for like living in Colombia and why she decided to move to America and the journey that took her there. The author did a great job of exploring the mother-daughter relationship and both of them having an immigrant experience. We see the arc of Melanie not embracing her culture to learning a lot more coming to an appreciation for her mother and what she went through. The parts that I loved, I really loved. The mother and grandmother scenes really were top tier. The one part that kinda annoyed me or pissed me off is Melanie, a 25 year old Colombian, who is a writer didn’t know that Garbriel Marquez is Colombian… I mean…. LET’S BE FOR REAL!!!!

She goes out partying with her friends on a weekend to an underground club called The Crypt. They get to whine, and grind and meet other people, but also The Crypt is a way for them to let go of all things that holds them down and escape for a bit. During a night at The Crypt Yamaye meets Moose, a furniture maker from Jamaica and they fall madly and deeply in love.

Prachi Gupta writes a memoir for immigrant children who are trying to understand their place in the world. She writes about growing up with the parents and her brother- her father wanted to be a doctor because that is what he thinks was expected of him. He married very young and took her mother from Indian to Canada and then the US. Growing up the father always made the decisions, where to live, what they would be and what was expected of everyone.

They were each other’s firsts and have been married for three years. During a conversation they talked about the fact that they haven’t had sex in months, that their marriage has hit a roadblock. To remedy the situation, Dominic suggests the Freedom Clause. What is the Freedom Clause? Well both Dominica and Daphne gets one night off every year for five years to sleep with someone. Yes, there are rules:It cannot be the same person, you know they don’t want to have an affair.They can’t tell each other about it.They can’t tell their friends about it.

What I enjoyed was seeing how the Freedom Clause pans out because there will be drama and drama there was. I think the author was very heavy handed and wanted Daphne to “win” from the start.

She gets shaken from her daydreaming by women trying to save her son Timothy who ended up drowning in the river.

Do you that feeling when you have a favorite author and you thought you read all their essays, then you find out there’s a book you haven’t read and you finally read it and it blows your mind? That is exactly how I felt reading Kei Miller’s  Writing Down The Vision If you are a Kei Miller fan, I highly recommend you read this collection, he comments on everything, and when he said prophecy, he didn’t lie because one of the essay in this collection was basically a starting point for  Things I’ve Withheld . In this eighteen-essay collection he explores what it is like for a young Caribbean writer to write from what is deemed a small space, who influenced his writing, culture, identity, religion, falling out of religion, grief and so much more. I particularly love his commentary on Caribbean literature in the essay, “IN DEFENCE OF MAAS JOE”. In this essay he spoke about what is an authentic representation of Caribbean life in literature. How do we include the contemporary and the “simple” country life while making them both stunning. A line that stood out to me was:  I agree wholeheartedly then that the citizens of the developing world ought to be allowed to live modern, urban, and even Western lives in fiction, but I disagree that only such lives are authentic, or that the so-called simple life cannot and has not been depicted in all its stunning complexity. Can we not allow the folk to hold an iPad in one hand, and a mango in the other?  If you read Nicole Dennis Benn’s  Here Comes The Sun  then you will love the essay  where he talks about tourism and what the “Real Caribbean” looks like. Overall, this essay is truly a breath of fresh air and I think everyone who loves Caribbean books should read this....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 05, 2023","Jun 07, 2023","Jun 05, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19300752-writing-down-the-vision

Pearline, left Jamaica over 20 years to make a life for herself and provide for her family back home. She spent majority of her life in Brooklyn, married, with a daughter who she hardly gets a long with because she works so much. When she hears that her father may be dying she decides its finally time for her to move back home to Jamaica. Pearline must now get use to living in Jamaica after being gone for a long time, reconnect with her family, especially her sisters who for some reason holds bitterness and grudge towards her. She spends her days taking care of her dying father whose last wish is for her to find her siblings she left over 60 years ago on a port in Havana, Cuba. With the passing of her father Pearl spends majority of her time unravelling family secrets, finding out things she isn’t prepared to deal with and making everyone uneasy as she prepares to grant her father his last wish. Going from Brooklyn, to Montego to Cuba we are taken into Pearline’s family history as she seeks to fix what was broken sixty years ago. I have a lot of thoughts on this book, let me start with the good ones. This book is well written. It is clear Donna Hemans is a stellar author. She is writes so well, at times I felt I was on that veranda back in Jamaica with Pearline. I thoroughly enjoyed how she went about writing this family saga, the history of Jamaicans leaving to go work in Panama and Cuba. The family dynamic with Pearline and her sister was so believable because I am witnessed that first-hand. The person who leaves getting treated unfairly and those who stayed feeling they were slighted. The exploration of that was layered and believable. The thing one thing that I felt the book lack was an actual plot that moved. To say this was a slow burner would be a lie, at times I felt I read 5-6 chapters and we were discussing the same thing- granted it was 5-6 beautifully written chapters. I wish the book had a stronger editor, because everything was there- the family dynamic, the history, family relatives popping up out of nowhere, Pearline getting back to life in Jamaica, the need to fulfil her father’s wish- it was all there but I just felt it didn’t come together as I would like. Don’t get me wrong, you will read this book, you will be engaged but you will finish feeling like something is off. I finished it and I thought, “it was well written but it is was missing something” Overall, I enjoyed the writing, it is clear Hemans did her research, the book felt very Jamaican and made me so nostalgic, I just wanted a bit more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,2,"Feb 17, 2024Apr 2024","Feb 27, 2024not set","May 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123087725-the-house-of-plain-truth

In  Dances  we are introduced to twenty-two year old Cece Cordell who was recently promoted to the principal at the New York City Ballet. Cece grew up in with a non-existent father, a mother who saw ballet as something trivial and a brother who worked hard in helping her get to where she is today. From a very young age, all Cece wanted to do was dance and she did everything to make it possible. After filling in for a dancer Cece was quickly promoted and pushed into stardom as the first Black Ballerina principle. She is at a weird space in her career, and with the stardom comes guilt, regret and questions of what could have been. She is no longer in contact with her brother, and misses him so much she sets out to find him. She thinks about her Black Ballerina body all the time and wonders what will happen if it fails her… Here are my thoughts on this book:I loved reading about a Black Ballet dancers and what it took to reach the pinnacle of her success. I think the writer did an amazing job of walking us through that. It felt believable and was very engaging to read about. Cece is a character you want to see win in everything and I think its because of how much heart she’s got, fighting against all odds and being a Black woman in a very white space- this was explored expertly. For once I am going to say, I wish we had an additional 50 pages to explore her family dynamics. I felt it was presented but never truly explored. Why was the mother like that? Why didn’t the brother stay? Is she really friends with those people? I felt it was very one-dimensional. If you are fascinated by ballet culture, I think this book does a great job of exploring the ins and outs of it. I learned so much! Overall, I can see this being a favorite for many!

On her fifth birthday her dad mysterio So many thoughts and feelings about this book… In  Lucky Girl  we meet Soila who was born and raised in Kenya. On her fifth birthday her dad mysteriously dies and no one speaks about it, especially her very strict mother who raised her to be grateful, always give back and not complain too much. Since Solia’s father’s death, her mother took over the business and made it very profitable. They are very well off, Soila is very sheltered because her mother doesn’t want her to end up like the “other girls”. She lives at home with her aunties and does her best to be obedient. As a teenager she misses out on a lot and craves freedom. With college coming up she decides she wants to go to the US to study. Behind her mother’s back she applies and is approved for college. After much fight her mother says yes. In New York she makes friends, falls in love, finds out who she is in the world, and tries to navigate what it means to be a Kenyan living in the US. She learns a lot, loses a lot and finds peace on her journey. Here are my thoughts on this book:It was a very easy read, it is one of those books you spend a day trying to finish because you needed to know what happened. What decision Soila ends up making. The book have a very strong mother-daughter relationship themed and while I love reading books that centered on it, it made me not like Soila. I find she did not stand up for herself and was so fraidy-fraidy. At one point I found myself screaming “YOU ARE AN ADULT!!!!!” I felt the author really bemoaned a lot of topics to the point. Yes, I loved reading about what it is like for an African living in America versus an African American living there. When those topics came up it felt forced, it read like a thesis, it didn’t just seamlessly flowed through the book. It was just these big blocks of “let’s discuss this…for 4-6 pages.” I did not believe the romance in the book or the relationship Soila had with her first boyfriend. It was so cold and unbelievable. I didn’t even care when they broke up.There were a lot of characters in the book and I wish instead of so many aunties the author focused on 1-2 building out their backstories a bit more. I also felt the author packed so much in the short book- sexual harassment, racism, coming of age, friendship, identity, love, art, 9/11, where is home… every single theme was ticked, this could be a good or bad thing I guess. For me, it felt like tew much. You are probably reading this thinking, “well, what exactly did you enjoy?”. Honestly, I enjoyed how the book made me feel. It felt fresh, it was a solid coming of age. And even though Solia enrages me, I still couldn’t help cheering for her. I think this would made a perfect book club pick. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"May 13, 2023","May 14, 2023","May 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61913597-lucky-girl

Ok, we’ve all seen this book, and you are probably wondering if it’s worth the hype and here’s my answer- it is worth the hype and it doesn’t worth the hype. I don’t know how else to explain it.  Yellowface  opens with author Athena Liu celebrating yet another achievement with her “friend” June Hayward. Athena Liu is a writing author with six figure publishing deals, Netflix series, and a cult like following for her work. She is on track for becoming a know literary icon- every book she writes is an instant best seller and she’s a literary darling. June on the other hand, when she released her book, it barely made even, and her publishing house doesn’t even take her call anymore. On the night that June Hayward is out celebrating yet another win with Athena Liu, Liu chokes on a slice of pizza and dies- right in front of June. Acting on impulse June takes the just-finished novel that Athena Liu was working on, takes it home not necessarily knowing what to do with it. The novel is about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers to the British and French war efforts during World War I. June in a fit of inspiration, or grief spends hours editing Athena’s novel, to the point where decides it’s not longer Athena’s work because she’s added so much to it. She sends the novel to her publisher who calls her offering her six figures and spot as the next literary darling. June’s novel (if we can call it that) moves through the publishing pipeline fast. When she is asked for a sensitivity reader June shuts it down- because, why would a white woman writing about the Chinese laborers during World War 1 want to get it right? With the publishing of the novel June is propelled to stardom but the public have questions. Y’all, chaos reigned in this book. When I tell you, I could not stop laughing at the plot:1.	Because it is hilarious2.	Because, having been a reader for years and deeply curious about the publishing world, I have seen this happened first hand. Yellowface is a commentary on the publishing industry, I wish publishers would take this book to heart…. But the fact that they published this shows that they are just laughing in our faces. Overall, I would recommend you read it, it is a very entertaining read!

I am not going to lie; this book floored me in a good way. The author did a spectacular job showcasing how society views the body of women in such a layered way. The story is told from the perspective of three characters:A man who sees the woman in the gym and get a front seat view into how she transforms her body. He sees her on her first day in the gym and how she transforms both in the gym and in personal setting… because they start dating. Her mother gives us a history of how she was growing up, her personality and the kind of daughter she was. I really enjoyed the mother’s perspective because I loved the mother-daughter theme that was explored. A co-worker/friend who basically took in the character after a disastrous break-up, she dotes on her and nurses her back to life. I think she had the most unique look into the character as she went from being abused to owning her power. Through the three point of view we basically piece together who the character is and her motivation behind her transformation. I loved that the author took us through each stage, even though it wasn’t told the character herself and I think that is what made it very intriguing. This is truly just an unforgettable, unique read that I hope a lot of people will pick up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Apr 19, 2023","Apr 22, 2023","Apr 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61612866-chrysalis

In this collection he mentions an old woman in the back room that we don’t walk about. Author Ann Dávila Cardinal explores that in her novel so beautifully.  We meet Isla Larsen Sanchez as she is being sent back to Puerto Rico by her mother because her dad is dying. She spends the majority of her time with her Aunty in the rural part of Puerto Rico. After the summer is over, she goes back to New Jersey to find out that her dad died, and her mom cleared out all his things. She does not know how to navigate life, she hardly has friends in New Jersey and when she goes back to Puerto Rico for summer she feels judged by her cousins. Isla spends a lot of time with her Grand Aunty because her grandmother and Mother do not get along. They really do not like each other. When Isla turns 18 and her grandmother passes, she starts having these visions and dreams that she is not sure what to make of them. There are some deep family secrets, but everyone is very tight-lipped. She decides to go digging. What I really enjoyed about this book was getting to see Isla grown into her own as a young woman in the world. I loved learning about the different cultures and the history of the family. The book dragged a little in the middle but overall I enjoyed it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Apr 03, 2023","Apr 09, 2023","Apr 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57695734-the-storyteller-s-death

Even with all that anxiety I didn't feel frustrated because even though I wanted to find out what happened at the BBQ I also kinda didnt want to know, because I know it would have been something awful! Let's talk about how enthralling all the characters were. Clementine, Erica, Vid, Sam, Harry even Dakota all were fascinating in their own way. I loved how dysfunctional Clementine and Erica's friendship, because to be honest we all have that one friend who is kinda like Erica who we put up with, for reasons that aren't even clear to us. I absolutely love how Moriarty isn't afraid to go there with the awkward moments. Throughout the book there were some cringe worthy moments where I felt like I would die if that happened to me in real life.

In  The Nursery  we meet a firs time mother living in a very cramped New York City apartment. It is narrated by her so she pulls back the curtain of her mind and we are privy to all her unfiltered thoughts as she finds out that she is pregnant, giving birth and feeling like a failure in every sense of the word. Our narrator, pre-baby is in a loving relationship with her husband John whose face lights up when she enters a room. She spends her days at her desk translating foreign books, John works in an office, overall they are a very happy couple. She becomes pregnant and everything changes- her and John barely speak, she stays home, she wonders if she is doing motherhood right, her body betrays her and nothing could prepare her for her current life with her baby Button. She suffers from post-partum depression where nothing seem to be able to pull her out. This is a very short read but packed with a slice of life of a new mom who seems to be going at it alone. I love how unfiltered her thoughts are and I imagine a lot of new mom may feel that way. There is something real about the life that our narrator is living. She speaks about not being able to relate to her friends, how there is a line drawn between child-free and those with child, the unfairness of labour, the freedom her husband has and how motherhood just feels rough. I highly recommend this read to anyone- especially men!  There is nobody to teach you that motherhood is forever so how is it not a shock to your system when you find out that it is, in fact, until forever? How can this even be called motherhood?  ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Mar 18, 2023","Mar 18, 2023","Mar 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63904515-the-nursery

In  Hello, Beautiful  we meet William Walters who grew up in a house where his parents barely spoke or even looked at him. William was born soon after the death of his sister and his parents never got over it, so William was left to take care of himself as his father worked a lot and his mother drank to numb the pain. He started playing basketball and found a sense of freedom and release from his life at home. Through basketball, he was offered a scholarship to a college far away from home- there he would meet and fall in love with Julia Padavano. In college, William was able to reinvent himself- though he did not know what he wanted to do with his life- he found joy in dating Julia who seem to have her entire life planned out and was on an upward trajectory. What William loved even more was the fact that her family was so tight, they loved deeply and he felt what was missing from his family life, he saw so clearly with them. Having met Julia’s sisters and parents, he was ready to be married into the family. Julia planned their family life and their future, but William felt things were moving too fast. He wanted children, but just not now. He loved history but did he want to be a professor? Dealing with an injury and not being able to play basketball William begins to question everything in his life. What seemed like a bright future, lead to him questioning everything and wanting to leave it all behind. There is a tenderness with which the author writes that pulls the readers in and makes you feel deeply for all the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the storytelling and all the characters I have a very soft spot for. I loved that the author tackled very hard subjects including depression, suicide, love, regret, death and rejection. They were dealt with in very layered way and you feel as if you know exactly why the characters did what they did.

The father owns a printing business, the mother is a doctor in the public health system and they have three daughters- one is currently in America studying and the other two attends a private school in Nigeria.

I am going to go ahead and say this, yes I believe women- but I feel like this was not believable Nani did not explore ALL her options and I think that is what left me feeling so MAD and ANGRY with her as a character. She just went right with it- didn’t talk to her Aunty, her sister anyone. Yes I get that there was a lot of shame- BUT for her to fall into that other option it just didn’t seem to make sense to me.

Ola and Michael met, started dating- like all couples they went through some very rough patches but they both stuck to it and are currently seeing their efforts paying off. Ola is doing great at her job, young, beautiful and by society’s standard, very successful. Michael, took his time but he will be starting a new role at Curated, earning more and marrying the love of his life. After sharing their engagement photos online, Ola and Michael became the new poster couple for Black Love. They went viral and started getting a following- a following Michael loved because in some ways it validated him and the relationship. Of course, like all famous insta-couple they started getting deals and being featured. This worked in their favour, until they woke up one day to a list be posted on twitter that will shatter their lives.

It felt like the author wrote this book so it could be picked up for a TV series or a show. I just know when an author is writing to be picked up for a show and this was the definition. I did not believe they were an Instagram famous couple- very few things in the book pointed to that. The book tried to cover entirely TEW much- feminism, being woke, modern day influencing, love, culture, friendship etc. Somethings were done well but the others were not because too much was trying to be covered.

Meet Alice, a Black woman living and working in retail in Toronto. Alice was set to be the next big thing in publishing but after graduating she could not find work in the space. Now she is going through a midlife crisis wondering how is it possible she is the only one in her group not employed in publishing and living with her Mom. In an effort to be more social she says yes to going out with some co-worker. On her way home after taking off her guard bracelet that was given to her by her Jamaican Grandmother, she was visited by River Mumma! River Mumma guards the water, she is known for having a golden comb that she uses on riverbanks. If she spots someone coming, she hides in the water leaving the comb, but those who find it always return it because they know it is River Mumma own. That is until a tourist finds the comb, takes it back to Toronto leaving River Mumma combless and out for revenge. River Muuma gives Alicia 24 hours to find and return her comb. Alicia is still in shock that a character she grew up being told stories about is actually in front of her, in Toronto. What started off as harmless Jamaican folklore told to her by her Granny in Jamaica turns into real life visions, spirits, duppies, rolling calves and douens! Alicie spends 24 hours around Toronto with her two friends Mars and Heaven trying to find the missing the comb, while battling spirits. Fast-paced, thrilling, packing with Jamaican folklore, I could not get enough. Growing up in Jamaica where my mother and Granny would tell stories about Riva Muuma, Duppies and Rolling Calf, it was chilling reading about them in the contemporary space. I find that in today’s world we don’t read too much about stories we grew up hearing about so it was truly magnificent reading a book like River Muuma. It is clear that Zalika Benta-Reid did her research and is passionate about keeping folklore alive, relevant and giving a voice to stories we hardly hear today. I cannot wait for more persons to engage with this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 03, 2023","Jan 03, 2023","Jan 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/65650494-river-mumma

Homebodies  opens with Mickey attending an industry event where one of her co-worker tells her that she heard through the grapevine that she is getting replaced. Mickey goes home feeling uneasy but doesn’t give much thought to it because why would her boss ask her to do a presentation for the upcoming year if she was planning on getting rid of her? Its not until a few days later Mickey sees a series of Black women going into her boss’s office for interview that she finally comes to term with what is going to happen. Mickey loves her job in media, she loves writing and even though she only gets to write 10% of the topics she pitches she knows it’s a great position to be in. With her being let go, she’s furious at herself, her boss, the industry and the systems that doesn’t serve her! In a fit of rage she pens a detailed letter outlining all the things she endured as a Black woman in media- hoping to get some coverage. Added to this, Mickey’s relationship with her girlfriend of over five years starts to unravel. With so much going on she decides to head back to her hometown to stay with her grandma while she decides on next steps. Mickey doesn’t have time to reflect, between her Grandmother asking her to do chores, reconnecting with old friends, and former lover she begins to wonder if she should just forget about media, New York and her relationship… that’s until her letter goes viral. Listen, I ate this book up! I absolutely loved being in Mickey’s world and reading about all the things she has to contend with. I love how real her issues were and absolutely enraging. There were parts of the book where I legit SCREAMED because I could not imagine having to go through that.

Truly an amazing read. In  The Colo of Family  we meet the Payne family, they are considered to be Black Excellence. Rich, beautiful, athletic, academically inclined and they are all destined for greatness. Devon and James Payne are brothers but have always been rivals- not just regular brotherly rivals, they genuinely do not like each other and would not have been friends or caught in the same place- but because they are related they endure. Both of them have a love for sports and they excel at it, they are considered Connecticut’s golden boys- destined to go pro and put the town on the map- that is until one night an accident leaves Devon paralyzed for life- crushing all his hopes and dreams.While Devon is in rehab, trying to gain mobility, only a few of his siblings actually stays in contact with him- he doesn’t hear from his mother or his brother. James is his mother’s golden child- to be fair, she actually cannot stand Devon. The family barely recovers after the tragic accident and decades later-Devon is still bitter about how they treated him- especially his brother who ends up getting married to the girl he was dating before the accident. Years later, James needs a replacement kidney and Devon may be the perfect match. Everyone pleads with Devon to get tested but he decides not to- which shatters the family having persons choosing sides. Listen, this book is not for everyone but it was definitely for me.

She left Savannah eight years ago to start fresh in a new town without anyone knowing except her immediate family. She keeps her daughter Alana close, even though she is a genius.

Sara tries to keep Alana close but it is hard when she is actually a genius and remains very curious about the world. In caring for her ailing father, running his bookstore, trying not to run into the family members of the person who assaulted her- Sara meets the most amazing man- who turns out to be the twin brother of her assaulter, Alana’s uncle. There are so many things Sara must make a decision on, including finding out her daughter’s father is dying.I really enjoyed this read and I think it was because it was told from two perspective.

In  BLACKGIRL ON MARS  Lesley-Ann Brown talks about everything. It is so refreshing reading a memoir written by a Black Caribbean woman because I feel far too often we are told, “this is family business” “no one needs to know about this…” and to see Brown talk about her experience and how they shaped her life made it a truly amazing read.The memoir explores the author finding her place in the world especially as a Black Woman from the Caribbean living in Denmark. Surrounded by so many white people, she talks about what it felt like being a teacher for students she could not impact how she wanted to. We read about the death of her Grandmother who she calls home and how going back to Trinidad and Tobago impacted her outlook. I really enjoyed hearing how she coped being sent back to Trinidad at a very early age to live with her grandmother and how their relationship shaped who she is today. If you love a memoir that also teaches, I strongly recommend picking up BlackGirl on Mars. It is honest, well written, smart, hilarious and deeply moving. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jan 03, 2023","Jan 22, 2023","Jan 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63272560-blackgirl-on-mars

Brilliant, moving, an emotional journey, layered, spectacular, heavy, redeeming, unforgettable and un-putdownab This is the gold standard of memoirs. Brilliant, moving, an emotional journey, layered, spectacular, heavy, redeeming, unforgettable and un-putdownable. I read this book a month ago and I am still unable to put into words how brilliant this memoir is. My life is forever changed reading this book. Safiya Sincliar’s writing is forever in my heart and I need everyone to experience this masterpiece and for it to win all the awards.  How To Say Babylon: A Jamaican Memoir  by Safiya Sinclair’s explores childhood and adulthood growing up in a very strict Rastafarian household in Jamaica where she and especially her sisters were subjected to numerous rules to maintain and keep their purity. She showcases how this upbringing impacted every part of her life and how she was able to break free. Safiya grew up in a Jamaican household with her mother, brother and sisters to a Rastafarian father. He was once in a popular band when he met her mother before they fell in love and started having children. He became obsessed with everything ital, purity and the teachings of Selassie and Rastafarianism. She and her siblings had to cover themselves constantly, they weren’t allowed to have friends, or lean into the Western world because it was a construct of Babylon. When asked why certain things were they way they were, “Babylon business” would be the resounding answer. Disobedience was never tolerated and her father ruled with a strong first or sometimes belt. Despite all of this Safiya and her siblings turned out to be academically gifted, receiving scholarships, awards and being the head of their classes. This was a point of pride for her father who loved that his children were considered geniuses. Through their academic gift they were able to break free of their father’s strict rule but the scars continue to be there. In  Sinclair how she worked through the trauma and how she made it out on the other side. Friends, I have read 60 books for the year so far and this is one of my top favourite reads. I felt real emotions reading this book, I was sobbing at the end of the book and that goes back to how much of an expert writer Sinclair is. She carried me through a range of emotions which all ended in forgiveness. I have read a lot of memoirs and this one shines the brightest and I think it is because Sinclair was able to lay bare all the things that happened to her and how she dealt with it. I learned so much about Jamaica’s history with Rastafarianism and I thank Sinclair for putting in the work and research and shining light on the massacre that happened to Rastafarians living in Jamaica. This was also the first time I read a book that details what it is like being raised with a devout Rastafarian parent. What I loved about this book is that Sinclair did not tell a one-dimensional story, it was “my father treated me bad” she showcase his history, why he is the way he is today and how that fed into how he raised his children. His character arc… can it be a character arc if it’s a real life story? But the father’s character arc was *chef’s kiss* and the ending will ruin you! If you only read one book in your life, read this! Additional Note  I know publishing are supposed to market other memoirs using memoirs we may know but I wish they had tried harder for a book like this that is distinctly Jamaican. So, if you read this memoir and loved it I highlight recommend you read  Lorna Goodison's From Harvey River: A Memoir of My Mother and Her Island.  In her book Sinclair wrote about Jamaica and her father, in Goodison's book she also wrote about Jamaica and her mother. These books are talking to each other and I hope you find the time to read and listen....more",Notes are private!,6,188,2,"Jan 08, 2024Jul 2023","Feb 03, 2024Jul 16, 2023","Dec 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62919742-how-to-say-babylon

Soraya Palmer was flexing on us when she wrote this debut novel and I am here for it, because it is truly an experience reading this book and I need everyone to engage with what true storytelling looks like. The Human Origins of Beatrice Porter and Other Essential Ghosts  has everything, from folklore, to spirits, to contemporary Caribbean and Brooklyn setting, themes of family, sisterhood, mother-daughter relationship, infidelity, coming-of-age, sexuality- it is all there and it is very well executed. What a brilliant book! This book is about a family comes together through storytelling. Told from the perspective of the two sisters in the family, we are privy to the family life. The mother who is currently pregnant with the third child, she reminisce on growing up in Trinidad and Tobago, meeting her current husband and how much he loves her. She suffers from a lot of headaches, while trying to raise her two daughters who she cannot seem to relate to, added to that, her husband is cheating on her… again. Her husband, originally from Jamaica, loves storytelling, and loses himself in it, he does not know how to commit or be there when times are hard. Zora, is currently on her way out of the home, getting ready for college. She is exploring her sexuality in a way her mother did but she does not get the grace she needs. Wondering if she will ever be accepted by her family or the world, leaves home to find herself. Further distancing herself from her sister. Sasha is the middle child, who spends a lot of time with her journal, as a way to understand the world and what is happening around her. With her sister out of the house and her father gone as well, she must take care of her mother whose illness is getting worse. How will they as a family come together to rally for her mother? Told from the perspective of the two daughters and an omniscience narrative this reads like a fairytale where you get insights into how things will end. I absolutely LOVED the very present narrator who draws you into the story and asks you questions- it was soooo very interactive and think that was the biggest brilliance of the book for me. As someone who grew up in the Caribbean, storytelling is a big part of our culture and meeting family who tells story as a way to impart wisdom made me feel so much at home. Also, it doesn’t hurt that it is set in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, my two homes.

The book is told through Stella’s lens, we see how she is treated differently by her father, how he bask in his son but treats her unfairly. We see how hard her mother works as a nurse trying to save children, while she awaits her time to be saved. During high school she gets an autoimmune disease that pushes her over the edge. While trying to be an A+ student, stay out of her father’s way, grow up, make friends, she discovers if she knows on wood or search for magpies, things will work out…. Or will it? We follow Stella from an early age, as she becomes a teenager, starts university and become a lawyer. She tries to forget her past, tries to forgive her father, her mother and brother but she finds it hard. Surrounded by friends who love her, she tries to be courageous but it is hard when the wounds won’t heal and no one will address the elephant in the room. Set in South London (big up South London) and Ghana, we are introduced to a character who goes through a lot. We are taken into a family and friendship dynamics that is sometime difficult to navigate. The author writes convincingly about the effects of domestic violence and the effects it has on the intergenerational trauma. While very heavy topics are explored in the book, the character is very defiant and we are at no point feeling pity for them.

Visceral  It is not every day you pick up a book and the writing is makes your chest constrict which leads you to taking many breaks in reading because you feel like you are constantly holding your breath. Cecile Pin’s debut novel  Wandering Souls  opens with a Vietnamese family currently in Vietnam getting ready to take their journey to America. Their Uncle went previously and writes back to let his brother know that he is in the land of milk and honey. With Vietnam currently war torn, their only way is to try and get to America to meet up with the uncle. The family decides to send ahead the three older siblings and the remaining family members will follow. Nothing could prepare the siblings, Anh, Thanh, and Minh as they leave from Vietnam to Hong Kong. The siblings arrive safely in Hong Kong but their parents and younger siblings did not make it. They are left orphaned with Anh as their caretaker. Being orphaned so young, in a new place and nowhere to call home, they must cleave to each other as they carve out a life for themselves. I am truly blown away by the writing of this book. The story felt deeply personally and one that needed to be told. Wandering Soul captures what it is like to face the unknown, time an time again, to get your choice ripped from your and constantly wondering what your future holds. I cannot recommend this book enough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Nov 24, 2022","Nov 28, 2022","Nov 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60741794-wandering-souls

During the 1966 we meet Sook-Yin who leaves Kowloon to go to London for a better life. Her family sends her off to restore their honor, make more money and help them at home. Sook-Yin must make a life in gloomy London, while being exposed to racism and trying to find community. She started her training as a nurse but things go south very fast.

Engrossing, engaging, beautifully written with a main character you would go to war for. Let me start with saying MAAME is one of my favorite books for 2023 and it is just February- but I am calling it. This is a must read. In  Maame  we meet Maddie, in her twenties and should be living her best London life but with everyone of her family member shirking their duties she ends up being the primary caretaker for her father who suffers from Parkinson’s. Her mother spends half the year in London and the other half in Ghana but makes sure to ask for money and send strongly worded text telling Maddie how to live her life. Maddie’s older brother left the family home a long time to live and travel with his friends. He checks in, but his life mostly involves his friends who he’s made his family. Maddie must take care of her family, go to work at a very unrewarding job where her boss is unreasonable, unstable and chaotic- all while being the only Black person present. It is exhausting. Finally Maddie’s mother returns to London to take over as lead caregiver for her husband and Maddie can now step into the role of young twenty-something-finding herself! She moves out, starts making friends, dating, speaking up for herself, and making a list of what the New Maddie will look like. Maddie is way out of her comfort zone but intends to lean into the life she couldn’t live previously. All seems to be going great until it is not and Maddie’s world comes crumbling… fast. Let me tell you something… I inhaled this book. Well written, funny, moving, this book will have you fighting for a fictional character. Jessica George did the damn thing with this book. I can see this being the book of 2023 because the character is so relatable. The book touches on a number of topics dating, family, grief, friendship, religion, microaggression at work, family expectation, racism, capitalism, all while being relevant and not trying too hard. Maame does brilliantly what Such A Fun Age was trying to do. I will say, if you enjoyed Queenie, you will definitely love reading about Maddie. Very complex characters who are going through things you may have experience. I will say the ending felt rushed and there were some google searches that could have been left out but overall a very stunning debut.

I absolutely loved  HIS OWN WIFE  so when I saw she wrote a second book I was excited and I wasn’t disappointed…that much! In  Nightbloom  we are taken to Ghana where we meet two families who are bonded together by the mothers friendship which spills over to the daughters becoming inseparable. We meet Selasi and Akorfa, who grew up very close, their mothers were best of friends so it was inevitable they would be friends. Akora was the shy one, always observant and taken to reading her book. Selasi was the more outgoing and fun one who Akora followed around. Akora’s parents ensured she got the best of everything especially in education- not matter the cost, it also helped that they had the financial means. Selasi did not go well in school but her parents ensured she was given the best. In a twist of events Selasi loses her mother and everything goes downhill from there. The friendship she thought she had with her friend, turned sour and their lives went in different directions. What will it take to bring them back together?Told from the perspective of Akora and Selasi, we get layered look into motherhood, friendships, mother-daughter relationships, grief, sexual assault and being Black in America. You can tell a Peace Media book from anywhere, the prose is layered, starts of slow and builds to a crescendo and that is exactly what happened here. I loved that we hear the stories from each character POV and I think that’s what made the book so good. There were certain parts where the book dragged and it felt very preachy, I also feel the battle with Selasi and the minister could have been shorter to make space for the friendship.

In Liv Little’s debut novel Rosewater  we first meet Elise, after a drunken night with her co-worker Bea, she wakes up to two policemen knocking on her door, telling her she will be evicted from her apartment in the next hour. Elise does not know what to do, especially with Bea being there- a co-worker she hooks up with but doesn’t really know that well. With no one else to turn to, she calls her friend Juliet who she hasn’t spoken to in over a year to ask if she can stay by her until she sorts herself out. Juilet agrees, but there is still that conversation that needs to be had between them. Elise goes through so many emotions, being 28, jobless, starving poet, living in her best friend’s apartment, little to no money, barely any contact with her family, except for her grandmother- all while trying to see if she wants Bea as more than a hook up. She tries to not be a failure but cannot help but feel like she will never make it in life, especially when she compares herself to Juilet. This time the marketing department did not lie, if you did enjoy QUEENIE  I think you will absolutely enjoy Rosewater. Yes, Elise reads way more mature than Queenie but both are going through the growing pain of finding themselves in the world. I love how relatable Elise was, as a Black woman in London, who cant seem to catch a break, who wants to be the next poet, it is great getting a look into the reality of what can happen. I did feel like the author tried to cover a lot of different themes and some I felt got glossed over. The family bit, with the father cheating and who he cheated with- that felt a bit unnecessary because it did nothing to move the plot along. I also felt like the book dragged a bit in the middle and sprinted in the end and I wish they had taken more time to give us a slower ending.

Efe wasn’t sure where her place is in the world but she knew she wanted to leave an impact. She met Sam while in high school and they stay connected while in University. Through a series of events, they got together later in life, got married and everything was going great, until Efe accidentally got pregnant. Efe struggled through her first pregnancy, she went through it because Sam left her no choice. Motherhood was hard for Efe, so much so her parents came from Ghana to take her child from her. After three years, Efe and Sam are finally happy, back into a groove, and enjoying their marriage and being a parent. That is until Efe disappears. A truly heart breaking novel about motherhood, tradition, marriage, regret, love, family and what it means to lose yourself for others.

In Breanne McIvor’s sizzling debut we are taken to Trinidad and Tobago where we meet Bianca Bridge, a budding writer who is starting over after a major scandal. Bianca recently graduated from a University in London where she headed back to her home country to persue her dream of becoming a writer. Things are looking up for her, she’s got a remote job, an apartment, a car and while she is a bit lonely- her mother died and her father remarried so he is hardly around- she makes the best of her situation. All is going well, until Bianca meets and falls in love with a government minister, their affair ends up on the country’s front page and Bianca is blacklisted. She is social pariah, blacklisted, fired from her job, barely making ends meet, and the only thing she has going for her is her one off photoshoot jobs. With little to no job option Bianca says yes to being a lowly assistant to larger-than-life Make-up Artist Obadiah Cortland. Obadiah Cortland is known in the industry as very hard to work for- worse than “a devil wears Prada” but with no option she takes the job planning her exit even as she does so. Surprisingly Bianca doesn’t end up disliking her time in her new role, she ends up working on her writing craft, making friends, giving herself some grace, finding out Obadiah is not as much as of a devil as he is known to be. With her role as assistant she gets to put her degree to use, work on her writing craft and finally tell her side of the affair story. What happens when the truth is out?  The God of Good Looks  is filled with characters you cannot help but cheer for. The entire cast all are fresh, entertaining and engaging. McIvor takes us to Trinidad and Tobago we learn so much about the culture, history and the make-up industry. What I loved is that we journey with Bianca as she comes into her truth. I love how realistic her character was, you truly feel for her as someone who has little friends, is a social pariah and not sure where her path is in life, added to that, she’s got no family support or her mother to take care of her. I love that it was set in Trinidad, and YES, I will admit, it took awhile for me to wrap my head around a story set in a high fashion make up house being in Trinidad but once I got use to it I really enjoyed it. I did think the book dragged a little and it could have been 50 pages shorter but overall I loved how entertaining the read was. The main characters Bianca and Obadiah were very endearing and I want everyone to meet them. If you enjoyed reading  If I Had Your Face  you will enjoy this one!

Set in Atlanta during the 1980s we meet James Witherspoon, a Black man with two families- one he claims publicly and the other is a secret. Yes, we all know a James Witherspoon.

Eleanor Shearer’s debut novel is a testament to mother’s love, a redemptive story!   River Sing Me Home  is a sprawling debut novel set during the 1834s that takes us to Barbados, British Guiana (now Guyana) and Trinidad and Tobago. The book opens with Rachel, an enslaved mother, running away from Providence plantation in Barbados. The Emancipation Act of 1834 was announced and declares they are no longer enslaved, but the slave master has other plans for them. Rachel decides she will never be free, unless she runs. Rachel wants to find her five children who were taken from her in the most gruesome way. By some miracle, Rachel makes finds safety, and is taken to the capital city of Barbados to search for her children. She has no clue where they are, if they are still in Barbados but she is resolved to find all of her five children. Will she find them? Will she find them alive? Will she die trying to find them? Will they remember her? All of these questions plays out in Rachel head as she goes from Barbados, to the deep interior of British Guiana, and finally, sailing to Trinidad and Tobago. Will she find her five children? Written with so much heart, the author did an amazing job of taking us into what is like to be a mother who had five of her children ripped away. I think what I enjoyed most was how Rachel traverse the Caribbean in search of her children. The bravery displayed all for love, really left me feeling hopeful. In the Author’s note Shearer said her “aim in writing this novel was to bring to life a story about the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery.” I think the author walked a very fine line in making a topic that is so oppressive, hopeful, she gave us a protagonist we could cheer for, cry with and who will remain with us for a long time.

The book opens with Devon King getting called out at work for not being a team player and never taking part in any of the company’s activities. The company is hosting a baking competition, and while this is not at the top of Devon’s must do list, he still needs to take part in company activities if he ever wants to make partner. Taking the bake off a little too seriously, he sets out to hire his brother’s girlfriend but she is not available so Reba, is who he’s got to go with. Reba met Devon at his brother’s wedding and since then she’s been crushing on him, sending him memes, messages that he never replies to… that is until he needs help with this baking competition. Reba’s main goal is to make Devon fall for her, or at least throw him out off his game. Devon’s main goal is to win the baking competition and not have Reba ruffle his feathers. Who will win or will both lose? I breezed through this book while laughing out loud, fanning myself at the spicy scene and truly enjoying these characters getting to know each other.

We waited six years for the author to write her second book and trust me when I say, this did not disappoint. As with her first book, Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ tackles a subject matter that is current, real and with characters you cant help but to fight for. In  A Spell of Good Things  we are taken to a city in Nigeria where we meet two families from different social and economic backgrounds. We meet Eniola’s family, who were lower middle class, things were going great for them, until his father was made redundant from his job. The family lost everything, their car, house, and access to education. His parents are behind on his school fees and each day that they don’t pay, he gets beaten by the school principal. The landlord is knocking at their door threatening to throw them out on the street. With Eniola’s father not doing anything, he decides he must make some very hard choices. Wuraola comes from a wealthy family. She is a medical doctor currently doing her residency, always tired, suffering in the public hospital, paying her dues. Her childhood friend and boyfriend propose as a way to join the family together. She is unsure of the proposal but goes along with it because both families are happy. There are some red flags she ignores, in the hopes of not reaching thirty and being unmarried. Things begin to crumble when these red flags won’t let up. Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ is a stellar writer there is no denying it. This is not your happy novel, she unflinchingly takes us to a town in Nigeria and shows us how the wealth gap lead to persons doing things they wouldn’t usually do. It is a hard novel to read but there is a sense of hopelessness but I think we need literature like this. The ones that makes us sit with difficult things. The writing is beautiful and I cannot recommend this enough....more",Notes are private!,0,92,2,"Oct 02, 2023Feb 10, 2023","Oct 10, 2023Feb 12, 2023","Sep 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57834285-a-spell-of-good-things

Hungry G Atmospheric, immersive, un-put-down-able, truly impressive storytelling from a Caribbean voice you will want to hear from again…and again….  Hungry Ghosts  opens with four boys doing a blood pact that will make them brothers for the rest of their lives. Do they know what this pact means? How will it impact their individual lives? That is exactly what we find out in this book. Set on the island of Trinidad and Tobago in the 1940s we are taken to the Barrack, a community that lives in poverty, no running water barely able to make ends meet but proud people. Overlooking Barrack is the Changoor Farm where Marlee and her husband, Dalton lives in a big house that is taken care of by three men. Dalton is known by the community to have a lot money but no one knows where it comes from. Marlee, lives in the house and hardly interacts with anyone from the community so rumours are made up about her. One day Marlee wakes up and her husband is nowhere to be found. She starts getting messages and death threats. In an effort to protect herself, she hires one of the men from the Barrack to be a guard at the house until her husband “comes back home”. Hans, the new watchman for Marlee is faced with a lot of choices- take the job in order to make enough to get his family out of the Barrack, or continue to live simple life… his choice leads to immeasurable consequences.  A corbeau will always be a corbeau, hated by the world that it will eventually eat… Kevin Jared Hosein is an expert storyteller, how he is able to tell nuanced story rich with history, and explores classism, racism, religion, traditions, jealousy, love and violence is truly magical. Hungry Ghost is rich in atmosphere, you feel like you are transported to Barrack and immersed into the lives of the people there. You get so invested in how the story will go and that all goes back to Hosein’s writing. The writing in this book is absolutely impeccable, the characters’ stories are told with care and deeply tender. You feel for each character and you recognize that they are each going through so much and I loved that the author made them characters we could relate to. There is a lot of strong themes happening in the book and generally that is hard for an author to explore each and do it justice but Hosein was able to do it expertly. We had coming-of-age, love, poverty, classism, religion and racism well explored- each leaving you with food for thought. I also loved how truly authentic the book felt- you were taken to the island of Trinidad and Tobago during the 1940s and you feel that through the writing and research done. In the author’s note he said,  “Fifteen years ago, my own stories were set in places I had never visited… The few Trinidadian stories I had written felt painstaking and derivative, embarrassingly littered with footnotes attempting to explain what is a corbeau… I wanted to write a book that not only electrified but was also more than its plotline and its characters- that could be a portal to the Caribbean, even at such a dark time of Trinidadian history.”  I truly cannot recommend this book enough.

If I Survive You  is a collection of interconnected short stories told from a Jamaican family living in Miami. While it is a collection of short stories, it does read like a novel because each story connects and move the plot along, while being told from the point of view of different family members. We meet Christopher (Topper) and Sanya, both were born and grew up in Jamaica in the 1950s, they met and fell in love but with the political turmoil they moved to Miami with their son Delano and end up having another son- Trelawny while in Miami. With a loan from his father, Topper opens a landscaping business, business begins to boom after Hurricane Andrew but not enough to combat the recession. The family topples over when Topper heads to Jamaica after the death of his parents and in a moment of weakness- make a decision that impacts his family greatly. Topper and Sanya separates, Sanya gets Trelawny and Topper ends up with Delano. With the family falling out, we see how this impacts each member uniquely…. But also, this book is so much more than that. We meet Trelawny who is constantly having an identity crisis- he doesn’t look or sound Jamaican, he looks Dominican but cannot speak Spanish and Black people don’t know which box to put him in. He doesn’t understand his Jamaican father and wishes he could call the island home. Delano is his father’s son- he decides to skip University and with a loan from his father he opens a business but while he got a strong start in life, ended up with a wife and two children- with the second recession will he end up like his dad? Sanya decides she is done taking care of men and wants to live her life now. Topper, isn’t sure what is next for him but he still wants to find for his marriage. We meet characters who are going through it. I think what I enjoyed most about this book is the writing. I am blown away at how distinct each POV is- it is unmistakable who is narrating their chapter because of the writing and storytelling. There were moments when I literally was laughing out loud- and being insanely sad because it feels as if each character just cyan ketch a little break.I think at the heart of this book is the humanity, each character wants to be better, to be change, to have a better way but they are living in a country that is not for them and it feels the deck is always stacked against them. We meet a father who failed, who is fathering a son he doesn’t recognize or cannot seem to read. We meet a son who constantly struggles to fit in, to know he is and what is his place in the world.I am not going to lie- Topper must be the most hilarious character I’ve read in a long time. The man had the HOWLING with his one liner. If you loved  Mr. Loverman  and the main character then you are going to eat Topper up. He may not be as loveable as Barrington but one thing is for sure, he is HILARIOUS. This book is written with so much heart, it is nuanced, fresh, engaging and offers so much food for thought. I want everyone to read this book.

We get a glimpse into history and I think that is what I enjoyed a lot about this book. You are transported to not only what is happening in South America but also the world. Isabel Allende is an expert storyteller and she reminds us of this with Violeta. If you love a story that is character driven, well written and well… sweeping, this is definitely the book for you! ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jun 09, 2022","Jun 18, 2022","Jun 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57933338-violeta

In  The Garden of Broken Things  we meet Genevieve, originally from Haiti she left at an early age to live in the US. She studied hard and started working as a therapist. While in school she met her husband and now father to her two sons. After years of philandering Genevieve finally decides to “leave” him but the pain remains fresh and she cannot seem to shake him. She should go to therapy for it, but do therapist go to therapy? Added to her fail marriage, Genevieve’s son Miles starts acting out, in order to teach him a lesson she decides to take him to Haiti to show him what his life could be like if he doesn’t shape up. Nothing could prepare Genevieve for the decision that will shake the core of her life. While visiting Haiti she reconnects with family and friends, and tries her best to stay present even though she remains haunted by the things of the past.I read Momplaisir’s first book and I made a note to read their sophomore novel and I can definitely say I am happy I did. I don’t think any book written about the earthquake in Haiti will be an easy read but this one was particularly hard. There was an undercurrent of hopelessness and sorrow that I didn’t shake even after finishing the book.

The collection is the perfect mix of fantasy, magical realism, dystopian and surrealism- when they say this collection is a mixed bags of chips, believe it, but also know there is a story in this collection for you. Themes of grief, loneliness, desire, love, regret and aging are expertly explored in a clever way.

A teenager who starts growing wings on her heels, her friends aren’t sure what the next step (or flight should be) perfect examination of coming-of-age and the magic of that time. We meet a woman who becomes obsessed with trying to sleep, but rest eludes her. Then there is a couple who spent millions on a machine that rebuilds your body and uploads your consciousness after you die so you can come back… this couple spends their time committing suicide and killing off each other but never talks about it. Then there is a girl tied to a chair, blindfolded in the middle of a theater as her lover performs certain acts on her with a scissors, the girl’s only rule is that no one is allowed to touch her except her partner…what happens when the audience starts lining up?

I’ll be honest, this was more of a memoir than I expected. I thought it was be more about theology, Black Women, Feminism, how she viewed God, and how she grappled with her faith. I wanted more of a theology and deep dive into her faith, the Bible and what it means to be a Black Millennial Woman of faith. Some of the essays I read, I took like a step back and thought, “this sounds like blasphemy” but maybe I need to sit with that and explore why I think it such and what work I need to do and how much of the Bible I need to explore. Don’t get me wrong, the essays were well written and highly engaging, but I felt she would make statement and not explore them. It was more, “I believe this…” but didn’t show us how she came to this reasoning- giving us a biblical look into why. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the essays, I still do not know exactly what Red Theology means or should be, maybe I just really wanted more theology.

We are thrown into the world of Claude McKay whose parents left him with his grandmother at a very young age and never returned. Claude’s world is his grandmother and her friend Paul who lives with both of them. He lives in Chicago and is currently battling the pressures to stay in school and not be deterred by the violence around him. That fails when there is a major to throws his world off course. Honestly, there is a lot happening in the book. Some parts felt unfinished but on a whole I felt the writing was immersive and honest in a way I will remember. Being in the world of a young black man from South Side Chicago who is raised by his grandmother because his parents abandoned him- well, I kinda didn’t want to leave- I wanted to cheer for him so very bad! I also love how hilarious some moments were… I genuinely loved how the characters were jumping off the page- specifically Paul and Claude’s grandmother.

This is going to be the darling of millennial reads this year and trust me, you will not be disappointed. If you are a fan of Sally Rooney, Brandon Taylor’s REAL LIFE, MY YEAR OF REST AND RELAXATION and SORROW AND BLISS you are going to absolutely enjoy this beautifully, well done debut novel. HOW TO FALL OUT OF LOVE MADLY  is told from the perspective of Joy, Annie and Celine- millennial women working and living in a city trying their best to hit their fantom life goals that was pressed on them by society. Joy and Annie are friends and roommates living together but still aren’t able to cover their rent even though they hold down steady jobs that they enjoy doing. In an attempt to keep their rental, they decide to get third roommate and in walks Theo who charms them and becomes a part of their home life. After months of hinting Annie’s boyfriend finally ask her to move in so the trio now becomes a duo, but Joy doesn’t mind because now she’s got Theo to herself. Joy starts spending a lot of time with Theo and ends up falling for him, only for him to show up a few weeks later with the most stunning woman Joy has ever seen and introduces her as his girlfriend. Joy is shook but figures if she puts her best foot forward he will miraculously fall for her. Celine has been told all her life she is stunning but doesn’t really believe it. Yes, she’s reaped so many opportunities because of pretty privilege but she still doesn’t feel confident in herself. Annie moved in with her boyfriend, she thinks this is what she wants but finds herself putting on this “easy breezy cool girlfriend” act that she may not be able to keep up. She wants commitment, but does she want it from her boyfriend? Relatable, entertaining, fully and unforgettable the lives of Celine, Joy and Annie examines what it can be like for a millennial woman dating, looking for love and to grow in their career. A lot the scenes in this book was so relatable and cringy I could feel myself getting secondhand embarrassment from it. Yes there were some insanely frustrating moments, especially how the women were treated by the men- I actually wanted to SCREAM but I guess that goes back to how well written this book is. We see how these women grapple with the stage they are in their lives- the need to grow in their career, be closer to their family, to get more money and to be hit those societal markers. A novel I won’t soon forget.  One time I had a friend say that if a man says something mean to you about your body it’s like a hate crime. At first, I thought that was stupid, reckless even, but I know what she meant.   Work hierarchy in generally was something she found to be unnecessary cruel, and so when she had the chance she would do her best to rebel against it  I think something you have to remember is that people bring everything with them to work and they try to hold everything away.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Mar 19, 2022","Mar 27, 2022","Mar 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58885789-how-to-fall-out-of-love-madly

I think she perfectly details what it is like being the only Black woman in certain spaces, especially in the fashion industry. Danielle Prescod grew up Black in an overwhelming white community, a lot of her identity was shaped based on the media she had access to which was predominantly white. We see how the media she engaged with shaped how she saw the world and herself and I think it was very jarring at times to read.

When I picked up this book, I thought it was supposed to be a memoir about Ira Mathur’s life. I was so intrigued to find out more about how she left India with her parents and ended up in Tobago and all the various things that would have gone in place to make that happen. There aren’t a lot of literature (I find) written from an Indian person whose families weren’t indentured laborer but decided to leave Indian to start a new life in Tobago.Let me tell you what I enjoyed about this book – reading about Ira’ family, specifically her Grandmother, mother and sister. Yes, she gave us a raw look at the family drama, the fights and unpleasant things that took placed behind closed doors. I loved reading about their life in India and how they ended up in Tobago. I felt that part of the book was truly interesting. Yes, I felt there were so many unanswered question family wise- why didn’t she get along with her sister? What’s up with her parents currently? How did they afford to send her to colleges? Her brother’s family. Then again, there is only so much you can fit in a memoir. Here is what I didn’t like… how the book felt like a 200 page name drop of “I spent a weekend with Derek Walcott and he looked at my manuscript” honestly….that part was confounding. Why did it feel like 20% of the book was a biography of Derek Walcott’s life and his beef with VS Naipaul? Also I didn’t need the BTS of your manuscript critique- I wish the story focused more on Ira and her family and her journey. Also her relationship with her husband it was… for lack of a better word… WEIRD. I felt there was an under current of being abusive but the author did not come right out and say it. I felt his family seem like they would throw her out any time she steps out of line. Also, I wanted her to talk more about her career because she fact that her husband was well off but she was told she needed to work… man….I finished this book having more questions than answers.

Each story covers themes of love, lost, regret, heat-break, redemption and desire. From the musician who is faithful and will do everything except get married, to the childhood friends turn lovers who reunites after years of playing around, to the man who cheats on his wife and having to deal with the consequences, to the guy who calls the girl on a her wedding day and tells her not to get married. All of the characters are layered, deeply flawed, beautifully human and you cannot help with fall in love with them. Here's how I know Garricks is a master storyteller, they are able to write a robust story in less than ten pages and I did not once think, “I want more..”.

The book is told from the point of view of three friends who met in college in Nigeria who are reuniting for the first time in over 30 years as one of their daughters prepares to be married. We hear from: Funmi lives in Lagos in the lap of luxury. She married rich, but her husband is constantly busy and doesn’t really take her on. With her daughter’s Destiny’s wedding coming up, she is excited to throw the wedding of the century. Enitan met a man who was on a mission trip and decided to elope and go with him to America. Years later they are getting divorced, she is raising their daughter Remi, and they have a contentious relationship but it is clear they love each other. Enitan is happy to be returning home to Nigeria after years of being away. Zainab is reserved and the most understanding of the group. She got married very early to her teacher against her father’s wishes. Her husband met in an accident and now she spends all her time taking care of him. He is secretly resentful and she doesn’t know how to move forward. All three women after catching up after years of trying to figure out life apart. Funmi, Enitan and Zainab all are struggling with how to show up as their true self with the hand they were dealt during life. Destiny’s wedding brings for them a reckoning moment. I enjoyed this book. The title is a bit misleading because, we hardly heard from Destiny but I guess her wedding was a pivotal moment. The book does an exceptional job of explore friendships, mother-daughter relationships, love, regret and loss.

Amanda recently had a miscarriage- she knows she is not pregnant- yet her body and brain tells her otherwise, she is diagnosed with a rare, mysterious condition called pseudocyesis. This is where her body shows she is pregnant, she feels pregnant but is not pregnant. It is hard for Amanda to go through this, and she is unable to connect with her husband who recently found God starts believing they are having a faith pregnancy. Amanda turns to a neuroscientist Patrick for help with her condition….. but maybe Patrick is a little too helpful. Patrick recently went through a traumatic experience and so did his wife, Marissa.

THE FULLNESS OF EVERYTHING opens with Winston receiving a telegraph (yeah… I don’t know what that is either) from his mother in Jamaica telling him his father is about to die and he needs to come come. Winston left Jamaica over 25 years ago and never returned any communication from his family, he is actually shocked that they know where to find him. With his personal life in shambles and a lot of unfinished business to clear up with his family, particularly his father he decides to go back home…after 25 years. What Winston encounters upon returning back home, shakes his entire life. He finds his father on his death bed, but still cannot bring himself to forgive him for all the abuse he inflicted on him and his mother while he was growing up. His mother is still taking care of his father and his brother holds a lot of resentment towards him for being left behind. What he never imagined was finding out he’s got a much half sister that his mother is taking care of. Winston is overcome by all this and doesn’t know how to process it. Can he forgive his father before he dies? Will his brother forgive him? What will happen to his half sister? I LOVE a good family drama and Powell kept me intrigued for the entire book. I wanted to know what would happen, does this person get to be forgiven? Will this family heal? The book was beautifully written and believable. The characters were not likeable but you get to look pass their flaws and accept them for who they are. I particularly love how the author dealt with the theme of forgiveness- it was not contrived but realistic and I appreciated that.

Neruda on the Park explores the age old question of “where is home”, is it a place? What is it?  Home, she told herself, could be a place, a person, a feeling, at times, a profession, the end result of a long pursuit. A fluid thing, for sure, but precious. I absolutely loved reading this book and I think a lot of people will enjoy it as well. In Neruda on the pack we meet the Guerreros, they have spent majority of their lives in Nothar Park, home to mostly Dominicans in New York. One day they wake up to see demolition taking place and a new condo being built. You know that this means… the neighbourhood is about to change. Eusebia who came from the Dominican Republic with her husband Vladimir wants to fight the development, protect the people she’s come to know and love. Their daughter Luz, a budding attorney finds there are some benefits to the neighbourhood changing, it means she doesn’t have to go all the way into the City to do hot yoga (yay). Vladimir on the other hand, wants to take the payout and leave for his home in the Dominican Republic and retire there. A lot of people will be affected, some will have to leave home, to find their true home. A well crafted tale about gentrification, agency, mother-daughter relationship and what it means to call a place home. The author does a great job of telling a well thought out story, and I loved that she told the story from the POV of the Luz and Eusebia. We get a deeper look into their motivation and how they justify their action. This is a such a great story about community, how coming together with one goal can lead to a victory.

The Island of Forgetting  is Jasmine Sealy’s debut novel and what am stunning debut this is! The novel starts out in Barbados in the 1960s and goes until the early 2000s. Similar in structure to HOMEGOING each chapter we are introduced to a new family member and the story picks up with them, but we do get a look at those who narrated previously. The book opens in Barbados in 1962, we meet Ipateus who is roaming the street, he cannot seem to return home after witnessing the death of his father at the hands of his brother and mother. The guilt and fear won’t let him rest, how can his brother and mother expect him to carry this secret around? In his restlessness he meets a girl who stares into his soul, and he ends up having a child- Atlas. Atlas has big dreams- having never met his father, he relies on the kindness of his Uncle Cronus and cousin Z. He does he work, and plans to move abroad to England once he finishes his exams but life as other plans for him. Fast forward to a decade later and Atlas is married with a daughter called Calypso and along with his wife they run the family hotel in Barbados. With tourist coming in and out, the island starts developing, people are looking to come and take the island and it’s people for all they are worth, how will Atlas protect his only child and his only income? There is a lot happening but the story does not wavier and leave you uninterested at any point. Themes of mental health, defered dreams, regrets, colonialism, colorism, colonialism, belonging, love, coming of age, exploitation and climate change are explored in a nuanced way. The author did a brilliant job of not just telling you but SHOWING you how these different themes continue to plague the family generations alter. You know an author is great at their craft when every single point of view switch feels real, authentic, layered and nuanced. Every time there was a new chapter and we got introduced to a new character narration, you could feel the shift in tone and voice. This goes back to strong writing skills. I would recommend going into this book without reading the blurb.

I didn't drown; I was the water""- Jo Nketiah  Also...the the title was a dead giveaway. This book is being marketed as a mash up of Transcendent Kingdom  and  A Man Called Over  and I think its doing the book a disserve, I think this  Open Water  and  Transcendent Kingdom  had a baby...  The Selfless Act of Breathing  would be the child. This is my way of saying... it's a beautiful child that you MUST READ! This is such a beautiful debut, Bola has a way with words where they get under your skin, and stay there. I was so moved by how the author handled Michael story, it was nuanced, fresh, engaging, and truly beautiful, I think everyone should read this book. We meet Michael, a young teacher at a high school in London. He is loved by his students, his co-worker enjoys his company, his best friend loves him, he still lives with his mother and can barely save enough after he gets paid. While he is doing was well as can be, for a long time he's felt like he doesn't have the will to go on. He continues to push through those feelings- even when his mother brings home the pastor and asks for his blessing for them to get married. After a traumatic experience, things finally pushes him to leave it all behind... and that's where the story starts, with these lines, ""I quit my job; I am taking my life savings, $9,021, and when it runs out, I am going to kill myself."" With an opener like that, prepare for the unexpected. To leave London, head to LA and all over the USA... but what happens when the life savings runs out? Well... read to find out. I cannot wait to read what Bola writes next. Loneliness is a topic I feel we don't talk a lot about and Bola did it with heart and nuance. Michael experience is so layered, being a Black teacher in London, from Immigrant parents, being raised by his mother who expects so much of him, including going to church regularly. I really did not want the book to end. What a beautiful read.Below are some of of the quotes from the book I absolutely LOVED!  We fight to be seen, for the world to know that we are here, only for us to be forgotten, to be invisible once again.  Have you ever loved, knowing it would end, but giving your whole heart regardless?  She loved books in a different way than I; they brought her back into the world but helped me escape.  The thing about losing love is makes you feel like you can never love again, like you are not worthy.  It reminds him of the Caribbean restaurants in Dalston or Tottenham High Road, and how there's always something endearing about the way the servers behind the counter never smile at you, or the way they tell you, ""we nuh ave that,"" and yet you keep coming back because you love it.  Loneliness is being there for everyone, everyone, in the hope that someone will be there for you. But no one ever is. You are the sun, lighting the world of another, while setting yourself on fire.  And above all, it is love, that spark of bright light, that dazzling flame, ephemeral or eternal, may it find us, may it be us, the will that carries us forward, the bond that brings us back, from beyond this lonely feeling to healing; the selfless act of breathing.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Oct 30, 2021","Oct 30, 2021","Oct 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56898266-the-selfless-act-of-breathing

This is an intelligent look into the life of a 75 year old woman whose lived a very full life. I cannot get enough of books written from the perspective of older women who are still living their very best lives! Honestly, too often we read books about older women and they are dowdy, grandmothers filled with regrets... this is the opposite of our main character. While she is almost 75 she's lived a full life, she's got a lot going for her, independent, and spunky without being a stereotype. This is such great story, written with care, love and intelligence. If this is not on your reading list... IT SHOULD BE! Deep down, I know that my desire to return home comes from nostalgia than genuine longing to return. I no longer organize by books alphabetically, or arrange them by colour of spine, which was what I used to do. Now the books are arranged according to which characters I believe ought to be talking to each other. That's why Wide Sargassi Sea sits directly above Jane Eyre.

As reader, I LOVE the backstory about our main characters and that is exactly where Yanique took this love story. You get to see how and why they behave they do and if they are perfectly suited for each other. I will say, because of this technique I was more invested in the back story than the actual love story. I wanted to know more about the father and why he insisted on having his ex white girlfriend photo on the family wall. I wanted more information on Stela's mom second husband and her life after Martin. So much is explored in this book, racism, religion, immigration, love, forgiveness, marriage, unfaithfulness and regret. I really enjoyed how religion was dealt with, we see Evangelical dating taking place, how growing up in the church changes you and how you change after leaving the church. I think the novel could have benefitted from be more direct, it felt a bit all over the place in certain parts.

From there, her life turns upside down in her quest to find out who her father is. Anna is in the process of getting divorce after finding out her husband was cheating on her for months. Added to that, her mother who did not have a strong relationship died, her only daughter moved out and she is living alone trying to decide on her next steps. This gets decided for her when she finds the diaries of her father, she knows nothing about. Her father is the President (possibly dictator) of an African country, and he is still alive. After weeks of research, she finds out more about her father… that he is a tyrant and he doesn’t know she even exists. With a one-way ticket to Africa, Anna places her freedom and past before her… what could possibly go wrong? Honestly, as much as this was a slow burner, I really enjoyed the read.

Perfect exploration of sisterhood! In Leila Aboulela’s  Bird Summons  we meet three women who are going on a road trip to the Scottish Highlands for a week. What could possibly go wrong? On the road trip is Salma, Moni and Iman. They all decided to go when everyone in the Muslim Women’s ground decided to pull out… out of sheer pettiness Salma decided she is going, just to show everyone who pulled out, Moni and Iman decided to join here. Salma has it all together (at least on the outside) she’s got the perfect husband and children who are doing great in their respective field. Salma feels unfulfilled, like she is losing a piece of herself, her children feels foreign to her and for the first time in a long while she feels she chose the wrong man to married. Added to this Salma recently contacted by her first love… she’s spending so much of her time wondering “what if…” Moni can barely hold it together. She’s shut everyone, including in her husband out to take care of her disabled son. She quit her career in banking to stay home and take care of her son, she is martyr who no one seems to appreciate. She decided to go on the trip, leaving her son in a nursing home, the guilt eats her up… but it feels so good to not have the responsibility… what to do when her husband calls and asks her to choose- her son or him. Iman is in her twenties and already in her third marriage. She is beautiful even through she pretends she doesn’t know it. Everyone wants to have some sort of ownership to Iman, people want to be her friend, men want to make her their wife… she is constantly at the wimps of other people, she just wants to be free! She’s never worked a day in her life… Her freedom comes so unexpectedly she is thrown and doesn’t know what to do. All three are on a roadtrip that will change their lives completely!Honestly, I wanted more of this book, I did not want it to end. I felt the author did such a beautiful job of making each character so strong and nuanced. With each character you feel like you are the only person they’ve ever let into their lives, and you feel like you never want to leave. I particularly loved how the themes of sisterhood, duty, regret, freedom and autonomy was executed.

When you pick up a book and this is the dedication you know you are in for an emotional, moving, tender and brutal read.

I also feel like nothing could prepare me for the read. I think the author did such an amazing job in telling these stories with care. It was never trauma porn.

Erna Mullings spends majority of her life growing up in rural Jamaica with her grandmother, grandfather and her four siblings. Her mother decided to leave her children back in Jamaica so she could go make a better life for them in England and then send for them… I know, you’ve read this story before, right? (Spoiler alert: you haven’t!)Being the eldest means Erna basically helps her Grandmother and Grandfather in raising her siblings. She’s got to focus on school and being a part time mother to her siblings. One day her siblings are suddenly taken away by their father and Erna is left with her grandparents who are getting older and slower with each year. Erna does not have a relationship with her mother or her father but after the sudden death of her grandmother she is sent to England to be reunited with her siblings and her mother. Nothing could prepare Erna for being in a new country, being around a mother who never showed her warmth and reunited with her siblings who don’t really remembers her. Erna must now take the mother role again… but how will that change with her being in England? First let me say, this is a very engaging read once you get pass the first 3 chapters. I felt the opening wasn’t as strong as it could but it really picked up. With that said, I also feel like the book could have been 50-70 pages shorter. At some points the book felt overly written and I found myself going… MOVE IT ALONG!!!! Outside of that, Erna is a character you cheer for from beginning to end. You want her to win! I felt the author did such a beautiful job of capturing Granddaughter and Grandmother relationships and she truly made me miss my Granny. I felt she had a strong grasp of the Grandmother and Erna as a character and she executed flawlessly. This book is for anyone who maintains a great relationship with her Grandmother and love seeing it on the pages. This is a coming of age, we meet Erna from she is nine or then and the story goes into her late twenties. So much happens within that time, her grandmother dies, she leaves the only home she’s ever known, she lives with a mother she’s got no connection to, and she finds out her father raped her mother and that’s how she was born. Yes! So much trauma is there… so much! One of my biggest peeves was how the mother’s rape was glossed over. It actually infuriated me. I also felt the author didn’t explore with any tenderness or nuance what is like for Erna to find out about the rape and then meet her father who have about 30 children… I mean… what?I know it sounds like I didn’t enjoy the book… I did. I also will read what the author writes next. I just wish she had a stronger editor who would have pinpoint areas that needed to be explored more or maybe even left out… Overall a very solid debut novel, yes, its got a lot of issues but I know I will not forget Erna for now....more",Notes are private!,1,26,2,"Oct 04, 2021Jun 27, 2021","Oct 26, 2021Jun 30, 2021","Jun 27, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/57514774-the-day-i-fell-off-my-island

The Bread the Devil Knead is set in Trinidad, we meet forty-year-old Alethea Lopez who is the manager of a fashion boutique in Downtown, Port of Spain. Alethea does not get too close to anyone, and she does not have many friends. She is very independent and spends majority of her time and effort hiding her bruises she receives from her common-law husband. Alethea who goes by Allie has been with Leo, a failed, washed up soca artist who spends majority of his time drinking, doing low paying gigs and cheating on her. Anything can set him off, so she is constantly on eggshells around him. Why does she stay? Well, what other options does she have? She grew up with an abusive mother and was molested at an early age… life for Allie was never easy but she is making the best of the situation. While at work one day, a woman is shot and killed by outside the boutique. Allie finds out that woman was in an abusive relationship. This death hit closer to home for her, because she keeps imagining this is what may happen if she stays with Leo… but what are her choices? Lisa Allen-Agostini brings us a heroine that we cannot help but cheer for. We feel for her in so many ways and we want her to win. Themes of love, gender violence, racism, colorism, abuse and violence are thoroughly examined in this less than 300 page book. We get an honest look into the life of a woman who is not faced with a lot of choice and must figure out how to leave an abusive relationship. I spent less than a day reading this book because I just had to know what happened to Allie. I did feel like Allie could have gotten a bit of a let up, it was abuse after abuse after abuse… I mean.. wow. I did enjoy how Allen-Agostini write female friendship, it was truly a beauty to experience. I also felt the book wrapped up too quickly and I wish she had spent more pages examining Allie’s earlier life and what happened after she ran away from home. I felt there were a lot of plot holes and I kept wondering “how did she get here?” Overall a good read....more",Notes are private!,0,65,2,"Jan 23, 2022May 22, 2021","Jan 23, 2022May 30, 2021","May 22, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58203799-the-bread-the-devil-knead

In  How to Kidnap The Rich  we meet Ramesh Kumar, he grew up in the slums of the Old City of Delhi. He grew up being physically and verbally abused by his father who sells tea from a stall. One day a nun from a private school saw his potential and decides to tutor him. Ramesh soaks up all the knowledge because he knows that’s what is going to get him out of his situation.

On one exam Ramesh did so well, the son Rudi is place first in the country and propelled to celebrity status! Ramesh takes this as his sign, he is about to be rich and nothing will stop him. That is until… he get’s kidnapped with his cash cow! First let me say, this book started off extraordinarily strong, down to the dedication was laugh out loud funny.

He examine racism and classism in Jamaica by citing examples of things that happened recently- Usain Bolt being told to “go back where he comes from” #NeverForget . We read his open letters to James Baldwin and the impact he had on him. Family secrets and things you don’t talk about, love affairs and trauma. Being a gay man in Jamaica, how the writer’s white tears continue to be something he cannot shake and carnival in Trinidad- the “different type of energy”.

After finishing The Boys At the Harbour, I was moved to tears. I literally could not breathe reading what their life is like. Miller was able to give a realistic look into he lives of these boys, what they dreams are (yes, they have dreams) and how fluid their lives can be. I was transported to the Kingston Harbour, hearing the waves crash while I reasoned with them. WOW. What I loved was how Miller handled their stories with care, this essay was truly masterful. Jamaica wasn’t big, but there were so many different Jamaicas, that it was possible to live in the worlds that really had never intersected. Miller’s writing is perfection. His brain is brilliant.

As luck would have it, business Tito Fernandez was driving pass and offered Edie a ride. During the ride Edie tells Tito about his venture, and he decides to invest. Edie is a seasoned oil man, having worked in oilfields in Texas and South America. He knows how drilling for oil the luck of a draw and many men is spend years seeking that one lucky drill. After returning home to Trinidad hears the word on the ground is that Sonny Chatterjee’s estate is ripe for drilling. The only problem, Sonny is not interested, he wants to farm his cocoa, he wants to do what’s been done for generations in his family. After much back and forth, Sonny agrees to have Edie drill, but for one year, after that he will return to coca. With the oil secure, Edie must now find an investor who will take this fool’s luck investment…especially on the heels of the US market crashing…. In comes Tito, a businessman who comes from generation of wealth, only problem, after years of risky investment Tito’s funds is running low. After listening to Eddie’s pitch he is ready to try his luck, even after being advised oil is not the way, it is a fool’s errand. Eddie pushes forward in the hope that this risk will pay off big! In the rush to get fortune, Tito and Eddie risk it all, will it pay off? Friends! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, I was hooked from the very first page to the end. I absolutely loved being transported to 1920s Trinidad and Tobago when oil was now becoming a thing. I think the author did such a great job of writing characters who are believable and situation you can relate to. I could see why Sonny wouldn’t want to drill for oil- why switch from cocoa to oil? I can see why Eddie loves the rush of drilling and finding oil and I believe that this was Tito’s last shot at remaining wealthy. This is a such a great historical look into Trinidad and Tobago, and by extension the Caribbean during that time. How oil impacted the lives of every Trini. It was just so well done!I loved how the plot moved quickly and how immerse you were in the drilling aspect without it being too technical. I think she wrote community and characters really well. I felt like I was there waiting for the oil to spurt up. She really did a great job of tension and suspension to the very end. You literally will be rooting for Eddie and Tito down to the very end. I do think the ending wrapped up a little too quickly for my taste and I would have loved 50 more pages, but maybe that is me being greedy. This is a book I will not forget anytime soon.

In an effort to get her life together and deal with her past she shows up at a Catholic church for free therapy and is mistaken for someone looking for a job.

She is a character you hope will snap out of it, but understands why she cannot just “shake that feeling” she’s got anxiety and never ending panic attacks that sets her back daily. I think what got me was how sensitive the writer was in talking about mental illness and how it impacts others around them. I am still shaken about Gilda going to the emergency room Doctor and telling them “I cannot believe there is a skeleton inside me” and that is something I cannot even think about.

Addictive reading from a fresh new voice in Trinidad and Tobago literature landscape.  In Pleasantview foreword given by author Rachel Manley she says, “It’s my turn to suspect the mantle of Chekov, then Naipaul has now fallen to Celeste Mohammed.” When I read that line I literally wrote, “really?” because that is such a huge mantle for anyone to accept. I literally thought,  “Rachel Manley is setting me up, I am going to expect Miguel Street and be profoundly disappointed.”  Friends, I am here to report, that Rachel Manley was on SPOT with the  Miguel Street  comparison, Pleasantview was all that and MORE! WOW!Pleaseantview is a series of interconnected stories told from the perspective of different residents of the fictional town of Pleasantview, in Trinidad. Each story gives a diverse in-depth look into the resident’s lives but at the core of it, Mr. H seems to be a character that is involved deeply in Pleasantview’s running. These nine stories are distinct, engaging, fresh, jarring, realistic and unforgettable. We meet characters who are escaping from the prison in Bocas to be with his girlfriend being held captive at a local whorehouse. A young man forced to leave Matura, the turtle watching village to go Pleasantview for a better life, only to met up in trouble. There is Gail who wants to be a chef but finds herself as a kept woman for a Syrian man, she goes against the one rule of a kept outside woman- do not fall for the man- she falls hard in more ways than one. We meet Kimberley who is estranged from her Syrian father after he finds out she is a lesbian. She exiles herself in Barbados with her Soulmates With Benefits who keeps pushing her to come out. We meet characters who want to be good but so many opportunities forces them to be bad, we meet corrupt policemen, reader women, men marrying for green card, sons growing up fatherless, unfulfilled marriages- you meet all of these people and their battles at Pleasantview. Let me just say, this is hands down, one of my favorite 2021 Read Caribbean Release. I am blown away by how impeccable this book was. The characters were full formed, the plot was engaging and I felt the author did a brilliant job of giving you a bird eye’s view of this community. I literally feel like I was at the top looking down on them going about their business with all their troubles and secrets tagging along behind them. It is not every day you pick up a contemporary collection of stories set in Trinidad and you know that this is distinctly Trini. WOW. The use of language I think was spot on. The views and landscape of Trinidad was also impeccable. I loved how each character had a distinct voice internally and externally, it was beyond believable. There are so many things culturally that happened that was nuanced that was perfectly included in the stories. There is a darkness to these stories that gets under your skin and does not leave. Sometimes I felt the author went very dark, but I also thought it was a realistic look contemporary Trinidad. Themes discussed includes, prostitution, generational trauma, father-son relationship, racism, classism, poverty, religion and sexuality. Each story gives a snapshot of the reality of Caribbean life, this is not your sun, sea and sand look, it is way more than that.

Here, it comes with a community and a history but also with an immediate fear and a proportional rage at having to be so afraid all the time. And, make no mistake, white people: I am truly afraid all the time. Ben Philippe was born in Haiti, left at an early age to live in Canada with his parents and spent majority of his twenties in the US studying in NYC. In his first collection of essays  Sure, I’ll Be Your Black Friend  he details what life is like being the only Black person in different spaces. In his introduction he notes: Because of this wrinkle of having been born Haitian, raised Canadian, and having adopted America as my third home in adulthood, conversation both about and around race have always been a fixture in my life.  It is through these conversations and experiences he is able hilariously and soberly tell us about his life. We read about how he lived a plush life in Haiti, having gone to school with expats. He left at an early age for Canada where he had to assimilate to life in this cold, far away country. Of course, looking back he was able to see all the microaggressions and the ways in which he was discriminated against. Fast forward to moving to NYC and attending university, he is thrown into what life is really like for a Black man in America. I really enjoyed this book more than I thought it would. Ben Philippe’s writing is hilarious, self-depreciating without being cringy and truly vulnerable in moments when it needs to be. That is very hard line to walk and he does it really well. I am always looking to read more about the Haitian experience and I think this may have been the first book I read where someone was a Haitian of means who left the island on “their terms”. I loved his relationship with his mother, how he documents their early move to Canada and what finding a new community. I think what stood out for me also was how he detailed a breakup with his roommate who happened to be his best friend. It is not every day you get a male perspective how sad and heart breaking it is to break up with your other male friend. There is also the underlining of racism and power dynamics. Well executed!Yes, there were some moments/experiences he went over a lot and that made the memoir dragged a lot.

In  The Days of Abandonment  we meet a couple whose been married for over a decade with two children. One day the husband decides he wants to leave. The wife, not thinking anything of it, because he has made this proclamation as least three times before but always come back to his senses.

This book was worth the wait, when you read it, you will see why!In Imbolo Mbue’s sophomore novel  How Beautiful We Were  we are taken to a fictional village called Kosawa which is on the continent of Africa. Kosawa is home to the villagers who once live a simple life farming and living off the land. That is until an American Oil company called Pexton found oil close to the village and started drilling. Kosawa which was oncea fertile and thriving village is now home to children dying from toxic air and fumes. The land is barren and infertile, the river is polluted and water from the well can lead to death.The Pexton’s overseer comes with promises and reparations that are never fulfilled. Each year the Villagers sit listening to promises of what is going to happen, how Pexton will start assisting them but nothing happens until one night, the village Madman decides enough is enough. With one bold move from one Villager, they all decide it is time to fight back. No one can image the fight that awaits them. This is a story of fight, of greed, environmental awareness, poverty, corruption, activism, agency, colonialism and the cost of not having a voice. Told from the perspectives of Thula, her family and the children who grew up with her, we are giving an in-depth look into the history of Kosawa and Pexton and how the fight turned out. I loved that the author told this very heavy story from the point of views those who are not only involved but deeply impacted. Yes, this was a slow burn, and generally I would lose interest but having the change in narration and the author making the fight against this oil company the focus of the story kept me deeply invested. I need to know what happened. How will it turn out? Can a small village in Africa win against a huge American oil company? Who will hear their voice? How can one woman win this uphill battle? Will they lose interest? Will they forget about all the children that died because the government decided to hand over land to an oil company? Imbolo Mbue KNOW how to tell a story. She knows how to keep you invested and deeply interested. She is able to take you through a range of emotions that will not let up. She wrote these characters with care and dimensions. I particularly loved reading about the village history, customs and culture. How the Villagers interact with the world and people around them. I felt the author did a superb job of telling a convincing story through Thula. There is the ever-present folklore and culture that transcends and that for me was particularly well executed. Friends, I could GUSH about this book. The themes of love, marriage, education, death, allyship, what activism looks like. There is so much to talk about and dive into. Did I mention the writing was just *chef’s kiss*. I could go on and on, but what I will say is that book was worth the wait!

We meet three former enslaved persons, Buckram, Georgie and William who fought in the Revolutionary War against America. They were promised rewards once they returned to London but that did not happen. These three men returned to London in the 1780s with nothing and must now beg and scrape to make a living. We are thrust into London life in the 1780s, it is chaotic, ugly, smelly, hard and constantly changing. As a Black Man starting from scratch, life is hard. Buckram is back from spending time in jail, he meets up with his ex-soldiers who seem to be making an ok life for themselves. Buckram struggles to get back on his feet. When William hatches a plan that will take them out of their misery, they all fall for it… will this plan work? How will it change their lives? This is a tiny novel that packs in A LOT. It also references a place I cannot remember reading, especially from a Black perspective. I also cannot remember reading the experiences, albeit fiction, of Black man that fought in the war for Britain and what their lives turned out to be. I enjoyed getting the heads of the character and historical look at Britain at that time. I do believe the book could have benefitted from a stronger edit, somethings were a bit over the place and at times I couldn’t place exactly where we were. I also think the plot was fast and then slow in some areas and then wrapped so quickly. I wanted a lot more from the character perspective, each seem to be so unique and I felt we didn’t dive into William’s character enough.

This is a tiny book but it offers an in-depth look into the history of Ghana, the slave trade and how the lives of Ghanaian changed completely. There are some very heavy themes explored in this book.

I felt Corrinne was a believable and truly the heroine you want to cheer for. While I have often heard of these folklores, I cannot say I have read a children’s book that explores it so well.

Blain did an amazing job if editing the history of African America for over four hundred years, with over 80 contributors in the form of poem, memoirs, bios and essays. If you are looking for an in-depth look into African American history, this is definitely the book to start with. Topics covered include Black Lives Matter, The Great Migration, The Code Noir, Maroons and Maroonage, Black Power, Queer Sexuality, Racial Passing, The War on Drugs, Hurricane Katrina, Black Immigrants, Civil War, Anita Hill… just to name a few. This collection is solidly written and well researched. Every chapter offers information that forces you to learn and maybe unlearn the history you were taught. I highly recommend this one. Here are some things I learned:If Black people could prove their Christianity through baptism or marriage in the Christian church, as occurred in New Amsterdam, they might logically be exempted from slavery. In 1655 Elizabeth Keye petitioned the courts for her freedom and that of her new child- and thus became the first woman of African descent to do so in the English North American colonies. To this day, Black people remain the most Christian demographic in the country. Royal African Company (RAC) is responsible for transporting more African people to the America than any other entity.Germantown Quakers wrote the first petition against slavery every drafter by a religious group in the English colonies. I loved how Christopher J. Lebron explored how English Quakers saw slavery vs how German Quakers viewed and lobbied for freedom.Zora Neale Hurston was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study folk religions of Jamaica and Haiti. It was while in Haiti that she wrote in just seven weeks  Their Eyes Were Watching God, I particularly loved reading Robert Jones Jr. essay on Denmark Vesey- he answered Mr. West’s statement on why enslaved people didn’t just “leave”. KMT. I also enjoyed the conclusion to this historic read where Blain explored whether we are really our ancestors’ wildest dreams.

A daughter is a kind of psalm. You, in the world, responding to me, is a song I made. I cannot make another. In Kaitlyn Greenidge’s sophomore novel  Libertie  we are taken to Brooklyn where we meet Libertie and her mother Cathy a free Black practising physician. With the death of her father, Libertie is raised by her very strong mother who is known as a level-headed physician for Black people. With more enslaved persons taking their freedom her mother’s house gets fuller and fuller. While her mother’s dream is for her to become a physician like her, Libertie doesn’t think that is the path for her. This is a coming-of-age story about Libertie, how she views the changing world around her. This is what I would call addictive reading. I could not put this book down and when I did put it down, I kept thinking about it. I loved how well researched and developed the characters, especially the women were in this book. The theme of feminism, freedom, mental illness, mother-daughter relationship, colourism and passing were thoroughly executed. First let me say, I cannot remember reading a book where free Black Americans journey to Haiti to start a life. I really enjoyed how the author explored this in light of history, culture and religion. For Libertie who is a free Black Woman journeying to Haiti with her Husband who while he is Black, can also pass for white. There was so much to unpack and I think the author did such a superb job of showing us life in Haiti from a Black American perspective. We see how religion was weaponized and how Haitians who wanted to have an education had to give up so much. I wanted more of this. A free Black Woman Doctor living in Brooklyn during the time of slavery, I could not get enough of it. The historical look into this was well executed. I think I enjoyed all the experiments that were done and how herbs were used to treat those in need. I loved that the author took it a step further by showing that while enslaved people were free, the impact of being enslaved has lasting effects on their mental health. That for me, was so nuanced, heart break and deeply impactful.  Their bodies are here with us in emancipation, but their minds are not free  There is the theme of passing and colorism that the author executed on meticulously. Libertie is dark, while her mother could pass for white. We see the constant microaggression and biases towards Libertie because of her colour and how her mother was sometimes able to slide under the radar. I think what stood out for me was how Libertie was viewed because of her skin by other Black people. If you are looking for a book with strong mother-daughter theme, this is it. Greenidge writes this theme so convincingly and wanted more of it. How we see the mother through the daughter’s eyes and vice versa was just…. Wow!Overall, I really enjoyed this book. There was so much explored and at some points I wished the author had focused on just one thing but it all came together. I did feel sometimes the character motivation wasn’t fully convincing, case in point, Libertie running off with her husband. I also felt some of the storyline was tied up, but that could just be me. A solid read that I thoroughly enjoyed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,116,1,"Jan 17, 2021","Jan 26, 2021","Jan 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54110460-libertie

After I read  The Taste Of Sugar  last year and it was one of my favourite reads for the 2020. I wanted to read a lot more of her work, fast forward and I got to read  If I Bring You Roses .The book opens in a small mountainous town in Puerto Rico where Felicidad Hidalgo mother is going through a mental break down after having a miscarriage for the second time. She is taken away from her home to be observed and to work on her health. While she is gone, Felicidad must now drop out of school to care for her entire family. The work is endlessly and unrewarding, added to this is the sense of lack that is ever present. Her father decided to give one of his children a change and choose her. She was sent to live with his brother in a town nearby where she would have access to an education and a chance to study and make something of herself. She taught living with her richer uncle would change her situation, but it is a lot of work and she is always alone and feeling lonely. That is until one day a stranger walk into the cage she was working and asked her to go to the beach with him… a trip to the beach turns out to be a lot more than they both bargained for. Anibal Acevedo has been living in Chicago for a while and life in America is not what he thought he it would be. With his mother constant plea for him to visit Puerto Rico, he flies home to help his father with the harvest and meet the girl his month thinks would be perfect for him. While is perfectly comfortable with his bachelor life, all of that changes when he sees Felicidad. They have a quick wedding, he leaves for Chicago, she joins him later but nothing could prepare them for life as young newlyweds.First, I want to say the graphic team did this book so bad by giving it this gaudy cover. I’ve had this book on my list a long while and I did not pick it up because the cover was just so dreary and uninspiring. After cracking open the book, I was immediately immersed in the story and I wanted to inhale it. Marisel Vera is so great as writing a plot that makes you invested, that keeps you cheering for the character to the very last pages. I have such an affinity for stories written and told by Puerto Ricans, and I felt this one was a gem. It covers themes of love, family, colorism, poverty, immigration, race and identity. I really enjoyed Anibal Acevedo’s journey from Puerto Rico and how he experienced life in these two opposing countries. We see how differently he is treated, base on his race or the colour of his skin. How hard he works without rest, and him questioning whether the opportunity cost is worth it. Yes, I was not here for the extended look into Anibal’s sex life and how he is such a great lover… also the gender roles in this book really had me annoyed in some cases, but I am chalking it up to culture. I also wish we got more information on what became of Felicidad’s family back home. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Mar 09, 2021","Mar 14, 2021","Jan 11, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10138211-if-i-bring-you-roses

Mrs. Death Misses Death is Salena Godden’s first prose publication. The book is told in poetry and prose and follows Mrs. Death who is a Black Woman tired of doing this “job” she’s been doing since the beginning of time. In a near death experience, Wolf is saved from a fire and years later he is a struggling writer who ends up being the one to write Mrs. Death memoir. Wolf, who is no stranger to death finds it thrilling to be the one to tell the story of Mrs. Death. She takes him back in time, to places and major events that shaped her career. They both get to look at life through the lens of death, for the future, one thing is certain- death.  Let me start with the things I loved. The Title:  I mean, who does not love a great title? This one was so fresh and such great play on words.  The Premise:  I can say I have never read a premise like this. Death herself gets someone to write a memoir about her life. INJECT THIS IN MY VEINS! I mean seriously, how utterly original is this premise. Death as a Black Woman  Ok, so I know this was probably explored already somewhere but for me, personally, I have always pictured death as a man. I do not know why I thought death had to be a man. Also, even if I did picture death as a woman, I would not have picture her as Black or a Black married woman. I think for me, this was well executed by the author, dispelling the myth that death had to be a man.  The greatest trick man played was making you believe I was man. They erased me and made you all believe that Death was a male in spirit- the Grim Reaper. For surely only she who bears it, she who gave you life, can be she who has the power to take it. And there is no human more invisible, more easily talked over, ignored, betrayed and easy to walk pass than a woman; than a poor old black woman. Yes, this entire paragraph had me shaking my head so much, my neck hurt. I loved that the author put forward this very solid premise to build on.  Exploring death  Let’s be real, we are all going to die, yet, this is something I don’t think we talk a lot about. Or if we do it is generally clouded in fear. Death is the only thing we have surety about yet, as the book says, we don’t call it by name when it happens. We say, “pass on, passed…” anything but death. Without death, there is no life, and I enjoyed how the author was able to position death as something we should think about, maybe not harp on but at least think about. I liked that it is a troubled young writer who had experiences with people dying that got to have a friendship with Death. That for me really gave the theme the depth it needed.  The Writing  It is clear Salena Godden can write. This is my first introduction to her work, and she writes solidly. I have never read any of her poetry so it was great seeing a bit of it included in this book. She writes convincingly so much so, I started feeling sorry for Mrs. Death.  Historical Look  In the book Mrs. Death refers some deaths that made international news, or deaths that are still unsolved or you may not know about. I think getting a little history lesson within the book worked so seamlessly.  What I didn’t love  Above I gushed about how strong a premise this book had. When I see a strong premise not strongly executed it makes me sad, maybe even a little mad because I know with tighter edits and stronger editor the book would have been great.I felt the first 25% of the book was phenomenal, the writing, introduction of characters, scenes and Mrs. Death narration was flawless. Then, it all started to wane. Death in itself is a very board topic, it’s been happening since the beginning of time- there are so many ways to explore the topic and I think that’s where the author (maybe even the editor) may have went wrong, she tried to do entirely too much instead of keeping it tighter and more focused. At one point I was like, “huh, how dis even drop in yasso?!!” that for me was a little infuriating. While I didn’t absolutely love it, I know there are others who may enjoy it. I think one thing that really stood out for me was Mrs. Death saying,  I’ve often wondered how very different this living life would be if we were born with our expiry date stamped on our foreheads. I mean, if we knew exactly how long and little time we have left to love each other, maybe then we would be more kind and loving. Imagine if we knew our death date. How different we would live, maybe, and yes I know, maybe not.  Of course I well be reading more of what Salena Godden comes with next.

From flesh eating teenagers, to kids coming back who were gone missing for years, to Ouija boards, to a woman fetishizing about heartbeats, it is all there and well executed. Yes, some of the stories missed the mark for me, others made me go “mmmm, what’s that supposed to be about?” but then there are some that just did not leave.

It is such a brilliantly done YA novel that I could not put down or get enough of.  Off Track  is set in Trinidad and Tobago and is told from the perspective of two budding track and field teens- Kayla Francis and Joel de Freitas. Kayla has one goal- to do well in CARIFTA and make it to the Olympics. This goal will help greatly secure not just her future, but that of her mother and sisters. She sees the sacrifices her mother is making to ensure she stays in track, she cannot afford to fail. Joel is hailed as one of the country’s upcoming track and field star, the son of a former star whose light got dimmed too soon. Joel battles with abandonment issues along with insecurities that comes with being a golden boy. Both Joel and Kayla are training at the best facility with the best coach all paid for by the Government who expects them to win. Added to these unrealistic pressures is the fact that their home situations could derail their track dreams….This is my first time reading Gibson’s work and I can tell you it will not be my last. I really enjoyed this book. The characters felt real. The situations they were going through felt real and for the entire read I kept cheering for them to win. The book is set in Trinidad and Tobago and centers around track and field- one of my favorite sports- I really enjoyed reading about the training process and what goes into making a young track and field star.

In  The Year I Flew Away  w Being in America means I have a chance to reach my dreams, but if it weren’t for Haiti, I’d never even know how to dream. In  The Year I Flew Away  we meet Gabrielle a ten-year-old living with her parents in Haiti. The book opens and we are taken to a village with Gabrielle and her friends in the middle of a mango eating competition. Gabrielle won the competition and that same even her parents let her know she will be moving to America to live with her Uncle and his family. Gabrielle moves to New York but her parents have to remain in Haiti until a later time. Gabrielle must now adjust to life in New York, a new country, family, school and friends. She finds out that America is not an easy place to live, added to that she does not fit it. Gabrielle is constantly being bullied for her accent and where she is from. One evening she meets a witch who promises her all of this can change, she grants her three wishes… but, we all know witches be witching and things goes worse than Gabrielle can imagine. I honestly, enjoyed reading this book. Gabrielle is such a strong character that you WANT to see win. She is sincere and thoroughly entertaining. The author did such a great job of having strong characters alongside Gabrielle who were hilarious and beyond engaging. I think as a adult we can all see ourselves in a character who are looking to belong and have a community- this is a theme I never get tired of reading about. I loved that the author spoke about racism and how America really is, even in a YA novel. Yes this is YA and yes it is fantasy but it is so well done and deeply engaging.

I see a lot of s have done that, but I’ve decided not to because… it’s an entirely different book and I will treat it as such.  You are a people person in that the way that you get people. You see people. And, like, properly see people. You see us, you see who we all are, in our own way. And you don’t judge us for it. You don’t ask people to be who they aren’t. And I don’t think many people are like that, so, yeah.”  People Person  is Candice Carty-Williams sophomore novel and I truly enjoyed the experience of her taking us into the lives of the Pennington. If you read and loved  My Sister The Serial Killer  and  Mr. Loverman  I am almost sure you are thoroughly enjoy William’ latest book. The novel begins with Jamaican absentee father Cyril Pennington waking up one day and deciding it is time, albeit over ten years later that he introduces all the children that he know of and claims to each other. Yes, you read that right. Basically Cyril has five children (that he knows of) by four different women, but he’s never paid an active role in their lives. One day he decides it is his duty to introduce them to each other because they are at the age where they may be sexually active and he doesn’t want to be held accountable for them accidental well… committing incest. He visits the four homes and picks up the five children, takes them out for ice cream, drops them back and they never hear from him again. Before the siblings depart, the eldest Nikisha tells them that even though they may not be close, they can call her for anything because they are blood. Fast forward to a decade later and Nikisha’s phone rings, it is one of her siblings, Dimple, taking her up on her offer to help… Nikisha then calls all the other three siblings, nothing could prepare them for the “help” that Dimple needed. We see five strangers who are connected by blood come together under difficult circumstances and how that changed their entire lives. First let me say, I enjoyed reading this book. It had a cast of characters that were fresh, interesting, likable and also refreshingly honest. I would say, some of the characters are more developed than others and I did want to hear from them a lot more- specifically the dad Cyril, Lizzie and Nikisha. I do believe that there are certain parts of the book that were borderline unrealistic and had me thinking “dis nuh mek nuh for a sense…” but then I remember I am reading FICTION so where is the line right? I wish there was more thought put into how the siblings all came together it just did not ring as believable. I also found that some parts were also unbelievable but not as much as the initial meeting. I also feel like the author could not use the father dying to have them come together but... something else would have been more believable I guess.I loved how the author explored the theme of family, what it means to be family and belonging. It was done in a layered way, it showcased that families are and can be toxic. How the lack of a father in a child’s life affects how they see the world, their relationships and how they navigate difficult situation. I think because there were five siblings the author showcased how an absinthe father affects each differently and that I thoroughly enjoyed reading about. I need the author to write a book about the father Cyril. I felt myself leaning in a lot more when he was mentioned or when he showed up. He is such an interesting character and so very Jamaican. I felt I have heard and seen men like Cyril growing up and still to this day they are about. What I appreciated was that she didn’t just show that he was a wasteman, she showed WHY he was a wasteman and also clearly reminded us that sometimes people are in fact shit, or just don’t know how to be there for their children or have no remorse and just live their best life with zero regrets. I could do a case study on Cyril. What an unforgettable character. But then it just drives the feminist in me CRAZY! Overall, this is one book that I will remember for a long time. Parts were borderline unbelievable, other parts had me truly crying, the rest had me enraged and engaged, I would recommend you give this one a read....more",Notes are private!,0,121,1,"Apr 13, 2022","Apr 15, 2022","Dec 29, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52514822-people-person

Turnbull has matured in his writing and you will know it once you start reading this book. This book was truly atmospheric, you could feel the fear of the characters leaping off the page. What I love is how Turnbull is able to write characters that while they are flawed, you cannot help but cheer for them. He spends a lot of time building out his character, to the point where you become invested and immerse in their experience. This is an urban fantasy novel that goes through multiple point of views, between present and past but truly fast paced. There were some instances where I thought, “a wah gwan yasso?” “who dis again?” “where dis one from yah now?” but overall I was able to follow along and understand what was happening. I do think this book was very ambitious and could have benefitted from a tighter lens- a lot was happening at times and that made it hard to follow along. I think Turnbull was able to write a fantasy novel that truly captured diverse characters who were not one-dimensional without trying too hard. Representation matters and Turnbull was able to write characters I think a lot of people can see themselves in.

The Coldest Winter Ever  is fast paced, filled with drama (a whole lot) and is told from the very fierce perspective of the main character, Winter. There is A LOT happening in this book- A LOT. Some of them don’t make sense, and others just did not pan out and the author did not address it. Winter grew up in Brooklyn with her mother, father and sisters. Her father is a drug dealer who got busted and things went down in fast for her and her family. Also, how WEIRD is it that the author included herself in her own book… can we talk about that please? No seriously, I have read A LOT of books in my life and I cannot ever remember the author writing about herself, in her own book… I do not have the words…Overall, it was a wild read and I think I need to be a teen again to actually “appreciate” this book. With that said… I do want to read what comes next… I feel a bit invested…Seriously though… why did the author put herself in her own book? I need answers....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,Dec 2020,"Dec 03, 2020","Dec 01, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/106393.The_Coldest_Winter_Ever

WOW Deesha Philyaw’s collection of nine stories about church ladies is fresh, tender, biting, raw, deeply moving and just downright beautiful. I think there was a moment I was holding my breath while reading a story and I could only release after finishing. These stories beg to be read, and be read widely. In The Secret Lives of Church Ladies  we meet women and girls who are exploring their sexuality, while trying to be that “good girl”. We see where religion is ever present and how it is interpreted can lead to years of hurt. I think Philyaw did a superb job of exploring mother-daughter relationship in a nuanced way. These relationships are complex and never one dimensional. I love the theme of love and how it was executed, from those who are waiting for their love to arrive, to those not knowing what to do when they arrive. Every single one of these stories were flames!

I ain’t a animal… I know that when you trapped in a small place, you start getting used to being small. And people, they know too, and they start treating you like a small thing. Even if you big like you are. I have a lot of thoughts on this novel and I hope to get through them all. First let me say Robert Jones Jr. can write. I am blown away that this is his debut novel and I cannot wait to read everything he writes next. What a well-executed, perfectly done novel. In  The Prophets  we are taken to the 1830s on a plantation where two enslaved men Isaiah and Samuel are in love with each other but so much impede their love. Their goal is to have a bit of freedom, that is a lot to ask for as a Black man on a plantation. Themes of colonialism, identity, colourism, slavery, white privilege, love, motherhood, religion and revenge are perfectly executed. Yes, I will be the first to stand here and say that I am tired of reading stories about enslaved people and what they went through. Reading these recounts, while it is historical fiction still weighs me down. I finish these books feeling exhausted. So yes, nothing about this read was light- well expect for that one part in the book where a white man shit himself- that, that was hilarious!  I cannot say I have read a historical fiction set on a plantation that surrounds the love of two Black Men. It is already so hard being Black on a plantation, much less one where the enslaver is a religious zealot and there is the whole crab inna barrel mentality of the other enslaved people who cannot seem to let others have the little joy they can squeeze out in a very joyless world.  These were people after all. There was, therefore, some kind of happiness to be found in someone else being humiliated for once.  When I tell you the fear I felt for these men being found out was palatable and that goes back to how great the writing is in this book. There was the use of religion which was found throughout the book, through the naming of the chapters to the characters in the book, I felt it was impeccably executed. I enjoyed how the author explored religion in the context of a plantation. How religion was used to placate some, and used as a weapon against others. How the enslaved individuals responded to the religion of their enslavers was even more interesting. One aspect that I could not get enough of was Jones taking us to a remote village where white people arrived for the first time. I thought it was great that it was told from the view of the tribe members- we got such a unique look into their lives and customs and I wanted so much more from there.Yall… do you know white women been white womening since the beginning of time? I freaking loved how Jones explored how dangerous bored white women can be, especially on a plantation setting. I think Sara Collins did such a great job of doing that in  The Confessions of Frannie Langton  and to see it again and how it was done really wowed me. How identity was explored I felt was nuance and deeply moving. We hear from a Adam who is the son of the enslaver and an enslaved person. He walks us through what life on the plantation is like for him, how he wasn’t wanted and fit in anywhere. How lonely it was just existing in his skin. Beyond impactful. While the story surrounded Isaiah and Samuel, I loved how the other characters on the plantation got to tell their stories and move the plot along. I particularly loved hearing from Maggie and wanted to hear a lot more from her, but I know she had the potential to outshine the others. Yes, I did enjoy this book a lot but I felt at some points the book was a bit over written and I found myself thinking, “alright Jones, I get it you can write but move it along and tell me know wah guh happen next nuh!” There were a lot of characters and setting so it took awhile to get my footing, it would be great to an index of characters but that may just be me. I do think the book could have been 30-50 pages less but that may just be me. Last thing… the ending, it felt so rush…. So rushed! I can definitely see this being a favourite for a lot of people and I absolutely enjoyed it!

Black Buck is Mateo Askaripour debut novel about a Black man who joins the sales team of a start-up company. Twenty-two-year-old, Darren is a Barista at Starbucks, he is supposed to be going to college, as his mother remains him daily, but he is content just being a Barista. While he knows deep down being a Barista for the rest of his life is not practical, right now he wants to spend his time with his girlfriend, best friend and mother.

I felt the book started off really strong, I was invested, I needed to see how this opportunity presented to Darren turned out. From getting the job to the sales training, the author was writing fire! I did think the middle dragged a lot, entirely too much for my taste. It then began to spiral into the unlikely and ridiculous and I kinda wished his editor had reeled it in a bit. I also felt the book went on for much longer than necessary and a lot of the same conversations kept repeating. I think more time could have been spend dividing into Darren's character. I felt we didnt see him grieve certain losses. While I did not see the twist coming, I felt the character motivation was lacking- WHY would they do that? It is seemed so far fetched really. With all that, I still wanted to know what happened and how things turned out and that is a testament to the author’s writing, I was still interested!I heard the audio is really good.

Nnena’s father is Nigerian but she has never met him and her white mother hardly ever invites questions about him.

I generally don’t do this but I find myself reading scenes from this book to my friends- that is how funny the book is. This book covers themes of mother-daughter, identity, coming of age, race and acceptance. I think Nzelu did such a great job of taking us into the world of a teenager who is about to enter adulthood. Nnenna is such a layered character and truly believable in her quest to find out more about herself. Set in modern day Manchester this story is told from a cast of very interesting characters including Jonathon who went to Cambridge with Joanie and Maurice who is Nnenna’s dad. Through a series of flashbacks we get a look into Joanie and Maurice’s romance and what happened when she got pregnant. I particularly enjoyed hearing about Joanie and Maurice’s relationship dynamic. I cannot get enough of mother-daughter relationships and this book offers a unique look into such a loaded theme. I really wish that Nzelu spoke more from Joanie’s point of view of what it is like raising a biracial child in modern day Manchester. This is where I felt the author missed an opportunity. I also felt the plot could have been just a little tighter with the focus more on Nnenna and her private joys.

Since reading and enjoying Jennifer Makumbi’s  Manchester Happened  I have had a huge fascination with Ugandan history and culture, which is why I picked up this book because I wanted to learn more.  We Are All Birds Of Uganda  goes back and forth between 1960s Uganda and present day London. I am always a fan of stories being told in from different perspectives, especially when it is done in a way that we find out more about a family saga or history of a culture. It is the 1960s in Uganda and things are changing fast. Hasan is the owner of multiple businesses, things are going great but he continues to struggle with the death of his wife. Even married to his second wife and having numerous children, he still cannot shake the death of his first wife. Added to this the new regime is in power and his business and family life gets shaken to the core. Fast forward to present day London, we meet a descendant of Hasan, Sameer, who is young lawyer at the top of his game. He is comfortable, financially stable, lives in the perfect apartment and just landed the opportunity of a lifetime but everything gets shaken to the core when he receives news about his childhood friend. That leads him to quest what life is about, where he should be, what his focus is. He takes a trip Uganda and everything falls into place… or falls apart depending on how you look at it. If you want to know about Uganda and what took place when the regime gained power, I highly recommend you read this book. I think the author did a great job of showcasing the fear of what it is like living during the time of great upheaval. I particularly loved reading about present day Sameer, it was sad (but also realistic) that some of the racism his father faced, he ended facing was well.. years later. Honestly, this is a great commentary on race, religion, history, love and family.

In  Monogamy  we meet long time married couple Graham and Annie who are both living and working in Vermont. Graham can be described as a teddy bear who co-owns and runs a Bookstore. Annie is a photographer who is in the midst of putting together a show that could land her back on the market. This is both Graham and Annie’s second marriage, they have one child together- Sarah and Graham has a child from his previous marriage Lucas. They have been married for a long time and life is easy and comfortable, that is until one day Annie wakes up to find Graham dead.With the sudden death of Graham the family is scrambling to make sense of it all.

I do not know what I expected when I picked up this book but I can tell you, I am so happy I did. This book is well written, well executed with a plot and characters that will keep you going to the end! A House Wit No Angel  is Muli Amaye’s debut novel that offers a sweeping look into the lives of three women. The book goes between present day Manchester and Lagos after the war. The book is told from the point of video of Ade, Elizabeth and Kutes. Ade grew up in Nigerian with her parents on a compound. Her father is very big into politics and it is through his evening gatherings that she met and fell in love with an Englishman called David. She got pregnant and to not shame her family she runs away with David to England. Ade must survive on her own in a country that is cold in more ways than one. So many things are new to Ade including being a Black Nigerian trying to make a life in Manchester. Elizabeth is Ade’s only child who she had with David. Elizabeth got the call that her father is dead and she must now return to Nigeria to assist with burial. Elizabeth doesn’t know what to do next, between hiding her love affair with her childhood best friend Dia, having a daughter who she doesn’t understand and now the death of her father who didn’t really know- she is confused. Kuti is Elizabeth daughter, she doesn’t get why her mother and grandmother are grieving a man she hardly knows. Growing up she was not told who her father is and that remains an area of contention in her relationship with her mother. Kuti is confused but does not know who to turn to. All three women journey to Nigeria to bury their grandfather, father and husband. They are all looking for some form of closure, will they get it? Mulia Amaye did such an amazing job with her debut novel and I am excited to see what she comes with next. I loved getting a historical look into Lagos and Manchester during the 1940s.

A person who sells eggs should not start a fight in the market What a piece of proverbs to start out the epic story of Oto and his twin sister Wura!  An Ordinary Wonder  opens up in Nigeria in 1991 where Oto, age 14 starts recounting the story of his life. Yes, I know, he is just 14 but trust me when I say, he has lived a long, tiring life so far. Oto lives with his mother and his twin sister Wura, after his birth his father, saw that he was a “monster” and left to not be associated with Oto, his sister and his mother. Oto is left as the only person his mother can take her frustration out on and she does so relentlessly. Oto is the exact opposite of his sister Wura, she is a social butterfly, the apple of her mother’s eye, she cannot do any wrong. While Wura tries to protect her twin brother, he always seems to find himself is tight situations- some things are left out of her hands. In an effort to escape his home life Oto leaves for boarding school and for the first in a long time he finds somewhere he can truly breathe easier… that is until he starts falling for his roommate and best friend.  is told from Oto’s present life at boarding school and his past life while living at home. This gives the reader a more in-depth look into Oto’s character, his family, history and why things are the way they are now. I think the author did this to show us the impact the past continues to play on Oto’s life. I also liked that you see the mother’s descent into a religious fanatic and why she is the way she is. We also get an explanation for why Oto continue to feel like a girl even through the world views them him as a boy… So much is explored in this book- sibling love, education, gender, sexuality identity, belonging, culture, folklore and hardship. At the heart of this, this book renews your faith in humanity in such a great way. Yes, there were some parts in the plot that read unrealistically but I did not hold it against the author. I also felt the book tied up nicely without being too eyerolling.

This book is packed with history of fascinating tidbits about Jamaica, in writing about her mother, Lorna Goodison takes us in what is was like living in Jamaica during that particular time period and she did it so seamlessly. This is a beautiful memoir that I highly recommend to Jamaicans or anyone who loves history and strong females.  From Harvey River: A Memoir of my Mother and Her Island  we are introduced to the Harvey family, how they came to settle in Hanover and develop an entire community around the Harvey River. Lorna introduces us to her Great Grandparents, Grandparents, and every other family member who came from English, African and Irish heritage. We meet Margret and David and their offspring who included Doris who is Lorna’s mother. Lorna writes about her mother meeting her father, moving from her childhood home of Lucea to St. Elizabeth, then to Kingston. We see how her life changes with each move and what it means to raise a family in Kingston through sheer grit. I know I keep using the word Beautiful to describe this book but that is exactly the feeling I got when I read this book. It was pure, it was joyous and truly an ode to Jamaica, a Jamaican family and daughter honoring her mother. The book was so easy to read because of the writing, Lorna totally immerses you into the Harvey/Goodison history to the point where you felt like you knew each of them individually. There are so many greatness contained in this, there is the history of Jamaica- we learn so much about what is happening at each time period. From the Morant Bay uprising, to the abolition of Slavery, the change in rule, there is so much social commentary that shows us the thinking at that time. There such atheneite and simplicity in how the family was depicted. I particularly loved the depiction of a family from the country because I am from the “country” part of Jamaica and a lot of what the Harvey clan went through felt so familiar. I loved how Goodison wrote about the community the family finds themselves surrounded by. What some family member faced when migrating. Themes such as love, grief, loss, religion, migration, family and hardships are explored in such depth. I do not know how Goodison is able to convey so much in so little space.

In annoyance the Tour Guide suggested she start her own tour, being petty Sydney spends the next weeks putting together a tour. She gets help from her new neighbour Theo.

The stories centers around Puerto Rican girls and boys living in the diaspora and how they are navigating the world of love, mother-daughter relationships and grief.

Whenever I pick up a memoir I am always looking out for teachable moment A Memoir packed with insights and teachable moments from a live well lived.  Whenever I pick up a memoir I am always looking out for teachable moments. I am looking to learn from the life and the author’s mistake. James H. Lowry’s life is colourful, well lived and continues to impact those around him. In reading this book I think Lowry solidly drove the point home that while good education and key relationships are critical for success, “without wealth the road travelled can be more challenging” and aint that the whole truth. I think as a society we sometime discount the fact that wealth and access to it plays a huge role in the projection of your life. Generational wealth sets up the next generation and having to start from scratch with not generational wealth is hard. In a Pew Research study it showed that between 1983-2015: White households net worth increased f 42% from $100,000 to $141,000Hispanic household net worth increased 40% from $9,800 to $13,700African American household net worth decreased 16% from $13,000 to $11,000  I had to re-read that, you should too. Lowry spent most of his life assisting major corporations plan and execute diversity plans, ensuring Minorities are properly represented at different Fortune 500 Companies. Through his consultation company he’s lead his team in advising governments in African and Mayors in the US. I think one quote that stood out for me was Lowry saying:  “Too often, when we get people who truly want to solve the problems of the poor, they don’t understand or appreciate the US economic system or how to produce and transfer wealth. Often, attempts to address these highly complex problems grounded in historic realities have failed.”This was such a profound read for me, because at the core of Lowry’s life, is him making a seat at the table for Minorities. I love that throughout the book the consistent message was him opening doors for others to come through. He mentioned “crab inna barrel mentality” and I feel we don’t talk about that enough but it is so real! If you are looking for a memoir or a roadmap on how you can be a Change Agent or how you can open the door for others to come through, this is a great place to start. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 14, 2020","Dec 11, 2020","Sep 10, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/51583571-change-agent

I loved that throughout the memoir she constantly shines a light on the history of the US immigration policy and how deeply unfair it is. Did you know, “When the US won the Mexican-American War in 1948, Mexico was forced to cede nearly half of its territory- land that later made up California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming- for $15 million as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo” … yeah, I didn’t know this either. I do not need to tell you the austerities continues to this day with how ICE is treating persons who are undocumented. To say this book is timely would be a lie because what Maria Hinojosa details in her book- as it concerns migration and the treatment of Migrants have been happening since the beginning of time. It is so important that people read books like these that forces us to look the awful history. I cannot say I have heard about Maria Hinojosa before getting this book, but in reading this blurb my interest was piqued. I love a rich memoir and that is exactly what you get with  Once I Was You . Reading about the author’s journey from living in South Side Chicago to being on CNN was nothing short of inspiring. It is clear that she’s got a heart for her country -MEXICO and its people- MEXICANS and it was beautiful to see how she used her platform to create awareness and fight. I loved how Maria Hinojosa brought us into her life, pulled back the curtains and showed us her deepest hurt, what motivates her and why she continues to fight. A truly beautiful memoir that I will continue to think about for years to come.

Marriage shouldn’t be a never-ending competition where you spend your life fighting to be seen and chosen  Peace Adzo Medie’s debut novel  His Only Wife  is a book you will read and continue to think about for months to come. The story opens up in a small town in Ghana, we meet Afi Tekple a young seamstress who is about to get married to a man she has never met, what’s more the man does not show up to their wedding because he is on a business trip. How did Afi end up in this predicament? Afi’s dad died and her mother was unable to provide for her, they lived on the charity of Aunty Ganyo. They felt so indebted to Aunty Ganyo so when she suggested that Afi marry her son, Elikem Ganyo, her mother forced her to say yes! Afi ends up marrying Eli, moving to Accra to live in a fancy new apartment, having a driver to take her around, starting her apprenticeship as a fashion designer-all while waiting to meet her husband Eli for the first time. Afi is well aware that Eli has another “woman” and a child who he lives with close by, but she is married to him and there are some expectations for a marriage.  You have to learn to fight for your husband and never let your guard down  Basically Afi meets and falls in love with Eli and sends their entire marriage trying to please and keep him. It is exhausting to say the least. I was enamoured with this book from the beginning. I LOVE books that are set in Ghana and I have such an affinity for Ghana’s culture, I wanted to inhale this book. I felt the premise was strong and the execution equally as strong. I loved that it was contemporary Ghana and a love story.

I was able to borrow a copy of her debut novel Cereus Blooms At Night  from a fellow Bookstagrammer so I could read more from her. The story opens with Tyler who is a nurse at an Alms House on a fictional Caribbean Island. The story is narrated by Tyler who is tells us the story is not about him (even though he inserts himself in the story lol) but about Mala Ramchandin and how she ended up being a patient at an Alms House in Paradise. I absolutely loved how endearing Tyler is and why he decided to tell the story of Mala Ramchandin who doesn’t interact with anyone, was held for the murder of someone but the judge dismissed the case because there was no body. Throughout the book we learn about Mala’s very traumatic history and what led to her ending up where she is today. We hear about her Grandfather who came all the way from India to carve out a better life for his son, Mala’s father. Her father ends up being adopted by a Catholic Missionary family, he lives with them and ends up falling in love with their daughter, which they forbid because that is basically his sister. Mala’s father becomes enamoured with the daughter which basically lead to the demise of his entire family. While I did not love this book I have to admit that Mootoo’s writing is phenomenal, from her first novel you can see her promise. A lot of very heavy themes are explored, rape, incest, trauma, grief and mental illness. What really overwhelmed me was the incest, it really broke me. I know it is a little narrowed minded of me but I kept wondering “why didn’t you just leave Mala”, I didn’t see her reasons for staying- and the author did not make a strong case for it… I find. We meet two non-binary characters in this book and for me, I liked that they were able to be their true self with little trauma or struggle. It was a little unrealistic they were met with little or no opposition especially from the family but even with it being unrealistic it worked for me. Overall I wanted to love this one a bit more but… I loved loved loved the first 150 pages but after it just went a bit downhill.

Starting over is hard, there is so much to learn but Mina is determined to make a way in America, which may be what lead to her death…This book started our strong! With the author starting the book with the death of the character, we are taken back and forth with both characters to piece together what happened. I initially was drawn to this book because of the heavily suggested mother-daughter theme and I also love books that feature Korean characters, I just felt like the book wavered and just ended up being flat overall. What worked: I liked that the author has the two POVs we got a layered look into Mina and Margot’s relationship. I felt for Margot and her grief, she is grieving the mother she knows and the mother she did not know- that for me was profound. I loved how the author wrote about immigration and what it is like for persons who do not have papers. It is such a struggle to start over and I loved that the author was realistic in how the theme was presented. I think having the end at the beginning did a lot to keep me going to the end.  What didn’t work  The writing started off strong but, in the end,, it really faltered and the book dragged. While I am generally fine with having loose ends or unanswered questions, I felt a lot of things were not explored. We didn’t get a solid picture of Mina BEFORE America, I wanted to hear more about that. I also felt like the author dragged the ending of the book, 60% in and I wanted it to be wrapped up. Overall, this book really fell flat. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Aug 05, 2020","Aug 07, 2020","Aug 04, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/49222645-the-last-story-of-mina-lee

Baba Segi is married to three women, the story opens when he carries home his fourth wife Bolanle who is educated and not generally the type of woman who would marry Baba Segi. With the fourth wife joining the household, her reception from the other wives is cold. Yes, Bolanle expected this, but she did not expect them to take it that far. Told from the perspective of the four wives and Baba Segi, you get an intimate look into the Segi household and what happens when the big secret comes to light!Shoneyin is a great storyteller and she gripped me with this story. I loved that she told it from the different POVs and how we are given tidbits along the way to keep you interested. I loved how you get the history of the wives before they end up with Baba Segi and what lead them to that fate. Yes! The book is hilarious in certain areas and sobering in others and I think the author did an exceptional job of toeing that line. If you are looking for a fast paced, interesting read, this is it.

I think this is the reason I like reading Fredrick Backman, whenever I finish his books I want to be a better person for myself and those around me. In  Anxious People  we meet…well… some Anxious People, but they are all anxious for different reasons, because they are adults who just need extra care. We meet a bank robber who is so desperate for money they went to rob a bank, only to find out it is a cashless bank.

Opening in 1825 we are taken to a small coffee farm in Utuado that is owned by the Vega family. Raul Vega is a womanizer in every sense of the word, he has two sons by his wife and another by a local girl. Raul’s son’s Vicente follows his footsteps and become a coffee farmer. Vicente grew up on the farm and plans to spend his life growing in the coffee trade, despite being in debt and the fluctuating price of coffee and tax. Times are hard but Vicente believes if he works hard, things will get better and he will end up living comfortably off the land. Meanwhile in the town of Ponce nineteen-year-old Valentina Sanchez dreams of marrying a handsome man and heading off to Paris to live a life of luxury. The Sanchez family is middle class, but still feels pinch at times, they are banking on Valentina marrying a 50-year-old widow. When Valentina’s upper-class friend sends her a wedding invitation, the Sanchez family pulls out all the stops to see to it that Valentina catches the eye of the rich suitor. Instead of a rich suitor, Valentina ends up in the grasp of a handsome coffee farmer. While Vicente doesn’t promise Valentina a life of luxury, he does promise he will love and treat her kindly, come what may. Nothing could prepare this bright eyed coupled for what may. From the torturous journey from Pone to Utuado, to Valentina climatizing to farming life, to the farm being in severe debt, to Raul lusting and being inappropriate to Valentina, to the death of a child, to the great San Ciriaco hurricane that left the farm in shambles in 1899, to trying to rebuild but there is the upheaval with Puerto Rico moving from Spanish to US ownership… this couple will go through a lot. Even with all of that they still manage to stick with each other. After the hurricane of 1899 Vicente proposed that they go to Hawaii to work on the sugar plantation. There is the offer of a new life, school for the children, higher pay in USD, a decent house and transportation to and from Puerto Rico, Vicente and Valentina jumps at the chance for a new life. They set out on their journey to Hawaii, nothing could prepare Valentina and Vicente for what is to come…This book is a WORLD WIND! In the acknowledgements the author said she’s always been obsessed with learning about her heritage and “one day, stumbled upon the fact that over five thousand Puerto Ricans had gone to work on the sugar plantations of Hawaii after the US invasion and the San Ciriaco hurricane…” this led to her researching more and what led to her writing this book, which I am so happy she wrote. I spent a weekend reading this book because I absolutely had to know what happens for Valentina and Vicente. There are so many positives in this book: I loved learning more about Puerto Rico’s history. It is clear the author did her research and presented a solid look into life in Puerto Rico during the 1800s and early 1900s. I learned so much reading this book and if you are interested in Puerto Rican history, I strong suggest you pick this one up. The writer was able to show how the human spirit can rise above a lot of depressing circumstances. Honestly at times I thought “lawd a massy, how much this couple gonna go through!!! Yah guh kill dem off Vera, ease dem up!”  but I think that is what made the book so unforgettable. You were taken on a journey with these two people who promised to love and go through it all. The author manages to cover a wide time period without it being a dense or boring read. I think the use of letters to move the plot along worked greatly. I loved reading the communication between Valentina and her sister which continued for the entire book. Kudos to Vera for doing this! The character development in this book was exceptional- we meet Valentina as a young, shallow 19-year-old young girl and we are taken a journey where we are shown what made her into the very strong, unwavering, sexually secure woman she turns out to be. I really enjoyed how the author wrote Valentina’s character.

Set in Port Angeles, a fictional pl Atmospheric, gripping, immersive and tender- When We Were Birds is a a debut novel you will not be able to shake. Set in Port Angeles, a fictional place with the stark resemblance to Port of Spain, we meet Darwin who leaves the countryside behind to start a new life as a Grave Digger at the largest cemetery in Port Angeles. Darwin was raised in the country as a Rastafarian by his single mother. His mother is a staunched Rastafairan who believes that the dead must bury the dead- so her son becoming a Grave Digger goes against everything she believes and taught him. The Grave Digging job is the only available work Darwin could find, the only way for him to help out his mother who is ailing and is not able to be work. With a full shaved head, Darwin makes his way to Port Angeles to become a grave digger…. Warned by his mother that the city eats men alive- he is determined to prove her wrong… And maybe this is what it mean to be a man. Doing the things you never think you would have to do, making hard choice when the only thing in front you is hard choices.  Yejide grew up listening to her Grandmother Catherine telling her stories about what life was before a warrior wandered into the forest. A forest that was so thick, lush and animals who could talk and lived together peaceable. When the warriors came, they brought war and the animals all disappeared…. Many turned into birds living on the edges of the forest of Morne Marie. Yejide is from a line of woman who are all trusted with communicating and helping the dead find peace. With the death of her mother, she is passed this “gift” that she is not sure she wants- after hearing from her dead mother who remains bitter about having this gift. Not fully prepared for her destiny- how will Yejide use her gift? What happens when a Grave Digger and a woman who is charged with helping the dead find peace meets? Well… a lot!  What a stunning debut. Ayanna Banwo’s writing is immersive and atmospheric- once you start reading you are immediately transported to the streets of Port Angeles. The entire time I was reading the book I felt like I was holding my breath waiting for the other shoes to drop- and that goes back to how spellbinding the writing is. Filled with themes magical realism, fantasy, traditions, romance, love and mother-daughter /mother-son relationship that were all explored in fresh ways. I could not get enough of Darwin as a character, weeks later and my mind still returns to him and wishes him the best. I felt so much for Darwin and I think it is because the author spent so much time taking us inside his mind- we felt we were there with him. While I wanted to have that same reaction to Yejide, I felt more time could have been spent building her out individual- a lot of her character was tied to her mother, her aunty and grandmother- to the point where I hardly knew who she was as a singular character. I also felt the pacing of the book could have been better- it started off really slow and then raced at the end. Ayanna Banwo is a Caribbean voice I cannot wait to hear more from!

I was up until 10:30pm last night reading this roller coaster of a book because I just HAD to know how everything played out. There is a story in the Bible where King Solomon had two women claiming to be the mother of one child. When Solomon suggested they cut the baby in half he was able to see who the real mother was based on her reply. Delaney references this story at the start and throughout the book. It was nice to get a contemporary take on a dilemma that existed over 2000 years ago. In  Playing Nice  we meet Pete Riley, a stay at home Dad whose world was rocked when Miles Lambert shows up to let him know that his two year old son Pete is not his biological son and through an error their sons got mixed up at the hospital. Shocked and devastated Pete calls his partner Maddie to tell her the news and how they should treat with this highly unlikely situation. At first Pete and Maddie decides to play nice with Miles Lambert and his wife Lucy but then Miles keep pushing the boundaries, stopped playing fairly and Pete and Maddie must decide to stop playing nice and treat with now a hostile situation. No one could guess things would make such a drastic turn, especially not Pete and Maddie.

Arrival of the Snake Woman  is a collection of seven short stories that gives an in-depth and nuanced look into Jamaican life in the early into late 90s. This collection is layered and explores themes such as misogyny, colourism, classism, community, immigration, love, infidelity, and trauma. Senior can write about the mundane and make it so interesting. I loved how she is able to transport us to a rural community in Jamaica and introduce us to community and make their problems ours.

In re-reading it a second time I was reminded why. Absolutely well done. A must read. As the author says  Here’s to hoping this book remains forever in the category of speculative fiction  I also hope everyone who reads this take it as a warning because this could be our reality.Set in 2084, the sun is so hot the people on the fictional Caribbean island of Bajacu have to sleep during the day and work during the night. If you are caught outside at dawn you will die- that is how hot the sun is. Food is scarce, water is scarce, children attend school online, internet is limited, the island is ruled by the Domins who are trained to kill and their only goal is to survive. People over 40 years old are considered old, no one lives to see 60. No one travels, no one has access to the internet- actually the internet isn’t even a thing, the only thing of top priority is SURVIVAL. In  Daylight Come  we meet fourteen-year-old Sorrel who is living with her mother Bibi, an IT Tech who works with the Government. Sorrel is not able to sleep during the day and is up during the night, which in the long term cannot work. Bibi isn’t doing well having to deal with the constant relocating and providing for her daughter. With the city letting everyone know they have to evacuate Sorrel suggests to her mother that is it time that they go for the hills. Legend has it there is a thriving community of Tribal people who are living healthy and unaffected by the climate change. To get to this Tribal community Sorrel and Bibi will have to go through blood thirsty animals, rain booms, the sun and if they do reach, will this community take them in or turn them back?Daylight Come is a warning we cannot hide from, yes, this is fictional book but we are already seeing ice cap melting, the sun was never this hot… the signs are all there. I think what stood out for me the disdain the young persons felt for the older persons living on the island who didn’t do anything to stop climate change. McCaulay paints a realistic picture of a Caribbean island suffering from climate change. It is not every day you pick up a book writing by a Caribbean author, set in the Caribbean and it is about climate change and I was here for ALL of it. The author expertly explored themes of grief, trauma, survival, mother-daughter relationships and morality. I wanted the book to have a solid 100 more pages because I didn’t want this story to end. The book gives me a Hunger Games  but without the ceremony, just a band of women doing everything to survive.

I felt this is a book that would elicit very strong emotions, give us a lot of material to talk through and explore. The book is set in Baxter Beach, a small beachside community in Barbados. On the night that the main character, Lala gives birth there is a murder at one of the villas. Lala is a new mom whose husband is in hiding and not able to share the joy of having a new addition to the family. Added to this Lala does not have a support system, her mother is dead and her she is estranged from her grandmother. After leaving home at an incredibly young age, Lala must now survive on her own. One of the main themes in this book is generational curses, how trauma is passed from mothers to their daughters. I think Cherie did a great job of showcasing that in a really moving way. There is a deep sadness that continues throughout the book and it does not lift, even after you close it. This is not your light easy beach read, you are taken into the lives of the people in the community. I think what stood out for me was theme of classism and colorism, how that played out on the beach front.

I love reading a character with a strong back story and I felt that Jones spend a lot of time developing the stories of the characters.

Shout out to the National Library and Trinidad and Tobago for having this on the help.  Haiti Noir  is edited by none other by the great Haitian author Edwidge Danticat and features stories from great Haitians including Ibi Zoboi. If you have been following my s for a while you would know that I have a great affinity for all things Haitian so I am always open to read Haitian stories. As with all Noir series a lot of the stories explore some really dark and heavy themes but these are things we cannot turn away from. Some of the themes explored in this collection included migration, grief, violence, trauma and natural disaster. These themes are not new but they are done in a really strong way. Some of my favorite stories in this collection include: The Finger by Gary Victor  which gives a look into the violence in the country, following a thief to this demise. This story left me feeling tingly....  Paradise Inn by Kettly Mars  focused on our definition of ""paradise"" and how it makes us never want to leave... and but the longer we stay the more drained we get.  Which One? by Evelyne Trouillot  this story STUCK with me. It is a story about a family member living in New York that is looking to adopt one of her nephew's daughter...but which one? The Harem by Ibi Zoboi  takes us through an earthquake happening in Haiti, we follow this man as he tries to check on all his three lovers to make sure they are alive and doing well. It was A LOT.  Rosanna by Josaphat-Robert Large  YOEW!!!!! A kidnapping story just always gets me and this one really ruined me  Who is that man by Yanick Lahens  this story takes us through what happens when you are a good Samaritan.Overall, a great collection, the stories that were good, were GREAT the ones that were not good, were not great. If you love Haitian culture, history, literature I HIGHLY recommend this. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 23, 2020","Jul 29, 2020","Jul 11, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8034666-haiti-noir

The Deep Blue Between  is Ayesha Harruna Attah’s first teen book about twin girls Hassana and Husseina who got separated when their town was raided by rebels. Set in the late 18th and early 19th century, the book is told from both Hassana in the first person and Husseina in the third person. Barely 10 years old and they were separated during the transport after the raid, they each ended up living different lives. Hassana ended up with her older sister but left to find her twin. Husseina ended up in very unfavorable circumstances but with the help of a kind woman she found herself fleeing for Brazil. For the entire time they were separated they saw each other in their dreams, they were pulled to find each other. Will they ever find each other? What will it be like if they find each other? I really enjoyed this book! Here is what I loved:I liked that the author told the book from two different perspective, it really helped in telling a more layered story. It also made it easier for me to remember which sister was speaking. I also feel like getting the two different perspective endeared me more to Hassana than Husseina. I loved that the author took us to Brazil and the Gold Coast during the 18-19th century. It was so great getting a historical look into what was happening in these countries at that time. I also loved that slavery was NOT the main focus of the story, even though it influenced it. It is not every day I pick up a book and I am transported to Brazil and West Africa and for me that was a huge seller!The author’s ability to deal with themes of grief, loss, religion and faith was spot on! That for me was a very big highlight. I loved that the ending was unrealistic – when you read the ending you will see what I am saying. The author was able to show that these young ladies lived different lives and experienced different things and that would change how they view society. Her ending was a testament to that. The author’s ability to write beautiful scenery wad enjoyable to read. I could not get enough of Brazil and the Gold Coast. One thing that perturbed me was the author totally did not give any follow up about the bigger sister. I felt it was a bit cold that we met the sister in the beginning and we didn’t a thing about her too much. Yes, I get it, it’s the story about the twin but the entire time I kept waiting to get some closure about the older sister…Overall a great read! Honestly, get ready to be impressed!

In  A Girl Is A Body Of Water  we meet young Kirabo who is being raised by her Grandparents in a small village called Nattetta. The story Kirabo was told is that her father, Tom, showed up with her 12 years ago because her mother did not want her. Since then Kirabo have been wondering, who is this woman do left me? She asks questions but no one will give her a straight answer not even Nsuuta, who the villagers call a witch. Kirabo’s family cannot understand why is not able to move pass being abandoned by her mother. In their mind, she is greatly provided for and taken care of, why does she need to know more about the woman who did not stay around? Kirabo is at that stage where she feels a dual force inside of her, one that is obedient and the other that wants to wreak havoc. Kirabo is growing up, and fast, her world keeps changing, secrets are being revealed that forces Kirabo to question her reality. This is a marathon read, Makumbi takes us into the life of Kirabo, we actually read about her leaving the village to go live with her father, she goes off to boarding school, we see her fall in love, grow up and experience how her world changes through grief. There is so much happening in this book, we get a historical look into Uganda during the 1970s, there is folklore, oral storytelling, religion, a bit of magical realism, themes of grief, generational curses, love, grief, abandonment, betrayal and feminism. Let me start with what I loved:I loved reading about Uganda and what was happened historically during the 1970s. The author did a great job of showcasing feminism and I really enjoyed how that theme was executed. It is not every day I read a book where feminism is at the forefront of the narrative and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Kirabo is a character I enjoyed hearing from, I really could not get enough of her world. I delighted in her grown and her growing into her womanhood.Makumbi does an amazing job of writing family history and generational curses. How is it one family have so many secrets?! It was enjoyable to read for sure. The author did a great job of showcasing religion and how religion was used as a means to colonize. Throughout the entire book religion was explored, through the planting of churches and how Christianity changed the customs of the villagers. Language was also executed in a layered way, how the use of English was seen as a good thing. What I did not enjoy:While I enjoyed the book, I felt it could have benefited by having a stronger editor. I felt too much was happening and the themes were not strongly fleshed out. There is the hint at magical realism at the start of the book that basically fizzled out and was not carried through the entire book. I also had some difficulties with the timeline of some events it was not clear when or how it happened. There was not an easy transition of flashback or creating a linear narrative. It was very clunky how events were sometimes written and that left me confused at time. There were a lot of characters, some with names that look the same, and I had to keep flipping to the back of the book to remind myself who was who. I was not entirely sold on Kirabo and Sio’s relationship, a lot of it did not seem realistic and how their story was told didn’t help in making it believable for me. Overall, I did enjoy this book, I just felt the plot could have been tighter....more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Sep 12, 2020","Sep 16, 2020","Jul 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51188678-a-girl-is-a-body-of-water

FLAWLESS!In Danticat’s memoir/non-fiction release  Brother, I’m Dying  she tells the story of her father Andre and his brother Uncle Joseph who acted as her second father while her Mother and Father migrated to the US. Edwidge and her brother remained in the care of Uncle Joseph and his wife Denise while her parents went to the US for better opportunities and to one day file for Edwidge and her brother. During her time in Haiti Edwidge spoke to her parents on a daily basis but it was Uncle Joseph- a Pastor and School administrator who oversaw her childcare. Edwidge walked us through life in Haiti during the 1970s to the 2000s- showing us the progression and changes in her family dynamics. We see where her parents visited Haiti and ends up filing and taking her and her brother to the US. How her Uncle Joseph lost his voice due to an illness and how hard it was for them to communicate. How her cousins’ lives changed for the good and the bad. We saw Danticat’s transition from life in Haiti to living in the US. The book is told from the present day in 2004 where Edwidge is newly pregnant, but her father is dying and her uncle through a series of awful events ends up seeking alyssum in the US but was detained and thrown in a detention centre in Miami. There are so many layers to unpack in this book, there is Danticat giving us a historical look into Haiti and what it was like growing up there. We also get insights into the political landscape of the country and how that shaped the society at the time. As someone who is deeply interested in Haiti this book really gave an insightful and rich look into the ordinary lives of Haitians. The theme of father-daughter relationship was explored beautifully and in the most nuanced and raw way. I could not get enough of Danticat’s exploration of this theme. I also loved how she showed us what immigration is like for Haitian, from how limited their opportunities are and how differently they are treated to other nationals seeking asylum in the US- wow.

Claire’s mother died while giving birth to her, so on her birthday she usually “celebrate” by going with her father to her mother’s grave. With the death of his wife, fisherman Nozias must now figure out how to give his daughter the life she deserves. Nozias did not attend school, and is barely getting by as a fisherman, he wants to give Claire the life he’s never had and figured the only way to do this is to give her away to a woman who lost her child. On Claire’s seventh birthday the woman shows up to collect Claire, but Nozias is not sure if he is able to do so, Claire ends up running away. On the night that Mme Gaelle visits Nozias to finally adopt Claire she gives him the ultimatum, either I get Claire tonight, or the deal is off. Gaelle knows about grief, she knows about not getting to say goodbye to the ones she loved. With the sudden death of her husband and daughter Gaelle is left alone to grief and wonder about her karma. Grief seems to be the ongoing theme through this book as we hear about Bernard Dorien, Max Ardin Junior and Senior, and the town’s undertaker and mayor- Albert Vincent. These Ville Rose residents are each linked to Nozias and his daughter Claire is a loose way, they all have their ghosts they have to deal with. I have to be honest, this was not my favourite Danitcat novel and it pains me to say this. I felt the book did not do a great job of putting Claire at the forefront as a character. The book ended and I still did not have a vivid picture of who Claire is, her motivations etc. I felt the book would have worked better as a collection of short stories because that’s how read. While I did enjoy the plot lines of the other characters, I still kept on going back to… “when are we gonna hear more from Claire?” and that never happened. Regardless of the above, Danticat still was able to keep the interested by weaving and pulling together characters and plotlines that held you. I really enjoyed seeing how the town of Ville Rose was held to together by the undertaker and mayor- which is so hilarious to me.

With  The Undiscovered Country  we got a peek inside the brilliant mind of Andre Bagoo, and if I am being honest, I did not want to leave. In this collection of essays Bagoo questions whether Trinidad and Tobago actually gained independence, how are we still to this day struggling as a country and what independence can actually look like. In his introduction Bagoo quips that these essays are meant to  castigate and praise. They aim to provoke, add fuel to the fire of augmentation..  and he achieved just that. There were some essays that really got under my skin and stayed there, others that hand me going “WOW, I did not know this!” and the rest that left me in wonder and awe of how Bagoo’s brain works. I loved the essays that talked about Caribbean authors we are familiar with including V.S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott- did yall know they were enemies? I could not get enough of hearing about Naipaul and his layered relationship with his home country. It is clear that he did his research and left it up to us to decide our views on Naipaul. Other essays that really captured my attention includes,  Double  a local staple in Trinidad and Tobago- while I don’t eat it, it was impactful getting a look into how this creation came to be.  Plato’s Cave  and  Free Colony  did a deep dive into the coup, T&T laws and how outdated they are. I think if you are interested in law and how laws don’t change, even after independence, these two essays will offer a lot.  Soca which is the heartbeat of T&T and one of my favorite musical genres is explored through the 2019 giant hits “Savannah Grass” and “Famalaylay”.

The boo The Wondrous and Tragic Life of Ivan and Ivana  was the first book I have read by Maryse Condé and I was not disappointed… what an epic read! The book opens with the birth of twins Ivan and Ivana on the French Caribbean Island of Guadeloupe. Born into a single parent family to their mother Simone who adores them, they often heard about their father who is a famous musician who currently lives in Mali. Simone works hard to provide for her twins who are living in Guadeloupe under hard time. In their teenage and young adult life Ivan ends up being imprisoned at least twice in Guadeloupe. Ivana works hard and won a scholarship to attend a police academy in Paris. It is during that time that Simone finally gets word from their father who sent a plane ticket for Ivan and Ivana to come and live with him in Mali. Once they arrive in Mali, Ivana and Ivan must now navigate an entirely foreign world, one where they live on a compound with a father, they do not have a relationship with. Ivana starts volunteering at an orphanage and Ivan joins the local military. They are not as close as they once was and with the compound watching, they try to not be as close as they were in Guadeloupe. It is during Ivan’s time in Mali he switches religion to Muslim and become somewhat radicalize. He goes on his first “mission” and was successful but at a major cost. Upon leaving Mali the twins settle in Paris where Ivan works odd jobs to make ends meet. Ivana starts attending the police academy. The twin no longer has a lot in common but their attraction to each other remains. Ivan finds himself in the company of radicals and ends up going on a fatal mission. The above is just a brief overview of the wondrous and tragic life of the twins. I am blown away by the writing in this book. I did not know what to expect of Maryse Conde’s writing but I was in for a great surprise and I loved every minute of it. I loved how Conde wove different characters into the fabric of this book. She does a great job of introducing characters, some who are central and others who are just passing through. Conde tackles colorism, poverty, colonialism, racism, terrorism, incest, migration, immigration in contemporary Guadeloupe, Paris and Mali.

This book absolutely stole my heart and its now one of my all time favourite books. WOW. In Jennifer Makumbi’s collection of stories, Manchester Happened  we meet Ugandans who journey to England, specifically Manchester to make a life for themselves. The collection is separated into two sections, the first journeys with those who decided to leave and the second section takes us on a trip back with the characters who decided to visit Uganda after spending a significant amount of time in the UK. While we all know that everyone’s immigration story is different, Jennifer Makumbi was able to give the readers a diverse and nuance look with these twelve stories. Of twelve stories, my standouts where: Our Allies the ColoniesManchester Happened Something Inside So Strong Malik’s Door My Brother, BwemageThe Aftertaste of SuccessLet’s Tell This Story Properly Yes, yes, I know I basically listed out the entire table of contents but that is just how much I really enjoyed this collection. I really do enjoy stories that tells of the experience of those who leave their country, for whatever reason, to go a try and make a better life elsewhere. Makumbi treated their experience with compassion and vulnerability and that is why I felt so hard for this collection. Makumbi even included the point of view of a dog who got kidnapped from Uganda and was brought to Manchester- yes! That happened. Themes of immigration, identity, racism, colonialism, colourism, fitting in, displacement, sadness, regret and shame are explored and done in a very layered way. I really appreciated that the author did not tell a one-dimensional story but something that really moved and stayed with you, after finishing the story. I particularly loved how realistic the depiction of the characters were. Makumbi’s ability to write about how people perceive the UK and having that perception blown to pieces when they arrive really did it for me. I honestly could go on and on about this collection, but I highly recommend you read it yourself. Trust me when I say, you will not be disappointed....more",Notes are private!,0,75,2,"May 03, 2021Nov 12, 2020","May 23, 2021Nov 16, 2020","Jun 17, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54819813-manchester-happened

The book seeks to answer, who is one of the “good” ones and what exactly makes them a “good” one. Why are some considered good and others considered bad? As the blurb said, “Isn’t being human enough?” In  One Of The Good Ones  we meet three sisters, Kezi, Happi and Genny. Kezi Smith is Social Activist with a strong YouTube following. On her channel she talks history and advocate for Black Lives. Off YouTube she has perfect grades and is on track to attending a great University. While she’s got everything going for her, her sister Happi cannot seem to stand her and while she’s got a very public life, she’s got a secret she doesn’t want anyone finding out. In an effort to take her activism offline Kezi attends her very first social justice rally, ends up getting arrested and killed under mysterious circumstances.Kezi’s death ends up being a catalyst for “change”, she is made into someone as a martyr and everyone once again is holding up Kezi as one of the good ones who did not need to die. With her death everyone is an activist who all of sudden sees the need for change. Kezi’s sister Happi is annoyed by this but does not know exactly what to do, especially seeing that they didn’t have a great relationship and on their last interaction Happi told her sister to leave her alone. A few months after the death of Kezi, Genny, the oldest sister thought it would be a great idea to go on a road trip that Kezi was planning. Before her death Kezi, using The Negro Motorist Green Book as a guide planned an entire trip to see places that were haven for black people back in the day. While on this road trip Genny and Happi, along with Dwight and Ximena ends up learning way more than they bargained for. When I finished this book I had to go right to bed because my mind was blown. I had to sleep off the bookish hangover and I recommend you do the same once you finish this book. There is a whole lot going on in this book, and when I say whole lot, I mean it, you’ve got: GriefUnlawful killing of a Black girlRegrets Social ActivistBlack History Generation sins and cursesChristianity Coming out with Christian parents Unrealistic expectation Identity ThrillerSisterhoodFriendship How to be an ally Yes, a lot is happening, but it all comes together expectably and surprisingly well. I love how the Moulite sisters came together and wrote a stellar sophomore novel that highlights so many necessary topics that we need to keep reading about. As with their debut novel which was rich with history, in this book we get a deep look behind how The Negro Motorist Green Book guide came about and why there was a need for it. How Maika and Maritza are able to seamlessly teach us through their writing is something that I always admire. I learned about Black Cowboys, Sundown Towns and what they are and Claudette Colvin. I think what stood out most for me was how the story of Claudette Colvin tied into what it means to be a “Good one”. You will learn once you pick up this book. While I don’t have a sister, I get the feeling that they wrote sisterhood and family really well. I really enjoyed how they wrote relationships, history and how grief differs for everyone else. I also loved that there was a major twist that I did not see coming. There were a few things that didn’t work for me, I felt the writing was very heavy handed in driving the point of “one of the good ones” home. At one point I wanted to scream… “I GET IT!” but maybe it is a reminder for people who don’t get it. I also felt that the end wrapped up a bit too quickly, seriously too quickly and more time could have been spend fleshing it out. I also felt some plot points were very predictable. I received an arc so the family tree was not included but I see the finished version will have so that will help people like me who would not be able to keep track. Overall, I can see a lot of persons reading this book and falling in love with it. I hope they won’t forget the message the author wants to drive home.

There is a special sense of feeling you get when you open a book and see that it is dedicated to you… a Jamaican and that feeling stays with you! In re-reading this book, I laughed out loud on numerous occasions, I shed a tear, I nodded my head in agreement, and I was absolutely overwhelmed by a feeling of homesickness. It is not every day you open a book and you see yourself, your family, how you grew up being recounted on the page and for that I’ll be forever grateful to Alexia Arthurs.  How to Love A Jamaican  is collection of 11 short stories that perfectly captures Jamaican, Jamaican life, culture, history and a bit of folklore in a truly electrifying way. There are some stories that sticks with you, that gets under your skin and doesn’t leave you, that is how you know the writing is amazing…. Or it could be that I am a Jamaican and I am biased… but I don’t think that is it. As someone who grew up in rural Jamaica, there are so many of the stories that ring true in how they felt, in the characterization and the use of old sayings. A lot of the characters in this collection reminds me of people I’ve met or grew up with. There is a distinct feeling you get reading this book and I don't know how to explain that feeling unless you are a Jamaican, related to a Jamaican, from Jamaican heritage or loved a Jamaican. I could gush and go on and on about this collection. It is a book I hold dear, a book I cannot stop talking about- two years later, a book I always recommend, a book that remains close to my heart. Please read.  Review in 2018  I finally finished How To Love A Jamaican and I am thoroughly pleased with this debut novel. I have to admit I can be a bit biased when I read books written by Jamaicans about Jamaicans, but even with my Jamaican googles off this book is absolutely a must-read. I am so impressed with Alexia Arthur’s writing, she perfectly captures the various nuances of the Jamaican culture and its people. If you are looking for a solid collection of short stories that’s diverse and much as it is real. I would list my favorite stories in this book but I would basically be re-writing the content page (lol).A must read and absolute favorite of mine!...more",Notes are private!,0,34,2,"Oct 2022Jun 14, 2020","Oct 20, 2022Jun 16, 2020","Jun 14, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35395301-how-to-love-a-jamaican

I am generally not a middle school book reader but when I read the blurb, saw the gorgeous cover and the title was enough to send me reading Kereen Getten’s debut novel. Set in a seaside community in Jamaica  When Life Gives You Mangoes  is the story of twelve-year-old Clara and how she is spending her summer holidays. Clara lives with her mother and father in the community of Sycamore where no one leaves and no one new visits. Everyone in Sycamore knows each other, they all grew up together and are community in every sense of the word. Clara is ready for summer, to eat all the mangoes, to spend time with her best friend and cousin Gaynah and maybe win a game of pick leave. Lately Clara finds Gaynah have been very mean to her, while she tries to not take it on, she cannot help but feel hurt by her friend’s treatment. For a community where nothing new happens, the entire community is abuzz with the arrival of new visitors from the UK. Gaynah tells Clara all about the new visitors, but Clara isn’t interested in making any new friends. While Clara is excited for summer, she cannot help but feel left out as she cannot remember what happened last summer. Clara cannot remember what happened last summer and why she is not able to go into water without being overcome by fear. Her parents won’t fill her in, her best friend teases her for her memory loss… maybe this summer will be different, maybe she will remember…. I absolutely enjoyed this very delightful book. I enjoyed being in Clara’s world and going on her numerous adventures. Getten writing transported me to a simpler time where I would spend my summer holidays outside in the country. It felt very nostalgic and innocent and I wanted more. What I loved: I love that the book was told from Clara’s perspective, it brought to life her inner thinking and personality. I loved how perceptive Clara was in talking us on this journey. I was BLOWN away by the twist at the end. I felt the author did a great job of having more than one thing to keep us interested to the very end. The twist at the end was the absolute best!I really enjoyed how the author wrote about a positive, functioning family unit. I find I don’t read a lot about a family who sticks by and believe their child. I loved how the parents were portrayed as loving, patient and kind. There are the themes of community, religion, friendship, grief, father-daughter relationship, family and trauma that I felt were aptly explored and explored in an authentic way. I liked that that there was a bit of mystery and freshness to the overall plot. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed this book. Getten was able to pack a lot in just 217 pages without it feeling packed. The writing was fresh, layered, and very authentic. Clara is a character I know I will not forget anytime soon. If you are looking for a delightful read, this is your pick! Please please go read this book!Thanks Pushkin Press for this ARC. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Aug 06, 2020","Aug 10, 2020","Jun 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51342422-when-life-gives-you-mangos

Lesley-Ann Brown writes that  unlearning is a tenet of decoloniality which is why she wrote this book for her biracial son so that he can have the knowledge of who came before him and a narrative he can use to navigate his life. Lesley-Ann Brown was born in Brooklyn, spent some of her formative years in Trinidad and Tobago and is currently living in Denmark. She is well traveled, a poet, activist, writer and also worked in publishing,  Decolonial Daughter, Letters from a Black Woman to Her European Son  is her debut non-fiction book. In this book she sets out to show how colonialism impacted her history, heritage, the world and how we are all still reeling from the effects. This book is well written, well researched and deeply moving in certain areas when Brown talks about her childhood trauma, growing up with an abusive father, being sent to Trinidad for an incident she should have been protected from and the nuanced look into her prison visit to her brother. There are certain parts in this book that will leave you feeling heavy and like you cannot breathe because of a lot what Brown experiences I am sure will resonate with you. A lot is covered in this book from Colonialism, Racism, Colourism, Classism, Religion, Abuse, Immigration, Microaggression, Depression, Mental Health, Motherhood, Systematic Racism, Generational Wealth, Policing of Women’s Bodies Privilege and Whiteness. Yes- I know, that is a mouth full but Brown was able to address these issued in a very nuanced and current way. She gives us information to help us learn more about our shared history, for us to better understand why we are still in 2020 having to “fight” racism.  Science says we carry within us the experience of fourteen generation  so you can image why writing a book like this to her son will help in the unlearning process. I loved how Brown walked us through her family history, how she was met with opposition or silence when she asked about the past. I think a lot of people feel shame or some are not sure of their heritage but seeing someone go through and dig into her family’s history really empowered me to do the same. I could go on and on about this book but I know this was a deeply personal read for me and I implore you to give this a read and experience it for yourself. I recommend this for anyone with children, or anyone looking to learn more about colonialism and it’s impact on the world today.

Monday is Claudia’s only and best friends, they are inseparable, which is why Claudia could not understand why Monday didn’t write to her over the summer vacation. With school starting the next day Claudia prepares to meet her friend Monday who LOVES school- except Monday does not show up to school for an entire week… then a month… then a whole year… . Claudia is beside herself; no one will look into Monday’s disappearance, no one will take her serious that her best friend is missing. Claudia is barely coping trying to finish her final year all while trying to find her missing friend. This is my first book by Tiffany D. Jackson and I am kicking myself for taking so long to read something by this author. I decided to go with this book because of the title, also I absolutely LOVE Mondays, the freshness of a new week, the start of something new. I could not stop smiling when I saw that’s exactly how Monday feels about Mondays. ow for the book, what a well written, thrilling and utterly addictive read. I could not put this book down and I was BLOWN away by the twist that I did not see coming. Jackson did an amazing job of writing a plot that keeps the reader heavily invested. The entire time I was reading I kept thinking (maybe getting frustrated and shouting), “why isn’t anyone listening to Claudia?!!!!”. I loved how the author explored friendship in this book, it was realistic and very reminiscent of my younger friendships. I was taken back to Primary and early high school when I would rush to school early to catch up with me friends. I was utterly enamored with the friendship and how nuanced these two girls were. I also liked how the author showed the two family dynamics of Claudia and Monday- how people can be close and still not know everything about each other because… isn’t that so real .A well written thoroughly deserved read. Jackson did a great job of using her talent to draw awareness to girls who go missing daily.

I will forever pick up a book that explores the Haitian experience.  American Street  opens up with Fabiola Toussaint arriving in the U.S. after she and her mother left behind Haiti to move to Detroit to live and start a new life. While Fabiola was allowed to enter the US, he mother was detained by US Immigration even through she had a visa and all the “right” paperwork. Fabiola must continue to Detroit without her mother, in a country she is not familiar with. Fabiola is greeted in Detroit by her American cousins- Chantal, Donna and Princess- the Three B’s. Fabiola is confused, homesick and misses her mother, but must apply herself to life in America and all the struggle and goodness that comes with it. In navigating the strange world Fabiola is offered a deal to free her mother but it comes a very high cost. I really enjoyed reading this book. Yes sometimes I do get a bit overwhelmed by the immigration story at time but it is a reality when reading Caribbean literature. A lot of Caribbean nationals are currently living outside of their home country so, you will meet a lot of literature that speaks to the theme of immigration. I enjoyed seeing how Fabiola navigated her life in America, it felt real, it felt realistic and wanted her to win. I love her loud cousins and how their sisterhood, how they each are carving out a world for themselves. I felt the book started really strong it got a little loose in the end, but I felt reading the author’s note tied everything together for me. Overall, this is a really great YA novel that covers theme of immigration, identity, sisterhood, mother-daughter relationship and religion. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 17, 2020","Jun 22, 2020","May 28, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40009905-american-street

They are inseparable as Mabel guides Audre through American culture, her school system, Audre in return shares her experience growing up in Trinidad and Tobago. Both of their world begins to crumble when Mabel is diagnosed with a disease that will change the trajectory of their lives. I’ll be honest, I cannot tell the last time I read a YA novel.

This book is so well written, so layered and showcases so many facets of queer teenage life. I love that the author decided to make the character a Trini because it is not often we (me) read about the experience of a queer Caribbean teenager- I love that a place was created for this.

Love After Love  is Ingrid Persaud’s sophomore novel that examines… well, love! The book is set in Trinidad and Tobago and follows the life of Betty Ramdin, her son Solo and Mr. Chetan. Betty Ramdin was only twenty years old when she met married her husband Sunil. The marriage was Betty’s way to get some form of freedom, live in and run her own house. The marriage started off great but soon evolved into a toxic relationship Betty could not leave. A few years into the marriage Betty has Solo, her one son who she dotes and maybe spoils a lot. When things in the marriage gets rough, Betty’s only focus is protecting her son from Sunil. On the night of Solo’s birthday, Betty’s husband died from falling down the stairs. At age forty Betty is now on her own raising her son and looking after a house that is entirely too much for her. Mr. Chetan’s landlord for numerous years was recently assaulted and they decided to pack up their lives and move to the US. With very little notice and few places available Mr. Chetan ends up being Betty Ramdin’s tenant. Mr. Chetan is a very private man, he loves his space, his privacy and is not a big talker, he just wants to be left alone to read and do his thing in the kitchen. However, being Betty’s lodger means he will have to deal with having the company of Solo 24/7. Mr. Chetan and Solo hit it off and they are inseparable. The three falls into a weird but great arrangement that works for all. However, Mr. Chetan has a secret, one he is afraid to share, one he keeps close because he feels it might ruin his current arrangement. Solo grew up not really know much about his father or his father’s side of family. His mother spoils him, dotes on him and they have a really great loving relationship. With Mr. Chetan moving in Solo considers him a sort of father figure- a role Mr. Chetan is happy to fall into. Solo does not lack for anything, that is until his mother starts dating and that lands a blow to their once tight relationship. One night Solo overhears a conversation between his mother and Mr. Chetan, and he is exposed to a truth that ruins their relationship. Solo works through his high school days and leaves for summer holidays to visit his uncle Hari. Solo takes this opportunity to leave his mother and Trinidad and Tobago behind for good. His visa expires after six months and Solo is now an illegal immigrant working in New York. Life is much harder than Solo imagined, and he finds unhealthy coping mechanism. He has no intention to return to Trinidad and Tobago… that is until one night he received a phone call that will change his life. I spent an entire day reading  Love After Love  and I absolutely could not put it down. Ingrid Persaud’s writing is beautiful, engaging, nuanced and hilarious at times. The characters are all well developed and people you would actually want to meet in real life. I felt the author did an amazing job of showing Trinidad and Tobago’s history, culture and country’s current landscape. I tend to not try to speak on behalf of Trinidadians (even though I have been living here for over 6 years) but I did find the author paid homage to her country in a very beautiful, yet nuanced way. A lot of themes are explored in  Love After Love  with love being the grounding theme. Persaud showcase the different forms of love and the different ways we love or show love. I have to admit, I enjoyed hearing from a 40 year old women about what it is like dating at that age in Trinidad and Tobago- it was so well done and I find we don’t read a lot about “older” Caribbean women dating and finding love. There is the theme of friendship and what that ""should"" look like, and I felt Persaud did just a spectacular job of taking us into a real genuine friendship between Betty and Mr. Chetan- I think that was so well explored and I wanted more of it. Honestly, I could go on and on about this book. It is well written, it explores modern Caribbean life in a realistic way and the book will leave you feeling gutted. So many unforgettable moments and beautiful characters. A must read for me.

Alaine is a confident young lady, she knows exactly what she wants for her future and is willing to work at it. She is sarcastic, funny and rumbustious- not your typical teenager but she is fine with that. Alaine attends a private school in Miami where a lot of the attendees are very rich and privilege. During one of Alaine’s school project things went left and she is asked to take a leave of absence (not a suspension because you know the family donated to the school over the years so they are afforded this privilege). For her two months absence Alaine will visit live in Haiti and work at her Tati Estelle’s non-profit organization. Alaine is not sold on living in Haiti but embraces the experience for what is it. She also gets to spend some time with her Mother who is recuperating after having a show down on national television. Alaine makes best use of her time trying to uncover and learn more about Haiti and the family curse she grew up hearing about. This curse will change Alaine in ways she is not prepared for…First let me say, it is not every day I read a book written by Haitian sisters that flowed seamlessly. I thought it would going to be choppy but Maika and Maritza did a solid job in writing this book together. I loved the character of Alaine, she was believable, real, very interesting and laugh out loud funny at times. I also loved that the authors gave the main character emotional range while making it realistic. A solid job for character development. I have always had a soft spot for Haiti. I think the World does not give Haiti and Haitians the respect they deserve for being the first free Republic in history and actually fighting for that freedom. With that said, I was so happy that majority of the book was set in Haiti, I learned so much about the culture, I even have a itinerary for when I do visit. I loved hearing about all the historical facts… yoew, Haiti is just so rich with history.Overall I really enjoyed this book- why not a five star? I felt that the book could have been a bit shorter and tighter. I felt there were a lot of sub-plots and characters that didn’t add to the overall plot but took away from it. I felt the book could have been shortened by 50-80 pages had we focused mostly on Alaine and her core family. I also felt the ending fell apart a little. Regardless, this is a great YA read, that’s packed with history and filled with a character that will keep you entertained! Truly it was a delight reading this!  What I learned reading this book  “Jean-Jacques Dessalines: Called for the massacre of Haiti’s white minority, which resulted in several thousand deaths.

We hear from Norman Alonso, a Jamaican living in England with his wife who is seeking to provide a secure future for their children. Norman grew in Jamaica from humble beginnings, while he didn’t lack anything, his wife Glorie convinced him that life would be better in England. Life in England did not turn out how Norman expected, from illness, to a hardened marriage and racism, where was the bright future he envisioned?Fast forward to 2002 we meet nineteen-year-old Jesse McCarthy, a Jehovah Witness who was disfellowed because of “improper behaviour”. Turned out by his community and family, Jesse runs away to London to start over, and shake the hold religion placed on him. Starting over proves harder than envisioned so Jesse turns to sex work to earn his living while he writes his book. While he is surrounded by millions, Jesse still battles with being disfellowed, the remnants of religion, his sexuality, not knowing his father and not having a community. This is what I call addictive reading! I could not put this book down because I needed to know what happened with Jesse. I think the author did such a compelling job of exploring religion and sexuality- specifically how it is treated in the Jehovah Witness faith. I loved how he explored identity for those who grew up in the church and even after leaving, they cannot shake the teachings. This was a solid coming of book, we journey with Jesse who landed in Brixton when he was 19years until he was 34 years old. My only draw back was that I wanted to hear more from Norman, he is such a commanding character, his voice was so strong. I felt how his story was inserted in the book was a bit clumsy, and with a stronger Editor it would have been re-worked into the narration a bit better. I also felt that the book went over the same things a little too much, that did not help with the pacing. Regardless of those two draw backs, this is such a well written, truly beautiful account of a young Black gay disfellowed man trying to make his way in London. We need more stories like this.

Shani Mootoo writes a book that grabs you from the starts, grips you hard and doesn’t release you, even after finishing the book… WOW! Set in a small town countryside of Ontario, we meet lesbian couple Priya and Alex who have been together for a long time. Priya is from Trinidad and Tobago but left to study in college and ended up in Ontario to pursue a career as an artist. During her time in Ontario she met and fell in love with her partner Alex who is a writer. Priya hatches a plan for her and Alex to leave it all behind, move to a countryside, come off social media, get rid of all their contacts/acquaintances and move forward in this “new life” with just close friends and family. For the most part their plan works, and they live comfortably together forging a life that is beneficial to both of them. This plan comes to a halt when Priya’s long forgotten university “friend” Prakash finds and messages her on Twitter. For some reason Priya invites him to come visit her and Alex in the countryside. What was supposed to be a “you should come visit!”, but I don’t mean in, turns into Prakash actually deciding to come visit…alone. Alex and Priya relationship starts to unravel because there are questions and concerns that Priya is being evasive about. Who is Prakash? Why is he visiting you without his wife? Didn’t you say he had a crush on you? Priya is conflicted and wants to call off the visit. Alex is angry, insecure and feels she doesn’t really know who Priya really is. This couple is unravelling and fast….This is my first book by Shani Mootoo and I was not prepared for this amount of brilliance! When I tell you Mootoo writes a book wrought with tension, believe me. For the entire book I kept waiting for the next shoes to drop. Usually I would get annoyed with the author feeding me bits and pieces of information, but Mootoo did such a spectacular job of knowing when to ease up the tension and when to pull it in. I generally do not like books set in secluded settings with less than 4 characters but Mootoo executed beautifully on this I could not complain. I spent a whole day reading this book because I just HAD to know what happens and what this visit will lead to. Also the ending. THE. ENDING!.... WHY?!!!Overall this book is well written, well crafted and truly will not leave you be, even after closing the book. An absolute must read!

This is jarring for the group of friends because this beach is a public one… what exactly is happening? Pinder Street is home to families who live and work together for ages. Their children know each other from birth and have been growing up together. We are taken into the friendship of Eve, Faith, KeeKee and Nia. Eve is the most responsible teenager you will ever meet. Her father is the pastor at the community’s church, which means she takes care of her family along with his flock. While she loves her family, she would like some release to just be a teenager. Just when she thinks this may happen, her father is diagnosed with Cancer. Faith’s family is falling apart in front of her eyes but she tries to hold it together. Her father stopped coming home, her sister no longer lives there and her mother is a shell of herself. Faith is trying to hold it all together but when her mother leaves trying to kill herself, Faith knows she needs help. KeeKee is the friend you want to have, she is a poet who constantly listens to you. She’s got big dreams and a brother who everyone seems to be in love with. When her best friend steals her poem and the other one is caught sleeping with her brother… what else can she take?Nia cannot leave the house unless her mother says so. Her mom wants her to be a journalist but she would rather study culinary arts She’s got no idea who her father is and her mother won’t tell her. One day Nia decides to take the risk to apply for a summer art program her mother did not approve, will this risk pay off? Every girl is facing a huge problem they cannot seem to fix and it is compounded when they learn that a big hotel will be taking over the place they find the most solace… the beach. This was such a great book. Yes, I had a warm time trying to remember everyone’s name and who they were. I think it took me until I was 65% into the book to finally get an understanding of the personality. I don’t think it is any fault to the writer, or maybe it is… she could have gone with four characters, I guess. Either wait I did enjoy reading about all of them and I didn’t think any character was too much alike. This was my first time reading Janice Lyn-Mather and I will for sure be reading more from her.

Reyna who lost her mother at a young age and the love of her live decides to give up painting and is going through the biggest tabanca she’s ever experience- granted she is just seventeen. The cause of Reyna’s tabanca is Aiden, her first love, who left her and Tobago behind to pursue his career in music. Of course, like every tabanca, it hits harder when they show up to the hotel you are working at to spend an extended time with their group of friends. Aiden and Reyna must now either avoid each other for the entire stay, or confront each other. Friends, if you know me, I am not big on YA and Romance but this book truly did it for me. I felt the author did such a phenomenal job of taking me back to my teenage years and me thinking my first love was it and losing them was the end of the world- yea… the dramatics right?! The author writes convincingly about Tobago, love, and being a teenager who is heading into adulthood. The theme of grief, love, mother-daughter relationship and growing up was thoroughly and well explored. I truly enjoyed Reyna and how very likeable and realistically written she was. Granted, if my father owned a hotel, at 17 I wouldn’t be looking to manage it, I would have my friends over every weekend for a villa party… but that’s just me.

When I finished reading the book my first thought was  A weh di rass mi just read?! I don’t even know where to start with this  because I am so confused and conflicted… here goes! The story of  My Mother’s House  opens with a house in New York City South Ozone Park committing suicide by burning itself down (yes, you read right). We hear from the House the reason it decided to burn itself down and why this drastic measure needed to be taken. The story continues and we hear from the House as it gives us the history of the community, how it was gentrified, and an intimate look into the lives of the persons who lives/lived inside them. The House tells us of the horrors that happened under it’s roof and why it decided its best to burn itself to the ground.Lucien is the current owner of the House. He is originally from Haiti but had to flee because he got tangled up with the General’s daughter Marie-Ange. The General’s entire family was assassinated but Lucien was able to save and hide Marie-Ange until his parents in America sent for him. After moving and settling in New York City, Lucien is determined to make a life for himself and provide for his family which includes his three daughters. Hoping to recreate and build a community like in Haiti, Lucien buys an old rundown house where he invites Haitians who are new to NYC to come over. Lucien and Marie-Ange offers these persons who are new to the US advice on how to assimilate, and a nice home cooked Haitian meal. Through an illness Marie-Ange dies and the house is not what it used to be, people no longer come around like they use to. Lucien starts “dating” the nurse that took care of his wife but he can’t say he loves her. Lucien’s love is toxic, he is an emotionally damaged man with heinous habits and impulses. For over two decades he’s been feeding his evil desires and the House is about to make it known to the world. This is just a peep into what is happening in this book because I don’t want to give away spoilers. The book explores Immigration, Abuse, Gentrification, Grief, Violence, Evil and Identity. It takes us from Haiti to a community in NYC and it is unflinching in its exploration of what life is like for an Immigrant living in the US. Honestly, I wanted to love this story. Once I heard it was written by a Woman from Caribbean Heritage and it explores Immigration, I was sold! I never expected to be confused by what is happening and WHY it is happening. I felt the characters were underdeveloped; it was like I was looking at them through a very thick mirror. I wanted to know more about the daughters, more about Marie-Ange’s and why she decided to stay. I also was not sold about the bit on the House not knowing everything happening inside of it- that did not make sense. I also felt there were parts what we very vague that need clarification or a lot of explanation. I felt some parts were unnecessarily cruel for no reason….

In  West Indian Lawyer  Sobion gives an overview of the very brief but impactful life of his father Keith Sobion. Keith was born in Trinidad and Tobago from very humble beginnings, through the hard work of his parents he was able to attend law school, he later practiced law, went into politics and became the first West Indian trained Principal of the Norman Manley Law School in Jamaica. You can see the impact he made with by advocating for the Caribbean Court of Justice, he was involved in the Black Power Revolution in Trinidad and was notoriously a part of the last execution that happened in Trinidad and Tobago.

When all your work of raising (children) is finally done? Will you remember yourself, how to get back to yourself? How much of yourself do you get to keep?”  These are some of the big questions that are being asked by the couples in this book, questions that seem to remain unanswered. In  Ordinary People  an ode to John Legend’s hit single we meet two London couples: Melissa & Michael: They have been together for a long time, engaged but not married because life just happens. They have two children, including a toddler. Melissa works from home and does majority of the child rearing and chores. Michael works in the city, does a long commute when he comes home, he feels like a bother. Melissa and Michael are just not connecting the way they should, the spark is just not there anymore, they love each other but maybe love is not enough. Stephanie & Damian: Live in the suburbs with their three children, life to them seems very standard. Stephanie basks in her duty as mother, it is the one job she’s been preparing for. Damian, though he loves his life, cannot help but wonder- what else? Is there another life I should be living? With the death of Damian’s father, he becomes more distant and Stephanie wants to fix this and keep it moving. They both are battling their own version of what parenting looks like, Damian I checked out and Stephanie’s main focus are the children. How do they move forward? I appreciate what the author was trying to do and I think I was drawn to reading this book because it gave some insight into what married people with children have to overcome.

Either, way... this is a book club pick and one of my favorite books for 2020.  “Me, a fisherman and she my lady friend; the sea was our matchmaker…” A Love story like no other… This is not your typical mermaid or love story and that is what made  The Mermaid of Black Conch  utterly unique. Set in 1976 we are introduced to a fictional Caribbean Island called Black Conch that is reminiscence of an island in the Lesser Antilles. The book opens with David Baptiste who is a fisherman from the small village of St. Constance, he takes his pirogue, which was the only value thing his father left when he went to the bigger island to seek a better life. David takes his pirogue out to Murder Bay daily to fish, and spend some alone time singing and playing his guitar. One day while David is singing, he attracts the attention of “sea-dweller” he thought only existed in fairy tales and island “ole talk”. David sees the Mermaid, goes through a range of emotions one being curiosity. Daily he revisits the spot where he first sights the Mermaid, she begins showing up to hear him sing and play the guitar. They form a sort of bond that continues for weeks until the Mermaid begins listening for the hum of David’s boat. Fast forward to the biggest that happens on Black Conch, the yearly Marlin Competition. This sees competitors from all over the Caribbean and as for as Miami coming to Black Conch coming to seek top prize. During the competition instead of catching a Marlin they instead catch the Mermaid. The Captain starts seeing dollar signs and all the different ways he can make use of the Mermaid for his benefit. The Captain hangs his prize on the jetty sandwiched between two marlins while he goes off to celebrate his fortune. David upon hearing about the capture of the Mermaid heads to the jetty, cuts her down and takes her home. He doesn’t have a plan, but he knows he cannot let the Mermaid come to ruin, he also knows doing this may lead to his ruin, but he takes the chance. Aycayia was a beautiful woman who loved dancing, years ago she was cursed by jealous wives who sealed her off and threw her in the sea away from their men. Aycayia have been roaming the Caribbean Sea along with turtle who was once an old woman who also got cursed. For years Aycayia made friends with sea creatures and kept to herself, that is until she heard the strumming of David’s guitar and his singing. One could prepare her for life on Black Conch after years of living underwater, one prepared her for what falling in love with a man would mean for her. What an epic well thought out love story with a realistic Caribbean twist. A Mermaid caught off the coast of a Caribbean island and she ends up falling in love with a lowly fisherman… I WANT MORE! I read this story in one day because it just had to know what became of these lovers. The writing was well executed, and the pacing perfect for the kind of story that was being told. We had history, folklore, power dynamics, and such tender moments all interspersed throughout the novel. For the theme of love, I enjoyed the story of David and Aycayia, it is not every day you read of a Caribbean man falling in love with a Mermaid and being utterly tender with the process of waiting for him to fall in love with her. I was so taken by how Roffey showcased a Caribbean man being hopelessly in love with woman and willing to do anything for her including turning his back on his village. I find we don’t the positive aspects of love being explored in this way, even if it is between a Mermaid and a Man. The theme of love continued and was explored in a somewhat nuanced way between Ms. Rain and Life. Ms. Rain’s ancestors were slave owners on Black Conch, they own almost all property and land on the island that was passed down to Ms. Rain and her siblings. Ms. Rain grew up among the children on the island and from a young age latched on to Life after one day in class he cut one of her ponytail. Ms. Rain and Life explored their love for each other which ended up in Ms. Rain getting pregnant, upon hearing of the pregnancy, Life ran away. In this love story Roffey sought to explore how history impedes love and how a man must make his own way and not take from the hands that enslaved his ancestors. I liked that Roffey did not shy from this topic of colonialism and it’s effect in today’s society. There is the exploration of greed and what people will do get their hands on money. Throughout the book there is the ever presence of women and what happens when they own their sexuality. So much to talk about with this book, but overall a must read.This was such a well written, enchanting read that I hope everyone takes the time to read. Thanks Peepal Tree Press for sending me a copy of this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,63,2,"Feb 2021Jul 09, 2020","Feb 23, 2021Jul 14, 2020","Mar 25, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49869087-the-mermaid-of-black-conch

June is a bit of an eccentric, but she finds she can be her true self around her Uncle who does not expect it, but nurtures it in a way no one else does. While June’s got a very stable family unit in her Mom, Dad and Sister, she is not as close to them as she is to her uncle. When June is told by her Mom that her uncle is dying of AIDs she is hardly able to process how little her time with her favourite human she has left. Finn decides to use the remainder of his time to do a portrait of June and her sister. One afternoon June receives the call that her uncle passed away and the grief she feels is piercing. She does not know how to process a world without her uncle, how to grief him but also keep his memory alive. Her mother, Finn’s Sister is a little perturbed at how June is taking it, and part of her thinks it should not be so hard, after all it is HER brother. At the funeral June sees a stranger who her Mother seems hostile towards, he is told to leave. A few days later June receives a package with teapot she and Finns drinks from. June finds out who Toby is and who he was to her Uncle. Things start off rocky, but she is able to form a solid friendship with Toby based on their love for Finn and the grief they both have.

Lenworth doesn’t know how to navigate this new reality with a recently born baby without raising suspicions of the people in the town. He concocts a story about the baby’s mother, finds someone to help with raising the baby, he gets a job in carpentry at a high school nearby and begins building a life for him and the child. A seventeen-year-old mother, Plum Valentine wakes up after giving birth, requests to hold her child and is told the father is currently with the child, she should rest.

Plum spends over ten years searching for her daughter, numerous trips back to Jamaica, having a private investigator, numerous leads but nothing comes to fruition.One bright New York day as Plum is playing with her twin girls she comes up on a newspaper clipping with the face of the man she’s been looking for over twenty years.

This is an ageless Caribbean story- the misbehaving teen, sent to the Caribbean so they can start acting right, but do they act right? How will their life be affected by the abandonment? These are the questions Hemans answers in such a nuanced way. I really enjoyed journeying with Plum and Lenworth, seeing how the decisions they made impacted their lives. I loved the parts of the book that were set in Jamaica- it made me a bit homesick to be honest. I felt the ending was a bit rushed and somewhat abrupt, but I know this is a book that will lead to a lot of discussions in book club groups!Great novel!

More than 90% of the passengers on flight AA587 were of Dominican descent.  It is the second-deadliest aviation crash in United States history.  . It is from this historical event that Elizabeth Acevedo decided to pen her third novel.  Clap When You Land  opens at the airport with Camino Rios and her Aunty eagerly awaiting the landing of a plane. Camino’s father, Papi visits the Dominican Republic every summer, they get to spend all their time together because outside of summer Papi leaves in New York, working hard to ensure Camino and her aunt are well taken care off. Upon arriving at the airport Camino finds out that the plane her Papi is on crashed… there were no survivors. The night before taking his flight to The Dominican Republic, Yahaira Rios’ father tried to have a conversation with her but she is still not talking to him. The next day Yahaira is called to the principal’s offer where she sees her mother crying. She is told her father’s plane did not make it to its destinations and there are no survivors.

While they grapple with their grief Camino and Yahaira must come to terms with their new reality. Can I be honest? I did not love this book. I actually felt like a “hater” because in looking at all the five stars and all the spectacular s on Bookstagram I kept wondering “WHAT AM I MISSING?” I know Acevedo can do no wrong, and having read Poet X and With the Fire On High, I can tell you my expectation was out of this world, maybe that is why I was let down. Acevedo is known for writing characters that gets under your skin and stays here and that was not the case for me with this book. I kept on mixing up Camino and Yahaira, because they didn’t seem fully formed. I couldn’t grieve with them because I didn’t know more about their relationship with their father. I finished this book wondering, “that’s it?” and for me that was very disappointing. The more think about the book is the more I didn’t like it. I felt there was no character development or much plot... I just... What I will say is this, the premise of this book is AMAZING. I absolutely loved that it was based on something that happened that I did not know about. Also I can see how a Caribbean man would have a family in two countries without either family knowing about it. I also loved the title because like the author, when I fly  “My favorite moment was when the plane landed and the other passengers clapped. Instinctively I joined them. Even if the exact performance we were applauding was unclear, it was understood; it was praise for a higher being for allowing us to arrive safely, as a reaction to the pilot’s performance, applause for ourselves at having finally returned—I didn’t know then, and I don’t know now, the exact reason for that spontaneous reaction, but I know I was enamored with the many ways Dominicans celebrate touching down onto our island” If you are a Elizabeth Acevedo fan you will enjoy this, but for me, it was flat....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Jul 28, 2020","Mar 16, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50818439-clap-when-you-land

Re-reading this book the secon Updated August 31, 2020 I ready this book and felt that it would be a great BookOfCinz Book Club pick and I was right! Re-reading this book the second time around, I did enjoy it a lot more. One Year of Ugly is Caroline’s Mackenzie’s debut novel, due to be released on July 14, 2020. In  One Year of Ugly  we meet the Palacio family, who are originally from Venezuela but fled the country to start a new life in the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The entire Palacio family settles somewhat comfortably into life in Trinidad and for the most part is trying to carve out a new life for themselves. Their semblance of security is shattered when the self-appointed head of the family, Aunt Celia dies, and they learn the ugly truth. The family finds out that Aunt Celia lied about the legality of their immigration documents and they have all been living in Trinidad and Tobago illegally. Added to this, Aunt Celia owes a lot of money to local criminal called Ugly which is now passed on to them. Ugly lets the Palacios family knows in no uncertain terms that they are at his will and in order to pay off their debts they will have to do what he requires or else….Through the narration of 24 year old Yolo Palacios we get a direct look into what life is like for a whole year under the Ugly regime. From the family being a safe house for illegal immigrants coming into the country, to working unpaid in a gentleman’s club, the Palacios family is subjected to a lot. To ensure that things goes smoothly, Ugly puts his right-hand man, Roman in charge. Yolo, while acutely aware of the position her family is in, cannot deny the insane attraction she feels for Roman. A little confused Yolo turns to her Aunt Celia’s journals for advice but how can she take the word of her Aunt who put her in this position to begin with? I must be honest, when I first read the blurb and some of the Goodreads s, I was little nervous that Mackenzie used comedy as the device to tell this story. I approached the reading of this book with much trepidation because: “what could possibly be funny about a group of illegal Venezuelan immigrants living under the duress of a local drug lord?” “will be it socially insensitive?” “will illegal Venezuelan find it tone deaf”” ""will this lead to a greater appreciation of the struggle Venezuelans face living in Trinidad?All these questions and more really crossed my mind, however in reading this book all I got was well written, hilarious look into the fictional life of this family, filled with a lot of heart-warming moments. I loved being immersed in the world of the Palacios family through Yolo- her narration was hilarious, wry and hella sarcastic. At time points I felt the plot lagged a little and some of the situations worked out to nicely, especially the ending which tied up a little too clean for my taste. While the author touched on it throughout the book I felt we missed opportunities to really highlight some struggle of Venezuelans in a real way. I do recognize there is only so much you can do in 350+ pages. However, overall, I did enjoy this read a lot more than I thought I would. If you are looking to spend time with some engaging characters who are held in a dubious situation but manages to come out on the other side, against all odds – this book is your pick!...more",Notes are private!,0,31,2,"Aug 2020Mar 11, 2020","Aug 27, 2020Mar 14, 2020","Mar 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52764164-one-year-of-ugly

PT Sir  is a teacher at an all girl’s school that Jivan once attended. His life is predictable and as a Physical Education teacher he does not get much respect from his peers or the students. One evening, with a train delay he finds himself at a rally for a right-wing political party- he is inspired and wants to do more than just exists. PT Sir finds himself doing things to gain power and access to this political party.  Lovely  is an outcast, her dream is to become an actress on the big screens. With the help of Jivan tutoring Lovely is able to learn a bit of English which she uses when reading scripts. Lovely attends acting classes and is at the top of her class, but she cannot seem to get a leading role. When one of her acting clips went viral, she is offered a major role in exchange for her allegiance.Majumbar’s debut novel offers a fresh look into Indian, with characters who are colourful and jumping off the pages. It is a story about friendship, justice, poverty and how power corrupts. I could not get enough of PT Sir and Lovely’s story line, it was beyond interesting. The plot was not predictive, and I appreciated that, I did not see the ending coming and I appreciate the author for not taking the cliché route. A great debut novel set in India from a fresh new voice!

Lauren Francis-Sharma weaves a captivating ta Updated October 27, 2020 Re-read for BookOfCinz Book club and I am excited to see what everyone things. Lauren Francis-Sharma weaves a captivating tale in  The Book of Small Axe  and when I finished reading it I was exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. WOW!Starting in the late 1700s  The Book of Small Axe  spans over 33 years and goes between the present 1830 and the past 1796. Starting in Trinidad and Tobago and ending in Montana, Rosa Rendon is the glue who holds this story together. Rosa is the youngest in the Rendon family living in Trinidad and Tobago, they are free black land and animal owners doing well for themselves. Rosa works closely with her father in the field assisting with the raising of the horses and all the farm work. By all intents, the Rendon family is living in the lap of luxury, that is until Trinidad & Tobago’s ownership switches from Spanish to British rule. Under the British rule, the Rendon family is subjected to land taxes, because they are black, they are not allowed to own land and other assets, their freedom is slowly dwindling. Rosa’s family is slowly becoming undone, their once prosperous existence is no longer and trying to adjust from free individuals to following the rules of the British proves disastrous. Rosa is forced to leave her family and the only place she’s ever known for somewhere unknown. Fast forward to 1830, Rosa is living amongst the Apsáalooke tribe with her three children, her husband, Edward Rose, a Crow chief. She is particularly watchful of her son Victor who is coming of age and must have a particular vision, however, this vision will not happen. Victor’s path and vision is blocked by his history and a secret Rosa kept from him. After a life changing incident, Rosa embarks on a journey with Victor to tell him about her past and reveal the secret she’s been keeping, a secret that could make or break Victor. Small axe falls big tree.... and I think this book did such a great job of putting together small plots, with rich character that made for an unforgettable blend. I can say I have never read a book that features a Trinidadian native who ends up living with the people of Crow Nation. The entire time I was reading I kept wondering, “how did Rosa end up here?” and that for me was an added thrill, how would the author make this happen? To see that unfold was beautiful. I felt enveloped in this experience of reading this book. I did not want to it to end, I wanted more. There are so many things I loved about this book including:- Living in Trinidad and Tobago for over 6 years, it was great reading a historical fiction that perfectly captures what life was like for a free black family living under the Spanish reign and how that family’s life changed with the Spanish reign. -I loved hearing about life in Trinidad back in the 1700’s it felt authentic and rich. - As someone who loves travelling, I have always thought about what it would be like to travel in the 1800s and I think the author did an amazing job of capturing this. I felt I was on the journey with Rosa.-The theme of colourism and race was expertly explored. There were a lot of uncomfortable moments, cringey to be honest, but it all made the experience even richer. -To see a country go from Spanish to British rule and how that impacted the lives of the people living in the country- that was an immersive experience for me that I absolutely enjoyed. One day you speaking Spanish and the next day you are required to learn and write English… colonialism yes -Family dynamics and relationship were so nuanced and rich. The characters were flawed, they made decision that weren’t right but you still rooted for them. Honestly, I can go on and on about how great this book is but I will stop here. I have never read a book like this and I HIGHLY recommend it.

And what abut men, or people who don’t fall into the binary? Who thrives and who doesn’t?”  After finishing this magical novel, I can say without a doubt the Author did an amazing job of answering all these questions...and more. In  The Gilded Ones  we meet Deka, who is from the snowy mountains of the Northern part of Otera. Deka is still grieving the lost of her mother who recently died, her mother was originally from the Southern Provinces of Otera. Deka now lives alone with her father and is preparing for The Ritual of Purity, which happens across all the Provinces in Otera. The Ritual of Purity ensures that all teenage girls are “pure”, this is done under a religious ceremony where the girls are cut to see if they bleed red, or gold. This ceremony is a way for the Provinces to find out who are Alaki and who aren’t. Alaki are women who are “stronger, faster and hardier than regular humans and bleed golden blood.” On the day of the Ritual of Purity Deka bleeds golden and is proved to be an Alaki. She is taken by the religious leaders who bleeds her and sells her blood, and kills her…but she doesn’t die. Deka is held captive until a woman from the capital Hemaira recuses her and take her to be a part of the Emperor’s army. Deka is thrust from the only world she knows, she wonders how she is able to bleed golden, how can she recover from death, why this mysterious woman wants her to be a part of her army. She arrives in the capital to start training with hundreds of other Akai some who are like her, able to recover from death, others who have superhuman strength, speed, and power. They all train to be among the elite for the Emperor’s Army whose main goal is to rid Otera of Deathshrieks who have been plaguing them for decades. Deka stands out amongst the Alaki because of her special power, she must now bear responsibility of riding Otera of Deathshrieks, she must fight the battle of her life, one she could not prepare herself for. Everything about this book is beautiful as you can see from the cover. Forna did such a solid job of creating a world where Black Girls are seen as strong, fearless, as leaders and women who can hold their own. I love how she was about to able to show Deka transformation from a naive girl, not knowing her place in the world and sometimes ashamed of her skin color, to a strong fearless leader. Forna explored so many relevant topics and in such a nuanced way, particularly, patriarchy, religion, racism, colourism, classism, feminism, sisterhood and trauma. I particularly loved this plot because of how (black) female focused it was and how the author portrayed girls and women in positive light. Forna created a world unlike any I have visited before and I did not want to leave. I can see this one being a favourite for many once it is released in July 2020. I don’t see a lot of these YA novels on the shelf and we need more of them starting with this. This one is for the culture and it is well done, well executed and trust me, you are going to want to read it.

The Adler Family- includes Edward, his brother and his parents, they board flight 2977 to Los Angeles, the flight didn’t make it, the plane crashes and Edward is the only survivor. The book is told from two perspectives, it starts with what happens while the Alder family is on the plane and what happens to Edward after the tragedy. On the plane we are introduced to different passengers, all heading to Los Angeles for a myriad of reasons, the young business man looking to close a deal, the injured solider heading back home, a pregnant woman hoping her boyfriend will propose once she lands, a mid-aged hippie running away from her husband, an old business tycoon traveling with his nurse. In the aftermath we see how Edward is trying to cope and deal with a brutal reality. He does not know how to exist in a world that views him as lucky, divine and exceptional.

In his State of Mind, Minister Tufton gives a first-hand account the political landscape in Jamaica, how competitive it can be, and what he views as proper governance. This memoir tells of Tufton’s formative year growing up in Mandeville in a single parent home, how he worked hard in high school, graduating as valedictorian. He details how he was able to work toward putting himself through first year in UWI and landing a scholarship.  Tufton walks us through what lead him to a life in politics, from joining Young Jamaica while in University, to being a part of the formation of the National Democratic Movement and finding a home at the Jamaica Labour Party. We see the how precarious life in politics can be, how one day your party is in power and the next day you are recovering from losing as MP by just 13 votes. Life as a Politician in Jamaica can be rewarding, it’s got its challenges but Tufton in his honesty shows you exactly what you can expect.I am not a big fan of political memoirs, I have little to no interest in politics to be honest but when my friend got me a (signed) copy of this book I figured I should at least give it a read. I have been familiar with Tufton through his work as Minister of Agriculture & Fisheries and as Minister of Health through the campaign “Jamaica Moves”. I remember seeing a photo of the Minister running and I thought “wow I like how on brand this is, not only is he encouraging Jamaica to move, he is actually moving himself” -I appreciated that. I distinctly remember my Grandmother saying that Tufton seems like a genuine person and that stuck with me because that honesty came across in how he wrote this memoir. Tufton tackles everything from race, classism, colourism, the diaspora, inequality, corruption, defeat, Jamaican’s culture, education system, Family culture and the tribalism that is rampant in our politics. I really enjoyed reading this book, more than I thought I would. I loved the historical and cultural look at Jamaica’s politics. I learned so much while reading this book, and I was reminded of some historical moments and it was great getting an insider look at what that was like. I particularly liked when Tufton spoke about policies that he is clearly passionate about and the process it went through to make it a reality. Something that always fascinated me and I liked that Tufton mentioned it, having only 4-5 years in office really is a disadvantage for any Party, because as soon as you are ready to put policies in place and things are going as planned, it is time to call an election. This throws off everything and the entire country will have to start from scratch. It’s clear something needs to be done regarding this. Other things that he mentioned that I enjoyed hearing about from an Insider:-	Golding leaving the JLP-	The fall out of Golding saying he doesn’t want any homosexual in his cabinet -	Seaga stepping down from the helm -	What the work of a MP is, and how he went about winning his first seat-	How cassava came to be a staple in Jamaica’s food -	The Dudus-Manatt case and the fall out in all of that-	How the JLP, through social media was able to deliver a solid campaign message and thereby winning the 2014 general elections. This is a well done, well written, well research look and I highly recommend giving this book a read. Even if you are not big into politics it really gives a great historical look in Jamaica’s rich history. A must read for me.  What I learned reading this book  Donald Sangster died just six weeks after taking office When the JLP won in 2007, that was the first time they were in office since 1980Edward Seaga was the second longest serving head of a political movement in the Western hemisphere when he did so (Paraguay’s dictator Alfredo Stroessner held the record)In just the last three years before Air Jamaica was sold, Jamaican taxpayers spent some $JA40 Billion to keep the airline goingCuba, was once the producer of 25% of the world’s sugar...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 10, 2020","Apr 12, 2020","Feb 06, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51026980-state-of-mind

I finished reading this book four days ago and my heart is still aching. I still cannot stop thinking about the characters, about the writing about the greatness I just read. I am suffering from the biggest book hangover from one of my favorite books of 2020. In  Transcendent Kingdom  Yaa Gyasi’s second novel we meet a Ghanaian family living in Alabama. The story is told from Gifty’s perspective, she takes us into the world of her immigrant family and shows us how they moved from being together to things falling apart. Gifty’s parents met in Ghana, her mother decided America would be a great place to raise a family. She works hard and sends for the father who Gifty refers to as Chin Chin man. The father comes to Alabama but does not climatize as the rest of the family, for him, America is not all that it is cracked up to be. He tells his family he will be visiting Ghana but never returns. ifty’s brother Nana is a star athlete who bring victory upon victory to his home team. He performs so well he starts getting calls from major universities to play for them. Nana’s life is on track for greatness, until one day after an injury he is placed on bedrest and told to take OxyContin which he gets addicted to. Gifty and her mother tries everything in their power to help Nana recover from this addiction, he goes to a treatment camp, they pray for him, nothing works. A police man visits to let the family know Nana overdose. With the Chin Chin man in Ghana, Nana dead, Gifty and her mother is now a family of two, but with the mother barely present. She goes through significant bouts of depression, Gifty is left to raise herself. She manages to submerge herself in the sciences and ends up being a candidate in neuroscience at Stanford School of Medicine. Gifty intends to study reward seeking behaviour as a way to understand what happened to her bother and is currently happening to her mother. A major theme in this book is faith and religion and I think it was theme that was executed with excellency. As Christian I felt the book does a great job of showing us realistic way people’s faith gets tested and why some turn away from God. I was blown away by the accuracy and poignancy as the author’s exploration of faith and belief. The mother-daughter theme was beautifully portrayed in such layered and nuanced way. At times my heart broke for Gifty and how her mother handled the death of her son, and the suffering of her daughter. Honestly, I could go on and on about this book. I went in expecting to be underwhelmed or comparing this to  Homegoing  but I was SHOOK at how Gyasi took a total 180 and brought us something fresh, excellent and real.

This can be a statement or a warning depending on how you read it. In Elena Molchanova's debut novel  Trinidead  we meet British academic Harvey Pryce who recently got divorced from his loveless marriage and is looking to start over somewhere new- away from the London weather. He was offered a job as a Lecturer at The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine in Trinidad and Tobago and that is how he ended up on a island he's hardly heard of before, preparing to start a new life. We follow Harvey as he gets climatized to life in Trinidad and Tobago- from the easy going nature of the people, to the different cultural nuances and island time. It is an adventure watching Harvey settle into and build his new community around him. Life continues as normal until Harvey hears of his son, Nelson mental breakdown and his impending visit which will throw Harvey's life out of sorts. Added to this, there is a new couple-Peter and Miles, who recently moved in next door to Harvey and while they seem charming there is something lurking there that Harvey cannot seem to put his finger on. Regardless, Harvey being Harvey welcomes the couple into his circle of friends showing them around the island. However, with each interaction Harvey cannot help but think there is something more to the couple next door. I flew through this book, I could not get enough of Trinidad and Tobago. It is clear the author lived here and did her research. As a Jamaican who was brought over to Trinidad six years now it was so refreshing to get a look into how other people climatized to a country that is so different from anywhere else. I loved Harvey as a character, I felt he was well thought our and believable. What I also liked was that this was a thrilling read, one I could not put down. My only draw back was the initial transition in POVs it felt very jarring and I thought it could have been a little smoother but once you get use to the voices you should be good to go.

With the death of her husband Vesta decided to relocate to a remote town to live on a lake side cabin. Vesta is a recluse and her main interaction is with her dog Charlie. Her routine is set, morning walks, gardening, breakfast, listening to Pastor Jimmy and sleeping. It is during one of Vesta’s morning walk with Charlie that she finds a note that read: “""Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn't me. Here is her dead body.

These Ghosts Are Family  is Maisy Card’s debut novel that features a multi-generational narration from 1700s to 2000s. These Ghosts Are Family opens with the revelation of Stanford Solomon’s three decade long secret- he is not who he says he is. Thirty years ago, Stanford Solomon, who is actually Abel Paisley assumed the identity of his best friend, Solomon who died during a work accident. Abel who was working in England at the time used the death of his friend as an opportunity to assume a new identity and sever the relationship he had with his wife and children back home in Jamaica. With age and knowing he doesn’t have long to life Abel reaches out to the daughter he left back in Jamaica. Irene Paisley, a home health aide shows up to attend to a man who turns out to be the father she’s mourned all her life. I think this was a very ambitious book, in some ways it paid off and in other ways it did not. Here is what worked for me:The individual stories of the Paisley family. I felt that Card really showed in a unique way how the decision of Abel affected those around him. There was no shortage of trauma or struggle for each character due to the lack of a father figure or being raised by a single mother. I felt that Card did a great job of showcasing how we are all “haunted” in different ways by different things. The authenticity and research of the book. I loved how authentic the book felt. As a Jamaican I am always keen to read books that feel Jamaican and I felt Card did a great job of capturing all the cultural and historical nuances of Jamaica and Jamaicans.The freshness and intoxicating read. I devoured this book; I could not stop reading it. For a debut novel it was very strong and well written for the most part. I know people who are not familiar with Patois might struggle a bit but that does not take away from how great the writing is in this book. While I enjoyed the book, there are some things that did not work for me:I felt the book was not as cohesive enough and would have worked better as a short story collection. While I get the “Homegoing” reference in that we hear from one person at the beginning of the book but we don’t necessarily hear from them as the story continues with the following generation. I felt this was not as seamlessly executed as I wanted it to be. I felt the ending was very abrupt and I am still not sure what happened there. Overall, a really solid debut novel. I really enjoyed reading it and the “what did not work” really did not take away in a big way how enthralled I was with Card’s “These Ghosts Are Family”.

Every story was different, nuanced, and complex. Leone Ross can WRITE, and she shows off in this collection- I thoroughly enjoyed her showing off- I was HERE for it! She wrote contemporary, fiction, and magical realism stories in this collection. At the end of each story I was left mouth hanging and blown away. If you check my book I actually wrote “whoa!” at the end of some of these stories. I love how Leone Ross through these stories questions what it is to be a woman, how society places a lot of expectations on us, and how we sometimes fight to live up to them. There is the story of President Daisy who is traveling to Montego Bay by train to meet with a uncle, while on the train a stranger asks about her life and she mentions the list of things her grandmother teaches her- more than 50% of these teachings had to do with how to be a “proper lady”. On the other had I also love how she shows us characters who are free of these expectations and walking their own path. There is the Protagonist and her friend Marcia in the story  Art, For Fuck’s Sake  who shows us how they examine sexuality and pleasure. There is Marcia who only does one-night stands because it is less messy to the Protagonist who starts the story celibate and ends the story in a truly steamy situation. I truly enjoyed this collection, you know how I know? Writing down the list of my stand outs is like re-writing the content page.

Roll it  | A fashion show where the women are wearing designs that exudes Jamaican’s folklore and history including Rolling Calf and Annie Palmer.  Drag  | This story features a gender non-confirming protagonist who owns their sexuality like you wouldn’t believe. President Daisy | One of my FAVORITE story. I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS. I am absolutely enamoured with Daisy and the gay man she meets on the train. What I love is that President tickled the homophobic man into leaving him alone. WOW.  Minty Minty  | A woman celebrating her birthday in Africa, she intends to buy a baby (yeah can you believe that?) but it took another turn. Breathing  | YOEW! This story took me out!!! A man loses his wife in a freak accident, a few days later the wife shows up at his door. Also it seems everyone’s loved ones returned from the dead….

In  The Power of Showing Up  Siegel shares with us the different ways we can show up for our children, making them well adjusted adults. He stresses the four S's -SAFE, SEEN, SOOTHED and SECURED- in doing these four things he outlines how parents can raise better children.

Set in bustling Seoul, Korea we meet four young women who beat all the odds and are currently living in the city, but they continue to face a lot more than they are equipped to handle. We meet Kyuri who spends her nights getting drunk with rich businessmen at a salon that hires only beautiful women. Kyuri entertain men on a nightly basis and maintains a rigorous beauty regime in the day. She thinks of herself cold-hearted but then she does something that threatens her time at the salon. Kyuri’s roommate Miho returns to Seoul after spending her time in New York studying art. It is during her time in NYC that she meets and starts dating one of the richest heirs in Korea. Miho has a lot going for her, her long glorious hair and her art that everyone seems to love. Living together are best friends Ara and Suyrin. Ara is a hair stylist who is mute and remains fascinated by the lead of a boy-band she hopes to meet one day. Suyrin is obsessed with plastic surgery and spends her time researching and saving up for a surgery she believes will change her life. Last of the four women is Wonna, newly married and struggling to make ends meet even with the help of her husband. Wonna works in a toxic environment and is trying to get pregnant, even though she doesn’t know how she will be able to provide for the child. Frances Cha explores friendship dynamic of the four women in the must heart-felt and moving way. I love how refreshing the prose is, you get a raw look into the beauty industry and how hard it is for some women to assimilate and keep up with the insane beauty standard placed on them. The writing was utterly addictive, I could not get enough of each of the woman’s backstory and how they process their individual and collective reality. This is a well-crafted, refreshing look at friendship and the beauty industry. I honestly could not get enough….I really wish the author wrote more and added more pages to this novel.

I believed the story Brandon Taylor was telling even though it was fiction. He writes with authority on loneliness, racism, trying to find yourself, performing for people and trying to fit in. It was so real. I found myself getting so riled up at various scenes where Wallace was treated badly or gaslighted.

In  Such A Fun Age  we meet twenty-five year old, black babysitter, Emira whose insurance is about to expire and needs to find a “real job”, the problem is, she has no idea what she wants to do with her life….none. Emira baby sits for Alix Chamberlain, a lifestyle blogger and influencer who recently move to Philly with her two daughters and husband Tucker who is a News Presenter.Emira is smitten with Briar who she’s formed a strong relationship with and looks forward to babysitting.

In reading the s for this book I realize I am in the absolute minority. I did not like it….there, I said it. I wanted to be in the group that loved this book. Here are the list of things that did not work for me:1. While it was a pretty easy read, it felt very surface level. I am of the opinion that a book can be an easy read and deep. I felt a lot of the issues eg. Racism and white privilege was glossed over and not addressed with the importance that it deserved. For example- Kelley using the N-word and Tucker being a racist. 2. I understand that Emira is just twenty-five years old but I felt her lack of ambition was startling. Sis had no clue what she wanted to do with her life… while that is (not) fine, she also didn’t have any goals… I just could not even take her serious. The lack of ambition really threw me off. 3. Emira as a character was so aimless, unformed, one dimensional and a general push over- this infuriated me. Even though Emira was the character we spent the most time with, I still did not feel like I know her. 4. Alix was just eye-rolling to be honest. 5. The problem from the past that came into Alix and Emira’s life was so ridiculous I could not even handle it. Here is Alix still hung up on something that happened to her while she was in high school- COME. ON. I could go on and on but I will stop with this list.

In Marcelo Hernandez Castillo’s  Children of the Land  he details his family crossing over from Mexico into the US undocumented. He gives an unflinching look into what life is like living in America undocumented. The Castillo family have been crossing the Mexican border since before the 1980s for work, and mostly to carve out a better life for themselves. When Marcelo was five his family decided to leave Mexico and head to the USA to make a live for themselves. Once they arrived in California, they went about trying to figure out to hide in plain sight. How do they get jobs, attend school, get health insurance, and live in a country where you need to be documented to receive access to basic needs? For most of Marcelo’s life he lived in fear of being picked up by ICE and being deported. If I had to put this book in one word it would be visceral. My entire heart was broken for what Marcelo, his family and especially Ama had to go through. It is clear Marcelo is a poet from the way he writes, he writes with just delicacy and honesty you have no choice but to feel for him on a deeper level.

I think that is what made it so real- this was Marcelo’s experience; it was personal and deeply moving. I implore everyone to give this memoir a read, this is what I call essential reading.

The civil war was long and was devastating for many Liberians, including Wayteu Moore and her family. In  The Dragons, The Giant, The Women: A Memoir  is Moore’s second novel and first memoir that details in a very rich and moving way how the Liberian Civil war affected the trajectory of her family and how their lives were changed.

Her mother is not present for the celebrations because she is studying on a scholarship in New York. In the middle of the celebration war breaks out and the family is forced to flee without any warning. They leave on foot with a bag each, walking and hiding until their reached the village of Lai.

While a lot of the book surrounds Wayetu’s experience in the civil war, how being displaced affect her, how to this present day it still affects her- the book is also way more than that. It gives insights into mother-daughter relationship, living like an immigrant and what is it like for a black woman growing up in a country that doesn’t value the blackness of her skin.

A generational tale that spans forty years and converges when the twin sister daughters', through fate meet. Brit Bennett took her time to write such an intoxicating book. I could not stay away from the book and I found myself walking around with it just to get brief moments to read. I wanted to inhale the book but I also wanted to never end- it was THAT good. The storyline was strong and convincing you felt like you knew the characters and you become so attached to them and their lives. The pacing kept you hooked and I had to remind myself to exhale because I just had to know exactly what happened. I was a little nervous because of how the structure was- many different voices and POVs but each was so unique and convincing and I could not get enough of it. I know we are only in February 2020 but this is already a favorite for me. I want everyone to read this book so we can gush about it together!...more",Notes are private!,0,94,2,"Sep 2020Feb 21, 2020","Sep 25, 2020Feb 26, 2020","Dec 10, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

Dezna left Jamaica in the 1980s after a series of failed relationships and attempts to make a better life. She started working with the Urken family taking care of their two kids, Ross and Nicole. Over the years she did this, she and Ross became so close, he not only looked to her as another mother but saw Jamaica as his second home. After the passing of Dezna, Ross met some of her family and realized that there was a whole other life Dezna had before coming to the US, it is through writing this book he set out to piece together her history.

The book follows the fate of a Nigerian family as they go from enjoying a comfortable life to falling into poverty. Set in the 90s we meet a family of 6- mother, father, twin sisters Bibike and Ariyike and their two younger brothers-Andrew and Peter. Life for them is comfortable, they don't have much to worry about as their mother is the secretary of a political figure in Nigeria. With a change in government their mother loses her job and is forced to do jobs below her standing. The father is a dreamer, of little help and is constantly thinking of get rich schemes. It is through one of these ""business ventures"" that the father uses the family home as collateral because a Charismatic Pastor says so. In losing the family home, everything crashes including the family structure, the comfort of having a home and pursuing an education. The mother leaves for a new life in the US, the father leaves the four children with his mother as he goes off to ""provide for them"". Life comes at these four children fast, they now face a new reality that were not prepared for.  Black Sunday  is told from the perspectives of the four children- twin sisters Bibike and Ariyike and their younger brothers Andrew and Peter.

I did not get a sharp voice from each POV- each character sort of blended into the other.

That interpretation was a phenomenon with real implications for believers.  That quote basically summarizes why we are here today and why this book was written. Before reading this book I did not know about Megan and the Westboro Baptist Church. I decided to give this book a read because of the blurb and because as a Follower of Christ I wanted to hear from someone who ""left the church"". Needless to say, I wasn't prepared for the doctrine Westboro Baptist church preached and believed in. Megan gives a deeply personal look into how she was raised, how she ended up with these beliefs, how the Bible- or the improper use of the scriptures gave her a firm standing in her hate and how her family beliefs shaped hers as well. There is so much to unpack and I think Megan tries with this memoir but so much more still needs to discuss. In reading her accounting I kept wondering-, ""how did they get it so ""wrong"". God is love and He requires us to love so for church to build their beliefs on something so counter to the God they serve was an eye opener. Also, this is nothing new, for centuries people have been quoting the Bible for their benefit. Overall I liked how Megan came to the realization and her whole journey through that. I like that she questions and makes me question what I hear. I would have liked to find out more about what Megan's life is like now. What are her beliefs, how is she unpacking this world as it is- but alas, this is not ""Life After Westboro Baptist Church: A memoir"".

I have been such a great fan of Allende's I know this book was deliver. A Long Petal In The Sea opened in the late 1930s during the Spain Civil War where Spain is being ripped apart. Thousands of Spanish people are fleeing to safety to other nearby countries, there is not much food and not a lot of places to ide from the Fascists. Embroiled in all of this is the Dalmau family. Father who is a piano teacher and lover of the arts, Mother who is the amiable giver and continues to dote on her two sons. The two sons went off to war, one died leaving his pregnant love interest Roser pregnant with no way to leave Spain. When renowned Chilean poet Pablo Neruda hearing about the civil war and wanting to help some Spanish people decided to sponsor the SS Winnipeg leave from Spain to Chile, taking with them over 2000 refugees who would help Chile create a better tomorrow. In order to get on the ship, Victor decides to marry his brother's wife Roser to ensure they get a new start away from the Civil War. Upon setting sail to Chile Europe was plunged into World War. Victor and Roser never heard of Chile until they started sailing off to this new continent. There are a lot of things for these two to get climatize to but being hard workers Victor and Roser carved out a great life in Chile while they patiently wait for a day when they can maybe be divorced and start a life separate from each other. I expected to be utterly enthralled with this book but if I am being honest, I was not. I loved hearing about the Spanish Civil War and how it had a ripple effect thorough the world including parts of South America. I absolutely LOVED reading about the history of Spain and Chile. There are so many things I did not know about Chile as a country so that really was an eye opener and I loved it. I felt that Allende in wanting to tell us about the history kinda let the characters suffered. It is clear that a lot of research went into writing in tis book, but I felt the editing could have been better. A lot of things included in the book was not necessary and didnt help with character develop or letting me have a deeper connection with the characters.

This is a truly moving collection that deserves to be read.  I was simply storing up my tears, I would need them later. Somehow I knew this.  I am speechless and in tears after reading Bassey Ikpi's  I'm Telling the Truth, but I'm Lying . Reading this collection of deeply personal essays was like picking up your best friend's well written diary and getting genuine and utterly vulnerable look into their life. I am blown away by not only well written, utterly beautiful and moving the writing is, but how Ikpi is able to remain honest and real throughout the entire collection. This book takes guts to write, putting your truth out there takes bravery and I remain in awe at the author's courage. I picked up this book because of the snarky title but I didn't know the author or what the book would be about and I am happy I did because I didn't want to prepare myself for how blown away I would be. In this collection of essays Ikpi who suffers from bipolar talks about her life, from childhood when she migrated from Nigeria to the US, to her various relationships and ultimately getting diagnosed with bipolar and detailing what that on-going battle is like for her. It is not every day you pick up a deeply personal collection of essays written by a Nigerian woman that details her battle with bipolar and I was here for all of it. What really took my breath away was when Ikpi's doctor listed the signs of bipolar and all the signs were things she thought of as her personality trait. WOW. Almost all the essays were stand-outs but I particularly loved,  Young Girls They Do Get Weary, The Hands That Held Me, Yaka, Like A War, This Is What Happens When, Beauty in Breakdown & It Has a Name  These essays hit home for me in so many ways- particularly the exploration of the mother and daughter relationship. That theme was present throughout the book and my heart really went out to the author and her mother because mother-daughter relationships are so freaking hard! When the author say  I forgive her always because how can you not forgive someone whose whole life was a sprint towards survival?  I felt that!I also really really loved the essay that addresses her relationship with a man who was unwilling to commit and who I felt gaslighted TF out of her. When she said This is what he does. He shows you his hand and makes you feel ashamed for looking at it.  my breath left my body- WOW. Overall, a truly moving, deeply personal and beautiful collection of MUST READ essays.

I devoured Jia Tolentino’s  Trick Mirror  I was blown away by the  Trick Mirror is the perfect commentary on the twenty-first century- two thumbs up! I devoured Jia Tolentino’s  Trick Mirror  I was blown away by the writing and how well thought out each essay is. It is clear that Tolentino’s fingers are on the pulse of today’s culture from her commentary on the use of the internet/social media, feminism, “difficult women”, the rise of “scams” and the bridal culture. As a Millennial Tolentino came for my neck (as the young people would put it) in most of her essays. A lot of what is being explored is not new but they are written in such an insightful and educational way. I love a Writer who is also a reader and from Tolentino’s references it is clear she reads (a lot). My only negative comment is that sometimes I feel as if the Author over explained things that are common knowledge. Other than that, these essays are fully researched, thought out, biting and I particularly liked that we get a history lesson in each of these essays. There are ten essays in  Trick Mirror  while I really enjoyed all, my favorites were: The I in the Internet  This essay explores the current use of internet/social media and how it is basically turning us in a self serving generation. I cannot remember reading an essay that really gets to the truth of what the internet is doing to a majority of the population. Persons want an audience, they feel they deserve an audience for doing absolutely nothing. This took me out when Tolentino said  “I’ve been thinking about five intersecting problems: first, how the internet is built to distend our sense of identity; second, how it encourages us to overvalue our opinions; third, how it maximizes our sense of opposition; fourth, how it cheapens our understanding of solidarity; and, finally, how it destroys our sense of scale.” This basically sums up exactly what the internet is doing to us. If you have to read only one essay in this collection- I would refer you to this one. Always Be Optimizing  This particular essay spoke to me cause… mi tyad. Women are constantly being held to a higher beauty standard, so much is expected of us- how we are to look, speak, dress, and present ourselves. There are so many advances in the beauty sector and how am I to keep up with all of these while having a full time job? I loved how particularly real this essay was, but it really spoke to me as a woman.  “The ideal woman, in other words, is always optimizing. She takes advantage of technology, both in the way she broadcasts her image and in the meticulous improvement of that image itself.  I mean…. RIGHT?!!!!The Story of a Generation in Seven Scams  If you know me, you KNOW I am here for the scam stories, particularly when they are laced with White Privilege. If you have been living under a rock and want to hear about some of the biggest scams of our generation you just need to read this essay. Of course my girl Elizabeth Holmes made an appearance as ""A maniacally disciplined blonde with stressed-out hair …”  EL. OH. EL. Seriously though, aside from the rise in scams, Tolentino gives us a historical look and the continued rise in this trend. I love that the author said It can be hard, of course, to draw a precise line between a scam and a product with a highly exaggerated sales pitch … RIGHT? Cause let’s be real Fyre Festival and Theranos sold the hell out of their product…. We Come from Old Virgina  Rape culture, universities, the #MeTooMovement and journalism all rolled up into a must read essay. I Thee Dread  Of course this essay touched my feminist heart. I recommend you read this essay and then go read  All The Rage . This essay really got to the core of how marriage and being a bride is marketed. I particularly loved getting the history lesson on a lot of these things got started and how they are now called “tradition”. I was H.E.R.E. for Tolentino’s rant on marriage and being a bride  ""starting from the idea that a man just proposes to a woman and she’s supposed to be just lying in wait for the moment he decides he’s ready to commit to a situation where he statistically benefits and she statistically becomes less happy than she would be if she was single, and then she’s the one who has to wear this tacky ring to signify male ownership, and she’s supposed to be excited about it…” I could not get enough of this essay- I was shaking my head in agreement for the entire read mi neck almost drop off. I suggest everyone reads this essay cause I learned so much and it really did widen my gaze this wedding industry. If you haven’t guessed it already, I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of essays.

I liked that Perel spoke about couples who get married without having a conversation about what fidelity looks like for them etc. One thing that really stood out for me and a point I cannot shut up about is this Infidelity is a direct attack on one of our most important psychic structures: our memory of the past.

If you are a CEO, Entrepreneur, Manager, in HR, part of a team or looking to learn about how you can advance in your current role, Robert Iger provides a roadmap and lessons that everyone can benefit from. As someone who loves learning about brands and how to tell a great brand story, getting a behind the scenes look into Walt Disney the brand was exhilarating. Five key insights:1. Robert Iger have worked for the same company for 45 years, he started out as a studio supervisor and is currently the 6th CEO to run the company since Walt founded it in 1923. Throughout the book Iger referenced how his career progressed and how we prepared himself for each opportunity that was presented to him. This really resonated with me because even though he was at a company for 45 years, he was able to show his growth, how he changed with the times and why he is and will continue to be an asset to Disney. 2. Iger made numerous mention of his Chief Communication Officer Zenia Mucha, he said “she always has the interests of the company at heart”. As someone who is in Marketing and Communications, hearing from the CEO of Walt Disney on how ways I can be more of an asset to an organization was impactful. 3. If you are in HR or will one day have the hard task of firing someone, Iger goes through step by step on how accomplish this difficult task. 4. Iger explores in-depth the principles that are necessary for true leadership, they included; Optimism, Courage, Focus, Decisiveness, Curiosity, Fairness, Thoughtfulness and Integrity. I admired the fact that curiosity made the list because one point really stuck with me was the need to innovate and in order to do this, you have to remain curious. 5.  “Don’t be in the business of playing it safe. Be in the business of creating possibilities for greatness.” This is definitely a book I will be recommending and re-reading in the future, it is packed with key lessons that everyone can learn from. I highly suggest you add it to the list of books you read to help with your development. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Nov 11, 2019","Nov 21, 2019","Aug 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44525305-the-ride-of-a-lifetime

In The Water Dancer we meet young Hiram Walker born on a plantation in Virginia, his father the owner of the plantation and his mother an enslaved individual. Hiram is separated from his mother who is sold to another plantation, he ends up in the care of an elderly lady. Later Hiram is told to report to the ""big house"" where his father have him learn the ways of the house and gives him an hour with a tutor. Hiram is gifted in a number of ways, starting with his powerful memory- he forgets nothing. This gift is nurtured by his tutor and his father for the sole purpose of being his half brother's keeper. Hiram is asked by his father to watch over his brother- that is his one task- a task he fails when his brother dies in an accident and he survives in the most miraculous way. People start asking questions about Hiram and his ""gifts"". Hiram gets a taste of freedom and he starts seeing how he can make these plans a reality.... As a big fan of Coates I was excited and nervous about his first fiction novel mainly because it was so hyped up and because of the subject of the book. How would Coates present on a topic so written about and make it ""new"" and interesting? I think this book was a great first attempt at fiction- it was beautifully written- a bit too beautiful at times because I had no clue sometimes what was being written about and this is not for lack trying. I took my time going through this book because Coates writing requires you to chew and not devour. To be honest- I was not blown out of the water (get it? lol) with this book. I didn't love the main character- Hiram did not feel real and it was a bit disappointing because the book was told from the first person. I wanted to find out more about the other characters especially ""Moses"". Hiram's gift of conduction was not explored as in-depth as I would liked. I just did not believe. Also, when a book is so hyped up I always expect MORE and after finishing the book I was left down... because the ""more"" did not come.

While I can see why the comparison is being made I absolutely did not enjoy The New Me. I felt the main character was unlikeable, generally spineless and vapid. I cringed reading this the whole time and said a prayer that my life doesn't look anything close to the protagonist. Millie is a thirty year old woman who just cannot seem to hold down a job, her life doesn't seem to be going anywhere and doesn't have a lot if any friends, she is poorly dressed and her job is basic and not fulfilling. Yes, life is sad for Millie who spends the weekend cleaning her apartment or getting drunk with her only ""friend"". While I can appreciate that this is a form of commentary on what is like for some people- specifically millennials who just cannot seem to catch a break. I didn't like how shallow the entire read felt. The characters were all very one dimensional and superficial. I felt the ""friendships"" were exaggerated and over the top. I just couldn't careless and I blame that on the author because I wanted to care... I think If you read My Year of Rest and Relaxation, you don't need to pick this book up....My favorite quote from the book is below:  You can’t ask someone to help you without letting them know you’re different than advertised, that you’ve been thinking and feeling strange things this whole time. That you’re uglier, weaker, more annoying, more basic, less interesting than promised.

Ana is part of a big a family, with her mother assuming responsibility of the children and the household- hardly taking into consideration her husband's perspective. Growing up in the 1960s a lot of persons thought the best way to ""escape"" and make a better life is to move to America. Ana gets this ""opportunity"" when one of the Ruiz brother- Juan proposes to her and makes her promise to wait on him. Only fifteen years old and promised to a man twice her age, Ana is forced to go along with this plan so her mother and younger siblings will also have the opportunity to move to America. Ana departs for America on a tourist vista with her husband Juan. Having never left the countryside of the Dominican Republic, Ana experiences a lot of firsts. She is thrust into the role of wife, homemaker and caregiver with little to no warning or education. The deck is stacked against Ana who didn't graduate from high school, living in a city with no income of her own, doesn't speak English, is at home all day without company and is being hounded by her family back home to send money. Ana's husband returns to the Dominica Republic for three months so she is left alone. During that three months Ana decides to take English classes, find work for herself, she also find herself falling for Cesar, Juan's younger brother. Added to this is Dominica is in a political upheaval and Ana worries for her family and husband back home. I did not enjoy and liked this book at all even though I generally enjoy books that tells the Immigrant story- especially if that person is from a Caribbean island. I did like that Cruz incorporated all the historical things happening in Dominica Republic during the 90s so I was able to learn more about the country's history. Aside from the historical look, I remained underwhelmed and bored for the entire read.Have you ever read a story where a lot was happening but nothing was happening- all at the same time? That is how this exactly how this book read. Things were happening, but nothing was really *happening*. The characters were very one dimensional and mostly unlikeable- even Cesar who we are asked to like for Ana. The book felt very all over the place and did not have to be ""so long"" even though it was only 320 pages. There were A LOT of plot holes and unnecessary scenes that that A. weren't resolved or B. didn't help in moving the plot along or added dimension to the characters. The writing itself felt very sloppy and not sharp. Coming down to the end of the book I did not care what became of Ana and her family because I was so checked out.

This year I randomly heard a news story about a fake German Heiress who scammed a lot of people and committed fraud and I just had to have my fill of white women with white privilege scamming people.  My Friend Anna  Is Rachel Williams' account of her ""friendship"" with Anna, the woman charged with being a fake German Heiresss and scamming a lot of people- including Rachel. I started this book Saturday evening and spent the entire night reading it- I wouldn't say it was addictive reading, I was more confused as to HOW Anna got away with so much and why Rachel let her. I have a lot to talk about and it will be disjointed, so here are the things that stands out and why I didn't give the book a higher rating: 1. For some reason I have a problem with people under 30 writing a memoir like book- something about it just makes me go ""mmmm have you even lived any life yet?"" but I know I should judge. 2. This book lacks weight, there is almost no background and really groundbreaking information on Anna. If you are looking for ""juicy"" or mindless tidbits about Anna was and how she spent her time then by all means go ahead. The book doesn't tell of her motivations, how she got started, what her early family life was etc...3. I felt Rachel's motivation in writing this book was to ride the publicity wave AND make a case for us to feel sorry that she got scammed. Let me say, it is horrible getting scammed and it is one of the worse feelings ever but when you look at the overall picture- Rachel benefitted so much from this scam *side eyes* Also, I feel like as a self aware individual living in New York you should have a healthy awareness for people who are looking to benefit/profit off you. I don't buy the story Rachel was trying to sell. 4. The title of the book  My FRIEND Anna  is a bit misleading because from what I read, I am not sure why Rachel thought she and Anna had a friendship. Everything about their relationships were so surface level, superficial and empty. Yes they seemed to have hang out a lot but seeing and being around someone a lot does not equate friendship- I thought this was common knowledge. Added to that, I don't think Rachel even liked Anna and vice verse... it was SOOO superficial. 5. Before Rachel got scammed by Anna she spent a healthy amount of time benefiting from the things Anna ""treated"" and foot the bills for. For example, Rachel would go to Anna's $300USD fitness classes on a regular basis, not to mention the dinner/drinks and other things they did together. Maybe its me, but I feel in a friendship you don't have one person picking up the bill most of the time. 6. I could not get over the fact that money got charged to Rachel's company credit card because Anna used it- approximately $16,000USD that wasn't work related and Rachel kept her job.... INSANE!!! Overall, this is just white privilege at its best. You will not stop shaking your head. ...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Aug 31, 2019",Sep 2019,"Aug 02, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/45835010-my-friend-anna

I thoroughly enjoyed  The True History of Paradise  for a debut novel this book was well written and took you on an intimate look into Jamaica during the 1980s with the political upheaval. The book's centering character is Jean, we meet her as she hears about the death of her sister Lana and the brutal beating of her best friend Faye. Jean decides (as other Jamaicans did at the time) that she is going to leave Jamaica because of the violence and unstableness of the economy and political climate. Jean, with the help of her childhood friend Paul intends to make her escape from the island on an illegal plane in a parish far away from Kingston. The book goes from the present with Jean's narration and the past from the point of view of all of Jeans's ancestors starting with those who settled in Jamaica in the 18th century. I absolutely loved reading about Jamaica from historical perspective. Cezair-Thompson did an amazing job of giving the reader a great look into the history of Jamaica specifically how it was during Post Independence. As someone who wasn't born yet but heard about what took place, reading this book was an eye opener. If you interested in reading a book with really strong female leads, that explores Jamaica's history in a creative and educational way- definitely pick this book up.

My first book by Bruce Holsinger and I am now a fan. When people compare this book to  Big Little Lies  they are absolutely right in their comparison, it is basically BBL without the murder and domestic abuse but with ALL the other drama and family dysfunction and I am HERE FOR IT!!!Set in a town in Colorado we meet four long time friends Rose, Samantha, Azra, and Lauren all with children the same age. These four ladies have been doing life together since their children were babies and they helped each other through death, divorce, health problems- the works. While each family have their dysfunction, it all comes to a head when the District decides to open a school for ""The Gifted"" in the community- only the 1% will be admitted. We see how each family cracks under the pressure and do things they would never dream of doing- all to ensure their child is granted access to this school. Told from different POVs we are exposed to the most vulnerable parts of these families. Holsinger does an amazing job of exploring themes such as family, female friendships, divorce, parenting and privilege. I could not get enough of this book- I am really hoping it gets picked up for a limited series because this entire read was so riveting!

I felt that her Ted Talk was engaging and offered really practical tips on how you can be a better conversationalist. I saw this book and I felt it would be great to refresh and improve my conversation skills. Before I continue, if you watched her Ted Talk, honestly you can skip the book because majority of what was said in the Ted Talk was just expounded on in this book. I found out while reading this book that I am a  conversational narcissist … yes I know, I am a horrible person.  Sociologist Charles Derber describes this tendency to insert oneself into a conversation as “conversational narcissism.” It’s the desire to take over a conversation, to do most of the talking, and to turn the focus of the exchange to yourself. It is often subtle and unconscious. Derber writes that conversational narcissism “is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America. It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family, and coworkers.  So you get why I need to read a book like this and improve? I did enjoy reading this book and I do feel like I will get a physical copy so I can flip to when I feel like my conversations are waning. Here are some advice that Celeste Headless suggests and some things I found interesting. The business psychiatrist Mark Goulston says we only have about forty seconds to speak during a conversation before we run the risk of dominating the exchange. He describes the first twenty seconds as the green light, when the other person likes you and is enjoying what you have to say. The next twenty seconds are the yellow light, when “the other person is beginning to lose interest or think you’re long-winded.” At forty seconds, Goulston says, the light turns red and it’s time to stop talking.  A great reminder for everyone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 30, 2019","Jul 02, 2019","Jun 29, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35523159-we-need-to-talk

At first I thought the book was dystopian- maybe along the lines of  Vox  but that is not the case. Joanne Ramos did a solid job with this debut novel, she managed to shed light on racism, motherhood, surrogacy, immigration, wealth and privilege- all of these themes were explored in a really intelligent way and I think that is why I enjoyed reading this novel so much.  The Farm  is told from the perspective of four women:- Jane a young struggling Filipino single mom who cannot seem to hold down a solid job because of incidents that just seems to keep happening to her. Jane is offered the opportunity of a lifetime by her Aunty Evelyn also known as Ate who suggests she become surrogate mother at ""The Farm"". With this new gig she will be able to afford a lot and give her daughter the future she never had. - There is Evelyn also known fondly as Ate who is the Wet Nurse for women on the Upper East Side. Ate is the most sought after child nurse, so much so she's got a waiting list and as soon as wealthy women knows they will be expecting they are already calling Ate. Ate in the true representation of a Hustler- if there is money to be made, she will find a way to make it. So much so she ends up being a ""scout"" for The Farm. - The character I liked most was Mae- she is the brains behind ""The Farm"" she holds everything together. Mae intends on climbing the corporate ladder and nothing will get in her way. She is dedicated, smart, driven and intends to take ""The Farm"" to the next level- even while planning her super expensive wedding. - Last there is Reagan- a while idealist. Reagan is seen as a premium host because she is white with university education. Reagan decided to become a host to ""help"" women who aren't able to carry their own children. Reagan is annoying and is fighting her own white privilege. As you can see Ramos put together a cast of diverse and interesting characters and I think that is what kept me hooked the entire time- that along with the plot. I think the ending was a bit too clean and wrapped up too nicely. Also, Jane as a character was beyond annoying for me and at certain points I didn't feel for her anymore- rather I wanted to shake the daylights out of her. A timely novel with a whole lot to discuss. A solid debut! This is definitely not a book I will forget anytime soon. P.S.

While there might not be anything new explored in this book, especially if you read a lot of self-improvement books, what Jon Acuff does is get to the heart of WHY we don't finish what we start. Why we don't finish can be summed up in one word  Perfection . According to Jon Acuff  developing tolerance for imperfection is the key factor in turning chronic starters into consistent finishers. . This blew my mind, cause I have been letting perfection get in the way of me finishing goals. If I mess up, I decide I need to quit and start over... on a Monday of course....If you have been having problems finishing, I HiGHLY recommend you give this book a read. It offers practical ways for you to get over those finish lines. P.S.  That’s why the day after perfect is so important. This is the make-or-break day for every goal. This is the day after you skipped the jog. This is the day after you failed to get up early. This is the day after you decided the serving size for a whole box of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts is one.

In  The Dutch House  we meet Cyril Conroy, who through the luck and some real estate knowledge came into great wealth. Through this new found wealth Cyril was able to purchase The Dutch House which was previously owned by a Dutch family who came to ruin. Cyril purchased this sprawling mansion in the countryside of Philadelphia as a surprise for his wife- this began the down fall of the Conroy family. The book is told from the perspective of Cyril's youngest son, Danny. Danny gives us an in-depth look into his relationship with his older sister Maeve and what becomes of The Dutch House and those who lived and worked in the house. A five decade long narration that will keep you utterly enthralled the entire way. The Dutch House is the grounding point of the book because this is where all the relationships, conflicts and problems arises. From the housekeeper being thrown out, to the Danny and Maeve being told to leave with just their clothes and no inheritance to speak of... but this is where the story begins. I absolutely loved this book. Ann Patchett did an amazing job of showcasing sibling relationships, mother daughter-son relationships, sainthood and forgiveness. The characters were well formed, you knew exactly who Maeve and Danny were and their character motivation. Reading this book will have you rooting for these siblings. The book goes between the present, the past and the in-between so seamlessly and this is a testimony to Patchett's writing. There is this suspense that keeps building because of the unanswered questions- but everything comes together in the most organic and beautiful way. If you love family drama this is your pick. If you are looking for a truly heart warming sibling relationship- this is it. If you are a fan of Ann Patchett- just know she delivers with The Dutch House.

Starting from the 18th century we meet young Zachary Macaulay, sent to the island to be a bookkeeper on one of the more prosperous sugar plantations. Zachary who is new to island life assimilate but cannot get use the brutalities of slavery and after years of working on a plantation he becomes an abolitionist. Fast forward to the 19th century, we see John and his brother Brian who are both missionaries heading to Jamaica to help spread the Baptist message. We focus on John's ministry in a remote part of Jamaica, how he integrates with the village and locals who recently experience freedom from slavery. Last, we meet Leigh McCaulay who is returning to Jamaica after hearing of the death of her mother. Leigh's storyline is set in the 1980s and it is during that time we learn about how she is tied to the previous McCaulays. The book is loosely based on the authors' family history so it is hard to separate what is fact from what exactly is fiction. Overall I felt the book started off really strong, I felt I was being carried on a journey, however, I felt like I got taken for a ride that went no where. I just felt the author lacked focus, too much was being explored so it turned out A LOT got glossed over. I am a little annoyed that the author didn't zone in on ONE storyline and went from there. I felt she was a bit too ambitious trying to do Zachary, John and Leigh and fitting their lives into less than 300 pages.

In re-reading this collection I have to say I made a great choice. So many different themes, so many stories to discuss at lengths. Hands down one of my favorite collection of Caribbean stories.  January 2020 I will admit, I took my time getting around to this book for a lot of reasons. My top being, in the blurb it said folklore and the title said monsters so I was expecting a lot of magical realism based on Folklore from Trinidad and Tobago. Let me tell you, when hear about a Trini folklore, your pores will raise, I am VERY afraid of hearing about them, hence my reason for not putting this book to the top of my list. I will admit, it is a silly reason but.... yah girl lives alone. The entire time I was reading this book I kept thinking to myself ""Cindy, WHY did you wait so long to read it?!!!"" This is a brilliant collection of short stories- absolutely brilliant. I rated each story in this collection and only one was below three stars. McIvor did a great job of showcasing Trinidad and Tobago in a contemporary way and from a myth and folklore perspective. I also feel that even if you are not from the Caribbean you will appreciate a lot if not all the stories in this collection.  Where There Are Monsters  a debut collection of twelve stories. Mc Ivor plays on the title throughout the novel and makes us aware that monsters are not just the creepy crawly thing we so often hear about but also the people around us. The collection explores so many themes that are timely and relevant including mental illness, dating in the 21st century, domestic abuse, heartbreak, betrayal, infidelity and love. Your heartbreaks for so many of the characters and what they are going through because of the “monsters” in their lives. From the young man who is struggle to catch a break and go out on a date with his crush, to the woman who was forced to have an abortion because her husband gaslight the hell out of her, to the woman whose husband mistress showed up pregnant at her door… the list goes on. As much as some of these stories are heart-breaking they are somehow also uplifting. You feel for the characters, sometimes pity but mostly pride. My absolute stand out reads were:Ophelia The CourseThe One Night Stand Things We Don’t SayKristoff and BonnieRobber Talk Overall, a solid collection of short stories and I highly recommend you give it a read.

One night while leaving the Cinema Sahara meets Dexter who is outside begging for money for school.

Sahara wanting to help takes food on a weekly basis to Dexter's family, get Dexter and his siblings enrolled into a more prestigious school and tries to make life as comfortable for them as she can. Things do not turn out how Sahara would like.... A lot is explored in this book and it done in the most maddening way. This is not you fairytale, happy ending book. McCaulay does not paint a bright blooming picture, but one that is realistic and will end up breaking your heart. I highly recommend adding this book to your TBR list.

I sat dow Frying Plantain  by Zalika Reid-Benta is an amazing and wonderous debut novel that you will fly through and absolutely love- I promise you! I sat down and read  Frying Plantain  in one sitting, it was utterly interesting and delightful. Frying Plantain is a collection of twelve interconnected stories that follows Kara Davis from elementary school to university. Kara Davis is a Canadian by birth, both her mother and grandmother are Jamaican. The neighbourhood she lives in is a melting pot of Caribbean people and cultures. Kara is trying to fit in with her Jamaican friends but they think she isn't a ""true Jamaican"", she also tries to find balance and friendship with the children she goes to schools with but they are from a different world. Added to this is Kara's relationship with her controlling mother who seems to be trying to hold it all together and just want her daughter to finish school and go to university. There is also Kara's relationship with her grandparents which is also explored. What I loved about this book is how truly authentic the narrative feels. Benta captures exactly what it feels like to be a teenager and all the fears that goes into growing up. More specifically Benta captures exactly what it feels to be a teenager from Caribbean parents who drill into your head ""do not turn out like me"". As much as Kara is a young girl from Caribbean heritage her story feels so relatable. For the girl who lives in fear of her Mom, who is constantly sneaking around or having to hide things and is always that person who cannot hang out with her friends because her Mom doesn't allow it- you know that girl- that is Kara. This is such a rich collection of interconnected stories. The characters are well formed and you can relate to each of their story. For me, the Grandmother felt so much like my grandmother and I was so floored by that. I loved how Benta explored Grandmother-Mother-Daughter relationships- it was rich and fully formed- I could not get enough of it. A truly amazing debut novel and I cannot wait to hear more from Zalika Reid-Benta. ...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jul 25, 2019","Jul 25, 2019","May 29, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42448151-frying-plantain

Martine left Haiti and in doing so left her daughter Sophie with Tante Atie for her to raise. Finding some stability, Martinie sends a ticket to her daughter Sophie to join her in America. Of course things are awkward between Martinie and Sophie but they both try their best to be each other's keeper.

So many themes are discussed and the one I especially liked was how motherhood is portrayed, especially by Moms with children of special needs.  Having a special-needs child didn’t just change you; it transmuted you, transported you to a parallel world with an altered gravitational axis.  This was thoroughly explored in the novel. Overall the book really showcases how we truly don't know what a person is going through and how our small sometimes meaningless actions accounts for a bigger things that impacts a lot lives. I know this book is all hyped up but trust, believe the hype with this one. A MUST READ FOR 2019! ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"May 13, 2019","Jun 22, 2019","Apr 16, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41189557-miracle-creek

A People's History of Heaven  is Mathangi Subramanian debut novel that explores a thirty year old slum called Heaven, situated in Bangalore, India that is going to be destroyed to make way for new high-rises and what the people from Heaven will do stop it. The book centers around five friends from Heaven:Banu- a shy politically driven graffiti artist who loves building and construction, who is the glue of the group.Joy- a transgender who became reborn Joy the day she was baptized as Christian. Deepa- a gifted student and dancer who is forced to stay home because she is blind. Rukshana- A queer, Muslim tomboy who is the mother of the group, fiercely loyal and protective. Padma- The only literate person in her family who recently moved from the country to be in Heaven. These five brave girls pull together along with their mothers and aunties to stand in front of bulldozers to ensure their homes aren't run over. In  A People's History Of Heaven  we get an inside look into the slums of Heaven, into the life of these girls and their aunts. We see hope, despair, joy, failure, friendship and acceptance being explored in the most beautiful way. From the above feature, you can see there is a whole lot going on in this 288 pages book. I think for me, that is what led to why I did not thoroughly enjoy the book. Entirely too much was happening, I felt the author was like, ""come, look here... wait, look at this, no wait, you HAVE to see this, did I show you this? oh, before you go, one more thing!"" . My attention was pulled in so many different direction it was a lot. I also felt there were entirely too many characters, I found myself going back trying to remember, ""who is this again..."". I generally like books with a lot of characters but this one was entirely too much, especially because each had very rich, thorough backstories. I found myself getting caught up in these backstories of these characters more than the main plot. For example, Padma replying to those unreturned letters was GOLD, I wish the author would write a book about that... now that would be amazing....The writing style, *sigh*.... for me, it jumped all over the place and I was left lost at some parts. We go back and forth, from the five or more perspectives of the characters. I did not feel connected to any of the characters and I felt it was because I didn't spend enough time with them. Also, some of the situations were a bit forced and unrealistic, especially Padma's story line. Overall though, I would recommend this novel if only for the diversity and reading about characters I generally don't hear from on a regular basis. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 23, 2019","Apr 28, 2019","Apr 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40591946-a-people-s-history-of-heaven

In every case, someone is saying, in effect, “Let me join you in the recovery, your suffering, your fear of the unknown, your desire to become healthy, to get your life back. Let me bear some of your risk with you.”  – Dr. Joshua D. Mezrich How beautiful is that? This quote basically sums up some of what is explored in When Death Becomes Life: Notes from a Transplant Surgeon I have a bit of a fascination with the medical field so I am always on the look out for memoirs written by doctors. It started with When Death Becomes Life  by Paul Kalanithi, since then I’ve been reading ""medical memoirs"". Dr. Joshua Mezrich does an amazing job of giving you an historical look into transplant surgery, you hear get a solid historical look at the pioneers who did the ground work that made this field so successful today. Also covered are the patients, donors and Mezrich's journey to become a Transplant Surgeon. The medical jargons can be a lot but if you’ve been watching Grey’s Antaomy you should be good. Mezrich balances the history lessons with heart warming stories about his patients. A well researched, well written look into the life of a Transplant Surgeon. Also, in reading this book I learned that the first human to human transplant was done In 1976 in South Africa performed by Dr. Chistiaan Barnard. A little FYI for yah!

Those percentages have held steady since the year 2000. In the last twenty years, that figure has not budged... It is the year 2019 and women are still shouldering 65% child care responsibilities. On one hand I am not shocked because women tend to do a lot on the other hand it is sad that this is what is currently happening. I read this book in shock and awe. A lot of the women who were interviewed holds a lot of resentment towards their spouse because of their ""inability"" to help out around the house or with child care. For some reason, reading this book enraged me. Most of the mothers said they got little help from the fathers even though they were doing a lot already. Something to note is that majority of these women held down full time jobs outside of the home. While some fathers held down the home and child care responsibilities, they were few and far between.According to the research,  there is actually no known human society in when men are responsible for the bulk of all childrearing. Cross-cultural anthropologists report that every part of the world... mothers are more involved than fathers with the care of their young. It seems, it doesn't matter how well a partner you choose, women are left with the full time job of working outside the home and taking care of the home and the kids. In a 2018 report the United Nations estimated that women average 2.6 times the amount of housework and child care that men do... If you are going to have kids, take those figures into consideration. Darcy Lockman brought to light some new information, but for the most part she confirmed what we see in society on a daily basis.

Before the funeral, Kate reaches out to her estranged best friend Blair for support, she comes running. After the funeral Kate keeps getting anonymous text messages telling her she will be next. Racked with grief and fear Kate asks her best friend Blair to stay and help with the investigation. It is clear someone is out for Kate and no one is able to figure out why. Can Kate trust anyone?I read this book in a very short space of time because it was very fast-paced. There is a lot going on between the murder of Kate's mom, the taunting messages, and Blair coming back in the picture. Liv Constantine is able to grab your interest and keep you engaged. While I was engaged throughout the read I cannot say I was impressed or ""wowed"". I figured out the ending half way through and I cannot say I care a lot about the characters, none moved me. Also, I am not a fan of characters being made to look unreliable. If you are looking for a fast paced read, this might be it. I cannot say I was impressed with the overall book, it was a bit too generic for my taste.

I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading this novel and I highly suggest you give this stunning debut a read.  First Read March 2019  That’s always been my trouble. Never knowing my place or being content in it.- Frannie Langston The Confessions of Frannie Langton is Sara Collins debut novel set to be released on May 19th, 2019, I recommend you pre-order now because it is an amazing read! Frannie Langston is a Jamaican slave brought to London by her Master and is then given as a gift to his research partner. Frannie Langston is being held at Old Bailey for murdering her employers famous scientist George Benham and his dainty but odd French wife Marguerite. Yes, Frannie is in deep and while we are rooting for her, the evidence is not looking favourable on our protagonist. The book is told from Frannie’s perspective, through a series of confessions as the title suggests that gives us an in-depth look into Frannie’s life leading up to the night of the gruesome murders. Frannie Langston was born and grew up on a plantation in Jamaica during the 18th century when sugar was King. Frannie goes from being a house slave to being an apprentice to Mr. Langton- a mad scientist who does experiments that only a white man in Jamaica in the 18th century could get away with. These experiments were inhumane, unethical and evil. The ending of these experiments led to Mr. Langton moving to London with Frannie in tow. Upon arrival in London Frannie was given to George Benham and his wife as a gift, this would change Frannie’s world as we know it. Sara Collins did an amazing job with this debut novel. This book covers so many different themes in a new and refreshing way and I think that is what I loved most about the book. I have read a lot of books that covers the plantation and slavery experience, but I have never read a book where the main enslaved character was an apprentice to the Master who is a scientist. I specifically loved how Collins addressed the boredom of white women and the impact it had on the lives of those around them. I highly recommend this spectacular debut novel by Sara Collins. If you are looking for a book that will immerse you, leave you feeling “some type of way” and a character that will no shake, this is the book for you.

Silent Patience however, lived up to ALL the hype and trust me, the hype was REAL. In Silent Patient we meet Alicia Berenson who is a famous painter, married to an equally famous fashion photographer, Gabriel. From the outside, they are the quintessential in-love couple whose got a lot going for them.... that is until one evening Alicia shoots Gabriel in the face five times and never speaks. Alicia not speaking sparks debate and speculation during her trial, even then she doesn't speak to defend herself. Of course Alicia is deemed ""mad"" and is sentenced to live out her time at Grove Institution. The story is told from Theo Faber's point of view, a criminal psychotherapist who followed the case and made it his mission to meet Alicia and make her speak. With a job opening at Grove Institution, Faber got the opportunity of a lifetime....or did he?Honestly, this book worked on so many levels. The premise from the get go had me hooked, I just could not understand why the main character would not speak. Also, the narration from Faber's perspective pulled me in from the very first line. There is something about a first person POV that does it for me.

I am not a fan of Science Fiction/ Dystopia/ Post Apocalyptic novels so I definitely stepped outside of my comfort zone when I picked up Severance and I am happy I did because this novel surprised me in a really great way. In Severance  we meet Candace Chen a millennial living and working in New York City. Candace lost her parents so she finds comfort in her friends, boyfriend and New York City. A Project Manager at a publishing house, Candace manages the Bible printing division, ensuring orders are placed and executed in a timely manner. From the narration, it is clear that Candace lives in her own world, so much so, she didn't realize when a serious virus wiped out most of New York- possibly the world. The virus called ""Fevered"" started in Shenzhen, China and spread to the rest of the world. The book described being ""fevered"" as someone who does the same routine over and over until they die.... *shudders* That virus sweeps the world, including NYC. Candace is offered a substantial remuneration package to stay at her job and basically ""hold down the fort"" until things return to normal. Normal does not return and Candace is forced to seek help and find help before her medical situation turns dire. I loved how the book was put together, we get a look into Candace before the fevered virus and her present day situation with her band of survivors. The author did a great job of painting a holistic picture of Candace as a character you could relate and I think that is what I loved most about it. The writing is fresh and captivating, filled with suspense and plot twists you wouldn't expect. My only complaint is how infuriating the ending was- it was rushed and I felt not fully thought out but I wont hold it against the author.

It is about how easily we condemn people in this country and the injustice we create when we allow fear, anger, and distance to shape the way we treat the most vulnerable among us. I saw some of my favorite Bookish friends reading this book and I decided to give it ago. Absolutely nothing could prepare for the range of emotions I went through reading this book. Bryan Stevenson writes about a system so broken it will literally bring you to tears of frustration- I sure cried reading his account. Not only was I sad, I was f*cking enraged. Reading some of the statistics put forward in the book is enough to make your blood boil, for e.g.  Today we have the highest rate of incarceration in the world. The prison population has increased from 300,000 people in the early 1970s to 2.3 million people today. There are nearly six million people on probation or on parole. One in every fifteen people born in the United States in 2001 is expected to go to jail or prison; one in every three black male babies born in this century is expected to be incarcerated. Florida had the largest population in the world of children condemned to die in prison for non-homicides. Those are just a few that I picked out, there are many other sad, enraging statistics contained in this book. Bryan Stevenson wrote a thought provoking, honest look at the American ""justice"" system. After reading  The Sun Does Shine  by Anthony Ray Hinton (who is also mentioned in this book) I thought nothing could shock me but I was in for more surprises. This book sheds light on what it is like for a poor black person in the American Justice system. A very powerful read. This book should be read by anyone who cares about human rights.

Also, having read, enjoyed and put into practice advice from Cal Newport's previous book So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love  I figured this book would definitely help. In  Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Nosy World  Cal intended to  make the case for digital minimalism, including a more detailed exploration of what it asks and why it works, and then to teach you how to adopt this philosophy if you decide it’s right for you. I feel, for the most part Cal did put forward a good case for Digital Minimalism, but that was an easy case to put forward because we can all/mostly agree that some of us would benefit significantly from practicing Digital Minimalism. If I am being honest, what Cal intended for the book he accomplished, I just felt it lacked something. For me, most of the ideas put forward wasn't groundbreaking. In fact, the main take away from the book was, ""put down your phone/get a dumb phone and see how your life changes"" I also felt that Cal didn't get to the underline cause of WHY we need to practise Digital Minimalism. WHY are we consuming so much and the whole psyche behind that. I do think someone who is just exploring Digital Minimalism may learn more from the book.

We see where the Settlers visit and take over Earth making the Natives work for them, learn their language, brutalize and run a rampage in every way possible.

I was so engaged I read the first 30% in no time. I think having the chapters short and having the story seen from three POVs helped in the beginning but closer to the end proved a bit difficult. For example, we would hear about something happening in chapter 10 and not hear about it, have it resolved or mentioned again until chapter 40. Also, while this is fiction, a lot of the things and character motivations did not make sense. Added to this also, is that there are a lot of resolved minor plots or characters who did not need to be included. The end tied up entirely too nicely and unrealistic, I mean COME ON! The writing is good, but after 30% things got to be a bit eye rolling and cheesy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 04, 2019","Sep 06, 2019","Feb 05, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43322668-if-you-want-to-make-god-laugh

The book goes between two ""storylines"" the fire that destroyed the Los Angeles Public Library back in 1986- how it occurred and who might have been responsible. The second ""storyline"" was an ode to libraries, librarians, books and readers. The two intersect but overall it was a book about libraries. This is why I wanted to write this book, to tell about a place I love that doesn’t belong to me but feels like it is mine, and how that feels marvelous and exceptional. I gave this book a four star rating because I felt like Orlean really came from a place of love and genuine interest when she wrote this book. It is clear she spent a lot of time researching and putting this book together and most importantly I learned a lot about libraries and reading through this book and that for me is very important. A lot of the things I read in this book moved me as a reader and made me think ""wow.... I did not know that"" for eg:- ""In Senegal, the polite expression for saying someone died is to say his or her library has burned.""-""World War II destroyed more books and libraries than any event in human history."" - ""The Nazis alone destroyed an estimated hundred million books during their twelve years in power.""Yes, the book did drag in some areas and I felt like Orlean had a lot of ideas, things to discuss and some parts were not cohesive but I can overlook all of that because this book really spoke to me as a Book Lover.

I decided to start with  SAME EARTH  because it was his first novel. I like to experience an author from the start of their novels and what an amazing start. In SAME EARTH we are taken to a small village in Watersgate, Jamaica. We are introduced to the different villagers who resides and visit Watersgate. The core of the story follows Imelda Richardson but we get an overall look into the lives of those around her. As with a lot of Miller’s work there is the presence of religion, folklore, immigrant and finding community, all of these were well executed. Miller’s ability to take a small piece of Jamaica and carve it into a story that resonates is unmatched. How he takes us and pulls back the curtain on this village, you literally feel like you are watching over these people and their lives. You cannot help but cheer for them because they are so deserving. The comedy is unmatched, you literally find yourself in situations that makes you laugh out loud. This is truly a great read.  February 2019  This is my second book by Kei Miller and I was not disappointed. I think Miller's style of writing is colorful, engaging and captures Jamaica and Jamaicans perfectly. From most of the s, I saw a lot of people either loved or really didn't like how ""disjointed"" the plot was and I can understand that feeling. However, that was the best part for me. I love how Miller is able to weave backstories together to create an overall plot. I did think ""this book would have worked better if it was a collection of short stories""  but, from reading his previous novels I noticed this is a style what works for Kei Miller.

January 2020 I read Rising Strong for the first time in 2019 and I was blown away but home much the book and the teachings resonated with me. I think for the entire 2019 I made a conscious decision to be more vulnerable and live wholeheartedly and for the most part it worked. This time around what really resonated with me was how the story I tell myself when things happen. I liked that Brene Brown really focused on this because it is something I battle with a lot and I liked having the tools to work through it. This is such a great read for anyone who is in the arena of life. A must read. January 2019   Yes, feeling vulnerable is at the core of difficult emotions like fear, grief, and disappointment, but it’s also the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, empathy, innovation, and creativity. When we shut ourselves off from vulnerability, we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.   Rising Strong  by Brene Brown is exactly the book I needed to start my year. I found myself highlighting almost every line on my Kindle. This book explores how being vulnerable leads us to live a more fulfilling life. It also in no uncertain terms informs us that it will hurt and it will suck at times but if we want to live wholeheartedly, this is the process. I have to admit, there is a lot to absorb and so much to explore with this book at times it felt overwhelming but the lessons that are explored are essential. I particularly love this little nugget that Brene Brown shared:  My team and I often start difficult team meetings by writing permission slips and sharing them before we dig into our work. We’re not going to recognize emotion if we don’t feel like we have permission to feel emotion.  These are just some of the practical tips Brown shared in her book on how she goes about living a wholehearted life.

I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed at the end with a lot of questions. The debut novel by Anissa Gray is widely talked about and I can see why after reading the book. The characters and their lives feels real, they are all battling with their various demons and this is something I can appreciate. We meet the Butler family, three sisters and a brother Althea, Viola, Lillian and Joe. The oldest sister, Althea is currently on trial with her husband Proctor for fraud. While they are awaiting their trial, Viola and Lillian steps in to take care of their twin girls who are both reeling from losing their parents. We see that these siblings are all battling their own demons and coping with life in various ways, all of this is revealed throughout the book. I really wanted this book to ""win"", there is something about a debut novel by a woman of colour that looks at black lives that makes me want it to ""win"". For me, I felt the book just did not come together, there was too much going on. While some things were resolved, for the most part the overall plot fell flat for me. Too many storylines, too many characters, too many things not explored in-depth. I would still recommend you giving this a read, if only for the amazing title. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Mar 30, 2019","Apr 03, 2019","Dec 18, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41035829-the-care-and-feeding-of-ravenously-hungry-girls

The Lesson  by Cadwell Turnbull is unlike anything I have ever read before and I cannot stop talking about it and I didn't want it to end. Set on the U.S. Virgin Islands, we meet the members of the community of Charlotte Amalie-like most Islanders, they are pretty laid back, but all living complicated lives. Things get even more complicated when one day the sky opens up and an alien ship docks close to the island. The five hundred Ynaa came in ""peace"" and with advance technology to offer for their five year stay on the island. The Ynaa's message to the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands is that they are looking for ""something"", they needed time to ""research"" and ""they would leave the planet as they found it"". Yes, the Ynnas were very vague but their ask seemed reasonable at the time. Fast forward to a year into the invasion and tension between the Islanders and Ynaas is strong. While the Ynaas's tries to blend in by using human disguise, they are easily prone to anger, so much so, a Ynaa ripped an Islander to his death. The Ynaa's Ambassador Mera, tries to keep the peace by using Derrick a fellow Islander to help her get the message out but things are now beyond her control. The Islanders realize there are no consequences for the Ynaas action. Things spiral, quickly.When I say I have never read a book like this, I mean it. Cadwell is able to traverse and blend various genres together, it is hard to classify exactly what genre this book falls under. I think that is what I loved most about it. We get a bit of Sci-Fi, historical fiction and young adults. The book starts out exploring the complicated lives of the community members of Charlotte Amalie. We see a married couple coming to terms with the impending doom of their marriage and how their daughter might be affected. We meet a young man who grew up in church questioning Christianity, while wondering “what else could be out there?”Cadwell, took his time in The Lesson to explore the history of colonialism and what the invasion meant for an island that have a history of being invaded and taken over. We get a historical look on how the island was colonialized, and the question was posed to the reader and the members of the community, whether the Ynaa invaded or they arrived. If you are looking for a book that will grab you from the very beginning and won’t let go until the end, this is it. If you have never read about an alien invasion happening on an island- well this might be the only book for you to read.

I like that we are given an unreliable narrator and a narrator we can trust... but can we trust them? You get nuggets of stories inside the whole story that is carefully constructed. I loved reading about Warner Women and the Revivalist sect in Jamaica. A well done book.  The cry of the Warner Woman is Consider.

In fact, it would be no exaggeration to say that each day contains all of history. In re-reading this book I was reminded how much of a master author and poet Kei Miller is. I cannot get over how he is able to interweave stories and bring you to the best climax. A thorough examination of a period on Jamaica's history that deserves to be read.  December 2018   The story of Bedward is not the one they been telling you. Is it not the story of some fool-fool man who get it into him head that him could fly. And neither is it the story of a clumsy baff-hand man who fall out of a tree. You hearing me child? The story of Bedward is something completely different -is the story of a man who try his best to do something big-and to reach higher than any of we did think a man like him could ever had reach….. Then again, is probably just the everyday story of this goddamn island- just another striving man that this blasted country decide to pull down”  The book is named after August Town, a community in Jamaica. In Augustown we meet Ma Taffy, a blind woman who sees and smells trouble a mile away. On this particular day Ma Taffy felt a feeling of impending doom and disaster- autoclaps. It was not too long she hears her six-year old Nephew Kaia crying on his way home from school. This is the same nephew Ma Taffy keeps telling “you need to grow a backbone.” Nothing could prepare Ma Taffy for the injustice her six-year-old nephew faced and she knows this is just the start of what would turn out to be an autoclaps. While we Ma Taffy and her six-year-old nephew seems to be the focal point of this story, the book covers a lot more than that. It is about Bedward the flying prophet, August Town, Rastafarianism, Belief and community. If you are a Jamaica reading this book, it will read like a history lesson or commentary on the political, social and spiritual happenings during a particular time in Jamaica. I for one learned a lot picking this up. I love a book with strong characters who drive the plot along. Kei Miller is the master of backstory, with every character that is introduced you get an in-depth look into their lives before their introduction and how they form part of the reason for the autoclaps. Every character is a piece of the overall story, except you are not sure how they contribute until the last chapters of the book, then everything seems to come together. This is my first book my Kei Miller and I am greatly impressed by his storytelling, writing and the research that I am sure went into this book.

I was also drawn to this book because it is being dubbed as “Bridget Jones meets Americanah”  and while I see why that is the case, in some (most) instances I don’t- we will get to that soon.We meet Queenie Jenkins a 25-year-old living in London who is from Jamaica. Queenie’s had a lot going for her, especially for a millennial living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. She works at national newspaper, a job she actually likes, she lives with her long-time white boyfriend and still manages to have a solid group of friends around her. Things begin to fall apart and fast, for Queenie when Tom, her long-term boyfriend tells her they need to go on a break… a long one. We see our main character begin to spiral in more ways than one, she messes up constantly at work, her personal relationships are falling apart and her toxic behaviour starts taking a mental toll on herself and those around her.I have a lot of things I want to say, so I will break them up into two parts- what worked and what didn’t work for me.What Worked:The whatsapp group chat with the friends I found worked really well in how it moved the plot along and got us to know more about Queenie and her friends. I think this was my favorite part of the book if I am being honest. I love how real those chat felt, how hilarious they were at times and as a millennial, that part of the book really resonated with me.I particularly loved two themes that the author discussed one being mental health and how it is viewed in a Caribbean and Black community setting. I felt it was addressed in a very real way.  Being from the Caribbean, we can still be very archaic in how we address mental health and those who decide to go to therapy for help are sometimes shunned or seen as bringing embarrassment to the family. The author did an amazing job of addressing this issue. I also liked that the author explored how black women’s bodies are often fetishized. This is a topic I don’t read a lot about and how we were able to experience that through Queenie felt very real and often times infuriating. What Didn’t WorkWhile I liked that the author tried explored racial tensions and discrimination, I felt like it wasn't deep enough. Maybe I am nit-picking because how deep can one go when the main character’s life is falling apart and she is engaging in self-destructive behaviour. However, the race theme felt very “by the way” because this is current and it would be good to add to the discussion.  This also applies to Queenie’s heritage, I hoped to read more about how her Jamaican heritage impacted her overall. Aside from her Grandparents and Aunty that were Jamaican it wasn’t addressed much.I feel the comparison to Bridget Jones Diary is a long stretch. The only thing Queenie and Bridget have in common is that they live in London and are bad at love. The writing at times did lend to a Bridget Jones-esq feel but that’s where the comparison ends. Queenie is a way more complex character and while the book started out very shallow, things got deeper in the end.Overall this book will be open to a lot of reader interpretation. I do see a lot of people either loving it or being underwhelmed- it is too hard to not like a character like Queenie. I am here for Williams’ next book because I did enjoy reading this book. Queenie will be available for purchase in March 2019. Thanks Orion Publishers for this ARC.

The Black Jacobins  gives an in-depth look on the history of Haiti, the revolution and the impact the man called Toussaint L'Ovuerture. I have always had a bit of fascination with the country Haiti mainly because of its rich culture and history. There is so much to explore and unpack about this country and I think C.L.R James did an exceptional job of putting a lot things in context and revealing the things that shaped this country into what it is today. Haiti was the first country in the Caribbean to abolish slavery. They led the most successful slave revolt that impacted the world during that time. The revolt as a catalyst of things to come. In this book we are given an in-depth look of how the country was impacted by the British, French, Spanish and American influence. There are so many things at play in the history of Haiti and the revolution and it is covered in its entirety in this book.It is a difficult book to read because of the timelines and numerous persons mentioned, but it is worth going through.

As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end. I picked up  Becoming  because it is Michelle Obama and I wanted to hear what she had to say. I expected to be wowed, amazed, and knocked off my feet but I didn't expect to be so smitten. I have no words to explain how amazing this book is. The writing is flawless, Michelle Obama is GOALS and the G.O.A.T. This is Michelle Obama like we have never seen her before, unencumbered, moving, flawed, deeply authentic and funny. I am in awe of this woman and the life she has lived so far and I cannot wait to see where the next years take the Obamas. While I am not a big fan of politics and politician, the Obamas stole my heart when they were in power and I still look on deeply fascinated by the life they live.

Also, can we just all pause and acknowledge Barrack and Michelle's love story and how moving it was? I found myself crying, laughing out loud and cheering for them at different stages of the book.

I think what I loved most about this book was that it is not every day I pick up a book and read about a mother who just wanted to get a chance to live HER life. A lot of the books I've read we hear about men leaving to start a new life, it is great to read about the other side. I loved reading this book the second time around.  May 2019 I thoroughly enjoyed reading Nicole Dennis-Benn's debut novel  Here Comes The Sun  so much so  Patsy  was one of my most sought after ARC for 2019.We meet Patsy, a twenty something Jamaican living in Pennyfield- what one would call a ghetto. Patsy is a government worker, but gets paid so little, she ends up doing some on the side work that is she not too proud about. Patsy is the sole breadwinner, but she is hardly able to provide for her daughter Tru and her mother who stopped working after finding the Lord because ""the Lord will provide"". Of course, Patsy now have to pick up the slack that the Lord doesn't fill. By all intents Patsy's life is HARD. It just seems like she cannot catch a break. This all changes when Patsy receives the American visa she's been applying for. Patsy, like most/some Jamaicans think going to America will change their lives for the better so she grabs the opportunity to leave the island. Patsy's oldest and dearest friend Cicely left Pennyfield a decade ago and from her letters to Patsy, moving to New York was the best thing that ever happened to her. Cicely paints a picture of hope, wealth and overall happier life once Patsy lands in New York. What Cicely does not make mention of is any plans for her and Patsy rekindling their love once she arrives. Patsy decides to put herself first for once and makes the decision to move to America, leaving behind her mother and her five-year-old daughter Tru. Her mother must now truly depend on the Lord to provide and her daughter Tru will have to live with her father and his family. Patsy says goodbye to Jamaica, for the land of opportunity, America. Of course, once Patsy arrives in America, she realizes it is nothing as Cicely described in her letters. Reality hits hard for Patsy, an undocumented immigrant who finds herself doing things she would dream of doing if she was still in Jamaica. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Pasty. I feel she is a character I don't always read about and it was refreshing doing so. I liked how complex Patsy is as a character, Dennis-Benn wrote a believable character and that is what I loved most about the book. It is not everyday you read about motherhood like this and I felt it was explored in a truly authentic way. The themes explored in this book are not new, but I felt the author did a solid job of exploring each in a way I never thought of. On some level I am over the narrative of Jamaicans leaving Jamaica to find a better life in the US. I am over how a lot of people think the streets of America are lined with numerous opportunities and all they need to do is get a visa, get there and their lives will be changed for the better. I am also over reading about the barrel children who will have to grow up without their parent(s). On the other hand, this is a reality in Jamaica and the Caribbean, I've had Aunts and Uncles who left Jamaica seeking a better life elsewhere. So on some level, I feel like this is a story that deserves to be told, and Nicole Dennis-Benn did this a great way. I did enjoy the book but I didn't love it as much as I did her previous novel. I think it was a tad bit too long and the ending was a bit too rushed.

Set in Trinidad and Tobago in what I am assuming is the 1980s we meet the Deyalsingh family- father Clyde, mother Joy and their twin sons Paul and Peter. The family lives in the rural part of Trinidad and Tobago in a home that’s been in the family for generations. The father Clyde is a humble yet proud man who is trying his very best to provide for his family even in difficult circumstances. Things got a bit difficult after the birth of their twin. While Peter was delivered without complications, Paul suffered lack of oxygen along with other complications, while he survived his difficult birth will be a foreshadowing of his life. Peter is deemed a genius by his family and teachers while Paul is labelled as “not normal”. One evening Paul goes walking into the bush but does not come home. Joy and Peter are worried about what might happen to him. Clyde goes in search of his missing son who he had a terrible fight with some days before. While searching for his son Clyde thinks of all the possible reasons for his disappearance but nothing comes close to why he is actually missing. I finished this book two days ago and I am still being haunted by what took place. This book pulls you in from the very first chapter. Adam pulls the strings so tight in this book, the tension and build-up is palatable, some moments I actually had to remind myself to breathe. What I loved most was how imperfect and authentic the characters were, especially Clyde who is forced to make a decision no parent should make. Claire Adam’s writing is enthralling and beautiful. As a Jamaican living in Trinidad and Tobago for the last four years, I can say, with my limited knowledge that Adam perfectly captures the culture and social nuisances of this country. Golden Child is a deeply moving story about family, love, betrayal and resilience. I cannot wait for everyone to read this because I know this will be a major hit for 2019.

This trilogy has already been dubbed in the publishing world as “the African Game of Thrones” and I will tell you why soon. The publication date for this is January 2019 but thanks to those amazing people over at Riverhead Books I get an early peek into this enthralling tale. We meet the main character Tracker, a hunter who is know for his nose- once he catches the scent of a person he cannot let it go until that person is found, dead or alive. It is because of this specific skill Tracker is commissioned to look for a boy who disappeared under very mysterious circumstances three years ago. Tracker finds out he is not the only person looking for the boy, and the search turns into a team effort, but not everyone on the team can be trusted. The group that accompanies Tracker on his search is filled with mysterious characters all with secrets and hidden agendas. Tracker and his team move from one city to a next, through enchanted forests and magical doors. Their journey is filled with curveballs and mythical creature intent on killing them. The group ends up getting divided, mistrust surrounds them, and Tracker cannot help but question why he decided to find this boy and who he can trust to help him complete his mission. To be fair, it took awhile for me to get into the book but after the first 70 pages it was smooth sailing. I think with the numerous characters and interwoven storylines of each character is becomes a bit hard to keep track of who is who. In true Marlon James’ fashion the book is filled with very graphic scenes both sexually and in the description of how persons died. If you can push through these scenes without your stomach turning, then you are good to go.  Honestly, Marlon James did not disappoint with his first installation of the Dark Star Trilogy. I was kept guessing the entire time. I cannot wait for the next installation in this series. I am hoping this series makes it to the big screen, I want to see these characters come to life.

I did not know exactly what I was in for when I started reading this book and quite frankly NOTHING could prepare me for this madness.  Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup  is written by John Carreyrou a writer at The Wall Street Journal. He gives an engrossing account of the whole Theranos/Elizabeth Holmes debacle. So let me start by saying, before I picked up this book I've never heard of Theranos or Elizabeth Holmes, I finished this book three days ago and all I can think about is Theranos- I now feel personally invested in this fiasco. A bit of backstory. Elizabeth Holmes decided to drop out of Stanford to launch a company that would revolutionize the entire medical industry. As CEO of Theranos, Elizabeth aimed to build an at home device where with ""one drop of blood"" you could be given an reading of any disease or illness you have... sounds plausible right? WRONG. Lauded as the next Steve Jobs, Elizabeth Holmes was given money by top investors to launch this device. Millions of dollars were pumped in Theranos research and development without anyone knowing for certain if the device works, much less if it should be regulated. Needless to say, Elizabeth Holmes pulled off the biggest scam ever. Carreyrou gives us a deep dive into how this actually happened and how she got away with this fraud for so long. The writing is fascinating and engaging, it reads like fiction because of the bizarre things that happen. Honestly, book blew my mind. I am just in SHOCK at how this happened.

Everyday we are bombarded by information and news that makes it seem as if the world on a whole is getting worse.

I admire so many of the writers who contributed to this collection, it is no wonder I devoured this book because I wanted to know more about them and who influenced their writing.

I am not sure why there isn't a bigger hype surrounding Wayetu Moore's debut novel  She Would Be King  because it is absolutely enthralling. While I don't like comparing books, for some reason this book reminded me of how I felt reading  Homegoing  by Yaa Gyasi. I felt a pounding in my chest and fluttering in my stomach as I asked myself while reading this book- ""what magic is this book?!"" . I was reminded of how I felt when I was younger and I opened a book I know I would absolutely love... it felt like magic.  In  She Would Be King  we are exposed to magical realism, historical fiction, captivating characters and a storyline that grabs you from the very first line... I am talking about the dedication. The book features three characters- Gbessa born with a curse on her head but she would be king, June Dey born in Virginia from supernatural causes and Norman Aragon child of a Colonizer and Maroon Woman. These three characters were not only birthed in difficult circumstances but during a period in history where everything is stacked against them. We get a historical look into Jamaica during the time of the Maroons and Colonizers, Virginia during the booming slave trade and an in-depth look into Liberia's history. I never thought I would learn so much from this book, but from a historical perspective there is a lot to unpack- thanks for the additional reading material Wayetu Moore. If you are looking for a magical historical fiction, this is the book for you. If you want a book that is thoroughly researched, filled with strong female leads and tension for days- this is the book for you. If you enjoyed Homegoing, there is no doubt that you will love this as well. This book is currently on my top favorite books for 2018- it is that good! A must read.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THIS  ""Review"" written upon finishing the book- you know how Amazon prompts you....ugh. See more thorough  above Absolutely enthralling! I could not put this book down and I haven't been able to shut up about it. This debut is a must read and an absolute favorite of mine for 2018.

With Uriel and Amanda's world crumbling around them they turn to each other, but they have a muddy past, of course things get very interesting.

I highly recommend this read for anyone who's been with a FB, knows someone who was with a FB or is currently going back to their FB ""For the last time"". A must read!  What I’ve come to learn and what most people fail to understand is that love is a choice. If you assess the worth of your relationship solely in terms of your feelings it is likely to fail, or at least be extremely short-term. You cannot go on having these “feelings” for someone forever. With girls, the exciting part is winning their affection. That’s the fun. Then you have to choose who you’re going to love, backed by the reasons why.

Rick Warren spoke so highly of Graham, when I saw his book at a garage sale I had to get it and I am happy I did. It is always great reading a book filled with wisdom from someone who lived a long full life. Graham wrote about topics we don't generally read about, death, retirement and aging. I love how real this book was, as Graham rightly said, ""aging isn't for sissies"" he spoke about how lonely it can be, how much aging persons suffer because of health issues and have anxiety or worries because of their lack of finances. There are a lot of things to consider and Billy Graham brought all of these to the forefront in this book. This is a book for everyone, there is so much wisdom packed into this read.

We also meet French, Toulouse Valmorain who arrives on the island to run his father's plantation. Of course, Toulouse Valmorain, new to the island isn't prepared for all the troubles that comes with being on an island, especially during the time when Haiti is changing.

I genuinely felt what it must be like being a parent, how hard that role can be. My heart broke for Rafiq and Layla in so many ways. 3. This book is slow AF.

I generally do not like slow paced books but this one passed the test (I think). 4. It took awhile for me to get used to the jarring timelines.

We are taken on numerous outings with her and her friends as they navigate Zimbabwe which is rapidly changing due to the political climate. Darling's dream came true and she finally gets to travel to America to stay with her Aunt. For the rest of the book we see how Darling's expectation of America is crushed and how she deals with her new reality.

I learned so much reading this book, I am happy I picked it up. For the last several months I have been focusing a lot on my passion and I think in reading this I am taking a step back and seeing how my work and passion can function cohesively. Cal Newport main argument is  ""The passion hypothesis is not just wrong, it’s also dangerous. Telling someone to “follow their passion” is not just an act of innocent optimism, but potentially the foundation for a career riddled with confusion and angst. ""  Newport suggests that instead of blinding following your passion, you should work at obtaining  Career Capital  that is rare and valuable experience in your field and work at having a Craftsman Mindset  this is where you focus relentlessly on what you can offer the world. Along with these three he put forward the idea of deliberate practice- this is where you work assiduously at something and ensuring your abilities are stretched. Newport goes on to show how acquiring Career Capital may lead to you having control over your life and work. I especially liked this chapter because it rang true to me on so many levels. I want to be in a position where I can use my career capital to leverage some amount of control over my life. I absolutely enjoyed and learned so much reading this book.

The Perfect Mother centers around four mothers who are all a part of the ""May Mothers"" group. They all had their babies around the same time so they have a common bond and are going through almost the same thing. During the May Mother's first night out without their baby, one of the mothers return home to find that her baby was abducted- the horror.

You can only begin to know that moment by looking in the rearview mirror. And trust me when I tell you that you never, ever see it coming. In  The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row  we meet Anthony Ray Hinton who was wrongly arrested and charged with capital murder and sentenced to death. In the era of the New Jim Crow, Hinton was arrested in 1985 at just twenty-nine years old and would spend nearly thirty years on death row. Imagine being wrongly accused of a crime?Imagine only TWO persons on the earth believing you are innocent.Imagine having to spend thirty years of your life in on death row.Imagine seeing over fifty-nine persons walking pass your cell to their death.Imagine being so poor you cannot afford to hire a specialists that could prove your innocence. Imagine we are still living in world where being black and poor is a crime. Honestly, this book broke my heart, made me so mad and gave me the biggest headache. The injustice, the pain, the cruelty of it all was very overwhelming. This was a very heavy read for me. What broke my heart was Hinton saying that after he was released, he didn't go for extended periods alone because he always wanted to have an alibi. That shattered me, imagine you are a free man but because of the injustice you faced continue life in such a way to make sure you are never accused again. I think special mention should go to Lester, Hinton's best friend. He never missed a visit for the thirty years he was in prison. He drove long distances to meet with his best friend every week, he was beside him, fighting with him to prove his innocence. They don't make best friends like that anymore and that really warmed my heart. I am annoyed that these stories keep happening but it is essential that we read and support these causes. In the final chapter of this book Hinton listed every person on death row and asked that we pray for them by name, I made sure to pray for Cedric Floyd. A must read. But pain and tragedy and injustice happen—they happen to us all. I’d like to believe it’s what you choose to do after such an experience that matters the most—that truly changes your life forever. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Aug 17, 2018","Aug 21, 2018","Apr 19, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36567136-the-sun-does-shine

Holmes knowing that these two topics are barely related proved to be a bit exhausting. However, I learned so much and surprisingly I thoroughly enjoyed taking the trip back in time to the 1800s.

I have to say, I did enjoy reading about the different things people search about and how Big Data can teach us a lot about human behavior. While I did enjoy reading about some of the insightful data Seth presented, I wished it could have been better presented. I know it is hard presenting hard data and you need to break the monotony and keep things interesting, however, I felt the data could have been better presented. Maybe it is because I am so used to Malcolm Gladwell's writing but I really appreciate when authors are able to present data in an engaging way.

I read  How to Love A Jamaican  by Alexia Arthurs back in 2018 and I decided to give it a re-read for Read Caribbean month happening in June. There is a special sense of feeling you get when you open a book and see that it is dedicated to you… a Jamaican and that feeling stays with you! In re-reading this book, I laughed out loud on numerous occasions, I shed a tear, I nodded my head in agreement, and I was absolutely overwhelmed by a feeling of homesickness. It is not every day you open a book and you see yourself, your family, how you grew up being recounted on the page and for that I’ll be forever grateful to Alexia Arthurs.  How to Love A Jamaican  is collection of 11 short stories that perfectly captures Jamaican, Jamaican life, culture, history and a bit of folklore in a truly electrifying way. There are some stories that sticks with you, that gets under your skin and doesn’t leave you, that is how you know the writing is amazing…. Or it could be that I am a Jamaican and I am biased… but I don’t think that is it. As someone who grew up in rural Jamaica, there are so many of the stories that ring true in how they felt, in the characterization and the use of old sayings. A lot of the characters in this collection reminds me of people I’ve met or grew up with. There is a distinct feeling you get reading this book and I don't know how to explain that feeling unless you are a Jamaican, related to a Jamaican, from Jamaican heritage or loved a Jamaican. I could gush and go on and on about this collection. It is a book I hold dear, a book I cannot stop talking about- two years later, a book I always recommend, a book that remains close to my heart. Please read.  Review in 2018  I finally finished How To Love A Jamaican and I am thoroughly pleased with this debut novel. I have to admit I can be a bit biased when I read books written by Jamaicans about Jamaicans, but even with my Jamaican googles off this book is absolutely a must-read. I am so impressed with Alexia Arthur’s writing, she perfectly captures the various nuances of the Jamaican culture and its people. If you are looking for a solid collection of short stories that’s diverse and much as it is real. I would list my favorite stories in this book but I would basically be re-writing the content page (lol).A must read and absolute favorite of mine!...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"May 13, 2018","May 22, 2018","Mar 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36860760-how-to-love-a-jamaican

The story follows Lina’s time in the camps and their quest to remain hopeful despite all that is around them. While Lina and her family are all fictional characters, they represent millions of people who had to face this sad reality. What is also sad is that I knew nothing about this period in history until I picked up this book. A heart-breaking, horrifying but necessary read, especially for those who do not know about what happened the people from the Baltic States under Stalin regime....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 16, 2018","Mar 20, 2018","Mar 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7824322-between-shades-of-gray

My  below still stands after reading this book a second time. Well, maybe I found the characters just a tiny bit immature but the issues explored in this book is so relevant and done in such a realistic way.  It's like the difference between a raw egg and a scrambled egg. It's the same thing, but it's not the same at all. I have four things to say about An American Marriage by Tayari Jones,  BELIEVE. THE. HYPE  I could not open my Goodreads or Bookstgram page without seeing this book on my feed. It was everywhere and it seemed like the entire world (including Oprah) was reading this book. Of course, I jumped on the bandwagon. I cannot remember the last time a book left me so disoriented and feeling all ""kinda ways"". I stayed up late because I could not put down the book, also, when I was 90% through I stopped because I wanted to savor the rest of the book. I honestly cannot remember the last time a book made me cry but An American Marriage had me bawling and turning pages at the same time. As the blurb says, Celestine and Roy have been married for over a year, they took a trip to the South to Roy's hometown. During the trip Roy gets arrested and is sentenced to 12 years in prison. What transpires next, will break your heart. I think this book pushes our boundaries on what we think marriage is. I am always the first to say Marriage is such an important institution that should be respected. You are making an eternal promise to someone, and you are making this vow to them and to God (if you believe in Him). I do not take marriage lightly, ever, but after reading this book, I am honestly questioning if I will ever be ready for marriage. When people say their vows, should they be held accountable to these vows no matter the circumstances? Are things ever that black and white? Is marriage ever that black and white? Ok... now that I got the heaviness out of the way. Let us talk about how well written this book. This is the first book I have read by Tayari Jones but most certainly not the last. Her writing is eloquent, rich and thoroughly enjoyable. Her character development ability should be taught in schools. Not to mention how relatable the characters were. I honestly felt for Celestine, Roy, Big Roy, Olive and Andre. It was as if I was thoroughly invested in their lives. It is not often an overhyped book lives up to the hype but An American Marriage deserves all the hype its getting and then some. This is definitely a must read for me. Also, I know it is only February and we have 10months left in the year but I am firmly putting this on my favorite books of 2018.

If you are a Caribbean Woman or from Caribbean heritage this book is a must read. This debut novel by Krystal Sital unpacks so many issues that Caribbean Women face, particularly their mothers and grandmothers. The book is basically a memoir/biography of sorts for Krystal, her Mom and her Grandmother. When Krystal's Grandfather accidentally falls and is rushed to the hospital, there seems to be no urgency by her Grandmother in trying to save her husband's life. When Krystal asks her Mom, ""Why Grandma doesn't want Grandpa to live? the secrets that were kept for generations started unravelling. This book covers a lot and in such an authentic and unapologetic way. Mother-Daughter relationships are explored, racial tension in Trinidad and Tobago, Domestic Abuse, Mental Health, Family Secrets/Dynamics and the how being uneducated as a woman impacts quality of life. I could talk for hours on each theme and how Sital expertly addresses it in this novel, but I think you need to read this one for yourself. Coming from a Caribbean background and reading this, I couldn't help but this, ""this is so damn typical of us!"". Families are rife with secrets that never gets aired because of shame, there is the toxic male culture that seems to exist throughout the book. Overall, a real life read. What I absolutely loved was how Sital portrayed her Grandmother and Mother, while they were all flawed, their resilient spirit is truly one worth reading about. This might be one of my top Caribbean reads for the year. I absolutely recommend everyone picking this up....more",Notes are private!,0,25,2,"Aug 02, 2019Dec 03, 2018","Aug 21, 2019Dec 04, 2018","Feb 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35187198-secrets-we-kept

The novel broke my heart into a million little pieces and it was worth it!Everything Here is Beautiful explores the relationship of two sisters, Miranda and Lucia. Miranda, the older sister is responsible, stable and always in control, her younger sister Lucia suffers from mental illness, specifically bi-polar disorder/schizophrenia. We see Miranda struggling with trying to live her life, but living with the guilt that her sister is somewhere not being treated for her illness. Mental illness is always a hard topic to write about and not everyone does a good job of writing on this topic. Mira Lee did an amazing job of capturing exactly what the illness does to the individual, families and relationships. The story is told from different POVs, each POV gives different insight into how the illness is affecting them and Lucia. This is beautifully written, honest, complex, raw and heartbreaking debut novel. I recommend for anyone who loves a solid book that delivers on strong characters and speaks to a topic that we all should be talking about a lot more. I almost cannot believe this is a debut novel.

The story follows 25yr Fudges heading to Jamaica to oversee a plantation- a life he knows nothing about. Winkler really speaks to what the 1800s was like in Jamaica and I absolutely adored the historical aspect of it- especially as a Jamaican. Overall I did enjoy the book, at times I felt Winkler tried too hard to be funny but the plot was very engaging. If you are a fan of Winkler, no doubt you will love this one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 14, 2018","Jan 23, 2018","Jan 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16057234-the-family-mansion

The Title ""They Both Die at the End"" had two of those going for it- the title and the premise. In this book Adam Silvera's premise is on point. The story is set in a world where you are given 24hrs notice before you die. So at 12midnight, if your phone rights, it might mean you will die within the next 24hrs. The thing about these calls is, you don't know when exactly or how you will die. Great premise right? I love the idea of the backstories of the persons who make the calls, those who receive the calls and how all their stories merged. The major let down for me was that the story was centered about 24hrs, there is honestly so much you can do in a day before it becomes unbelievable. Also, I felt as if the two main characters lacked chemistry, I didn't get that loving feeling I usually get when I read of two characters in a life ending situation. Also, I found myself enjoying the sub-plots/stories about the secondary characters than the main characters.

The Things a Bright Girl Can Do  Is the story of three young female protagonist- Evelyn, Nell and May who are all a part of the Suffragette movement. The book is set in London during the peak of the Suffragette movement and WW1. It’s always interesting reading historical fiction told from a Young Adult POV, I think this is what stood out the most for me and this book. All three girls, though a part of the movement came from different backgrounds and were in the movement for different reasons. Evelyn is the oldest and is set to live the clichéd life of marrying her childhood sweetheart, having kids and managing a household. Except, Evelyn wants to go to University and learn and be able to make decisions on her own. Nell, who is from a humble background lives with her parents and 7 other siblings, is the expected to work to take care of her family. She dresses like a boy because that’s how she feels most comfortable and she also loves girls. She is a part of the Suffragette movement because she believes in Girl Power and their right to be who they want in the world. May lives with her Mom who is a known rebel, as a child she was exposed to various movements and causes that spoke to Women’s rights. She lives for a protest and fighting the power. The book is told from the POV of these three girls during a time where their future is unknown with the impending war. We get a glimpse into their personal lives, how they handle the demands and expectations of society- which for me was the most insightful read for me. Overall, a great YA novel, I think every young reader should be privy to this book.

This one line basically sums up the general feeling of the Protagonist in this book.  Chemistry  is about a Chinese protagonist doing her Graduate research in Chemistry- she is pressed on so many sides- from her boyfriend who excels at everything, her parents who expects greatness and somewhat her best friend who seem to be living her best life. We see how our narrator crumbles and for the most part remains directionless and uncertain about everything in her life.I am usually not one for clipped, sparse prose but this book really surprised me. I love how quirky, funny, brilliant and real the narrator felt. It felt like I was in her head for the entire read. For me, this is a must read, especially for those students/young adults who feel they don't have it all together, and for parents who pressure their kids to excel.

Juilet is a Puerto Rican queer goddess who finally got the nerve to come out to her family, then leaves the next day from the Bronx to take up an internship in Portland with her favorite Author, Harlowe- the authority of everything feminist and pussy power.

While I enjoyed Juliet's journey, the plot felt a lot like feminism/queer 101. There was a lot of explaining and dumbing down, at times I wanted to scream at Juilet, ""HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THIS?!!!! HOW NAIVE CAN ONE PERSON BE?!!!!"" Yes, I know this is a coming of age novel but I felt the character Juilet could have been a bit more prepared/educated.

I remain baffled every single time his is referred to as President, it is like a nightmare that wont end and I cant help but think, ""how did this happen?!!!!""... As Coates put its: ""If there was a difference between me and the President, it was that I thought Trump wouldn't win, whereas Obama thought categorically, that he couldn't. What amazes me thinking back on that day is the ease with which two people, knowing full well what this country is capable of, knowing that it had once sent hundreds of thousands off to die in service of slavery, knowing it had looked away during the era of lynching, knowing that it was conceived in slavery, dismissed the possibility of a return to the old form.""

That for me really made me enjoy the novel a lot. Two things I didn't necessarily like about the book:1. It felt overwritten, it tried so hard to be deep and well meaningful that most of the prose felt force and overdone. I sometimes had to re-read paragraphs to fully understand what the Writer was trying to say. However, I cut some slack here because this is a debut novel. 2. The book could have used a few more pages to really dive into the three main characters. I felt they each had powerful stories to tell that would have resonated more with me had I gotten the opportunity to spend more time with them.Overall, a decent West Indian novel. I do recommend adding this to your list of books to read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 23, 2017","Jul 24, 2017","Jul 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/147807.Unburnable

There are sometimes you read a book and no one will have your experience, because we all had different takeaways. Now, a lot of persons are ""bashing"" Sheryl Sandberg because of her privilege and how she dealt with HER grief and they are comparing how THEY dealt with their grief and how Sheryl probably should have dealt with hers. For me that doesn't make a lot of sense. If you want someone to write a book on how YOU should deal with YOUR grief- YOU need to write that book, that way you will get exactly what you need from it. Yes, there are a lot of things wrong with this book, it doesn't have a clear objective, it is a little all over the place and sometimes vague and generalizes a lot, but I think we can all agree that Sandberg did help in the following ways:1. From this book I learned how to help someone who is grieving. Everyday we are surrounded by people who are grieving or lost something. I for one NEVER know what to say to these persons, from this book, I know exactly how to handle the situation. So even if this is the one take away, it is a MAJOR take away because now I can help a friend, family member or coworker who is grieving and that will really impact my relationships and interactions with them.2. Yes I know everyone grieves differently and I cant exactly say I have had any major loss in my life (knock on wood), but Sandberg offers practical ways on how we can go through the grief. She mentions journaling, how to accept help, how to move forward. Again, all of these advice may not be practical in your grief, it may not be practical for me IF I do end up grieving but at least I have an idea of what I can do. Is this the best book on grieving and how to handle grief? No.Will there ever be the one book we refer too when grieving? NO, that is because we all grief differently and we all have our own journey. This makes ing and reading this book hard but what I did learn will really help me in my life and that is a major thing for me. Because of this book, I now know how to help those who are grieving.

The first half of the book was thrilling and will keep you entertained, the second half was basically a cookie cutter ending. If you have read any ""psychological thriller"" you've read the ending of this book. I could have read the end with my eyes closed and still know what happened. I try not to dwell on the bad because I have no idea how hard it is to write a book but there are two things that stood out that really made me dislike this book. 1. The author wants us to believe the improbable, she wants to believe that Gina who was married to her husband for over 10 years never once stepped foot in his garage/work area. The entire plot is based on us believing this absurd idea. How are you living in a house together and never once did you think to check out the area where your husband works? How did the kids not randomly end up there? I just don't get how Caine would like us to believe that didn't happen. 2. The ""cliffhanger"" was such a rip off, literally. I get that not every question will be answered at the end of a book but to knowingly end the book like that is low blow. I for one will not be reading the next book in this series.

They give you a breakdown of health plans, grocery list, exercise plan, travel plan.... everything you can think of healthwise is covered in this book. This might just be the most comprehensive health plan/ lifestyle change plan I have ever seen or read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who are just starting their health journey, even for those who are in the middle of it, it is a great refresher. I love that the Daniel Plan takes into focusing putting God as the base of your change, too often as Rick Warren says, we depend on willpower to make this journey- will power will last 2-3 weeks, we need God's power to go through this for a life time. So the faith aspect that is included is also a big focus and something for everyone to take into consideration. A great tool for those who want to remain healthy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 27, 2017","Jun 29, 2017","Jun 26, 2017",,Audiocd,view (with text),/book/show/20083073-the-daniel-plan

Little Fires Everywhere  is set in Shaker Heights, where everything is perfect and uniformed, even the lawns. We are introduced to the Richardson family- a complex group of individuals who lives in comfort and lacks nothing. The family rents an apartment, and their new tent is Mia and her daughter Pearl. The book, for the most part, covers the relationship between the Richardson and their tenant, among other things. While this was an enjoyable read, I cannot tell you exactly what the book is about. For the most part, it felt like.... ""little plots everywhere"" (lol). I understand the need for backstory and sub-plots but there were so many in this novel that it sometime felt as if it was taking away from the main plot. Also, when you have characters in the sub-plot that seem more interesting in the main plot, that's a little problem. I just felt the book was a little all over the place and didn't really hone in much on the main plot. Also, the actions of some of the characters seemed a little far-fetched, even for fiction, but that might just have been me.

TerKeurst knows how to connect to her readers, and her writing style makes it an easy read. One of my favorite chapters in this book was Chapter 11: Ten Things You Must Remember When Rejected . As a Christian that is early in my walk, this chapter really spoke to me in so many ways. Specifically the sections that encourages us to not ask the ""what"" questions, not the ""why"" question. We go through so many trials and troubles in life and this chapter offers practical advice on how to really face these hard and difficult challenges. TerKeurst listed some questions we should ask in these times: 1. What is one good thing I’ve learned from this?2. What was a downside to this situation that I can be thankful is no longer my burden to carry?3. What were the unrealistic expectations I had, and how can I better manage these next time?4. What do I need to do to boost my courage to pursue future opportunities?5. What is one positive change I could make in my attitude about the future?6. What are some lingering negative feelings about this situation that I need to pray through and shake off to be better prepared to move forward?7. What is one thing God has been asking me to do today to make tomorrow easier? I have this list written out, and it so good to have on hard and really go through when life gets rough and you are tempted to ask the ""why"" questions. A great read for those who want to know more about Jesus, how to real with rejection and how to develop a closer relationship with God. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 27, 2017","Jul 10, 2017","Jun 20, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27840705-uninvited

I wouldn't call myself a big fan, and I am usually not one for young celebrities writing memoirs, it usually comes off as shallow and self-absorbed- most of what they have the say doesn't add to the conversation and is usually eyerolling- that wasn't the case with Garbourey.

Its great when you get just a raw look at how fame changes people and those around them, one of the things that stood out for me was how much was expected of her after her first role in Precious, how things remained the same and she showed up to red carpets in less than spectacular wardrobe. Another was how mean and rude people can be, she spoke about how people felt the need to give her health advice in the most obnoxious way. Honestly, no memoir gets any realer like this.

Now that my fan-girling is over, let me  the book. ""Anything is Possible"" really is the epitome of how short stories should be written. While you don't have to read the first novel ""My Name Is Lucy Barton"" to fully appreciate this follow-up, it would help. I love how the stories are like loose leave green tea that comes together seamlessly in the end. I actually love how strong and well developed each character and story is, even though it just goes on for 30 pages- if so much. As usual, these words come to mind whenever I read a Elizabeth Strout novel:Poignant SharpGentleThought-provoking Mind-blowing Rich UnderstatedWhile the book is short in pages, it is rich and overflowing in content. The novel for me reads like an on-going “Humans of New York” blurb and I loved that. The narrative is realistic, emotional, melancholy, moving, very stripped down and organic. I am in awe of Strout’s rich language and how she is able to move a plot along with so little words. Two of my favorite quotes from this book are: ""A complaining woman was like pushing dirt beneath the fingernails of God""""The HIT-THUMB THEORY... one summer hammering tiles down hard, he'd discovered that if you hammered your thumb by mistake, there was a split second when you thought: Hey, this isn't so bad, considering how hard I was hit.

I enjoyed and learned every minute of reading this book. The Book of Joy is basically a conversation between the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu about how you find joy or more specifically how as an individual you can be joyful in this world. The book was done as commemorative piece for the Dalai Lama’s 80th birthday. The two met in India for the celebration of their lives and to talk about Joy, led by the writer Douglas Abrahams. I have to admit that I do not know who Archbishop Desmond Tutu his or how instrumental he was in the apartheid movement. What I will say is, I learned so much about this Archbishop and its clear he is one joyful fellow. Aside from the profound, awe-inspiring wisdom doled out in this book, what I appreciated was how Abrahams uniquely captured the true spirit of these two individuals. Who knew the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu were too big jokers who are constantly look for any moment to tease each other or create fun trouble? I thoroughly enjoyed how human these two Spiritual men were depicted and I think I related and learned a lot more based on how they were depicted. I also love that even though they are both from two religious backgrounds, they agreed on a lot. I will be putting into practice some of the tips Abrahams left us with, I think a lot can be gained from having a “God-eyes” view of a situation. As with a lot of things, practice is needed but I am up for the challenge. I have to make mention of the photos used in the book, they were all magically- whoever the photographer was clearly knows how to capture magic in one click. I leave you with some of my favorite quotes from this book.“Why be unhappy about something if it can be remedied? And what is the use of being unhappy if it cannot be remedied?”“Wherever you have friends that’s your country, and wherever you receive love, that’s your home.’”“A healthy perspective really is the foundation of joy and happiness, because the way we see the world is the way we experience the world. Changing the way we see the world in turn changes the way we feel and the way we act, which changes the world itself.

At first the sheer number of children and their names were a bit overwhelming and at times I got mixed up and confused but Flournoy managed to narrow down and focus on key individuals and we learned more about their siblings from their POV.

I didn't know exactly what the book was about before I started reading it, but I read a Reviewer who recommended it for persons who were feeling far from God. Needless to say, the last few weeks I haven't been feeling God's presence as strongly as I used to and I have been praying for a sign or something to get back into a deeper relationship with Him- then ""The Shack"" turned up in my newsfeed.I am not here to dispute if what happened to Mack is real or not, after reading ""The Shack"" I do not want to play judge. What I will say is everyone will experience this book based on where they are currently with their walk with God and what happened/is currently happening to them. For me, this book shook me to the core. It made me cry, laugh, left me awe, smiles, opened my spiritual world in so many ways. The most important take away from this book for me is the relationship factors that were discussed. I loved how we see God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit as approachable loving individuals we can all have a deep relationship. Too often I view God as this terrifying judge and jury just waiting to smite me, and that is truly not the case. Also, the Holy Spirit was always this fleeting wonder I could never wrap my mind around and after reading this book, I really got an appreciation for Him. Overall, this book is in my soul, it has refreshed my relationship with God and made Him more approachable and that in itself says a lot. Too often we get caught up with religion, institutions and we feel judged, that we are not living up to what is expected because we cant seem to reach that ""perfection"" that is required. We were made to love and have a deep relationship with God- this book really drove that point home for me. I have so much to say about this book and it is definitely one of those books I will keep re-reading. I wrap up with saying that this book really shook me when it made reference of worrying, how we live in the past and the future and when we do this, God isn't there, because He is present with us, we should remain present. Growing up my mother was as worrier and it is a habit I have been trying to shake because I know worrying does not help in any situation and reading that God made reference to worrying really spoke to me. This is a MUST READ for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 20, 2017","Mar 20, 2017","Jan 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1812457.The_Shack

If your memoir is not as real, poignant, bare, beautifully written, clever, insightful, brave, moving, and life changing as this, I don't want to read it.

I usually do not like books that are set in small town but Tinti had so many other things going on plot wise that I was thoroughly entertained.

However, as with most criminals, their past lives will catch up with them. This book thoroughly explores a relationship a father has with his daughter and how they navigate the father's past mistakes. I honestly enjoyed reading this book and I think it had to do with the characters but also how the book was presented. We go back and forth between the present and the past. The past explores how Samuel Hawley came close losing his life, all of which were nail biting, random and often times a little hilarious.

The book basically spoke about focusing our lives and caring about the things that need our attention, as opposed to draining our energy on mundane irrelevant things. It is about knowing what ""fks"" to give basically. While there is nothing grounding breaking in this book, it served as a good reminder of all the things we sometimes forget or take for granted.

I didn't know what to expect when I decided to read it, and Trevor Noah really gave me a history lesson, kept me laughing, made me cry a little and in general made in a huge fan of him. A lot of things he referenced about South Africa I could relate to growing up in Jamaica and I loved that. Three things that I learned that really shocked me were:1. Imagine your birth being a crime. Just take a moment to let that sink in. You were born a crime. Under the Apartheid system, your entry in the world is punishable by four years in prison for your parents. That honestly blew my mind in so many ways. It made me sad and angry. But I loved how Trevor and his Mom dealt with the situation. 2. In this book Trevor told us that as part of the Apartheid system people could apply to be white. People. Could. Apply. To. Be. White. There was a system in place where people could actually apply to be white. Again, let that sink in. As Trevor described, there was a pencil test where they would put a pencil in your hair and if it goes straight through you are white. CRAZY RIGHT?!!!!!! 3. Another thing I found fascinating was the fact that Chinese were classified as blacks because they didn't know how to classify them. However, because the Japanese had a lot more to offer to the Government they were classified as white. Wow.I love a book that makes me learn and opens my world and I think that's exactly what Trevor Noah did here. I have been recommending this book to everyone I meet because it is so relevant today. Apart from that, you were get an in-depth look into Trevor Noah's life growing up and trust me, that was a fun one. The only problem I had with this book was that it didn't cover how exactly he went to America and started hosting one of the most watched late night shows.

I have so many things to say about this novel, it might not be coherent but neither was the book so please bear with me.1. Rent CANNOT be that expensive for you to submit yourself to such rules and regulations. Also, in this day and age with so many persons having a lot of things they don't need to impress people they don't like, I hardly see that minimalist living taking off. I did appreciate the author bringing to life the idea that we all have a lot of things we really don't need or use and we all could use a little minimalistic view in our lives. 2. As one er rightfully said, this was really a mix between ""Gone Girl"" and ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". Yes, a weird mix but it kinda sorta work in an insanely weird way. Granted, the fifty shades party wasn't badly written and wasn't enough so it ruined the book and made it totally trashy, I think it added nicely to the overall plot. 3. I started the book last night and I could not put it down. Honestly, I spent the entire day with my kindle glued to my hands just so I could finish it. It is a wild, insane, somewhat unbelievable right. You are going to be thrilled, mystified, annoyed, shocked and peeved in one go. I will admit, Delaney knows how to weave a twisty, turny tail and I loved every minute of it. I honestly could go on and on about this novel but I urge you to read it and let me know what you think.

I mean Phoebe, I am STILL cut up about Carrie choosing Mr. Big- REALLY?!!! Also, Carrie, in retrospect isn't that great, she was broke, in debt, paying rent and still shopping for shoes at 35 years old-I mean really?!!! Anyway, I digress. I loved how Phoebe got the whole black culture what is it like growing up with hair that is hard to manage. Even though I live in the Caribbean the struggle is still insanely real for someone which natural hair.

Ruta told the story of what four young adults went through during the Nazi invasion, how they ended up on the Wilhelm Gustloff and how their meeting will forever change each of there lives. This is YA genre like I have never seen it before. The characters were interesting, they all had so many interesting layers to them. Ruta really did her research with this book and it shows in the interesting construction of the plot and characters. I honestly cannot get over what an amazing book this is and how much I've learned. I am baffled that as an avid Historical Fiction reader I've never heard of Operation Hannibal or this ship's disaster. Thanks Rupta for writing about this, job well done. MUST.

I will say I learned a lot from this book, and Sandberg pointed out a lot of things that I currently do that might be impeding me in ways I did not know. So yes, the book was indeed an eye-opener, I had a lot of ""ah ahhh"" moments while reading. With that said, some areas I found she rambled a bit and other areas I could not relate to. Not to nit pick but hearing about that story of the lady who have her kids wear their school uniforms to bed to save 15mins in the morning really threw me of, I know it is a little shallow but I couldn't help but think, aren't these kids supposed to shower before going to school..... I digress...I think women of any age have a lot to gain by reading this book, it really makes you reflect on those missed opportunities or how we as women sometimes get in our own way. Sandberg definitely added to the conversation in a good way. I liked that she touched on the point of how so much is expected of women and how society places us in specific roles and if we try to break out of those roles we are considered not living up to the right expectations.

Just 25% in and I had to stop to tell everyone about it. I honestly cannot stop talking about how amazing this book is. This might just be the best memoir I have ever read, hands down. ...First let me say, while I do consider myself a runner, I am not a fan of NIKE, my go too brand for sneakers is ASICS because #RealRunnersWearAsics .I decided to give this book a go because I really like reading about how companies get started. I also subscribe to Ryan Holiday's reading list and this was on his list to read- I got curious and decided to give it a go. Best decision for the month of August. Before picking up this book, I've never heard of Phil Knight or anything related to him. After finishing this book, I must say, Phil Knight moved me to tears, motivated me, made me cry, inspired me, left me in awe, pissed me off a little but overall, Knight made me a believer in everything that is NIKE. I see a lot of myself in young Knight, how unsure he was about his place in life, how we knew he had a bigger calling and how he took the unbeaten track in life. I liked that he took the time to travel and gain a lot of insights he wouldn't have gained being in Oregon. I loved how honest he was about the struggle to build a business, how he remained true to himself against everything else. People see NIKE and a lot, including myself would not believe the struggle and fight it took to make it the brand it is today. I almost could not believe the pure fight Knight went through to make sure that company succeeded. At times I felt tired and like giving up when I read about the problems that came about especially that 25million customs bill. I felt there are times I would have thrown in the towel and call it a day, but Knight stuck through it and this is the real reason for the company's success. I admire this man and everything he's achieved. I liked reading about the history of NIKE, how he decided on the name even though he didn't love it. How he paid graphic artist $35USD to create a logo that had ""motion"" and ended up with the swoosh/tick. That tick is one of the most recognized logos in the world. I am currently working in advertising, so reading about a brand image that came from nothing to being world renowned was extremely interesting for me. I've learned so much from reading this memoir, I honestly think this book should be required reading in schools. You learn about character, entrepreneurship, not giving up, taken the unbeaten road, believing in yourself and most of all- just doing it. Just do it.

I was totally enthralled, I could not get enough of Greenwood's research and presentation- also, she is hella funny. Honestly, have you ever wondered what it would be like to just disappear? I am sure we have all flirted with the idea and maybe went as far as going offline for an entire day, but then we al came back. I have daydreamed about starting over but like all the reference to women in this book it would be hard.

While I was intrigued about her reference to Michael Jackson and other dead celebrities who people still think are alive. I felt she could have cut down on that chapter A LOT.

Dew Angels follows the life of Nola Chambers, Jamaican girl born into a family and community who thinks having dark skin is an offense and proceeds to treat Nola as such. The community of Redding in Jamaica prides itself on its “light-skinned” people, so much so, Nola stuck out like a sore thumb and she was made to not forget it by those around us. A coming of age novel, we meet Nola at age thirteen trying to navigate a world where her sister gets preferred treatment, where her father treats her less than and her mother is mute and turns a blind eye to all these things happening to her. Nola’s world begins to open up when her school principal places her into a study group with Dahlia and Delroy. Their bond begins to grow stronger than they expected with each day they spend together doing school work. While Dahlia’s Mother Merlene is viewed by the community of a woman of ill-repute, Nola cannot help but admire how close Dahlia is to her mother. Dahlia’s household is the one that Nola longs for they embody the relationship Nola wants to have with her Mom. Things take a turn for the worse when Nola is seeing leaving Merlene’s establishment.Melanie Schwapp wrote a character that is haunting, resilient, a fighter, and the overall embodiment of a true Jamaican woman- Nola is definitely one character I will always remember. The book takes us on an unforgettable journey, for at least then years of Nola’s life. We see her face challenges, defeat, loss of love but we also see her grow and fight back in the most beautiful way.

In the end I have to admit- I absolutely ADORED  Dew Angels  Dew Angels is a story centered around Nola- a Jamaican girl born into a family who thinks having dark skin is an offense and proceeds to treat Nola as such. I would classify this as a coming of age novel as we see how Nola progresses from being a victim to overcoming in every area of her life.

It was a really nostalgic read for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed Kingsolver's writing in this novel. The Poisonwood Bible is about the Price family who is on a mission trip to Congo during the 1950s. The Dad, Nathan Price is a Minister who sets out to saving souls for Christ and baptizing everyone who comes in his path. There are a lot of cultural, spiritual and political things in play that hinders Price from achieving his goal- including his family. What absolutely loved about this novel was the writing. The book is told from the POVs of the mother and the daughters in the family. It is uncanny how distinct each voice it and I thoroughly appreciated that. This is a solid five star novel for me.  July 12, 2016 It took me 9 days to finish this book. NINE DAYS. I feel like I just finished running a marathon. I am exhausted, emotional, annoyed, happy, unhappy, angry, vindicated, tired- I am feeling just about every emotion after finishing this book. Like running a marathon, there were times where I felt I would never finish this book. There were times where I just didn't want to continue reading, but Kingsolver is a master storyteller, it was impossible to stop once I started. I have to say, Kingsolver's character development and use of varying POVs is impeccable. I am amazed at how she goes between four characters and each have a very distinct voice. At first I thought all of this would falter coming to the end but these characters are very consistent. I would go out on the limb and say, I have never read a book with such strong character POVs. I honestly loved this book. I think I rushed through some of the parts because I just wanted to be over, but overall, this is a must read. Also, how am I JUST finding this book when it seems half my Goodreads friends read it already! Late to the party much. MUST.

If you are grieving this book will resonate with you. If you've ever lost someone, this book will hit the spot and you will find yourself having a lot in common with Didion. I do have an appreciation for the book even though I haven't lost anyone (KNOCK ON ALL WOOD). I really felt for Didion in ways I didn't think possible. The writing will take a little getting used to, but you forgive it because this is grief at its rawest form. I like learning something new or having a thought provoked while reading. What really stuck with me was Didion explaining that people who are grieving are not diagnosed as having a psychological problem because they are expected to ""overcome"" or ""get through it"", but why isn't grief studied and looked at more in-depth? Is it because everyone grieves differently? Is it because we are expected to go through it and come out ""normal""? - yes, I really thought about this. I wouldn't say I enjoy reading this book, but I am definitely happy I read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 25, 2016","Jul 27, 2016","Jul 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking

It took me a while to plough through because each time I picked up the book, I would be reading about another senseless death. It is such a heart-breaking read, and I can relate to Younge's feelings of wanting to SCREAM over how senseless these deaths were. What totally got me was Younge saying that he didn't go with the specific date because of the 10 murders but he could have chosen ANY day and the results would have been the same. CRAZY. That blew my mind, how is it possible that this is happening and no one is paying any attention to it? While I liked the book, I think Younge may have been a bit too ambitious and kinda bit off more than he can chew. I felt the presentation of the data wasn't as seemless as I wanted it to be.

The name Sabga was mentioned again and again both in positive and negative light. It is with this background that I jumped at the opportunity to read Anthony Sabga's autobiography. I am a sucker for a great rags to riches story and ""A Will and A Way"" takes you on a journey of success. Imagine moving to a country where you do not know the language, where you have to depend on everyone, where you are uneducated in a society with less than 100 people from your homeland- that alone is enough to send me into depression. Not Anthony Sabga. What I loved most about this book was that it was unashamed in showing you how many times Sabga actually failed. You got a realistic look into what it was like doing business in the 60s and just how a little out of the box thinking carried you a long way. Granted, this story was told from Anthony's point of view so some of it might be a little fiction but who am I to judge. What I didn't like was the layout/how the book was narrated. I felt like the authors/researchers had a lot to say but they didn't know how to present it. They also didn't know what to do with all the information they received so at points they threw a lot of information and at other points a whole situation or problem was summed up in two lines. Maybe I am nit picking here, but I felt there were so many ways they could have presented the information but they erred on the side of easy and most convenient.Overall, I really enjoyed this book mainly because of the historical background in doing business in Trinidad, the history the Syrians on the island and how motivating the overall message is. If you are planning to do business in Trinidad this is definitely a go too book. If you like a great rags to riches story, this will pique your interest. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 25, 2016","Jun 25, 2016","Jun 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30763372-sabga

I just could not get over how unrealistic the entire plot was AND I could not relate or identify with Jessica and Dominic. I think it is one of those instances where I preferred if the story wasn't told from a first person point of view. Needless to say, Cohen will take you on a very wild ride with this one. Unless you are one twisted psychopath, you wont see the ending coming. Even though I rated 3.5 I don recommend yall taking the time to read this. I generally do not like comparing books but this is ""Gone Girl's bigger more twisted sister we are dealing with here.

I did not see this end coming at all! Cohen took me on the wildest ride where every character was a suspect. This is my first book by Cohen and I am definitely going back for more. The various points of views was seamless and really helped in maintaining the thrill and moving the plot along. You cannot believe how well developed the characters were, how fast paced the plot was and just how great the big reveal was. This is definitely a must read!

I have been in a horrible reading slum, falling 10 books behind on my reading goal because most of the books I end up reading end up being underwhelming. Needless to say, Ann Patchett's ""Commonwealth"" knocked me off my feet and woke me up out of my slumber. I am such a fan of storyline that follows families over a number of years and Patchett did a spectacular job of tying these families together in the neatest most messiest bow ever. I don't want to give a lot away, but the story starts when a DA shows up randomly to a cop's daughter christening and what happened after will blow your mind.A genuinely fun, gripping and interesting read. A totally different feel from Bel Canto but if you loved that book you will definitely enjoy this one.
