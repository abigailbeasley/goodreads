He appreciated his walks, camping trips and floats down the river while life slowly left him until he could travel no more and died listening to his remaining sister tell the story of his float down the river with his beloved brother, John, who had died at the age of 22.Followed by the Lark makes me want to learn more about Henry Thoreau, his sojourn beside Walden Pond and his connections with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson (the father of Louisa May Alcott) and Walt Whitman.

It was a very slow, lingering tale which I started on 3 separate occasions, before and after it was announced as part of the Canada Reads short list.I appreciated the resilience, the family, the characters but found it was a bit slow for me. I think it will lead to excellent discussion on Canada Reads!!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 11, 2024","Jan 14, 2024","Jan 11, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61650564-bad-cree

If I could give half stars, I would have given it a 2.5 but am rounding it up to a 3. This was my last of the 5 short-listed books and I should note that I LOVE that Canada Reads introduces books that I might not normally read and books that others enjoy. it is wonderful to be introduced to a variety of new authors, writing styles and genres. Although romance is not my favourite, I am looking forward to the discussion.As for this book, I couldn't help but roll my eyes at some of the descriptions, Stephen King in his book On Writing would definitely be cringing (perhaps that is not the point and I should have just got into the flow of the beach type read and suspended my critical eye...) but really??? here are some examples:""how dark his eyes are, black as a crows wing""or""the air tasted of vending machine sandwiches, diesel fumes and misery"".... what??or""she had a round face with hazel doe eyes and a tiny cherry of a nose that under most circumstances made her seem deceptively innocent""or ""bottom lashes were an exaggerated curve, as black as the lake at midnight""In the end, the story made me think of friends who do own and live on a resort in Huntsville. the setting seemed idyllic. I think I might have liked the story if the writers notes at the end, were more incorporated into the story, dealing with more of the serious issues on PPD and anxiety.I am looking forward to the debates... I know that the best book does not always win but the defenders are always interesting and it always gets more Canadians interested in reading!!Let the games begin!!!...more",Notes are private!,3,2,1,"Jan 18, 2024","Jan 20, 2024","Jan 11, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61848488-meet-me-at-the-lake

It is sad to think about the struggles of teens and young g adults as they live in public housing and try to fit in. It causes readers to reflect on what others have dealt with, struggle through and overcome. It highlights that throughout the challenges, there is resilience and a capacity to move forward despite hardships. As an adult, it is hard to think of youth dealing with these adult issues and this should lead to interesting discussions on Canada reads. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 11, 2024","Jan 12, 2024","Jan 11, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41810931-shut-up-you-re-pretty

It is a poignant tale of seniors living in their neighbourhood (Chinatown) as it changes. It is about love, loss, kindness, grief, comfort and every day coping. It is beautifully written and a book that I would like a hard copy to re-read, slowly, to take in the dialogue (written often in both Cantonese and English), the memories and think about the areas depicted in the art. This book would make very interesting discussion as we often don't think about seniors, their lives, their memories and what they have to offer as well as the changes in community and the impacts on the long-term residents.
