All that is shattered one night when two men with swords appear and fight over taking her back to their realm. They unbelievably tell her she is a Princess from another realm and she was sent away from her home realm for her safety. As Shay tries to navigate the new world she is brought into, one of magic and unicorns, she becomes very close to the ruler of the rival kingdom. As their relationship deepens against both of their wishes, war and manipulation swirl around them.

It is told from the point of view of Halverd and Tova, two young people in a dangerous climate of war. When war becomes reality, they must fight for what is best for their people. Tova only barely remembers her family as she was thought to die years ago and had been set adrift in the sea (funeral rites for her tribe) but was adopted by the war loving Svell tribe. Halverd is struggling with the oncoming responsibility of chieftain of the other nearby tribe. When these tribes clash, both must choose the right path.

I consider myself a teacher but also a lifelong learner and as such, rarely teach straight from a textbook. I try to incorporate all of my learning in my lessons. However, if this book is aimed at a young audience, I feel that it may have missed its mark. As a teacher, I found it interesting and engaging in most areas but it was wordy and often long winded in others. I think it would lose the attention of most readers below high school age. While the information is important and the truth should be told, textbooks are only a small part of the issue. My high school teachers led me to debate and think critically about all material and I hope I do the same for my students.

While it is clearly a beginning to a new series, it follows teenagers that are bonded to the elements. Each element has a bonded pair (so far boy/girl) and we are introduced to the Air pair (Foster/Tate) and the Water pair (Charlotte/Bastien) in this book. In addition to these teenagers there are other young adults who also manifest gifts for each element. It seems that all these people were the product of an experiment on the fetuses while in utero. Foster's adoptive father seems to be the scientist who began these experiments and the older adults who manifest the gift are in danger of losing their minds if all the teens are not brought to the island where they live to stabilize their gifts. After Foster and Tate meet and stop tornadoes in their tracks, the race is on to find the other pairs and keep them from their mad scientist creator. I liked the way the author described the teenagers practicing with their gifts like it was play but then were able to manipulate them in more serious situations.

As this girl, Rosie, exists in a coma, her family gathers around her trying to make sense of why this has happened.

Meanwhile, Rosie visits her memories with a bunch of spiritual guides, a she tries to reclaim who she is and what choices she has made. In the three days that follow, Rosie and her family must come to terms with how their actions have far reaching effects for both good and evil.
