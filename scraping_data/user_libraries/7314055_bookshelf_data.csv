For some reason that increased the enjoyment for me. Charlie's ""you can't really threaten me because I have nothing left to lose"" no-nonsense attitude makes him one of my favorite characters.

I have since the first time I met her in Mr. Mercedes, where Mr. King admits that she was supposed to be a bit character, but he became attached to her also.This book did not contain his typical supernatural aspect, which was a fun change. I don't read a lot of Stephen King anymore, but I have loved both Fairy Tale and Holly by him this year. You don't have to have to have read the other King books she appears in to enjoy Holly, but there will be references in her relationships with others that may not be clear without having done so. Nothing that would take away from the plot...which is just as creepy as you'd expect from Stephen King....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 24, 2023","Aug 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65916344-holly

Preparing, building tension, sharing topics for introspection, setting the tone/expectations for the gathering...all of these can make good use of the lead time in various circumstances. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 02, 2022","Oct 04, 2022",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/43617964-the-art-of-gathering
