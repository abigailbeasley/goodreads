It’s the end of the season and a storm is imminent. Determined to make the best of it, they check into the sun-soaked doors of the Villa Rosa. Already feeling insecure after seeing the “beautiful people,” the seemingly endless number of young models and musicians lounging along the Mediterranean, Evelyn is wary of the hotel’s owner, Isabella, who seems to only have eyes for Richard.Isabella ostensibly disapproves of every request Evelyn makes, seemingly annoyed at the fact that they are there at all. Isabella is also preoccupied with her chance to enthrall the only other guests—an American producer named Marcus and his partner Debbie—with the story of “the sleepwalkers,” a couple who had stayed at the hotel recently and drowned.Everyone seems to want to talk about the sleepwalkers, save for Hamza, a young Turkish man Evelyn had seen with some “beautiful people,” as well as the “dapper little man”—the strange yet fashionable owner of the island’s lone antiques and gift shop she sees everywhere.But what at first seemed eccentric, decorative, or simply ridiculous, becomes a living nightmare. Evelyn and Richard are separated the night of the storm and forced to face dark truths, but it’s their confessions around the origins of their relationship and the years leading up to their marriage that might save them.Exhilarating, suspenseful, and also very funny, The Sleepwalkers asks urgent questions about relationships, sexuality, and the darkest elements of contemporary society—where our most terrible secrets are hidden in plain sight.My Thoughts:The book is atmospheric and gave me a sense of being outside looking in. Evelyn seems to have some issues and some of that is revealed later on. I had some trouble with the prose stopping midsentence and the next paragraphs being seemingly unrelated, like some of the text was missing. This occurred at various times during the book. I failed to find any humor here. Maybe I'm dense, but even at the end I wasn't sure what I'd read and what really happened and what was imaginary. The writing was easy to read, but this book was just not for me. I do see some people really loved it though. I'm on the fence about whether I would recommend it to my friends. Some might find it interesting, it just seems too unfinished to me.Thanks to Simon & Schuster through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 09, 2024","Apr 11, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/176442759-the-sleepwalkers

Sarah Langan is a new author for meDescription:You’ll be safe here. That’s what the greasy tour guide tells the Farmer-Bowens when they visit Plymouth Valley, a walled-off company town with clean air, pantries that never go empty, and blue-ribbon schools. On a very trial basis, the company offers to hire Linda Farmer’s husband, a numbers genius, and relocate her whole family to this bucolic paradise for the .0001%. Though Linda will have to sacrifice her medical career back home, the family jumps at the opportunity. They’d be crazy not to take it. With the outside world literally falling apart, this might be the Farmer-Bowens last chance.But fitting in takes work. The pampered locals distrust outsiders, cruelly snubbing Linda, Russell, and their teen twins. And the residents fervently adhere to a group of customs and beliefs called Hollow . . . but what exactly is Hollow?It’s Linda who brokers acceptance by volunteering her medical skills to the most powerful people in town with their pet charity, ActHollow. In the months afterward, everything seems fine. Sure, Russell starts hyperventilating through a paper bag in the middle of the night, and the kids have drifted like bridgeless islands, but living here’s worth sacrificing their family’s closeness, isn’t it? At least they’ll survive. The trouble is, the locals never say what they think. They seem scared. And Hollow’s ominous culminating event, the Plymouth Valley Winter Festival, is coming.Linda’s warned by her husband and her powerful new friends to stop asking questions. But the more she learns, the more frightened she becomes. Should the Farmer-Bowens be fighting to stay, or fighting to get out?My Thoughts:I like dystopian scenarios where people try to survive in different ways. This one was based upon a big corporation with a seemingly helpful product that was used world-wide. Their community, Plymouth Valley, seemed to be a protected oasis with many advantages for families who were allowed to live there. The Farmer-Bowens were so relieved after all their suffering to be allowed in. Once there they tried so hard to be accepted and fit-in, but the people there made it tough. As the plot moved along and Linda started piecing things together another picture of Plymouth Valley formed and she became more and more uneasy. This book falls into a few categories: mystery, thriller, horror, and dystopia I think, so if you enjoy books in these categories you would probably like it too.Thanks to Atria Books through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 06, 2024","Apr 09, 2024","Apr 06, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/176443112-a-better-world

This is the second in the Nora McTavish series and both books have been good ones.Description:Needing to help the most vulnerable is in Nora McTavish’s DNA. Living within the echoes of her own traumatic past, she spends her days as a family advocate providing comfort and justice for those without anyone else to turn to. So when a long lost childhood friend calls asking for help and promising clues to the location of Nora’s missing mother, she has no choice but to say yes.Nora hasn’t seen Tess Grayson in over twenty years. Living the perfect suburban life in a college mountain town, Tess’s world is shattered when her husband Neil—a professor at the local university—is accused of killing a student he was allegedly having an affair with. When the charges against Neil are dropped and he petitions for custody of their daughter, Kendra, Nora steps in to help Tess any way she can.But as details emerge surrounding the murder and unsettling occurrences plague the quiet neighborhood, Nora begins to suspect Tess isn’t being fully honest with her. With Kendra’s safety and well-being hanging in the balance, Nora works to unearth the family’s secrets, and in doing so puts herself in the crosshairs of someone willing to kill to keep them buried.My Thoughts:Nora goes above and beyond as a family advocate, but when helping her friend Tess she gets some mixed feelings. Their past history together overshadows the present. It also makes the story more interesting. I couldn't help but love Kendra who was caught in the middle of her parents domestic situation. There were definitely red herrings in the book which kept me wondering what was actually going on here. This book is a slow burn moving from the domestic situation to a boiling point climax. I would recommend this to anyone who likes domestic thrillers.Thanks to Thomas & Mercer through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,Apr 2024,"Apr 02, 2024","Apr 01, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/92217371-never-come-back

While on duty at the hospital one day, a patient named Caitlin arrives in a coma with a traumatic brain injury, having jumped from a bridge and plunging over twenty feet to the train tracks below. But when a witness comes forward with shocking details about the fall, it calls everything they know into question. Was Caitlin pushed and if so, by whom and why?

I chose to read this book because the description sounded like it dealt with the abolitionist movement and the fight for freedom.Description:Philadelphia, 1837. After Charlotte escaped from the crumbling White Oaks plantation down South, she’d expected freedom to feel different from her former life as an enslaved housemaid. After all, Philadelphia is supposed to be the birthplace of American liberty. Instead, she’s locked away playing servant to her white-passing father, as they both attempt to hide their identities from slavecatchers who would destroy their new lives.Longing to break away, Charlotte befriends Nell, a budding abolitionist from one of Philadelphia’s wealthiest Black families. Just as Charlotte starts to envision a future, a familiar face from her past reappears: Evie, her friend from White Oaks, has been brought to the city by the plantation mistress, and she’s desperate to escape. But as Charlotte and Nell conspire to rescue her, in a city engulfed by race riots and attacks on abolitionists, they soon discover that fighting for Evie’s freedom may cost them their own.My Thoughts:This book was enlightening for me as it is the first I've read during the pre-Civil War time period that was not set in what is considered the ""deep south"". The setting here is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and many Blacks are free. Just a bit further south the environment at the time would be totally different. There are still major prejudices and segregation here though. I found the political standing of the abolitionists at this time to be brave considering the atmosphere in the city. Obviously, they were inviting trouble. The story of Charlotte and her father, as well as Evie was heartbreaking. It was easy to hate Kate for her role here. Sometimes I found the book a bit slow, but I felt it a good portrayal of what was happening during this time period.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,1,20,1,"Mar 27, 2024","Mar 30, 2024","Mar 27, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/182484361-all-we-were-promised

Upon closer inspection, it’s determined no animal could make such perfectly precise cuts. Only a blade could do that. Wielded by a human. Soon, dozens of oil drums emerge amid the river of grass. Each one packed to the brim with body parts.FDLE special agent Amy Larson and her partner, FBI special agent Hunter Forrest, share a bad feeling that extends beyond the horrifying nature of the grim discovery. They’ve seen this kind of sadistic killing before, and when a small beige horse is discovered at the bottom of one of the barrels, they know exactly what it means. The fourth horseman of the apocalypse rides a pale horse—and his name is Death.With so many bodies to identify, connecting one victim to the next is easier said than done. But finding a pattern in the chaos might be the only way Amy and Hunter can zero in on the killer, testing their skills as agents—and their relationship—like never before. And when the disturbing trail of clues signals these slayings are just the beginning, the agents will have to return to where it all started before it’s too late. The apocalypse is coming, and Hunter and Amy have only one chance to stop it, even if it means sacrificing each other.My Thoughts:This was a good story, but I found it kind of slow at times. The plot with the four horsemen and the apocolypse was made for an interesting read. I liked the romance between Larson and Hunt and the way they played to each other's strengths. I would have probably liked this more if I had read the first three books - but that's on me.

Still reeling from the death of her sister years earlier, she leaves South India to attend graduate school at Columbia University. In New York, Vega straddles many different worlds, eventually moving in and out of a series of relationships that take her through the striving world of academia, the intellectual isolation of the immigrant suburbs, and, ultimately, the loneliness of single motherhood. But it is the birth of Vega’s daughter that forces the novel’s central question: What does it mean to make a home?Written with dry humor and searing insight, Habitations is an intimate story of identity, immigration, expectation and desire, and of love lost and found. But it is also a universal story of womanhood, and the ways in which women are forced to navigate multiple loyalties: to family, to community, and to themselves.A profound meditation on the many meanings of home and on the ways love and kinship can be found, even in the most unfamiliar of places, Habitations introduces Sheila Sundar as an electrifying new voice in literary fiction.My Thoughts:Sundar's prose is both beautiful and heartfelt. I enjoyed reading about Vega's journey to find herself. I also enjoyed reading about how she fit in during the time she spent at different locations in America and then back in India. I felt her sister's death overshadowed Vega's life and held her back from moving forward in some ways. This book is not full of action, but is full of reflection and self-realization as Vega finds her way in her work, as a mother, and in her personal relationships with others.

When wealthy industrialist Robert Barnes and his wife, Anna, build Marbrisa, a glamorous estate on Biscayne Bay, they become the toast of the newly burgeoning society. Anna and Robert appear to have it all, but in a town like Miami, appearances can be deceiving, and one scandal can change everything.Years later following the tragic death of her parents in Havana, Carmen Acosta journeys to Marbrisa, the grand home of her estranged older sister, Carolina, and her husband, Asher Wyatt. On the surface, the gilded estate looks like paradise, but Carmen quickly learns that nothing at Marbrisa is as it seems. The house has a treacherous legacy, and Carmen’s own life is soon in jeopardy . . . unless she can unravel the secrets buried beneath the mansion’s facade and stop history from repeating itself.My Thoughts:This book has two timelines related to murders at the same house - Marbrisa. One is right after the Great War when people from the north came to Florida to build mansions and communities. The other is around 1940. The deaths at the house are mysterious and some said the house was haunted by Anna Barnes who disappeared from the house in the first timeline and was presumed dead. It was speculated she drowned in the bay. Some speculated that her husband killed her, but he was never charged. Her body was never found. When murders happened again in the 1940 timeline Anna Barnes and the haunting theory were brought up. There was an eerie feel to the house that everyone seemed to notice. I enjoyed this story and the mystery surrounding it. The characters were interesting and captivating. The plot was a slow burn.

Every time she meets a new man , she receives a slip of paper with his name and a number on it—the exact amount of time they will be together. The papers told her she’d spend three days with Martin in Paris; five weeks with Noah in San Francisco; and three months with Hugo, her ex-boyfriend turned best friend. Daphne has been receiving the numbered papers for over twenty years, always wondering when there might be one without an expiration. Finally, the night of a blind date at her favorite Los Angeles restaurant, there’s only a Jake.But as Jake and Daphne’s story unfolds, Daphne finds herself doubting the paper’s prediction, and wrestling with what it means to be both committed and truthful. Because Daphne knows things Jake doesn’t, information that—if he found out—would break his heart.Told with her signature warmth and insight into matters of the heart, Rebecca Serle has finally set her sights on romantic love. The result is a gripping, emotional, passionate, and (yes) heartbreaking novel about what it means to be single, what it means to find love, and ultimately how we define each of them for ourselves. Expiration Dates is the one fans have been waiting for.My Thoughts:The description of this book sounded fun and I think the premise has a lot of promise. But for some reason, and I'm not sure if it was the mood I was in while reading or if it was the book itself, I had trouble getting through this short, 277 page book. It took me eight days to read it and normally I read a book about every two days. I couldn't get invested in the story until the last twenty percent of the book and then I found it interesting. It bothered me that Daphne would find these notes with a guy's name and the amount of time she would spend with him, and she would jump in to a relationship even knowing it was only supposed to last 3 days or two weeks. I mean, why bother? Anyway I had trouble with that. I did like the last twenty percent of the book because then I found out more of what was really going on with Daphne and there was a twist in the romance at the time that was notable.

I was surprised to discover that this name is a pseudonym for a husband and wife team, Sean and Nicci French who are known for their suspense novels. They have written quite a few.Description:A nerve-tingling and atmospheric thriller from master of suspense Nicci French about two families shattered by tragedy and the secrets that have been waiting decades to be revealed. On the day of Alec Salter’s fiftieth birthday party, just before Christmas 1990, his wife Charlotte vanishes. Most of the small English village of Glensted is at the party for hours before anyone realizes Charlotte is missing. While Alec brushes off her disappearance, their four children—especially fifteen-year-old Etty—grow increasingly anxious as the cold winter hours become days and she doesn’t return. When Charlotte’s coat is found by the river, they fear the worst. Then the body of the Salters’ neighbor, Duncan Ackerley, is found floating in the river by his son Morgan and Etty. The police investigate and conclude that Duncan and Charlotte were having an affair before he killed her and committed suicide. Thirty years later, Morgan Ackerley, a successful documentarian, has returned to Glensted with his older brother Greg to make podcast based on their shared tragedy with the Salters. Alec, stricken with dementia, is entering an elder care facility while Etty helps put his affairs in order. But as the Ackerleys ask to interview the Salters, the entire town gets caught up in the unresolved cases. Allegations are made, secrets are revealed, and a suspicious fire leads to a murder. With the podcast making national news, London sends Detective Inspector Maud O’Connor to Glensted to take over the investigation. Resented by her mostly male colleagues, she has no tolerance for either their sexism or their incompetence. And she will stop at nothing to uncover the truth as a new and terrifying picture of what really happened to Charlotte Salter and Duncan Ackerley emerges.My Thoughts:This is an emotional novel with families torn apart by the disappearance of Charlotte Salter and the death of Duncan Ackerley soon after Charlotte disappeared. No one seemed to know what really happened. Thirty years later the children were all back in town and Morgan Ackerley (Duncan's son) stirred everything up again by making a podcast and talking with everyone in the families and in the community about the disappearance of Charlotte Salter. When the detective from London becomes involved the investigation is on again. My heart broke for the children, especially Etty. Charlotte's husband Alec was easy to dislike - did he do something to Charlotte to make her run away, or did he kill het maybe? This was a complex and difficult case and there were definitely some surprises. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery.Thanks to William Morrow through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I grabbed this book because the description sounded like a fun mystery.Description:Jolene Garcia is a local TV reporter in Phoenix, Arizona, splitting her time between covering general assignments—anything from a monsoon storm to a newborn giraffe at the zoo—and special projects. Stories that take more time to research and produce. Stories that Jolene wants to tell.When word gets out about a death at a radio station, Jolene and other journalists swarm the scene, intent on reporting the facts first. The body is soon identified as Larry Lemmon, a controversial talk show host, who died under suspicious circumstances. Jolene conducted his final interview, giving her and her station an advantage. But not for long.As the story heats up, so does the competition. Jolene is determined to solve this murder. It’s an investigation that could make or break her career—if it doesn't break her first.My Thoughts:The author's background as a tv reporter was evident in the authenticity of the fast-paced tv reporters' day to day activities and concerns showcased in the book. The necessary insensitivity of the reporters was also evident and we all hate that aspect of reporting whether it be tv or newspaper or magazine. However, I can also see that is the job and the stories wouldn't be as sensational and titillating without it - news would be rather bland and uninteresting. And yet it is easy to hate. The desire to ""get the scoop"" on a story has to be at the forefront for every journalist.The murder was an interesting one and there was certainly more than one suspect. I enjoyed the story plot even though I felt the characters didn't have a lot of depth and I didn't really get too invested in any of them. This is a good debut murder mystery for the author and I think Christina Estes shows a lot of potential as a fiction author.

I found it to be much more similar to Agatha Christie's Miss Marple series than to Knives Out or The Thursday Murder Club though.Description:It’s 1965 and teenage Frances Adams is at an English country fair with her two best friends. But Frances’s night takes a hairpin turn when a fortune-teller makes a bone-chilling prediction: One day, Frances will be murdered. Frances spends a lifetime trying to solve a crime that hasn’t happened yet, compiling dirt on every person who crosses her path in an effort to prevent her own demise. For decades, no one takes Frances seriously, until nearly sixty years later, when Frances is found murdered, like she always said she would be. In the present day, Annie Adams has been summoned to a meeting at the sprawling country estate of her wealthy and reclusive great-aunt Frances. But by the time Annie arrives in the quaint English village of Castle Knoll, Frances is already dead. Annie is determined to catch the killer, but thanks to Frances’s lifelong habit of digging up secrets and lies, it seems every endearing and eccentric villager might just have a motive for her murder. Can Annie safely unravel the dark mystery at the heart of Castle Knoll, or will dredging up the past throw her into the path of a killer? As Annie gets closer to the truth, and closer to the danger, she starts to fear she might inherit her aunt’s fate instead of her fortune.My Thoughts:I was caught up in the plot almost immediately upon starting the book and couldn't put it down until I was finished. I was totally engrossed. I loved the eccentricity of Frances as well as Annie's determination to find out what happened to Frances. The contest element of the will seemed daunting because the timeline forced such a fast pace. The prose was well written and the blending of what happened in the past and the present time was seamlessly done. There were many characters and quite a few suspects leaving a lot of avenues to investigate. I was not able to guess the murderer. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery. I'm eagerly anticipating the next book in this series.Thanks to PENGUIN GROUP Dutton through Netgalley for an advance copy.

It’s worlds away from her previous career as a vital part of the Office of Special Investigations. There, she devoted herself heart and soul to covert operations, the riskier the better.Since leaving, Melanie has cherished her peaceful, calm existence, with her two beloved retired service dogs for company. Then a call comes from her former supervisor, Rich Patterson. He needs her back for a highly specialized assignment. An international group of billionaires is known to meet regularly for decadent dinners, and they always hire high-class escorts for the occasion. Only the most elegant, well-educated, and sophisticated women will do. Infiltrating those meetings could yield information vital to national security.Melanie’s loyalty is indisputable. She’s willing to pose as an escort and glean every scrap of intel that she can. But these men aren’t just wealthy and powerful, they’re also exceptionally ruthless. One slip, and they won’t hesitate to eliminate Melanie, by any means necessary. . .My Thoughts:Melanie was a strong female lead. She showed courage in taking on the impersonations she had to manage in order to assist in the investigation. The investigation itself was daring and risky. Melanie's life was in danger and the cost of not succeeding was great. I'm not sure how Melanie left her fast-paced, dangerous life to become a school guidance counselor. That had to be a difficult transition for her. I have to admit I liked and admired the character. I also liked the wonderful dogs in the story. Overall I enjoyed the story and it was a fun investigation and an enjoyable read. It did feel somewhat rushed and things seemed to come too easily for Melanie.

Up until now, the Jessup sisters have been playing it by ear, but withthe whole town watching, can they catch a killer before he strikes again?My Thoughts:I loved the record / coffee shop setting and the sisters who worked together to revive this family business. This book gave me exactly what I want from a good cozy mystery: a small town setting, friendly characters with a sense of community, a little romance, and a murder mystery to solve. The shady investment company angle adds interest to the story and to the investigation. The two romantic interests competing for Juni also adds interest.

And then there’s the one you can’t. Welcome to the Morningside.After being expelled from their ancestral home, Silvia and her mother finally settle at the Morningside, a crumbling luxury tower in Island City where Silvia’s aunt Ena serves as the superintendent. Silvia feels unmoored in her new life because her mother has been so diligently secretive about their family's past. Silvia knows almost nothing about the place where she was born and spent her early years, nor does she know why she and her mother had to leave. But in Ena there is an a person willing to give the young girl glimpses into the folktales of her demolished homeland, a place of natural beauty and communal spirit that is lacking in Silvia's lonely and impoverished reality.Enchanted by Ena’s stories, Silvia begins seeing the world with magical possibilities and becomes obsessed with the mysterious older woman who lives in the penthouse of the Morningside. Bezi Duras is an enigma to everyone in the building. She has her own elevator entrance and leaves only to go out at night and walk her three massive hounds, often not returning until the early morning. Silvia’s mission to unravel the truth about this woman’s life, and her own haunted past, may end up costing her everything.Startling, inventive, and profoundly moving, The Morningside is a novel about the stories we tell—and the stories we refuse to tell—to make sense of where we came from and who we hope we might become.My Thoughts:This dystopian world was set somewhere in the United States after some type of climate disaster that included drought and flooding which the people haven't really been able to recover from. The story is told from the point of view of Silvia who lives with her mother. They have been part of a Relocation Project and are living with her Aunt Ena. Silvia's mother won't talk about the past, so Silvia doesn't really know where she came from and what happened in the past. Aunt Ena provides information to Silvia and shows pictures, but Silvia doesn't know what is true and what her mother is hiding. This is the story of a mother and daughter relationship and of hidden secrets. It was interesting to see the two worlds competing in Silvia's mind - the one on the surface and the one Aunt Ena described with her stories of a Vila and scary negotiations the Vila made. This is an interesting book with magical realism and a coming of age story. It is character driven and the characters are well drawn and have depth.Thanks to Random House through Netgalley for an advance copy.

He’s never lost a case, but can he win when he’s presumed guilty?Stafford Lee Penney is a small-town lawyer with a big-time reputation for winning every case he tries. In his sharp suits and polished Oxford shoes, Penney is Biloxi, Mississippi’s #1 Lawyer and top local celebrity.  Just as Penney notches his latest courtroom victory, his wife is scandalously killed. He spirals into a legal and personal losing streak, damaging his reputation and ruining his career.  That’s when Penney makes a bold decision. He stops trading on his power-lawyer identity and creates a new lawyer lifeguard. Moonlighting at the beach, showing up to court in flip-flops, mentoring a law student, the new Penney is at first unrecognizable.  It’s said that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client. But when Penney’s accused of murder, the #1 Lawyer will find a way to triumph. My Thoughts:This is a truly great legal thriller with dramatic courtroom scenes and lots of avenues to pursue. Stafford Lee is a fascinating protagonist, but he has his flaws and as the story moves along this becomes personal and then he ends up getting charged with a murder. And wow! He decides to represent himself at trial? No attorney would do that would they? My eyes were glued to page and I raced through this fast-paced, exciting book. Then the ending was totally unexpected!

Claire Swinarski is a new author for me.Description:Armed with a Crock-Pot and a pile of recipes, a grandmother, her granddaughter, and a mysterious young man work to bring a community together in this uplifting novel for readers of The Chicken Sisters.Esther Larson has been cooking for funerals in the Northwoods of Wisconsin for seventy years. Known locally as the “funeral ladies,” she and her cohort have worked hard to keep the mourners of Ellerie County fed—it is her firm belief that there is very little a warm casserole and a piece of cherry pie can’t fix. But, after falling for an internet scam that puts her home at risk, the proud Larson family matriarch is the one in need of help these days. Iris, Esther’s whip-smart Gen Z granddaughter, would do anything for her family and her community.As she watches her friends and family move out of their lakeside town onto bigger and better things, Iris wonders why she feels so left behind in the place she is desperate to make her home. But when Cooper Welsh shows up, she finally starts to feel like she’s found the missing piece of her puzzle. Cooper is dealing with becoming a legal guardian to his younger half-sister after his beloved stepmother dies. While their celebrity-chef father is focused on his booming career and top-ranked television show, Cooper is still hurting from a public tragedy he witnessed last year as a paramedic and finding it hard to cope. With Iris in the gorgeous Ellerie County, though, he hopes he might finally find the home he’s been looking for.It doesn’t seem like a community cookbook could possibly solve their problems, especially one where casseroles have their own section and cream of chicken soup mix is the most frequently used ingredient. But when you mix the can-do spirit of Midwestern grandmothers with the stubborn hope of a boy raised by food plus a dash of long-awaited forgiveness—things might just turn out okay. Includes Recipes My Thoughts:This book reminded me of growing up in a small town and of a group of older ladies at the church I attended when I was young. This is a heartwarming story of family and community pulling together when one of their own is in trouble. My heart went out to Esther after someone online convinced her she was in trouble and Esther loaned her a lot of money - then found she was scammed and she may lose her house. I loved the way Esther's granddaughter Iris did everything she could to help her grandmother. The story of the chef and his family added depth and intrigue to the story with the PTSD issue, their family issues, and the celebrity. The funeral ladies are a treat and are such great friends. I just loved all the characters. Claire Swinarski has spun a great story and I will look for more of her books in the future.Thanks to Avon and Harper Voyager through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I think this is the fourth or fifth book I've read by her. Her books never disappoint and this was no exception.Description:Frankie Elkin is an expert at finding the missing persons that the rest of the world has forgotten, but even she couldn’t have anticipated this latest request—to locate the long-lost sister of a female serial killer facing execution in three weeks’ time.She has called herself ""death,"" but people called her the devil.The case was sensational. Kaylee Pierson had confessed from the very beginning, waived all appeals. Despite the media’s chronicling of her tragic circumstances—the childhood spent with a violent father—no one could find sympathy for “the Beautiful Butcher” who had led eighteen men home from bars before viciously slitting their throats.Now, with only twenty-one days left to live, Pierson has finally received a lead on the whereabouts of the sister who was kidnapped over a decade ago, and she needs Frankie’s help to find her. The Beautiful Butcher’s offer:When was the last time your search ended with finding the living?Unable to resist the chance for a rescue, Frankie takes on Pierson’s request. Twelve years ago, five-year-old Leilani went missing in Hawaii. The main suspect? Pierson’s tech mogul ex-boyfriend, Sanders MacManus. Now, on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific—the site of MacManus’s latest vanity project—fresh evidence has appeared. In order to learn the truth and possibly save a young woman’s life, Frankie must go undercover at the isolated base camp. Her challenge: A dozen strangers. Countless dangerous secrets. Zero means of calling for help. And then the storm rolls in…My Thoughts:The serial killer who was on death row was there for horrifying crimes. I'm not sure anyone would sympathize with her enough to search for someone. It looks like Frankie took the case not for the ""Beautiful Butcher"" but to help the missing sister. The setting on the island was tense and the tension grew as things unfolded. It kept my attention and kept me turning pages to find out what would happen. There was a surprising twist and a turbulent situation ensued. A gripping, fast-paced plot.

I chose this book because the description sounded interesting. I had to find out why Billie West took her best friend's baby. Unimaginable!Description:On a brisk fall night in a New York apartment, 35-year-old Billie West hears terrified screams. It's her lifelong best friend Cassie Barnwell, one floor above, and she's just realized her infant daughter has gone missing. Billie is shaken as she looks down into her own arms to see the baby, remembering—with a jolt of fear—that she is responsible for the kidnapping that has instantly shattered Cassie’s world.So begins the story of Billie and Cassie's friendship--both in recent weeks, and since they met twenty-three years ago, in their small Hudson Valley hometown the summer before seventh grade. Once fiercely bonded by their secrets, including a traumatic, unspeakable incident in high school, Cassie and Billie have drifted apart in adulthood, no longer the inseparable pair they used to be. Cassie is married to a wealthy man, has recently become a mother, and is building a following as a fashion and lifestyle influencer. She is desperate to leave her past behind--including Billie, who is single and childless, and no longer fits into her world. Hurt and rejected by Cassie’s new priorities, Billie will do anything to restore their friendship, even as she hides the truth about what really happened the night the baby was taken.Told in alternating perspectives in Lovering’s signature suspenseful style, Bye Baby confronts the myriad ways friendships change and evolve over time, the lingering echoes of childhood trauma, and the impact of women’s choices on their lifelong relationships.My Thoughts:This is a gripping tale of a relationship where one friend is obsessively dependent on the other. This is a good mystery that kept my attention and there is a chilling plot. I didn't like Billie or Cassie, but I did feel sorry for Billie's past experiences. The plot moved quickly and kept my attention. Secrets from the past were revealed slowly as the story built. The friendship was central to the story and learning the various nuances to this relationship kept my attention.Thanks to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for and advance copy.

According to her neighbors, she’s prickly and unapproachable, but beneath her tough exterior, Kat is plagued by guilt from her past.Seventy-seven-year-old Dorothy Darling is Shelley House’s longest resident, and if you believe the other tenants, she’s as cantankerous and vindictive as they come. Except there’s a good reason Dorothy spends her days spying on her neighbors—a closely guarded secret that no else knows and the reason Dorothy barely leaves her beloved home.When their building faces demolition, sworn enemies Kat and Dorothy become unlikely allies in their quest to save their historic home. But when someone starts to play dirty and viciously targets one of the residents, Dorothy and Kat suspect foul play in their community. After the police close the investigation, it's up to this improbable pair to bring a criminal to justice.My Thoughts:This is a heartwarming account of the group of people living in the historic Shelley House when they are notified the building is slated for demolition. The focus is the interpersonal relationships among the residents, and the author dug deep into these relationships and made me care about them - especially Dorothy and Kat. The story is told from two points of views, Dorothy's who is in her seventies and has lived in Shelley House for ages, and Kat's who is new to Shelley House. Dorothy is a cantankerous, grumpy woman who seems to hate or dislike everyone. She is the self-appointed monitor of everything related to Shelley House, but is ignoring the fact that she needs to move. Kat has trust isssues and is afraid to create relationships with anyone.

They’re looking for the small resort town where they plan to spend their honeymoon. When they spot what appears to be a lone hitchhiker along the deserted road, they stop to help. But not long after the hitchhiker gets into their car, they see the blood seeping from her jacket and a truck barreling down Atticus Line after them.When the hitchhiker dies at the local hospital, April and Eddie find themselves in the crosshairs of the Coldlake Falls police. Unexplained murders have been happening along Atticus Line for years and the cops finally have two witnesses who easily become their only suspects. As April and Eddie start to dig into the history of the town and that horrible stretch of road to clear their names, they soon learn that there is something supernatural at work, something that could not only tear the town and its dark secrets apart, but take April and Eddie down with it all.My Thoughts:This story held quite a few surprises as April and Eddie's honeymoon turns into a nightmare. These unexplained murders happening on the same road with the supernatural legend surrounding them was creepy. Why weren't any of these murders solved?

They could be anywhere.A sniper dubbed “The Long Shot Killer” is taking out impossible targets in New York City.As the unknown shooter’s hit list mounts, Detective Michael Bennett calls for reinforcements.Officer Rob Trilling doesn’t like to talk about himself. But he has an impressive resume as a former Army Ranger who’s won a Bronze Star and recognition as a sniper with NYPD’s Emergency Services Unit. ​Bennett struggles to connect with the soldier, barely older than his own ten kids, especially when Trilling begins to log unexplained absences from duty. Trilling may be more comfortable with rifles than he is with people, but only Bennett can prove whether his partner is a lonely hunter or a hardened assassin. My Thoughts:This one centers on a sniper investigation. The sniper seems to be choosing victims that are seemingly unrelated. Bennett gets paired with the young Officer Trilling who initially is very uncommunicative. The investigation is comples and intense. Many questions arise not only about the suspect, but about Officer Trilling's secretive life. I enjoyed the intrigue and the investigation. Trilling's various interactions throughout were both positive and negative keeping everyone off balance. And wow! Bennett already has 10 kids and wanting another? That blew my mind. I just can't imagine such a houseful. Good plot, fast pacing and good characters. I really like Michael Bennett as an investigator. He seems like a fair-minded, intelligent guy.

Loretta Davenport has led an isolated life as a young mother and a wife to Pete, an ambitious assistant professor at a Bible college. They’re the picture of domestic tranquillity—until a local girl is murdered and Loretta begins receiving messages from beyond. Pete dismisses them as delusions of a fevered female imagination. Loretta knows they’re real—and frightening. Defying Pete’s demands, Loretta finds an encouraging supporter in parapsychologist Dr. Curtis Hansen. He sees a woman with a rare gift, more blessing than curse.With Dr. Hansen’s help, Loretta’s life opens up to an empowering new purpose. But for Pete, the God-fearing image he’s worked so hard to cultivate is under threat. No longer in control of his dutiful wife, he sees the Devil at work. As Loretta’s powers grow stronger and the pleading spirits beckon, Pete is determined to deliver his wife from evil. To solve the mysteries of the dead, Loretta must first save herself.My Thoughts:Anyone would have been scared hearing voices. I admired Loretta's bravery going to see the parapsychologist to try to understand what was happening to her, even though her husband was dead set against it and she had to be very secretive. I certainly didn't like Loretta's husband Pete at all with his controlling manner. The book was successfully in providing a good look at women in the 1950's as well as the atmosphere of that period. The story has a distinct feminist view which totally fit the story. I would recommend to anyone who likes a good period novel.Thanks to Lake Union Publishing through Netgalley for an advance copy.

This is a fun series and Finlay and Vero get themselves in so much trouble and their attempts to remedy situations are hilarious. They always keep me laughing.Description:Finlay Donovan and her nanny/partner-in-crime Vero are in sore need of a girls’ weekend away. They plan a trip to Atlantic City, but odds are―seeing as it’s actually a cover story to negotiate a deal with a dangerous loan shark, save Vero’s childhood crush Javi, and hunt down a stolen car―it won’t be all fun and games. When Finlay’s ex-husband Steven and her mother insist on tagging along too, Finlay and Vero suddenly have a few too many meddlesome passengers along for the ride.Within hours of arriving in their seedy casino hotel, it becomes clear their rescue mission is going to be a bust. Javi’s kidnapper, Marco, refuses to negotiate, demanding payment in full in exchange for Javi’s life. But that’s not all―he insists on knowing the whereabouts of his missing nephew, Ike, who mysteriously disappeared. Unable to confess what really happened to Ike, Finlay and Vero are forced to come up with a new plan: sleuth out the location of Javi and the Aston Martin, then steal them both back.But when they sneak into the loan shark’s suite to search for clues, they find more than they bargained for―Marco's already dead. They don’t have a clue who murdered him, only that they themselves have a very convincing motive. Then four members of the police department unexpectedly show up in town, also looking for Ike―and after Finlay's night with hot cop Nick at the police academy, he’s a little too eager to keep her close to his side.If Finlay can juggle a jealous ex-husband, two precocious kids, her mother’s marital issues, a decomposing loan shark, and find Vero’s missing boyfriend, she might get out of Atlantic City in one piece. But will she fold under the pressure and come clean about the things she’s done, or be forced to double down?My Thoughts:This one has a lot of shady characters and mobsters to keep up with. The crimes are involved and danger lurks everywhere it seems. Finlay and Vero are great characters. Some of the book is silly and you have to suspend belief because let's face it - this could never happen. This book is not my favorite in the series, but it is still good. I have to say the first two books are my favorites so far. You really need to have read prior books to keep up with this as it is a continuing situation. Characters in the earlier books continue to appear in this one. There is tension and suspense as the story progresses and, of course, some dead bodies. I really like the hot cop, Nick, who is Finlay's romantic interest. I highly recommend this series to anyone reading for entertainment with a touch of crime solving.Thanks to St. Martin's Press, Minotaur Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Homicide detective Jane Munro—pregnant and acutely attuned to the preciousness of life—hopes the grim discovery will finally bring closure to the girl’s family.But for a group of Annalise’s old friends, once dubbed the Sho Six by the media, it threatens to expose a terrible pledge made on an autumn night forty-seven years ago. The friends are now highly respected, affluent members of their communities, and none of them ever expected the dark chapter in their past to resurface. But as Jane and forensic anthropologist Dr. Ella Quinn peel back the layers of secrets, the group begins to fracture. Will one cave? Will they turn on each other?The investigation takes a sharp turn when Jane discovers a second body—that of the boy long blamed for Annalise’s disappearance. As the bones tell their story, the group learns just how far each will go to guard their own truth.My Thoughts:The discovery of the bones under the chapel is the trigger that opens the cold case of a girl gone missing 50 years ago. Detective Jane Munro get the case by default since she is the only person assigned to cold cases (which was supposed to provide less stress while she deals with her own missing person issue and her pregnancy). There are a group of friends who know what happened 50 years ago, but no one talked then and they went on with their lives are are now successful members of the community, some very wealthy. What will happen if one of them talks? This was a fun investigation with a lot of twists and turns and surprises.

Ady’s favorite pastime is listening to Sanite's stories of her families' origins, their fierce and rebellious nature, and the everlasting love that strengthens their bond.When mother and daughter are separated, Ady is left hopeless and unmoored, until she stumbles into the Mockingbird Inn and meets Lenore, a free Black woman with whom she becomes fast friends. Lenore invites Ady to join a clandestine society of spies called The Daughters. With the courage instilled in her by Sanite—and help from these strong women—Ady learns how to choose herself. So begins her journey toward liberation and imagining a new future. The American Daughters is a novel of hope and triumph that reminds us what is possible when a community bands together to fight for their right to live free.My Thoughts:Both Ady and Sarite's lives were filled with hardship and setbacks. This story is both heartbreaking and filled with hope that things can get better and change will come. The goal of true freedom is worth the fight and this story is focused on the efforts of Ady and the other ""Daughters"" who are involved in the resistance in New Orleans. There are parts of the book that will make you cry at the injustice and other parts where you will be cheering on the Daughters and rooting for their victory. The time spent with this book was well worth it. The writing is well done and the plot moved at a good pace. I was glued to the pages. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction. There is a lot of factual basis to this story as well, which makes it even more interesting to me.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group through Netgalley for an advance copy.

She didn't disappoint in this novel of grief and hope.Description:When Annie Brown dies suddenly, her husband, her four young children and her closest friend are left to struggle without the woman who centered their lives. Bill Brown finds himself overwhelmed, and Annie’s best friend Annemarie is lost to old bad habits without Annie’s support. It is Annie’s daughter, Ali, forced to try to care for her younger brothers and even her father, who manages to maintain some semblance of their former lives for them all, and who confronts the complicated truths of adulthood.Yet over the course of the next year, while Annie looms large in their memories, all three are able to grow, to change, even to become stronger and more sure of themselves. The enduring power Annie gave to those who loved her is the power to love, and to go on without her.Written in Quindlen’s emotionally resonant voice, and with her deep and generous understanding of people, After Annie is a story that ends with hope, a beautiful novel about how adversity can change us in profound ways.My Thoughts:There's no question that this family, as well as Annie's best friend Annemarie basically fell apart after Annie's death and couldn't seem to find a way forward. I had to admire Ali, who shouldered so much responsibility after losing her mother, for stepping in and trying to take care of her father and younger brothers. She had to grow up so fast! Annemarie was a real mess. She had leaned on Annie so much for support with her sobriety. The book covers the family and AnneMarie for one year after Annie's death. It is an emotional story and at times difficult to read. I loved the counselor at the school who helped Ali so much.Thanks to Random House through Netgalley for an advance copy.

This is quite and intense thriller.Description:In a daring, brutal act of terrorism, an explosion rocks and topples the Statue of Liberty. Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is awakened by his boss with that news and sent to New York as the agent-in-charge. Not long after he lands, he learns two things - one that Gina Delgado of the FBI has been placed in charge of the investigation as the lead of the Joint Terrorism Task Force and two, that threats of a second terrorism attack are already being called into the media. While barred from the meetings of the Joint Task Force for his lack of security clearance, Walker finds a young boy among the survivors with a critical piece of information - a video linking the attackers to the assault.As a radical domestic terrorist group, led by a shadowy figure known only as Jebediah, threatens further attacks against America's cultural symbols, powerful forces within the government are misleading the investigation to further their own radical agenda.My Thoughts:Gripping, fast-paced, and action-packed, I couldn't put this one down and raced through it. The first attack was at the Statue of Liberty at Liberty State Park and Agent Michael Walker from the National Parks Service was sent to New York as the agent in charge, joined soon after by Gina Delgado from the FBI, who took charge of the investigation. Soon after another crisis called and they were moved to another national park site with another attack. Together the pair made great inestigators with dedication and patriotism. They were determined to find answers and stop the perpetrtors. Each chapter was introduced with factual information about national parks. It was obvious the information was well-researched in the descriptions of the sites during the investigation. I liked the way the group of native american envrionmental group played a part in assisting.

But when a young man has a tragic accident in a nearby quarry, Gabriel is the one to find him and hear his final words, leaving Gabriel with a guilty burden.As Iris tries to help ease her husband’s trauma, they acquire an unexpected house guest. Laure has seemingly moved in after her husband’s revelation that he has had a child with another woman. Iris and Gabriel insist Laure stay as long as she needs. But Laure keeps wearing Iris’s clothes, following her every move, and asking her about the recent death of the young man.Their only respite from the increasingly tense atmosphere in their own home comes from a couple new to town and expecting their first child. But with them comes their gardener, who has a checkered past.With fractured relationships and secrets piling up around them, can Iris and Gabriel’s marriage survive?My Thoughts:Lots of secrets and twist and turns in this one. Yes, I was surprised at the end. This is not my favorite book by B.A. Paris, but it is a good mystery. I have to admit I got tired of Laure pretty fast though. I wouldn't want anyone moving in with me for such a long time for sure, even my best friend. Iris and Gabriel see a lot of tragedy in the span of the book - so much for one couple it seemed extraordinary. Laure was Iris and Gabiel's guest, and some new friends of theirs have a guest as well - and he seems suspicious after they get to know more.

But elderly Helen Garlington wants Sam the sheriff to test the remains, suspecting they may solve the mystery of her long-vanished husband. It’s not a match, and Helen takes it hard, drowning her disappointment in sherry at the tavern—where she sees a contestant on a game show who she swears is her missing spouse, Martin. To ease the woman’s mind, Josie contacts the show to track down the look-alike guest, who kindly agrees to travel to Wilfred—and is then found dead the next morning.Horrified by this fatal turn of events, Josie asks the spellbound books for help, seeking the aid of Sherlock Holmes. But strange things continue to happen—frightening images flash on the screen of a long-abandoned movie theater and flocks of crows seem to appear wherever she goes. Is Josie about to meet her own Moriarty? It will take all her courage to untangle the twisted vines of this mystery before this chapter in the colorful story of Wilfred claims another life . . .My Thoughts:The way books ""speak"" to Josie is unique and fun.

But before Mia can figure out what kind of paranormal pets she has on her hands, she finds herself with a murder to solve—when a dead woman is found in the lodge rental of Christina’s suddenly attentive ex . . .My Thoughts:I really like this cozy mystery series and plan to read the books I've missed.

But after assigning her college students a project designed to nudge them outside their comfort zones, Olive realizes that she’s never once stepped a toe over her own…and it’s about time that changed. Her firsttrip into the unknown? Moving in with her long-time crush―and friend…tattooed, motorcycle-riding, and pleasantly pierced, Baxter Donovan.Bax Donovan, Guardian Angel not-so-extraordinaire, has acquired so many black marks on his record it looked like a scantron sheet. He’s given one last chance to keep his Guardian wings intact, a high-profile Assignment he knows all too well. Olive is usually as low-risk as it got. Hell, she wrote the safety manual. But something landed her on the Guardian Affairs radar and his guess was it had something to do with the heart-pounding stunts she’s determined to check off her Dare I Docket list.Keeping Olive out of trouble is about to be his toughest assignment yet, and not because he’s forced to shake the dust off his feathers and embrace his inner aerialist. He’s at real risk of shattering the only Guardian Angel Code of Conduct Rule he’s yet to Don’t fall in love with your Assignment. And he isn’t so sure that’s a bad thing.If love didn’t play by the rules, why should they?My Thoughts:This was a fun witchy rom-com. This third book in the series is about Olive and her challenge (which she gave to her students but decided she should do herself) to try new things and her budding romance with Bax - a guardian angel. It was a quick read and rather light on plot, but was an enjoyable distraction. I understand the first two books were about Olive's two sisters and their happily ever afters, so not sure if this is the last of this series or if there will be more.

Now home in Halifax, Canada, she receives word of Freddie’s death in combat, along with his personal effects—but something doesn’t make sense.

Against all odds, the two men form an alliance and succeed in clawing their way out. Unable to bear the thought of returning to the killing fields, especially on opposite sides, they take refuge with a mysterious man who seems to have the power to make the hellscape of the trenches disappear.As shells rain down on Flanders, and ghosts move among those yet living, Laura’s and Freddie’s deepest traumas are reawakened. Now they must decide whether their world is worth salvaging—or better left behind entirely.My Thoughts:The story unfolds from two points of view, Laura Iven and her brother, Freddie Iven.

I am happy to say that I thought this book was better and I found it interesting.Description:After the tragic death of her mother and a long period of isolation under the thumb of a cruel grandfather, young Caroline Brady has little to hope for in her life in the foreboding Southerland mansion. Her only companion, her enigmatic cousin, Simon, may be a wolf in sheep’s clothing and is not to be trusted. But when Caroline’s estranged father suddenly resurfaces with news of a new wife and stepchildren in Hawaii that she’ll finally be allowed to visit, Caroline dares to hope for a new, normal life. Desperate for her father’s love, Caroline will do anything to stay in this new home. But her troublesome stepsister has other plans, and Caroline cannot tell who to trust and who to run from. Will her new stepbrother and stepsister be a light in her dark life, or will they blot out the last slivers of sun forever?My Thoughts:The characters in this book are much more developed that in the first book of the series. I actually started to like Caroline and became more invested in how she navigated life after her mother's death, her father's remarriage, and her life at Sutherland with her grandfather and his family. I also developed some hope in the grandfather's humanity - although just a little. Caroline has had a very hard time and a lot to face for a young girl. Navigating her new family situation is difficult and she always has to be cautious. Her cousin, Simon, has some problems too, but I think Caroline is starting to like him. Caroline gets the chance to go live with her father and his new family in Hawaii and what happens there is interesting and kept my attention. Caroline may have found a friend in her Aunt Holly as well. I think I will read the next book in this series to see what happens to her.Thanks to Gallery Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The mystery surrounding the new murders and the link to the past investigation was complex and I enjoyed following the search for the truth. The story moved at a good pace and kept my attention throughout - I was never bored. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery and investigation.

Which, in fact, they are.With them in the room is their previously unremarkable high school music teacher, who seems to know something about their disappearance—and what has brought them back again. Desperate to reclaim their lives, the three agree to the terms of the bargain their music teacher proposes. They will be given a series of magical tasks; while they undertake them, they may return to their families and friends, but they can tell no one where they’ve been. In the end, there will be winners and there will be losers.But their resurrection has attracted the notice of other supernatural figures, all with their own agendas. As Laura, Daniel, and Mo grapple with the pieces of the lives they left behind, and Laura’s sister, Susannah, attempts to reconcile what she remembers with what she fears, these mysterious others begin to arrive, engulfing their community in danger and chaos, and it becomes imperative that the teens solve the mystery of their deaths to avert a looming disaster.My Thoughts:The prose is beautiful and is atmospheric in nature - almost like a fairy tale. There is a good story here. I liked some of the names: the band name is My Two Hands Both Knowe You; the coffee shop is What Hast Thou Ground?; and one of the magical characters is called Carousel. I thought those names were fun. I liked how some of the characters could turn into animals using their magical ability. Unfortunately, and I'm likely in the minority here, I found the book to be overly long and I was bored through a little over half of the book. I had to force myself through. Luckily the second half of the book had a little more movement to it. Also, I couldn't get invested in any of the characters. Nothing made me feel anything while I was reading this. It is not likely that I will recommend this one to my friends.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Gareth Brown is a new author for me.Description:In New York City, bookseller Cassie Andrews is living an unassuming life when she is given a gift by a favourite customer. It's a book - an unusual book, full of strange writing and mysterious drawings. And at the very front there is a handwritten message to Cassie, telling her that this is the Book of Doors, and that any door is every door .What Cassie is about to discover is that the Book of Doors is a special book that bestows an extraordinary powers on whoever possesses it, and soon she and her best friend Izzy are exploring all that the Book of Doors can do, swept away from their quiet lives by the possibilities of travelling to anywhere they want.But the Book of Doors is not the only magical book in the world. There are other books that can do wondrous and dreadful things when wielded by dangerous and ruthless individuals - individuals who crave what Cassie now possesses.Suddenly Cassie and Izzy are confronted by violence and danger, and the only person who can help them is, it seems, Drummond Fox. He is a man fleeing his own demons - a man with his own secret library of magical books that he has hidden away in the shadows for safekeeping. Because there is a nameless evil out there that is hunting them all . . .Because some doors should never be opened.My Thoughts:This was a great fantasy adventure type book involving magical books that could be used for either good or bad. It follows Cassie who has received one of the books, but is now in great danger. Much of the book is her adventure trying to survive amidst bookhunters searching for the books who will do anything to get their hands on one. There is one woman who is everyone's nightmare, and she is known solely as ""the woman"" throughout the book. It was fun to follow the advanture and the relationships Cassie formed in her struggles to survive, save her book, and keep her friends safe.Thanks to William Morrow through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Susan Mallery's books are always fun to read and I've enjoyed many of them. This book has three main characters: Paris, who owns her own farm stand; Laurel, who resells items she finds at thrift stores and estate sales and resells them for profit; and Cassie, who is new to town and working at a wine bar/bookstore. Each of these women have issues they need to overcome to find happiness in their lives and all are currently single or divorced.Description:The rules of summer book club are• No sad books • No pressure • Yessssss, wine! Besties Laurel and Paris are excited to welcome Cassie to the group. This year, the book club is all about fill-your-heart reads, an escape from the chaos of the everyday—running a business, raising a family, juggling a hundred to-dos. Even the dog is demanding (but the bestest boy).Since Laurel’s divorce, she feels like the Worst Mom Ever. Her skepticism of men may have scarred her vulnerable daughters. Cassie has an unfortunate habit of falling for ridiculous man-boys who dump her once she fixes them. Paris knows good men exist. She’s still reeling after chasing off the only one brave enough—and foolish enough—to marry her.Inspired by the heroines who risk everything for fulfillment, Laurel, Paris and Cassie begin to take chances—big chances—in life, in love. Facing an unwritten chapter can be terrifying. But it can be exhilarating, too, if only they can find the courage to change.My Thoughts:I loved the way the story developed and the characters were fully drawn so that I felt as if I knew them. I liked all these charactes, but enjoyed Cassie's story the most. Each woman faced an obstacle that she had to deal with to move on with her life, and the ways they dealt with their issues was interesting.

This one will keep you guessing.Description:The man lay on his front, his arms and legs bound and pulled up with a rope connecting the two. His head was arched back, so he faced the curtains, and there was masking tape over his mouth. Erika gingerly reached out and checked his pulse.Yep. Dead all right.When Detective Erika Foster finds politician Neville Lomas naked, hog-tied, and dead in his own bed, skittish higher-ups at the Met quickly rule the death from natural causes. Case closed . . . until two months later when a well-known casting director and a star footballer are found murdered and tied with the same knots. The Met can no longer ignore what’s staring them in the face: there’s a serial killer loose in London, and they’re out to settle a score.As Erika and her team investigate, things take a strange turn as CCTV footage turns up five female suspects . . . and they’re all identical.In the hunt to identify the women, Erika is outpaced at every turn by an elusive sex worker with dirt on enough powerful men to make the Met’s top brass nervous – and desperate.As time ticks away until the killer strikes again, it’s up to Erika to untangle the web of evidence and answer the critical questions: What ties the victims together, who else is caught up in this scandal, and how far are the higher-ups willing to go to protect their own?My Thoughts:This one has a dramatic and fast-paced plot. The hidden political agenda adds to the tension. Erika is having trouble keeping up as it seems she is always one step behind. I really enjoy this series, and it just keeps getting better as we know more about Erika's life and her cases. It is difficult to tie the victims together in this investigation and Erika is thwarted by political roadblocks that are difficult to circumvent.

Many come to start anew, to strike it big. Many kill the person they once were, the person they left behind. And in turn, someone else can turn around and kill them, too—permanently.A housekeeper enters a secluded, upscale home and discovers two bodies floating in the The heir of an Italian shoe empire and an unknown woman. The house is untouched, but a ""double"" in Bel Air certainly makes this case stand out from the usual. No forced entry means this could have been an inside job. After all, the woman floating in the pool is revealed to be Meagin March, a married neighbor from down the street, who lives in an even more opulent and sprawling mansion. Married woman having an affair? That's a perfect motive.But not everything is as it seems. At her wedding, Meagin had no family and a tip from Meagin's mother-in-law raises their suspicions. Who was she, exactly?Learning the truth about this mysterious woman—uncovering her identity and motivations—will take Alex and Milo on one of the most shocking journeys of their careers.My Thoughts:This book provided enough history in the course of the read to make it a stand alone and easily read and enjoyed even if you haven't read any of the others in the series (however, they are all good so I recommend that you read them if you get a chance). I enjoy the way Alex and Milo work together. Each of them has different skills that complement each other, which ultimately helps them solve cases. This is a strong police procedural and the investigation is not so much fast-paced as it it thoughtfully followed through. It is well written and kept my interest throughout. I recognized some of the charaters from previous books popping up from time to time. I really like Alex's partner Robin - she is an independent thinker and restores old or broken guitars. The dialog between the characters is enjoyable as they work through the clues and delve further and further into the investigation.

Then, from the stage, Jake catches her eye, and smiles. It’s the best night of her life.It’s the last night of her life.Minutes later, Jake’s in the alley getting some fresh air, and the girl from the dance floor comes stumbling out, sick and confused and deathly pale. He tries to help, but it’s no use. He doesn’t know that someone in the crowd has jabbed her with a needle—and when his girlfriend Nadine arrives, she knows the only thing left to do for the girl is call her friend, Lieutenant Eve Dallas.After everyone on the scene is interviewed, lab results show a toxic mix of substances in the victim’s body—and for an extra touch of viciousness, the needle was teeming with infectious agents. Dallas searches for a pattern: Had any boys been harassing Jenna? Was she engaging in risky behavior or caught up in something shady? But there are no obvious clues why this levelheaded sixteen-year-old, passionate about her music, would be targeted.And that worries Dallas. Because if Jenna wasn’t targeted, if she was just the random, unlucky victim of a madman consumed by hatred, there are likely more deaths to come.My Thoughts:Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a great detective character and it was fun to follow her methodology as she investigated this class with so very little to go on. I found the plot interesting and kept wondering what if something like this were really happening, how would anyone even begin to solve it, how many people would it affect before the person was caught. I fell for the character, Jake Kincade, who seems such a kind-hearted passionate guy. My heart went out to the victims who were so seemingly random and were just out having fun when they were attacked with no warning.

Not sure why I missed the earlier books in this series, but had never heard of them. When I saw it was up to number thirteen I thought I had better check it out to see what I was missing.Description:Chief Inspector Kaldis is initially dismayed to be asked to investigate a series of suspicious forest fires that took place last summer. In Greece, forest fires are an inevitability, and he fears he and his team are being set up to take the political blame for this year's blazes.He quickly becomes suspicious, though, that the forests were torched for profit - and for a project on a far grander scale than the usual low-level business corruption. There are whispers on the wind that shadowy foreign powers intend to establish a surreptitious mega-internet presence on the island of Syros, with the intent to weaponize the digital world to their own dark ends.Can Kaldis and his team stop the hostile foreign takeover of the idyllic island - or will the rise of the metaverse set not just Greece, but the whole world, on fire?With its gorgeous Greek locations, engaging characters and fast-paced plotting, this international crime series is a perfect pick for fans of Donna Leon, Louise Penny, Martin Walker and David Hewson.My Thoughts:This book was fast-paced and kept my attention. With a potential international disaster as the central theme it was engrossing and I was rooting for Inspector Andreas to prevent the scenario being set up. The Inspector had courage and determination in his favor, but the deck was stacked and it was very tense throughout the investigation. I found the exploration of the possible abuses of AI and the Metaverse fascinating. I loved the beautiful setting in Greece and I would love to go there some day and see it for myself.

You write ’em in your books and show everyone who we are.”So begins award-winning poet DéLana R. A. Dameron’s debut novel, Redwood Court . The baby of the family, Mika Tabor spends much of her time in the care of loved ones, listening to their stories and witnessing their struggles. On Redwood Court, the cul-de-sac in the all-Black working-class suburb of Columbia, South Carolina, where her grandparents live, Mika learns important lessons from the people who raise her exhausted parents, who work long hours at multiple jobs while still making sure their kids experience the adventure of family vacations; her older sister, who in a house filled with Motown would rather listen to Alanis Morrisette; her retired grandparents, children of Jim Crow, who realized their own vision of success when they bought their house on the Court in the 1960s, imagining it filled with future generations; and the many neighbors who hold tight to the community they’ve built, committed to fostering joy and love in an America so insistent on seeing Black people stumble and fall.With visceral clarity and powerful prose, Dameron reveals the devastation of being made to feel invisible and the transformative power of being seen. Redwood Court is a celebration of extraordinary, ordinary people striving to achieve their own American dreams.My thoughts:I thought Weesie was phenomenal the way she tried to pull the neighborhood community together and make sure everyone was included and felt cared for. The neighborhood was friendly and looked after their families, who were close, and I really liked that. It was sad the family couldn't trace their roots which was a result of slavery where so many were disbursed and didn't know their families. However, this is not a book about slavery, but of the love of a family and their day to day lives. The characters in the story are central and drive the plot. The writing is beautiful and I enjoyed reading it.Thanks to Random House, The Dial Press through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 07, 2023","Dec 11, 2023","Dec 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/150247430-redwood-court

I picked the book up because, from the description, it just sounded interesting. Description:Growing up in the care of her grandparents on Belhaven Farm, Lizzie Craig discovers as a small child that she can see into the future. But her gift is selective—she doesn’t, for instance, see that she has an older sister who will come to join the family. As her “pictures” foretell various incidents and accidents, she begins to realize a painful she may glimpse the future, but she can seldom change it.Nor can Lizzie change the feelings that come when a young man named Louis, visiting Belhaven for the harvest, begins to court her. Why have the adults around her not revealed that the touch of a hand can change everything? After following Louis to Glasgow, though, she learns the limits of his devotion. Faced with a seemingly impossible choice, she makes a terrible mistake. But her second sight may allow her a second chance.My Thoughts:There's a lot of quiet drama in this novel set in 19th century Scotland. Lizzie's gift of second sight influences her to do things that are distressing and not always socially acceptable. I liked Lizzie - she seemed a hard-working, dedicated farm girl with a lot of questions. However, she was naive. I really hated some of the things that happened to her because of the accpted norms of the time period she lived in. So many sad things happened to Lizzie that could have been avoided if she had only been able to use her gift to see herself. I was sad in parts of the book and furious in others. The plot was kind of slow, but I felt it was necessary to provide the detail needed for Lizzie's story. I think my favorite character was Andrew, who didn't appear until near the end of the story.

Missed the first in the Miss Hermione series, but this second one was easy to follow without having the read it. Description:""Dear Miss Hermione—what is a mother to do?""Sensible Violet Manville and her very ladylike half-sister Sephora are absolutely bored, thank you very much. And though neither of them would ever admit it aloud, they're missing the thrill of playing detective.So when Violet receives a letter from ""A Heartbroken Mother"" sent to her alter-ego, the Agony Aunt known to the world only as Miss Hermione, her pulse can't help but quicken. The daughter in question has gotten caught up in a cult: the Hermetic Order of the Children of Aed. Rumors of human sacrifices, mystical doings, and a ghost in the ruined Alburn Abbey where the Children pray have gripped the public conscious, helped along by a series of novels about the group, written by the mysterious Count Orlando, and clearly this girl has fallen prey.Miss Hermione's investigation soon collides with very real life when Violet discovers that the runaway daughter in question is Sephora's dearest friend Margaret. Violet sets off to the Children's compound in Nottintham to convince her to return to London. But with the dashing-but-frustrating Eli Marsh running around and a member of the Children found poisoned to death, Violet and Sephora—along with their ever-trusty housekeeper Bunty—may have more intrigue than they can manage.My Thoughts:The setting is a London of 1885 and I found the language and descriptions in the book fit the time period. I liked the concept of the 'Dear Miss Hermione' letters. I found the main character, Violet, to be a curious and indepenent woman who really liked being involved in an investigation and is determined to find answers. Her sister, Sephora, I think showed more backbone that Violet expected - you have to give her credit. There were red herrings to chase which made the investigation more interesting.

But suddenly reports surface of Haley dying at the remote rehab facility where she had been forced to go to get her addictions under control.There are whispers of suicide, but Meg can't believe it.

The book has a spooky cover that foreshadows what is inside. Unbelievable what was happening at that clinic! Meg had no idea what she was getting into. It took guts to do what she did - even while battling her own addiction. The narrator is unreliable in this one. The plot was tense and had good movement. The spa setting was over the top fancy.

I didn't know the author had died, and this was one of her unfinished stories which was released posthumously.Description:Frank Culhane may be the wealthy patriarch of one of Texas’ most prestigious families, but his party girl daughter, Jasmine, is only interested in the money the ranch brings in—and the cowboys. Until the day she heads to the stables in search of their hot horse trainer and instead discovers her daddy’s body in their prize stallion’s box stall.Roper’s rodeo career was cut short by an injury. Now, he’s hungry to compete in reining events, like the prized forthcoming Run for a Million. In the meantime, until his family can afford their own breeding business, he’s got to work for the rich ranchers who snub them—including the Culhanes. But when an autopsy reveals Frank was murdered, Roper lands on the list of possible suspects.A city outsider, Detective Sam Rafferty’s investigation propels him into a tangle of simmering rivalries. For the ranch is now in the hands of an explosive Frank’s young, glamourous second wife, Lila, and his scorned first wife, Madeline. Lila has a genuine passion for ranching. Madeline is determined to destroy her.Through Sam’s interviews, more tensions surface—there are Madeline’s grown children who’ve been bypassed for control of the ranch, the socially dismissed McKennas, and the breeders, politicians, and gangsters ready to profit from Frank’s death. But tricky alliances are also brewing. While Lila and Roper clash, they discover a fire beneath their sparring. And with a killer still at large, the heat between Jasmine and Sam could put the case, and all their futures, on the line . . .My thoughts:This book read like a soap opera with lots of drama. The good kind that keeps you wanting more. This was both a romance and a mystery and was a fun read that kept my attention. I liked getting to know more about prize winning quarter horses. The book had both characters to love and hate. I hated Madeline, the first wife, and didn't like the evil step-mother second wife either. I hated the hateful son and the neighbor guy with the exotic animal ranch. What a horrible way to make a living - holding animals in cages and releasing them for people to hunt and kill for sport - absolutely sickening! I did like Sam, the FBI detective and also liked the cowboy, Roper. I never figured out why they let the FBI detective, Sam live on the ranch while he was investigating. That just seems far-fetched to me. I was disappointed at the end when I realized the story wasn't finished in this book and hope there is a follow-up book to finish this was that was in progress when the author died.Thanks to Kensington Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Description:Sometimes a family treasure hunt unfurls new paths in life. The Russell family members all seem to have . . . gifts. Eldest sister Penelope naturally infuses strength or joy or love—whatever the wearer requires—into the fabric of the dresses she designs as a seamstress. Her younger sister, Lilith, is never without whatever she needs—despite the free-spirited and nomadic life she lives with her daughter. There’s always a person nearby who just happens to have an apartment available to rent, or a part-time job open, or a car to borrow just when they need it. And Lilith’s adult daughter, Mattie, always seems to trigger the perfect song to mysteriously start playing—whether from a radio in another room that was turned off or from a friend’s phone in their pocket. And at the heart of the family is their old Victorian home that sometimes seems to have a personality in and of itself. When independent, artistic Mattie Russell finds herself back in the family home after her mother’s unexpected death, she has no intention of sticking around the small town, even though she has no future destination in mind. She’s used to living in a new city every couple of years with Lilith as her sole companion, and she’s especially hesitant to entangle herself in the Russell family secrets about their special giftings. But during the reading of the will, the family is shocked to learn Lilith included a testamentary trust that requires Mattie to stay in Ivy Ridge long enough to complete a series of seemingly absurd tasks in order to claim her inheritance. While completing the tasks, Mattie discovers that her mother had a well-thought-out plan for her daughter that would lead Mattie to finding her birth father, teach her how to choose her own path, learn to keep her heart open for love, and discover that staying still long enough to sow seeds can produce a stunning garden and vibrant life. This enchanting and whimsical tale of mothers and daughters, home, and love will open readers’ eyes to the magic all around them.My Thoughts:I found the special gifts the Russell family had to be inventive and fun. They are different from any I've read about in other novels. I loved the list of things Mattie had to accomplish for her inheritance and what she found while she was performing these tasks.

That's what Libby's mom said. And after Libby’s recent bipolar III diagnosis and the tragedy that preceded it, Libby knows she and her family need to find a new normal.But Libby’s new home turns out to be anything but normal. Scores of bugs haunt its winding halls, towering stained-glass windows feature strange, insectile designs, and the garden teems with impossibly blue roses. And then there are the rumors. The locals, including the mysterious boy next door, tell stories about disappearances tied to the house, stretching back over a century to its first owners. Owners who supposedly hosted legendary masked séances on its grounds.Libby’s mom refuses to hear anything that could derail their family’s perfect new beginning, but Libby knows better. The house is keeping secrets from her, and something tells her that the key to unlocking them lies in the eerie, bug-shaped masks hidden throughout the property.We all wear masks—to hide our imperfections, to make us stronger and braver. But if Libby keeps hers on for too long, she might just lose herself—and everyone she loves.My Thoughts:There's a mystery here. Family members kept disappearing without a trace from this house, never to be seen again. The disappearances started in the 1800's and at least nine family members have disappeared over the years. The main character, Libby, is dealing with her bipolar disorder and trying to keep her family intact. I admired her strength and courage, as well as her ability to try to analyze her the things happening in her mind. I liked the character Libby as well as her new neighbor, Flynn.

The victim of a famous kidnapping as a child and a widow four times over, Ruby ruled the tiny town of Tavistock from Ashby House, her family’s estate high in the Blue Ridge mountains. In the aftermath of her death, that estate—along with a nine-figure fortune and the complicated legacy of being a McTavish—pass to her adopted son, Camden.But to everyone’s surprise, Cam wants little to do with the house or the money—and even less to do with the surviving McTavishes. Instead, he rejects his inheritance, settling into a normal life as an English teacher in Colorado and marrying Jules, a woman just as eager to escape her own messy past.Ten years later, Camden is a McTavish in name only, but a summons in the wake of his uncle’s death brings him and Jules back into the family fold at Ashby House. Its views are just as stunning as ever, its rooms just as elegant, but coming home reminds Cam why he was so quick to leave in the first place.Jules, however, has other ideas, and the more she learns about Cam’s estranged family—and the twisted secrets they keep—the more determined she is for her husband to claim everything Ruby once intended for him to have.But Ruby’s plans were always more complicated than they appeared. As Ashby House tightens its grip on Jules and Camden, questions about the infamous heiress come to light. Was there any truth to the persistent rumors following her disappearance as a girl? What really happened to those four husbands, who all died under mysterious circumstances? And why did she adopt Cam in the first place? Soon, Jules and Cam realize that an inheritance can entail far more than what’s written in a will––and that the bonds of family stretch far beyond the grave.My Thoughts:Such a wealthy family - how did things go so wrong? At first I couldn't understand why Camden turned his back on his family fortune, but as the story unfolded it was obvious. What an evil group of people! The story goes back and forth in time to delve into the past that created the present day issues and why an entire town hated the McTavish family. Camden's wife, Jules has a secret too she's been keeping from her husband and she seems much more open to reclaiming that family fortune than Camden does. Such an interesting book. The plot moved quickly and was suspenseful. The story unfolded in a satisfying way that revealed all. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to delve into a family's history and uncover skeletons.Thanks to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The Khannas are together again, finally, and Arya wants to enjoy it. So she stifles her lingering resentment towards Alina, plays mediator during her sister’s fights with their mother, and welcomes her future brother-in-law with open arms.

But sometimes, the person you least expect will give you a glimpse of your dream sequence just when you need it most.My Thoughts:Indian weddings are full of tradition and are very rich affairs that cover a large span of time.

This is the first book I've read by Amy Pease (and after reading it I found out this is her debut novel). Well done Amy Pease and I hope this will be a series!Description:Eli North is not okay.His drinking is getting worse by the day, his emotional wounds after a deployment to Afghanistan are as raw as ever, his marriage and career are over, and the only job he can hold down is with the local sheriff’s department. And that’s only because the sheriff is his mother—and she’s overwhelmed with small town Shaky Lake’s dwindling budget and the fallout from the opioid epidemic. The Northwoods of Wisconsin may be a vacationer’s paradise, but amidst the fishing trips and campfires and Paul Bunyan festivals, something sinister is taking shape.When the body of a teenage boy is found in the lake, it sets in motion an investigation that leads Eli to a wealthy enclave with a violent past, a pharmaceutical salesman, and a missing teenage girl. Soon, Eli and his mother, along with a young FBI agent, are on the hunt for more than just a killer.If Eli solves the case, could he finally get the shot at redemption he so desperately needs? Or will answers to this dark case elude him and continue to bring destruction to the Northwoods?My Thoughts:This is both a crime thriller and a police procedural. The story was engrossing and kept me guessing. I liked Eli and was rooting for him to get a handle on his alcohol addiction and PTSD from his service in Afghanistan and get back on track for himself and his family. The story moved at a good pace and I kept turning the pages. The town seemed nice as a resort destination, but there is something darker going on beneath the facade. The death of a teenager and then another missing teenager triggers the investigation that follows. Pease seemed able to put me into the town and feel what was happening there. I would recommend this to any of my friends who like crime drama.Thanks to Atria Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I haven't read the first one, but this was easily read as a stand alone. This was one of those creepy kind of books where things are happending to people that should never happen.Description:Talia March, Pallas Llewellyn, and Amelia Rivers, bonded by a night they all have no memory of, are dedicated to uncovering the mystery of what really happened to them months ago—an experience that brought out innate psychic abilities in each of them. The women suspect they were test subjects years earlier, and that there are more people like them—all they have to do is find the list. When Talia follows up on a lead from Phoebe, a fan of the trio’s podcast, she discovers that the informant has vanished. Talia isn’t the only one looking for Phoebe, however. Luke Rand, a hunted and haunted man who is chasing the same list that Talia is after, also shows up at the meeting place. It’s clear he has his own agenda, and they are instantly suspicious of each other. But when a killer begins to stalk them, they realize they have to join forces to find Phoebe and the list. The rocky investigation leads Talia and Luke to a rustic, remote retreat on Night Island in the Pacific Northwest. The retreat promises to rejuvenate guests with the Unplugged Experience. Upon their arrival, Talia and Luke discover guests are quite literally cut off from the outside world because none of their high-tech devices work on the island. It soon becomes clear that Phoebe is not the first person to disappear into the strange gardens that surround the Unplugged Experience retreat. And then the first mysterious death occurs…My Thoughts:This was a gripping and suspenseful thriller that kept my attention throughout. I liked the characters Talia and Luke. The plot was well done and moved quickly. There's a romance here too to enjoy. The things happening at the retreat are dark and creepy. I liked the investigation of what was happening there.

This is the 27th book in the Kay Scarpetta series, and it's a good one.Description:In this thrilling new installment of Patricia Cornwell’s #1 bestselling Scarpetta series, chief medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta finds herself in a Northern Virginia wilderness examining the remains of two campers wanted by federal law enforcement. The victims have been mauled beyond recognition, and other evidence is terrifying and baffling including a larger-than-life footprint.  After the most frightening body retrievals of her career, Scarpetta must discover who would commit murders this savage, and why.My Thoughts:The wilderness area where the bodies were found was really creepy. Kay is working with Marino again and he found a footprint on the site that he is convinced was a Sasquatch. What? He's very serious about it. Kay's niece Lucy plays a big part in this one. She's a big help to her Aunt Kay and has so much technical knowledge (as well as her own secrets). There a Russian angle in the plot too. As always with Cornwell's book there is a lot of technical language to wade through, but I like this because I always learn something.

But the search for a fresh start isn't as easy as they'd imagined.And they soon discover that it doesn't matter where you are or who you are - if you can't lay the past to rest, coincidence, fate and deception have a way of catching up with you when you least expect it.My Thoughts:I've never had a backpacking experience nor stayed in a hostel so the concept was intriguing. The guests at the hostel as well as the employees all seem to be escaping from something and all have their own secrets they want to protect. It was fun delving into these seemingly unrelated lives and finding how their stories developed. The connections provided some surprise twists that were unexpected.

In precisely 18 months, she would be entitled to half of their combined assets and receive maintenance payments until her five-year-old daughter, Emma, turns 18. Just as Catfish was about to take her husband, Lindsay ‘Dogboy’ Kramer (a successful businessman and dog whisperer) to the cleaners, he goes missing.The police investigation into Dogboy’s disappearance leads them into the dark world of counterfeit designer goods, money laundering, and drug smuggling.With Dogboy’s assets frozen and the mob protecting their interests, the missing persons case escalates to homicide. Catfish is in a race against time to get hold of Dogboy’s assets before the police get hold of her.One question remains - is Dogboy dead or alive?My Thoughts:This book has themes of divorce, wealth, greed, corruption, revenge, friendship, drug smuggling, money laundering, and the domestic legal system in Australia. Quite a mix! This clever novel is full of twists and surprises. It was fun to read and I couldn't put it down, and actually hated for it to end (even though I liked the ending). The book stood out to me because I don't think I've ever read one with a storyline like this. The way Dogboy got his name was an interesting story in an of itself.

Her books have all been such good reads there was no passing it up. Description:A retired CIA operative in small-town Maine tackles the ghosts of her past in this fresh take on the spy thriller from New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen.Former spy Maggie Bird came to the seaside village of Purity, Maine, eager to put the past behind her after a mission went tragically wrong. These days, she’s living quietly on her chicken farm, still wary of blowback from the events that forced her early retirement.But when a body turns up in Maggie’s driveway, she knows it’s a message from former foes who haven’t forgotten her. Maggie turns to her local circle of old friends—all retirees from the CIA—to help uncover the truth about who is trying to kill her, and why. This “Martini Club” of former spies may be retired, but they still have a few useful skills that they’re eager to use again, if only to spice up their rather sedate new lives.Complicating their efforts is Purity’s acting police chief, Jo Thibodeau. More accustomed to dealing with rowdy tourists than homicide, Jo is puzzled by Maggie’s reluctance to share information—and by her odd circle of friends, who seem to be a step ahead of her at every turn.As Jo’s investigation collides with the Martini Club’s maneuvers, Maggie’s hunt for answers will force her to revisit a clandestine career that spanned the globe, from Bangkok to Istanbul, from London to Malta. The ghosts of her past have returned, but with the help of her friends—and the reluctant Jo Thibodeau—Maggie might just be able to save the life she’s built.My Thoughts:Tess Gerritsen has another winning series! I loved the main character, Maggie Bird, and her new life of chicken farming after retiring from her career as a CIA operative. The plot is full of suspense and had me biting my nails in anticipation of danger. I enjoyed the community and friendship of the former spies in the ""Martini Club"" and the way they stuck together to support each other. Each member seemed to have important strengths that allowed them to help as the past rose up from Maggie's life to threaten her. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.Thanks to Thomas & Mercer through Netgalley for a  copy....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Nov 03, 2023","Nov 04, 2023","Nov 03, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/131068071-the-spy-coast

He accepts a job as a wildlife ranger and settles into his cozy seaside cottage, relishing the respite from the noise, drama, and relentless careerism that curdled his relationship along with his mental health. Then he meets Leonora, the reclusive artist living next door, and is instantly charmed by her warm and gentle spirit.But as the two forge a connection on the cliff’s edge they call home, two young women activists raising awareness about gendered violence disappear while passing through. Cole and Leonora find themselves in the middle of a police investigation and resulting media firestorm as the world learns of what happened, and as the tension escalates, they quickly realize that they don’t know each other that well after all.My Thoughts:Lots of plot twists in this story that focuses on violence against women. It was presented in a very ""in your face"" kind of way that kind of beats you over the head with it. It was an uncomfortable read to say the least. I didn't like any of the characters, male or female. I did feel empathy for Melanie, and Lennie and Cole - they were all wronged as well as all being wrong to a degree. The way Lennie and Melanie manipulated the events was wrong. The way Cole went about satisfying his fantasies was wrong. Women should not live in fear of what men will do to them - on that I think everyone can agree. Also, all men shouldn't be stereotyped by men who wrongly abuse women - and yes, there are degrees of abuse. This is a heated topic for discussion and more people are aware now because of the Me Too movement. Bravo to Araminta Hall for presenting some of the issues in this story - no matter how extreme.Thanks to Zando, Gillian Flynn Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Lost in a vortex of other people's career milestones, engagement parties, and baby showers, Josie is perennially single, abandoned by her globetrotting family, and invisible to her boss - except for the one time he tuned in while she was mid-panic attack on live TV. As a punishment, Josie is shipped off to cover another reporter's six-month leave at a regional bureau in Newcastle.But Josie has more waiting for her in Newcastle than yawn-inducing stories about bicycle lane protests. The city is also the domain of Zac Jameson - her best friend since high school. This should be a happy turn of events, but Zac has barely spoken to Josie for the past two years. Not since his fiancee tragically died in his arms in a car accident and he left Sydney to try and cope with his grief.Now thrown back into each other's lives, Josie and Zac have to navigate their neglected friendship and secret attraction to each other while struggling with their careers and mental health.Hilarious, sexy and heart-warming, this is the perfect romcom to sit on the shelves alongside Emily Henry, Sally Thorne and Ali Hazelwood.My Thoughts:This was a rollercoaster ride of a romance. These friends since high school were both pushing each other in other directions, but they were the best of friends. Both Josie and Zac were dealing with their own different traumas they were trying to overcome. The traumas and their work had pushed them apart and their friendship was in peril. This is an emotional romance with both sadness and joy. There are some hot, steamy encounters that will get your blood racing. There are heart-warming interludes filled with love and honesty.

On the fateful day that will forever alter the trajectory of their lives, flames chase fleeing birds across the sky. The wildfire that will consume their home, and their lives as they know it, races toward them. In the smoldering aftermath, Irini stumbles upon the body of the man who started the fire, a land speculator who had intended only a small, controlled burn to clear forestland to build on and instead ignited a catastrophe. He is dead, although the cause is unclear, and in her anger at all he took from them, Irini makes a split-second decision that will haunt her. As the local police investigate the mysterious death, Tasso mourns his father, who has not been seen since before the fire. His hands were burnt in the flames, leaving him unable to paint, and he struggles to cope with the overwhelming loss of his artistic voice and his beloved forest. Only his young daughter, who wants to repair the damage that’s been done, gives him hope for the future.

She's not the type to sit idly by, so when she clashes with the sexy-as-hell man who runs the place, her temper is hot enough to nearly burn down the entire town. Despite refusing to turn down his jukebox and inviting Miss Mercy to leave his cantina alone, Hunter Wilson can't get that gospel singer with the ice-blue eyes out of his mind. Finding her again in their tiny town isn't the problem. Convincing her that he's interested―well, that's another story. But if Mercy will give Hunter one more chance to show his true feelings, they just might find the love of a lifetime. My Thoughts:Romance is not usually my go-to genre in books, but I do enjoy one every once in awhile. Both of the books here were good ones.In On the Way to Us, ot, hansome Hunter and spunky, fierce Mercy make good character leads in this one. Hunter has a few secrets that need to be spilled. The book was a quick read with an absorbing storyline that kept my attention. The plot moved quickly and gave me a smile.The Love Struck Cafe was another romance, but with a different plot. In this heartwarming tale, Walker was just passing through on his way north to buy a ranch when he stopped a the Chicken Fried Cafe (what a name!) where he met Jasmine, the owner. What proceeded after just seemed like fate (all a little too convenient, but it worked). Walker's plans from that point on changed drastically.I liked the romance and the author's prose, so I will likely be reading more of her books.

Eight respectable, upstanding people have been found dead across the US. These deaths look like accidents and don’t appear to be connected. Until one body – the victim of a fatal fall from a hospital window – generates some unexpected attention.That attention comes from the Secretary of Defense, who promptly calls for an inter-agency task force to investigate. Jack Reacher is assigned as the Army's representative.Reacher may be an exceptional soldier, but sweeping other people's secrets under the carpet isn't part of his skill set. As he races to discover the link between these victims, and who killed them, he must navigate around the ulterior motives of his new 'partners'. And all while moving into the sight line of some of the most dangerous people he has ever encountered.His mission is to uncover the truth. The question will Reacher bring the bad guys to justice the official way . . . or his way?My Thoughts:I can always count on Lee Child to create a thrilling adventure that is fast-moving and heroic. Yes, Jack Reacher is always a hero and I like that he sticks by his morals to do the right thing - no matter who is involved. In this one he unravels a mess that occurred at a lab in India in 1969. It is set in the 1990s and Jack Reacher is still a captain in the military police, so it's taking him back quite a bit in time. He is thrown together with several others under a lot of pressure to find a killer who is methodically killing scientists related to a project at the lab in India. The murders are happening quickly and they all are made to look like possble suicides or accidents. What is really happening? An absorbing investigation, a relentless pace, and a complex plot make this a great adventure.

Caroline was portrayed as being very naive, which surprised me as she was shown to also be highly intelligent. A little confusing to picture in my mind. It was an interesting book, but not what I expected.Description: Caroline Brady is the daughter of a very conservative TSA agent and former military brat, Morgan Brady. Her mother, Linsey Brady, is a descendent of the Sutherland real estate family. Their organized, suburban life in Colonie, New York is rigorously regulated and leaves little room for deviation from the norm.When Linsey, Morgan, and Caroline attend the wake of their neighbor Mr. Gleeson, they meet his charming daughter Natalie “Nattie” Gleeson, who works for the American ambassador to France. Linsey and Nattie strike up a fast friendship as women of a similar age in very different places in their lives—Linsey a devoted mother and housewife, and Nattie an international diplomat living an independent and freewheeling life. Their friendship soon evolves into a romance, leading to the collapse of Linsey’s marriage and her disinheritance from the Sutherland family fortune. In true V.C. Andrews fashion, a whirlwind of unexpected death, family estrangement, and a forbidden inheritance become Caroline’s new reality as she struggles to navigate the loss of her mother, the mind-boggling wealth of the Sutherland family (who quickly lock her away from the world), and the loss of contact with her father following the divorce.My Thoughts:This book filled me mostly with sadness and anger. Sadness for Caroline's having to watch her family fall apart, the distance created between her and her mother during the new relationship, and then the loss of her mother. Anger at her father for his abandonment, and at her grandfather for isolating Caroline and for the aversion therapy he put her through. The book unravelled slowly and is an in-depth study of Caroline and all the difficulties she was subjected to in her childhood. This is not my favorite type of book, but I'm sure some people will enjoy it.Thanks to Gallery Books through Netgalley for an advance copy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 20, 2023","Oct 22, 2023","Oct 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/101145092-losing-spring

Meanwhile, freelance photographer Emma Anderson is desperately trying to find her drug-addicted sister, Nell. Then a devastating piece of evidence found at Detective Honeywell’s crime scene brings her world crashing down, a driver’s license belonging to her missing sister.

But in doing so, will the investigation uncover more questions than answers?My Thoughts:I really liked the character Detective Matthias Honeycutt - he seems expressive with his mood changes showing in his countenance. He seems strong and determined, but has a softer side. I enjoyed the budding romance between him and Emma. The search for Emma's sister has some harrowing moments. There are a couple of murders with some twists and turns to the investigation, that becomes fairly complex. I enjoyed following the clues with the detectives.

Her books are always engrossing and they normally bring attention to current problems society faces. This one is focused on the abuse of women.

Only Norma Gallagher, a search and rescue volunteer, knows the real story.Norma’s already found Jill, huddled in a cave and terrified that her abusive boyfriend, Jake, will kill her. If he ever sees her again. To protect Jill from a dangerous man, Norma quietly delivers the girl to her grateful parents in California, even though she’s conflicted. Keeping Jill safe and hidden from Jake, the press, and the public will be their secret. But secrets can’t last forever.Five years later, the disappearance stirs a new media frenzy when Jake is arrested for the murder of Jill Moss—and Norma knows he didn’t kill her. As Jake is about to stand trial, lust for retribution inflames public opinion and Jill’s family refuses to come forward, forcing Norma to make a life-changing decision.What are the consequences if she stays silent? And what are the risks if she dares to finally tell the truth?My Thoughts:I loved Norma for her wisdom and the support she provided both to Jill and to Wanda. Behind her gruff exterior she has a warm, caring heart. The story kept my attention all the way through and kept me flipping the pages. I enjoyed the dogs and horses that were Norma's companions.

Yet not even her heightened senses can predict how to run a business—or catch a killer . . .Self-taught “seer” Shay has much to learn as autumn hits the quaint coastal town of Bray Harbor. Since attempting the art of blending herbs at her popular shop, Crystals & CuriosiTeas, she’s set on growing ingredients in the mysterious greenhouse on the second floor—if only she can separate the medicinal plants from the deadly ones. Her new skills are put to the test when she meets pub owner and ex-detective Liam Madigan’s Gran. A psychic from Ireland known for interpreting tea leaves and people, Gran encourages Shay to build upon her natural talents and hold her own group reading . . . Despite Shay’s reservations about putting herself in the spotlight, the evening goes off without a hitch. At least, until she does a reading and a customer goes from chatty to dead in a flash, poisoned after sipping a toxic substance recently grown in the greenhouse. Worse, Shay’s assistant is suspected of intentionally serving the lethal brew and committing cold-blooded murder. Now, aided only by Liam and her dog Spirit, Shay must exonerate her employee and save the future of Crystals & CuriosiTeas. But when clues start lining up like leaves in a teacup, she’ll need to understand the signs right in front of her to catch the manipulative murderer before it’s too late . . .My Thoughts:Shay is a good character and I liked her adventures learning about her particular gift. The family history is interesting and provided context. Loved Spirit and the way he intuitively went where he was needed!

This is an exciting series that follows the McDonald family's survival after the apocalypse and life in the settlement, Hickory Falls, that they helped to build.Description:The apocalypse is over. But the struggle for survival has only just begun… A hard-won peace has been earned by the McDonald family’s Georgia settlement, Hickory Falls. The rural community offers shelter, food, and safety. At least for now… But in the aftermath of the solar flare, and the fall of the old world, danger takes many forms. It begins with a drought that threatens crops. Then a flood of refugees arrives, driven from their homes by a raging wildfire. They’ve lost everything, and the inferno is spreading. Taking in the dispossessed means more mouths to feed—but it also means willing hands to do vital work. And one refugee in particular has valuable skills. Greyson was a firefighter, and he’s got a plan to make Hickory Falls safe from the encroaching fire. But there’s something a little off about the man. Beth, the McDonald matriarch, doesn’t trust him—though she can’t say why. But, like it or not, he’s part of the community now. Will his preparations save Hickory Falls? Or plunge the community into fiery doom…My Thoughts:In this book the McDonald family, as well as the entire town of Hickory Falls, is faced with the threat of wildfire. This is another exciting installment to the series with lots of risk, tension, and threats to their survival. The very blunt cliffhanger at the end left me furious though - I really wanted to know more! This entire series is tense with peril at every turn. It will definitely get your heart rate up.

With her flair for cleaning and proper etiquette, she has risen through the ranks of the glorious five-star Regency Grand Hotel to become the esteemed Head Maid. But just as her life reaches a pinnacle state of perfection, her world is turned upside down when J.D. Grimthorpe, the world-renowned mystery author, drops dead— very dead —on the hotel’s tea room floor.When Detective Stark, Molly's old foe, investigates the author’s unexpected demise, it becomes clear that this death was murder most foul. Suspects abound, and everyone wants to who killed J.D. Grimthorpe? Was it Lily, the new Maid-in-Training? Or was it Serena, the author’s secretary? Could Mr. Preston, the hotel’s beloved doorman, be hiding something? And is Molly really as innocent as she seems?As the case threatens the hotel’s pristine reputation, Molly knows she alone holds the key to unlocking the killer's identity. But that key is buried deep in her past—because long ago, she knew J.D. Grimthorpe. Molly begins to comb her memory for clues, revisiting her childhood and the mysterious Grimthorpe mansion where she and her dearly departed Gran once worked side by side. With the entire hotel under investigation, Molly must solve the mystery post-haste. If there's one thing Molly knows for sure, it's that dirty secrets don't stay buried forever...My Thoughts:Keep them coming Nita Prose. I'm loving this series! Molly is a great character with her obsession with cleaning and her social ineptness. She is more confident in herself in this book and she is now the Head Maid. Her intelligence and compassion shine in this one as she attempts to help Lily and to ""clean up the direct"" at the Regency Grand Hotel. Her attention to detail unwittingly assists the detectives to follow the leads in the investigation. Molly's grandmother's teachings provide Molly guidance as she navigates the situation. The story is well told and the plot is satisfying. There was humor in the story too.

When Henri’s boss makes it clear she’ll be starting the New Year unemployed unless she can close a big deal before the holidays, Henri impulsively tells him that she can convince her aging parents to sell Wegner’s—their iconic Frankenmuth, Michigan, Christmas store—to a massive, soulless corporation. It’s the kind of deal cool, corporate Henri has built her career on.Home for the holidays has typically meant a perfunctory twenty-four-hour visit for Henri, then back to Detroit as fast as her car will drive her. So turning up at the Wegner’s offices in early December raises some eyebrows: from her delighted, if puzzled, parents to her suspicious brother and curious childhood friends. But as Henri fields impatient texts from her boss while reconnecting with the magic of the store and warmth of her hometown, what sounded great in the boardroom begins to lose its luster in real life. She’s running out of time to pull the trigger on what could be the greatest success of her career…or the most awkward family holiday of her life.My Thoughts:Henri, the main character, has a heart-breaking choice to make with difficult consequences for either decision. To me, there was only one choice, but she had to make her decision on her own as the story played out and the Christmas Eve deadline approached. Christmas time is filled with family and friends, but Henri hadn't been with her family at Christmastime for many years, so they were very surprised when she showed up - as well as maybe a little suspicious. The plot was good in that it made for some tense moments as well as some light-hearted humor. The story moved at a good pace and built as it went. I liked Henri, but there were times when I couldn't fathom what she was thinking of doing. I got mad at her.

But there’s something special about that time of year when summer people return to their normal lives, and the wide sandy beaches welcome back locals with their dogs and strollers. And this year, even as the season cools down, Izzy Perry’s Sea Harbor Yarn Studio is heating up, thanks to an upcoming fashion benefit . . . The show will feature hand-knit garments, and enthusiastic knitters flock to the shop for supplies to create runway-worthy pieces. Yet Seaside Knitter Birdie is enjoying flocks of a different kind, thanks to a rekindled interest in birdwatching, a hobby she enjoyed with her late husband. Along with a small group of passionate birders, she often spends weekend mornings looking for warblers, or keeping watch for gannets and grebes. The group members themselves are almost as fascinating as the birds. It’s a lovely, special time—until Birdie makes her way through a tangle of vines and stumbles upon a fellow birder’s body. At first, it appears to be an accidental fall, but an autopsy soon reveals that the victim died before hitting a granite boulder. When police discover a clue linking the victim to one of the Seaside Knitters, the web of suspicion grows. Before the woods are ablaze in autumn glory and the knitters have cast off the final rows on their runway projects, they’ll have to unravel secrets and ties strong enough to bind friends and neighbors together—and some that may press a killer to take another life.My thoughts,This is the sixth book in the Seaside Knitters Society series and sadly, I've only read a couple of them so far but am planning to read more. This little knitting group is so close and caring that I felt enveloped in their warmth the whole time I was reading. I especially like Birdie, who seems to know everyone in town and seems to kind of bring the town together. I found the rift between the twin sisters to be sad and my heart went out to them. I found the bird watching group and their dynamics interesting. There were a few suspects in the murder and I was surprised when I found out who the real murderer was as it wasn't either of the two people I really suspected.

It can be read as a stand alone, but readers of Markert's earlier book, The Nightmare Man will recognize some things from the previous book, so it is somewhat of a sequel.Description:In the vein of T. Kingfisher and Christopher Golden, the boundary protecting our world from the monsters on the other side is weakening—and Mister Lullaby is about to break through.The small town of Harrod’s Reach has seen its fair share of the macabre, especially inside the decrepit old train tunnel around which the town was built. After a young boy, Sully Dupree, is injured in the abandoned tunnel and left in a coma, the townspeople are determined to wall it up. Deputy sheriff Beth Gardner is reluctant to buy into the superstitions until she finds two corpses at the tunnel’s entrance, each left with strange calling cards inscribed with old lullabies. Soon after, Sully Dupree briefly awakens from his coma.Before falling back into his slumber, Sully manages to give his older brother a message. Sully's mind, since the accident, has been imprisoned on the other side of the tunnel in Lalaland, a grotesque and unfamiliar world inhabited by evil mythical creatures of sleep. Sully is trapped there with hundreds of other coma patients, all desperately fighting to keep the evils of the dream world from escaping into the waking world.Elsewhere, a man troubled by his painful youth has for years been hearing a voice in his head he calls Mr. Lullaby, and he has finally started to act on what that voice is telling him—to kill any coma patient he can find, quickly.Something is waking up in the tunnel—something is trying to get through. And Mr. Lullaby is coming.My Thoughts:The story is gripping and I had trouble putting it down as I was so engrossed in what was happening that I had to keep reading more to find out. Old folklore comes alive to menace the town of Harrod's Reach and no one is safe. Loved the characters Gideon and Beth for their courage and determination. I found the coma patients and their role to be imaginative. Great plot complete with monsters and afflicted humans causing mayhem. Thanks to Crooked Lane Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

This book is awesome!Description:1806: Astrid Poole sits in her bridal clothes, overwhelmed with happiness. But before her marriage can be consummated, she is murdered, and the circle of gold torn from her finger. Her last words are a promise to Collin never to leave him…Graphic designer Sonya MacTavish is stunned to learn that her late father had a twin he never knew about―and that her newly discovered uncle, Collin Poole, has left her almost everything he owned, including a majestic Victorian house on the Maine coast, which the will stipulates she must live in it for at least three years. Her engagement recently broken, she sets off to find out why the boys were separated at birth―and why it was all kept secret until a genealogy website brought it to light.Trey, the young lawyer who greets her at the sprawling clifftop manor, notes Sonya’s unease―and acknowledges that yes, the place is haunted…but just a little. Sure enough, Sonya finds objects moved and music playing out of nowhere. She sees a painting by her father inexplicably hanging in her deceased uncle’s office, and a portrait of a woman named Astrid, whom the lawyer refers to as “the first lost bride.” It’s becoming clear that Sonya has inherited far more than a house. She has inherited a centuries-old curse, and a puzzle to be solved if there is any hope of breaking it…My Thoughts:The characters are perfect for their parts in this one. The ghosts have distinct personalities. The plot is exciting and moves at a fast pace. I couldn't put the book down. The brides are tragic, each and every one. I liked that the deceased brides are trying to help Sonia solve the mystery. Sonia, the lead heroine is both courageous and relatable. I enjoyed her friendship with her best friend Cleo. The romance was enjoyable, but I feel it's just getting started. I have to admit to being devestated at the end - there really is no end because it is a definite cliffhanger. I thought maybe I had an issue with my download and was missing a chapter or two, but no - it was just cut off and I was so disappointed I couldn't find out what happened. I sure hope I can remember the story when the second book comes out and that I don't miss it. I really should have learned by now not to read trilogies until all the books are available, but I just can't resist. Waiting impatiently for the next installment in the series.

This, to me, I picked this book up because I had read both A Secret History of Witches and The Age of Witches by Louisa Morgan and enjoyed them both. This, to me, is the best yet!Description:Beatrice Bird is plagued by ghosts. It’s a gift she’s had since she was a small child. Unfortunately, it’s a gift that has grown more intense, shifting from flashes and feelings to physical manifestations she can’t escape. In a desperate attempt for relief, Beatrice flees her home, her partner, and a psychology practice in San Francisco for a remote island with only nuns and a few cows for company. She sees as few people as she possibly can. She doesn’t call home. Then she meets Anne Iredale, a timid woman who has lost everything that matters to her. For the first time in a long time, Beatrice's gift will be called on to help someone in need. The path to healing awaits both of them—if Beatrice can find the courage to take the first step.My Thoughts:The story is told from three points of view: Beatrice, Anne, and Anne's son Benjamin. The story moves between the present and past experiences of Beatric and Anne. Beatrice is a has the gift of ""second sight"" which allows her to see ghosts, but her gift becomes stronger to the point of overwhelming to her. She retreats to live on an island cutoff from everyone. Anne has traumatic experiences she is trying to escape and finds herself on the same island. When Beatrice and Anne are thrown together by circumstance, they each find strengths in each other to help them deal with their situations.

This one can easily be read as a stand-alone as I had no trouble following it. Normally I like to start at the beginning, but it doesn't always work out that way.Description:Returning to her role as an amateur detective is the last thing library director Amy Muir wants. She’s already buried under an avalanche of responsibilities, including sharing the directorship of the local public library, parenting her holiday-obsessed five-year-old twins, and helping her choreographer husband, Richard, present The Nutcracker as part of the town’s festivities. With her frosty mother-in-law, Fiona, visiting for the holidays, Amy definitely has enough on her Christmas cookie plate.But when the chair of the festival committee is found dead as Dickens' proverbial door-nail at the town’s ice rink, Amy is determined to uncover the real perpetrator to protect her brother-in-law, Ethan Payne, who was placed at the scene. The clock is ticking down as Sheriff Brad Tucker is equally sure that Ethan is guilty.It's beginning to look a lot like the murderer hasn’t wrapped up his killing spree, and now, it might just be “lights out” on the holiday festivities—and on Amy’s life.My Thoughts:This was an enjoyable cozy mystery. I liked Amy as a character and it's great that she wanted to investigate to make sure her brother-in-law, Ethan, didn't get charged with a murder he didn't have anything to do with. It was interesting that Amy's husband was a dancer and choreographer, and is such a great Dad to the twins. The children were fun with the Nutcracker costumes and getting ready for their performance. Amy's investigation was interesting to follow as she sifted through clues and gossip.

This is the seventh book in the Robin Lockwood series.Description:In Phillip Margolin's Betrayal , attorney Robin Lockwood finds herself defending her old nemesis in a multiple murder case with too many suspects, where success might cost her own life.Robin Lockwood is now a prominent defense attorney in Portland, Oregon but a decade ago, she was a ranked and rising MMA fighter. Her career came to a quick end when she was knocked out and concussed in the first round by Mandy Kerrigan, a much more talented fighter.Now the situation couldn't be more different, with Kerrigan on her last legs, her career nearly over, arrested for the quadruple murder of the entire Finch family...and Kerrigan's only possible friend is the attorney she beat so many years ago.For Robin, it's no simple Margaret Finch was a lawyer working for vicious Russian mobsters, and was in the cross-hairs of both the mobsters and the widower of a woman a client killed; her husband Nathan Finch was deeply in debt to a bookie who threatened his life; her son Ryan was the one who sold Kerrigan illegal performance enhancing drugs and was beaten severely by her when Kerrigan failed her drug test. To complicate matters further, the DA that Robin is facing is the man she's just started dating, the first person she's begun seeing seriously after her husband was killed.In a case where the stakes are high and the truth is elusive, where each new fact twists the case in a new direction, there is seemingly no way to win or direction to turn that will leave Robin Lockwood unscathed.My Thoughts:Phillip Margolin has been one of my favorite authors for years now, so I always look forward to his new books. Robin Lockwood is a great character and I've enjoyed this series. Great twists and turns in this one. And there are so many suspects. This is a complex situation and the history with Robin and Kerrigan adds a hurdle to the attorney-client relationship here.

Charming and disarming, relentless and lethal, she earned a reputation as one of the most renowned and decorated Army snipers in the service before stepping away. But when Alex, now an FBI special agent on loan to Interpol, learns that an old friend, an MI5 officer, has been killed under mysterious circumstances, she’s pulled back into the dangerous world she left behind: a world where some people fear her, some want to recruit her, and everyone seems to want her dead.Following a trail of clues left behind by the dead woman, Alex pieces together a terrifying conspiracy that only escalates when a nuclear warhead goes missing. Dodging death at every turn, she reluctantly joins forces with a CIA agent, but he has plans of his own for her—and will stop at nothing to achieve them.Chasing the truth through the streets of London and bustling Turkish markets to the underbelly of Paris, Alex is unrelenting in her pursuit of justice. But as the clock ticks down and the world edges closer to doom, she must fall back on her Special Ops skills to stop the unthinkable.

When the party is interrupted by shocking tragedy, Phryne gathers all of her unerring brilliance to track down the miscreants. With some unlikely assistance, Phryne is in a race against time to save a pair of young lovers from disgrace and death.My Thoughts:First of all, I loved the character, Phryne Fisher.

But upon arrival, Mariah discovers that Sadie has vanished without a trace, and Barton rudely rescinds the invitation. Once Mariah finds another acquaintance to stay with during the holiday season, she begins investigating Sadie’s disappearance.Mariah’s uncanny knack for solving mysteries serves her well during her search, which is driven by gossip as icy as the December weather. Did Sadie run off with another man? Was she kidnapped? Has someone harmed her? Frustratingly, Mariah’s questions reveal more about the villagers themselves than about her friend’s whereabouts. Yet in the process of getting to know Sadie’s neighbors, Mariah finds a kind of redemption, as she rediscovers her kinder side, and her ability to love. It is up to Mariah to master her own feelings, drown out the noise, and get to the bottom of what occurred, all before Christmas day. With the holiday rapidly approaching, will she succeed in bringing Sadie home in time for them to celebrate it together—or is that too much to hope for?My Thoughts:I can't imagine being invited to spend Christmas with a friend, travelling there with my suitcase, and finding my friend had disappeared and her husband has no intention of letting me stay. Such a strange situation - where would you go - and more importantly, what in the world happened to the friend? This book was a quick read and was interesting. Apparently Sadie had a whole secret life that her friend, Mariah knew nothing about. Such a surprise to her to find out some of the things Sadie has done in the town.

I read it slowly to try to absorb some of the stories and history.Description:A witty and wide-ranging exploration of a book that has perplexed and delighted people for the Talmud. For numerous centuries, the Talmud―an extraordinary work of Jewish ethics, law, and tradition―has compelled readers to grapple with how to live a good life. Full of folk legends, bawdy tales, and rabbinical repartee, it is inspiring, demanding, confounding, and thousands of pages long. As Liel Leibovitz enthusiastically explores the Talmud, what has sometimes been misunderstood as a dusty and arcane volume becomes humanity’s first self-help book. How the Talmud Can Change Your Life contains sage advice on an unparalleled scope of topics, which includes communicating with your partner, dealing with grief, and being a friend. Leibovitz guides readers through the sprawling text with all its humor, rich insights, compulsively readable stories, and multilayered conversations. Contemporary discussions framed by Talmudic philosophy and psychology draw on subjects ranging from Weight Watchers and the Dewey decimal system to the lives of Billie Holiday and C. S. Lewis. Chapters focus on fundamental human experiences―the mind-body problem, the power of community, the challenges of love―to illuminate how the Talmud speaks to our daily existence. As Leibovitz explores some of life’s greatest questions, he also delivers a concise history of the Talmud itself, explaining the process of its lengthy compilation and organization. With infectious passion and candor, Leibovitz brilliantly displays how the Talmud’s wisdom reverberates for the modern age and how it can, indeed, change your life.My Thoughts:This book just showed me how much understanding I lack. It was not a beginner book, but I'm sure others with more understanding will enjoy it more. I liked the stories of some of the scholars and their experiences. The chapters were rather long and sometimes I lost focus on what the author was trying to convey, but once again I think this is my inexperience and lack of understanding. I did learn some things and enjoyed the history.Thanks to W. W. Norton & Company through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I will be going back to read the others though, as I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one.Description:On a bone-chilling October night, Medical Examiner Rowan Winthorp investigates the death of her daughter’s best friend. Hours later, the tragedy hits even closer to home when she makes a devastating discovery—her daughter, Chloe, is gone. But, not without a trace.A morbid mosaic of clues forces Rowan and her husband to question how deeply they really knew their daughter. As they work closely to peel back the layers of this case, they begin to unearth disturbing details about Chloe and her secret transgressions…details that threaten to tear them apart.Amidst the noise of navigating her newfound grief and reconciling the sins of her past, an undeniable fact rings true for Rowan: karma has finally come to collect.My thoughts:The husband/wife team of Rowan Winthorp, the Black Harbor Medical Examiner, and her husband, Axel, a homicide detective, just worked. Together they make a great team even though their careers keep them away from home a lot and away from their daughter, Chloe. The last words Chloe said to her mom before she disappeared, ""you'll love me more when I'm dead"", haunted Rowan throughout the book. There were so many suspects in this book that seemed viable i couldn't decide who was the real killer, so the ending was a surprise. This book kept my attention throughout and I look forward to reading more from Hannah Morrissey.Thanks to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The book was chockfull of magical realism, the horrible conditions of slavery, and the struggle to be free.Description:“‘Let us descend,’ the poet now began, ‘and enter this blind world.’” — Inferno, Dante AlighieriLet Us Descend is a reimagining of American slavery, as beautifully rendered as it is heart-wrenching. Searching, harrowing, replete with transcendent love, the novel is a journey from the rice fields of the Carolinas to the slave markets of New Orleans and into the fearsome heart of a Louisiana sugar plantation.Annis, sold south by the white enslaver who fathered her, is the reader’s guide through this hellscape. As she struggles through the miles-long march, Annis turns inward, seeking comfort from memories of her mother and stories of her African warrior grandmother. Throughout, she opens herself to a world beyond this world, one teeming with of earth and water, of myth and history; spirits who nurture and give, and those who manipulate and take. While Ward leads readers through the descent, this, her fourth novel, is ultimately a story of rebirth and reclamation.From one of the most singularly brilliant and beloved writers of her generation, this miracle of a novel inscribes Black American grief and joy into the very land—the rich but unforgiving forests, swamps, and rivers of the American South. Let Us Descend is Jesmyn Ward’s most magnificent novel yet, a masterwork for the ages.My Thoughts:I always have a difficult time reading about slavery because I can't understand how people can be so cruel. The conditions of life as a slave are hard to imagine and shock me terribly. I had to put the book down several times because it hurts too much to think people could treat an entire race as less because of their skin color. The story is a good one. Although I wasn't crazy about all the magical realism, I could see how it would be possible for someone in Annis' situation to lock out reality and cling to the spiritual teachings of her mother when escaping in her mind. I liked how strong and courageous both Annis and her mother were throughout all the hardships they were forced to endure.Thanks to Scribner through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I was thinking when I picked it up that I would love to find a recipe for sausage and lentil soup, and a few others.Description:Every day is a good day for soup! From broths and gazpachos to chowders and chilis, this flexible cookbook is overflowing with scrumptious soups for every season. These simple base recipes for healthy, yummy soups are easy to prepare and so satisfying. And the best part? You can riff on them endlessly with toppings and fixings—add mini meatballs, grilled cheese croutons, or a handful of grains. Or transform yesterday’s soup into an entirely new Carrot-Orange-Ginger Soup becomes a savory breakfast oatmeal; leftover Tomato-Watermelon Gazpacho makes a pitcher of Bloody Marias; French Onion Soup is reinvented as a bubbling, golden strata!Soup lovers, healthy eaters, and busy parents and professionals will love these veggie-forward recipes that never get old and make weeknight cooking a breeze. Tips for batching and freezing soups and instructions for using an Instant Pot or a slow cooker ensure stress-free meals, with less time in the kitchen and more time at the table. With gorgeous photography and a bonus section on soup accompaniments (think breads, salads, and slaws), Every Season Is Soup Season is a one-stop-shop cookbook. Everyday soups have never been so simple—or so incredibly delicious.My thoughts:I didn't find the soup recipes I wanted right away in this book, however I found many ideas for other soups. I didn't realize when I picked it up that all the recipes were for vegetarian soups; the book does give tips on how you can add various meats to the soup recipes, so that was good. I loved the way the book showed after each recipe how you could turn the soup into an entirely different dish for another time. There are lots of beautiful pictures, which is nice because I like to see what something looks like before I take the time to make the dish. The recipes were grouped into the seasons of the year the author felt the soup would be most appreciated. Some of the recipes seemed kind of exotic to me and sometimes I just like basic, hearty soups. This is a good book to keep in the kitchen that provides some great soup ideas.Thanks to Chronicle Books through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 03, 2023","Sep 11, 2023","Sep 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/103516878-every-season-is-soup-season

Her books are always full of mystery and suspense. The Christmas presents in this book are not ones you want.Description:Madeline Martin has built a life for herself as the young owner of a thriving business, The Next Chapter Bookshop, despite her tragic childhood and now needing to care for her infirm father. When Harley Granger, a failed novelist turned true crime podcaster, drifts into her shop in the days before Christmas, he seems intent on digging up events that Madeline would much rather forget. She’s the only surviving victim of Evan Handy, the man who was convicted of murdering her best friend Steph, and is suspected in the disappearance of two sisters, also good friends of Madeline’s, who have been missing for nearly a decade. It’s an investigation that has obsessed her father Sheriff James Martin right up until his stroke took his faculties.Harley Granger has a gift for seeing things that others miss. He wasn’t much of a novelist, but his work as a true crime author and podcaster has earned him fame and wealth—and some serious criticism for his various unethical practices. Still, visiting Little Valley to be closer to his dying father has caused him to look into a case that many people think is closed—and some want reopened. And he has a lot of questions about the night Stephanie Cramer was killed, Ainsley and Sam Wallace disappeared, and Madeline Martin was left for dead, bleeding out on a riverbank.Since Evan Handy went to jail, three other young women have gone missing, most recently a young college dropout named Lolly. Five young women missing in the same area in a decade. Are they connected? Was Evan Handy innocent after all? Or was there some else there that night? Someone who is still satisfying his dark appetites?As Christmas approaches and a blizzard bears down, Madeline and her childhood friend Badger return to a past they both hoped was dead—to find the missing Lolly and to answer questions that have haunted them both, discovering that the truth is more terrible and much closer to home than they think.Coupling a picturesque, cozy setting with a deeply unsettling suspenseful plot, Christmas Presents is a chilling seasonal novella that can be enjoyed all year long.My Thoughts:Cold cases are fascinating to me in that someone can pick one up years after the case is basically over and find new evidence or another explanation for what happened in the case. When the podcaster, Harley Granger, reopens this case it sets the entire town on edge. But yes, there is more to know of this case and the twists and turns are fascinating.

The Sweetheart Crush can easily be read as a stand alone. This is a second chance romance type book.Description:Photographer Viv Montgomery’s dreams were bigger than her small hometown of Blossom Glen. Following them meant leaving everything and everyone behind—including her sweet and funny best friend, Logan Matthews. Now, twelve years later, the town’s “sweetheart” is back, broke, and…well, working in the town’s famous Christmas store until she figures out her next move.Enter her former best friend who she hasn’t seen or talked to in years. Only the cute, funny guy she remembers is gone—replaced by a famous, bestselling author who seems aloof, jaded, and is much, much hotter than any book nerd she’s ever seen. Seeing him in the news is one thing, but up close and person? Whewf, it’s warm in here.Now he’s offered her a job she desperately needs (blissfully free of Santas), and suddenly it’s like no time has passed at all. Their friendship is just like it was…with one very unexpected difference. Because somewhere between the blossom festival and snuggling in front of a crackling fire, their friendship is definitely turning into something more. Only, Logan’s been hiding the secret of his enormous success…and the sweetheart of Blossom Glen is about to read all about it.My Thoughts:I liked that there was some humor in this book - I caught myself smiling several times at some of Viv's experiences with the Christmas Shop where she was working. The romance took quite awhile to rekindle, but you could see it coming. The characters drive the book and I enjoyed them. I also liked the charming small town and family feel. It was fun to see Viv finding a path to her dream.Thanks to Entangled Publishing through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 09, 2023","Sep 10, 2023","Sep 11, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/123414955-the-sweetheart-crush

I've read many of her books and always enjoy a little mystery with the fox hunting group.Description:Early fall in Virginia means shorter days, cooler temperatures, the blooming milkweeds of summer giving way to fields of fluffy seeds—and of course, the start of fox hunting season. It’s “Sister” Jane Arnold’s favorite time of year. And this year, the Jefferson Hunt Club is busier than ever, organizing a fundraising drive to help with the upkeep of their beloved hunting grounds.But the festive season is interrupted by the appearance of a dead body, tied to a chair and placed directly in the path of an early-season hunt. No one recognizes the victim, but the intentional placement makes it clear that someone is sending a message. Then, one huntsman’s valuable stamp collection is stolen, and they discover the victim was also a stamp collector. Sister suspects a connection, which is confirmed when just one stamp is found taped to the garage door of her friend and treasurer of the hunt club Ronnie Haslip. Could Ronnie have been involved in either the murder or the theft, or has he been marked as the next victim? Sister must uncover who has been sending these cryptic signs to her friends—before any of them wind up dead.My Thoughts:I didn't enjoy this one as much as I have many of Rita Mae Brown's books. There just didn't seem to be much of story here. Yes, there is a mystery, but for some reason I just couldn't get into this one. I did enjoy, as always with her books, the animal characters interspersed thorughout the book. The first 10% of the book was a list of the characters with a description of each one. Unfortunately by the time I get into the story I've forgotten who each character is and how they are related to the others in the book. Luckily there is enough description through the prose to fit everyone together. I enjoyed the friendship and camaraderie among the fox hunting group and how they always seem to be there for each other and truly care.Thanks to Ballantine Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Description:Southern California is where dreams come true—or so Scarlett Gardner thought. When she came out and opened the Palm Trees and Page Turners bookshop, she thought her boyfriend and business partner would be part of the story. When he leaves her for a better job, Scarlett finds herself struggling to keep her new business afloat. That’s not the only thing she has to worry about—she discovers something underneath the pier by her bookstore that she didn’t outline for her life’s story: the dead body of a book-buying customer.After Scarlett gives a statement to the police, she thinks her life can go back to business as usual. But when a lawyer, representing someone named Lorelai Knight, tells her that Scarlett now stands to inherit a small fortune, Scarlett is left with more questions than answers. Before she can think about any of it, the police bring her in for questioning; the body she found was Lorelai Knight. And the evidence they have against Scarlett doesn’t look good—not only does she have a motive because of her inheritance, but a bottle of the same poison found in Lorelai’s system was discovered near the bookshop. Business is booming as Scarlett returns to the bookshop, but for all the wrong reasons – they want to question the last known suspect of the murder.Who could really be behind all of this? And why frame Scarlett? To clear her name, she’s going to have get creative—and hope she can remain one page ahead of the killer.My Thoughts:This was a fun cozy and I liked the characters and the beach setting. I felt bad for Scarlett because she was dealing with a lot with the new business, her boyfriend flaking out, finding the dead body, finding about about and inheritance from someone she didn't know, and becoming the prime suspect in a murder - how much more worse could it get?

This read easily as a stand alone, but I think I would enjoy reading the other books in the series.Description:It’s Halloween in Vermont, winter is coming, and five humans, two dogs, and a cat are a crowd in Mercy Carr’s small cabin. She needs more room―and she knows just the Grackle Tree Farm, with thirty acres of woods and wetlands and a Victorian manor to die for. They say it’s haunted by the ghosts of missing children and lost poets and a murderer or two, but Mercy loves it anyway. Even when Elvis finds a dead body in the library.There’s something about Grackle Tree Farm that people are willing to kill for―and Mercy needs to figure out what before they move in. A coded letter found on the victim points to a hidden treasure that may be worth a fortune―if it’s real. She and Captain Thrasher conduct a search of the old place―and end up at the wrong end of a Glock. A masked man shoots Thrasher, and she and Elvis must take him down before he murders them all. Under fire, she and Elvis manage to run the guy off, but not before they are wounded, leaving Thrasher fighting for his life in the hospital, Mercy on crutches, and Elvis on the mend.Now it’s up to Mercy and Troy and the dogs to track down the masked murderer in a county overflowing with leaf peepers, Halloween revelers, and treasure hunters and bring him to justice before he strikes again and the treasure is lost forever, along with the good name of Grackle Tree Farm….My Thoughts:First of all I loved the characters Mercy, and her husband, Troy. The couple worked together so well and helped each other throughout. Each of them had very special dogs, Mercy with Elvis and Troy with Susie Bear. Gotta say I loved the dogs and how they instinctively protect their owners. They also are trained so well they follow commands no matter what. It's inspiring. There are several mysteries here to solve: the current day murder at the house, the likely posoning of the Druid, the past death of Euphemia Thitney-Jones (the poet), and the poaching operation. There were even a few more crimes happening. This kept my attention and kept me wondering how and if everything was tied together. Lots of twists here.

It is now fifteen years later, and Mitch and Abby are living in Manhattan, where Mitch is a partner at the largest law firm in the world.

Not a problem as everything is front and center and about as dramatic and traumatic as it could be. The characters are vivid and come alive on the page. Mitch is once again in the center of a hurricane trying to hold everything together. There were definitely some things that were hard to believe - like how did Mitch get a license to practice law again? Why in the world was Abby picked as the go between by the kidnappers?

The Witchfinder's Serpent was a fun, paranormal mystery going back and forth from occurrences in the past to present day.Description:When fifteen-year-old Nate Watson moves to Windsor to live with his mysterious Aunt Celia, the last things on his mind are witches and magick and ancient vendettas. While Nate focuses on building a new life for himself and his younger brother, making new friends and adjusting to a new high school, he can’t escape the feeling that something isn’t as it seems.Nate’s search for answers leads him to a forbidden, locked door in Aunt Celia’s mansion. Inside, he finds a witch’s workshop full of mystical artifacts, some dating back to the time of the earliest Puritan settlers. It’s no coincidence that Nate is now living in the very same town where, forty-five years before the Salem witch trials, Alse Young was hanged as America’s first witch.Could magick be real? Nate remains skeptical until he picks up the witchfinder’s serpent—a powerful, demonic bracelet that wraps itself around his arm and permanently imbeds itself into his flesh. Now Nate must confront the truth about Aunt Celia’s unlikely ancestry—as well as his own. And with her help, he must find a way to remove the bracelet before the serpent’s previous owner returns—an ancient and powerful enemy who will stop at nothing to get it back.My Thoughts:I'm always up for a new book about witches, their history, and the fictional imaginings of what one could do. The historical facts woven into the book were well-researched. The characters of Nate and his brother were perfect for the roles in the story. I liked the mystery surrounding Aunt Celia. This would probably make a really good movie, probably for children over 10 up to adults. There's some scary stuff, but kids would really enjoy it.

Overlooked for every exciting case, Grimsby tires of being told to handle mundane magical troubles, and appropriates a case file intended for a friend.Alongside Leslie Mayflower, the temporarily unretired Huntsman, Grimsby aims to crack the case and discover the origin of a strange, unfinished ritual—one that seems to imitate the handiwork of a foe Mayflower put down twenty years ago.Together, they’ll have to deal with escaped werewolves, a cursed artifact, and a perilous journey to the mysterious subterranean city below Boston, all to uncover the shocking truth. At any cost, Grimsby must stop this ritual from finally being completed. Yet the cost may be paid not by himself but by his friends. . . .My Thoughts:First of all, let me say that James J. Butcher's world setup around the adventures of Grimshaw Griswald Grimsby is as much fun as the Harry Dresden adventures. I like Grimsby, the inexperienced, somewhat timid, new auditor in the story. The subterranean world under the city of Boston was quite an experience. Grimsby's mission in this one was dangerous and tense.

She cannot bring herself to respond to another inane, “urgent” (but obviously not at all urgent) email or participate in the corporate employee joyfulness program. She hasn’t seen her friends in months. Sex? Seems like a lot of effort. Even cooking dinner takes far too much planning. Sasha has hit a wall.Armed with good intentions to drink kale smoothies, try yoga, and find peace, she heads to the seaside resort she loved as a child. But it’s the off season, the hotel is in a dilapidated shambles, and she has to share the beach with the only other a grumpy guy named Finn, who seems as stressed as Sasha. How can she commune with nature when he’s sitting on her favorite rock, watching her? Nor can they agree on how best to alleviate their burnout ( manifesting, wild swimming; drinking whisky, getting pizza delivered to the beach).When curious messages, seemingly addressed to Sasha and Finn, begin to appear on the beach, the two are forced to talk—about everything. How did they get so burned out? Can either of them remember something they used to love? (Answer: surfing!) And the question they try and fail to ignore: what does the energy between them—flaring even in the face of their bone-deep exhaustion—signify?My Thoughts:Loved the banter and the push and pull between Sasha and Finn. Sasha's endeavors to follow her list was hilarious. I liked the enemies to friends type plot. The book kept my attention and provided a light read with a lot of laughs.

My daughter loves his music but I didn't know any of his songs. As I read the book I listened to quite a few songs and found that I like his music too.Description:In this definitive biography of Keith Urban, music biographer Jeff Apter presents the legendary Australian country star turned international superstar whose career spans the Nashville music scene, American Idol, The Voice, and much more, including the highs and lows along the way.Keith Urban came from humble origins. His father worked at the local landfill and Keith was a high school dropout. But Keith had a plan: conquer Nashville. “It’s my destiny,” he said. And Keith was hell-bent on scaling that musical Everest. Whatever it took.It didn’t come easy. Keith served his apprenticeship in the beer barns of Australia, and his early trips to America were disastrous. But he never gave up, settling in Nashville in the 1990s and forming The Ranch. When the band fell apart, so did Keith, ending up in rehab (not for the last time). But Keith did eventually reach the top, through a combination of talent, charisma, sex appeal, dogged perseverance—and skin thick enough for a rhino. And along the way he married Nicole Kidman.As Keith has said, “All those detours, the really dark ones, got me to where I am now. I would not want to change one leaf on any tree in the whole journey.”Keith Urban is the definitive biography of an international superstar.My thoughts:This was a great biography of Keith Urban's life from a child in Australia to present day. He's a likeable man with a great love for music. I find it so amazing that many musicians seem to know from the time they are a child that they will be musicians and the lengths they will go to accomplish their dream. Such was the case with Keith Urban. I liked that the biography followed both his accomplishments and his failures and what he learned from them. I enjoyed the detail of some of his feelings about the music industry and his gratitude to others for assistance provided along the way. Keith Urban has a tremendous number of awards to his name! This was an interesting journey to read and I'm glad I picked up the book.Thanks to Kensington Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

She's once again on the trail of a serial killer in a cold case.Description:Tracy Crosswhite is reopening the investigation into Seattle’s Route 99 serial killer. After thirteen victims, he stopped hunting and the trail went cold, stirring public outrage. Now, nearly three decades after his first kill, Tracy is expected to finally bring closure to the victims’ families and redeem the Seattle PD’s reputation. Even if it means working with her nemesis, Captain Johnny Nolasco.Lead detective of the original task force, Nolasco dares Tracy to do what he failed to: close the case. Forming an uneasy alliance, Tracy and Nolasco revisit old leads and pursue new evidence only to unearth high-level corruption and cover-ups as dangerous as the elusive killer himself. At the risk of being exposed, such deadly and powerful forces will go to extremes to stay in the shadows.That’s just where Tracy and Nolasco are headed—to find the twisted truth behind a killer’s motives, his disappearance, and his chilling comeback.My Thoughts:I'm a Tracy Crosswhite fan (and, of course, a Robert Dugoni fan)! I've followed this series from the start and I don't think I've missed any of the books. Tracy delves into corruption in her own department with a fearlessness that is admirable, no matter the cost to herself. This book can easily be read as a stand-alone, but it's always nice to have the history from earlier books to get the complete picture. Dugoni puts forward a good plot and I enjoyed it.

A friend she can't forget.I kept your secret Lucy. I've kept it for more than sixty years . . .It is 1951, and at number six Sycamore Street fifteen-year-old Edie Green is lonely. Living alone with her eccentric mother - who conducts seances for the local Ludthorpe community - she is desperate for something to shake her from her dull, isolated life.When the popular, pretty Lucy Theddle befriends Edie, she thinks all her troubles are over. But Lucy has a secret, one Edie is not certain she should keep . . .Then Lucy goes missing.2018. Edie is eighty-four and still living in Ludthorpe. When one day she glimpses Lucy Theddle, still looking the same as she did at fifteen, her family write it off as one of her many mix ups. There's a lot Edie gets confused about these days. A lot she finds difficult to remember. But what she does know is this: she must find out what happened to Lucy, all those years ago . . .My Thoughts:It's funny how when you get older you look back at things that happened in the past and try to make them right. That's what Edie was trying to do as she slipped into losing her memory to dementia. She needed to remember what happened to her friend Lucy and find her. It was sad to see her attempts to start something and then forget what she was doing and why. I lost my husband to Alzheimer's and aspects of Edie's plight hit home. The author treated Edie's affiction with sensitivity while still showing both how Edie was feeling as well as other people's perceptions of her. I liked Edie's character and my heart went out to her.

Everything I've read by Martin has been really good. I like the way he is able to convey events that are violent and omit all the gory details yet still convey the scenario.

In a twist he never saw coming, he ended up moving to L.A. to work as the bodyguard for movie star Maybe Joe Sue.It didn’t take long for Pockets to realize there were two Joe Sues: The Joe Sue the public saw with her perfect life and her Hollywood husband. And the private Joe Sue: the one with the traumatic youth that no amount of pills could cover up, who desperately wanted a child of her own.Even after their paths diverged, he continued to track Joe Sue’s life. Only a few would notice when the bottom fell out. But he did. And that’s when he stepped in.The latest novel from New York Times bestselling author Charles Martin travels from Hollywood to rural Montana as one man answers the question: How far would you go—really—to save someone you love?My Thoughts:I love the vivid characters drawn and the names are so unique. A character named Maybe Joe Sue (who would name a kid that??) and another called 'Pockets'. Both characters were wonderful, lovable people, but I think I want Pockets in my life. I don't think I've ever read a character so loyal, loving, and caring as this man. The story was very tense, to say the least, and kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put this one down - but that's wht happens to me with all of Charles Martin's books.

Horror - very different type of book from Harry Hole. I found it imaginative, but not really scary since it was all unbelievable and could never really happen. Still a good story with lots of surprises.Description:In the wake of his parents' tragic deaths in a house fire, fourteen-year-old Richard Elauved has been sent to live with his aunt and uncle in the remote, insular town of Ballantyne. Richard quickly earns a reputation as an outcast, and when a classmate named Tom goes missing, everyone suspects the new, angry boy is responsible for his disappearance. No one believes him when he says the telephone booth out by the edge of the woods sucked Tom into the receiver like something out of a horror movie. No one, that is, except Karen, a beguiling fellow outsider who encourages Richard to pursue clues the police refuse to investigate. He traces the number that Tom prank called from the phone booth to an abandoned house in the Black Mirror Wood. There he catches a glimpse of a terrifying face in the window. And then the voices begin to whisper in his ear . . .You know who I am. She's going to burn. The one you love is going to burn. There's not a thing you can do about it.When another classmate disappears, Richard must find a way to prove his innocence--and preserve his sanity--as he grapples with the dark magic that is possessing Ballantyne and pursuing his destruction.Then again, Richard may not be the most reliable narrator of his own story . . .My thoughts:I liked the creativity and the story fit the weird imaginings of a young boy until the story changed. The protagonist is definitely an unreliable narrator. The twists and turns of the story were both imaginative and surprising. The book was fairly quick to read and I do have to say it kept my interest, even though much of it are things that would not and could not happen. I found Richard to be an engaging character and I like him and felt bad for him. I was not scared, though, and in a horror book I expected to be. This book had an inventive, creative plot and was well paced. It was divided into sections, with a different view in each section - although all are from Richard's point of view.

The story is centered around Aline Weir, a lonely girl who has more power than she realizes.Description:Aline Weir, a witch who can talk to ghosts, has kept her talents hidden ever since a disastrous middle school slumber party, choosing to be invisible and use her powers in secret to help lost souls reunite with the keys to send them home. All the while, she finds solace in a bookstore and the three mysterious women who run it… until Aline discovers the book of Mischief, and her powers are enhanced.Living a solitary life until the age of thirty, Aline’s life takes an unexpected turn when the wrong (or perhaps right) person witnesses her using her powers and she is invited to a town that doesn’t exist on any map. Arriving in Matchstick, Aline learns of a lost magic that desperately needs to be found and only her unique powers can do it. But what she’s not told is that Magic is a person. One that is dangerous and seductive and has been waiting for a witch with a power like hers for centuries.My Thoughts:I found I liked Aline as a character and I enjoyed the plot. The concept of the book was different than any others I've read, and I usually like something different rather than the same trope. I also enjoyed the character Dragon and her mysterious persona. Actually all the characters were interesting. The pace moved fast enough to keep my attention. I've read several of Paige Crutcher's books and have enjoyed them all.

This is a good coI had read the first Sewing Studio mystery, Seams Like Murder by Dorothy Howell, and enjoyed it, so I was happy to pick this one up. This is a good cozy series.Description:After setting up a small sewing studio in quaint Hideaway Grove, Abbey Chandler is focused on finding crafty, creative ideas to build up her clientele. But murder can be bad for business . . .Some of the independent shops in this sleepy town are barely hanging on financially—and that includes Sarah’s Sweets, Abbey’s aunt’s bakery. The shop’s advantage—aside from the deliciousness of its products—is the fact that it’s the only bakery in the area. But it looks like that’s about to change. The second wife of a wealthy businessman wants her own bakery—and money is no object.When murder unravels the plans for the competing shop, Aunt Sarah is an immediate suspect—and Hideaway Grove’s merchants are on pins and needles about a big upcoming women’s conference, fearing the organization will cancel their booking because of the crime. Abbey’s doing her best to stay optimistic and stitch some custom tote bags for the attendees, but she’s also concerned with patching up Aunt Sarah’s good reputation. And when it comes to sorting through the possible motives of the victim’s family members and associates, she’s got a few tricks up her sleeve . . .My Thoughts:Love the characters and the little town of Hideaway Grove. There are actually two mysteries going on in this book - the murder mystery, and a case of stolen collectible dolls from a toy store. Both were interesting stories. In this book the town is getting ready for a Women's Conference which will provide great exposure benefits for the town as well as increased revenue for the shop owners, so a lot of the story is about the town's involvement in getting ready for the conference. Everyone was worried the murder would cause the conference to be cancelled. I enjoyed the relationships in the story as well as the plot.

This was an intriguing tale of two sisters who inherit not only a house from a great aunt they didn't know, but a family history mired in secret rituals and magic.Description:Cordelia Bone's meticulously crafted life and career in Dallas are crashing down around her thanks to a philandering husband with criminal debts.When her older, carefree sister, Eustace—a cannabis grower in Boulder, calls to inform her the great aunt they never met has died and they must travel to a small town in Connecticut to deal with the estate, she sees an opportunity to unload the house and save herself.But once there, the sisters learn they are getting much more than they bargained for. The Victorian mansion they stand to inherit is bound in a dynasty trust controlled by their late aunt's aging attorney who insists they inhabit the house and retain it but keeps them in the dark about the peculiar rituals of their ancestors. Not to mention a sexy, tattooed groundskeeper with a shrouded past who refuses to leave the carriage house and a crypt full of dead relatives looming at the property line.As both women grapple with their current predicament, they come face to face with a haunting family secret, the truth of what happened to their mother, and the enemy that's been stalking them from the shadows for generations. In a twisting torrent of terror and blood, the sisters must uncover the power within them to heal their fractured relationship, reverse their mysteriously declining health, and claim the lineage they wanted to escape but now must embrace if they are to survive at Bone Hill.My Thoughts:What began as an inheritance and hopes for a new beginning descended into a fight for survival as Cordelia and Eustace unravel the family secrets and try to overcome the malevolence that come with their inheritance. The story became very tense at times as the sisters faced threats. The house was full of dark secrets. The bone rituals were interesting and kind of creepy. There was some humor in the book though.

The hotel employees and guests were like a close-knit family the way they supported each other, creating a warm atmosphere. Description:It's the busiest season of the year, and Forest Manor Hotel is quite literally falling apart. So when Izzy and Lucas are given the same shift on the hotel's front desk, they have no choice but to put their differences aside and see it through.The hotel won't stay afloat beyond Christmas without some sort of miracle. But when Izzy returns a guest's lost wedding ring, the reward convinces management that this might be the way to fix everything. With four rings still sitting in lost property, the race is on for Izzy and Lucas to save their beloved hotel - and their jobs.As their bitter rivalry turns into something much more complicated, Izzy and Lucas begin to wonder if there's more at stake here than the hotel's future. Can the two of them make it through the season with their hearts intact?My thoughts:A light, laughable read that is pure enjoyment. The main characters, Izzy and Lucas, both work for the same hotel which they both love. The story is told in two points of view: Izzy's and Lucas's. I liked both characters. While Izzy is warm and friendly to everyone, Lucas is more brooding and serious. There's a perceived betrayal that has to be addressed. Also, the hotel's finances are in trouble, so both of them are facing possible job loss soon. I liked the competition between the two characters and their banter. The 'Ring Thing' was fun too.Thanks to Berkley Publishing Group through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I like the William Warwick character, nicknamed 'choir boy' for his staunch moral character and persistance in following protocol to the letter. He has had some great adventures but this one to be was one of the very best.Description:THE TOWER OF LONDON…Impenetrable. Well protected. Secure. Home to the most valuable jewels on earth. But once a year, when the Queen attends the State Opening of Parliament, the Metropolitan Police must execute the most secret operation in their armory as they transport the Crown Jewels across London. SCOTLAND YARD…For decades, the elite squad at Scotland Yard have been in charge of the operation. And for decades, it’s run like clockwork. THE HEIST…But this year, everything is about to change. Because a master criminal has set his sights on pulling off the most outrageous theft in history―and with a man on the inside, the odds are in his favor. Unless the team can stop him before it’s too late...My Thoughts:Fast-paced and action-packed this one grabbed me at the first and didn't let up until the end. Master criminal Miles Faulkner is back and he's out for revenge against his enemies - especially William Warwick. He will stop at nothing to ruin him. The case involves an impossible to pull off theft of the Crown Jewls from the Tower of London. Warwick and his team must make sure those jewels are kept safe during the time when the Queen needs them to wear for the opening of Parliament until they are safely back at the Tower. I loved the historical aspects of the Tower of London and the historical figures brough to life in the story - well-researched.

But when a ship model in the exhibit’s collection appears to be haunted, Lee will have to dive into her own treasure trove of psychic gifts before a killer comes to the surface to strike again . . .My thoughts:Let me first say that I like the characters of both Lee and her husband, Pete. They seem to make a good team and truly care about each other. O'Ryan steals the show with his amazing skills - gotta love a good cat in the picture.

But when her grandmother is diagnosed with cancer with only weeks to live, and her first heartbreak, Jake McNealy, returns to town after a decade, her carefully structured life begins to unravel.With the news of their grandmother's impending death, Sadie's estranged twin brother Seth returns to town, bringing with him deeply buried family secrets that threaten to tear Sadie's world apart. Their grandmother has been the backbone of the family for generations, and with her death, Sadie isn't sure she'll have the strength to keep the family, and her magic, together.As feelings for Jake begin to rekindle, and her grandmother growing sicker by the day, Sadie faces the last of her heartbreaks, and she has to decide: is love more important than magic?My Thoughts:I adored the grandmother for her practicality, her sacrifice, and her love of her family. The entire family is blessed with magical gifts, but each one also has a curse. This is the heartbreaking journey Sadie faced with her curse and her quest to overcome. Sadie's love of her magic was her core and she used it to help others. I loved the cooking theme that ran through the book from the cafe that she and her grandmother owned to their family dinners.

Anyway, I wanted to sample Nathan Hill's work.Description:When Jack and Elizabeth meet as college students in the '90s, the two quickly join forces and hold on tight, each eager to claim a place in Chicago’s thriving underground art scene with an appreciative kindred spirit. Fast-forward twenty years to married life, and alongside the challenges of parenting, they encounter cults disguised as mindfulness support groups, polyamorous would-be suitors, Facebook wars, and something called Love Potion Number Nine.For the first time, Jack and Elizabeth struggle to recognize each other, and the no-longer-youthful dreamers are forced to face their demons, from unfulfilled career ambitions to painful childhood memories of their own dysfunctional families. In the process, Jack and Elizabeth must undertake separate, personal excavations, or risk losing the best thing in their each other.My Thoughts:Not what I expected, but a very interesting and different read. The book went back and forth between present day and childhood memories by both Jack and Elizabeth. I will say it rambled a bit and the book was probably longer than it need to be. I found the chapter about Elizabeth's family and how they accrued their wealth to be very interesting. The parts about her relationship with her father were intesting too and tells you a lot about how she became who she is in present day. Jack's background was very different from Elizabeth's and he had a very traumatic experience that shadows his life. The book looks deeply at how people come together then grow apart. It looks at marriage and child-rearing, mistakes made and lessons learned. I did like the humor in the book. Some of the deep dives into protocols for Google and Facebook were a little much though. I found the placebo premise for the company Elizabeth worked for kind of disturbing to think people paid money for this. I recommend this to anyone who likes thought-provoking reads peppered with humor.Thanks to Knopf through Netgalley for an advance copy.

As the new owner of the infamous Black Wood House—the scene of a grisly murder-suicide—she’s determined that the fixer-upper will help reach a new audience on her successful lifestyle blog, and distract her from her failing marriage.But as Sarah paints over the house’s horrifying past, she knows better than anyone that a new façade can’t conceal every secret. Then the builders start acting erratically and experiencing bizarre accidents—and Sarah knows there’s only so long she can continue to sleep in the bedroom with the bloodstained floor and suffer the mysterious footsteps she hears from the attic.When menacing notes start appearing everywhere, Sarah becomes convinced that someone or something is out to kill her—her husband, her neighbors, maybe even the house itself. The more she remodels Black Wood House, the angrier it seems to become.With every passing moment, Sarah’s life spirals further out of control—and with it, her sense of reality. Though she desperately clings to the lies she’s crafted to conceal her own secrets, Sarah Slade must wonder . . . was it all worth it? Or will this house be her final unraveling?My Thoughts:Who wants to buy a murder house? Not me for sure. Sarah has aspirations of boosting her social media influencer status and thinks renovating the house will help. She runs into a lot more than she expected. There are twists and secrets from the past. The atmosphere in the house caused me to shiver. I don't know how she could stand to stay in it. I would have run screaming! The tension-building was perfect for the story. The plot moved well and only slowed down a little in a couple of places. I didn't like Sarah nor her husband, but the characters were drawn perfectly for the story. I really liked Emily though - she just seemed so friendly and caring. This thriller will keep you guessing for sure.

I was just a kid during the Vietnam war, but I've heard stories of men coming home from war and serving their country and they weren't honored and loved like the men who served in prior wars. They were vilified and ignored. I never understood why. I've never heard a word about women serving until this book. Many of the men who served were drafted and had no choice but to go serve their country. The women did it voluntarily wanting to both serve their country and provide service to the men who were in combat. Many of these women were nurses, though others held different service-type roles.This book focused on Frances McGrath (Frankie) who was leading an idyllic life in California when her brother Finley went to Vietnam to serve. Her father had a heroes wall of photographs of family members who had served in various wars and Frankie knew that Finley would be added to that wall after his service. She decided she would follow her brother and earn her father's respect by signing up to go to Vietnam as a nurse. She ended up in the Army serving as a nurse in Vietnam at the age of 20. Frankie's story is told in vivid detail chronicalling her horrific experiences, devastating romantic interests, close friendships, heroic acts, through to arriving back home and how she was treated and the devastating and debilitating recovery from the war experience. Then how she dealt with piecing her life back together after all the trauma.I was glued to the page until the end. This book made me cry and and feel the anger and frustration of Frankie's situation. This opened my eyes to many of the issues surrounding war, and Vietnam especially. Those veterans certainly deserve our support and much better treatment than what they received. And yes, even though the Veterans Administration told Frankie she couldn't get help there because women didn't serve in combat, they most certainly did and they too deserver honor, respect and support from all Americans.Thank you Kristin Hannah for writing this book and handling the issues with such sensitivity and heart.

Description:Legend goes that long ago a Flores woman offended the old gods, and their family was cursed as a result. Now, every woman born to the family has a touch of magic. Sage Flores has been running from her family—and their “gifts”—ever since her younger sister Sky died. Eight years later, Sage reluctantly returns to her hometown. Like slipping into an old, comforting sweater, Sage takes back her job at Cranberry Rose Company and uses her ability to communicate with plants to discover unusual heritage specimens in the surrounding lands.What should be a simple task is complicated by her partner in botany sleuthing: Tennessee Reyes. He broke her heart in high school, and she never fully recovered. Working together is reminding her of all their past tender, genuine moments—and new feelings for this mature sexy man are starting to take root in her heart.With rare plants to find, a dead sister who keeps bringing her coffee, and another sister whose anger fills the sky with lightning, Sage doesn’t have time for romance. But being with Tenn is like standing in the middle of a field on the cusp of a summer thunderstorm—supercharged and inevitable.My Thoughts:This story had a fun, swoon-worthy romance with some tension and obstacles. There was also the magic factor which was different for each sister. Each individual gift was interesting. The book grabbed me near the beginning and kept my attention throughout - I seriously didn't want to put it down. The plot moved really well with tension building toward the climax. Themes of sister relationships, coming of age, dysfunctional family, and magical realism. I enjoyed the excepts of AOL chats when Sage was a teenager.

I I picked up this book because I didn't know much about Clint Eastwood other than I liked his movies and I knew he was a figure who is much admired. I just wanted to know more about him.Description:Clint Eastwood is Hollywood’s elder statesman and its conscience. He is the standard by which other films and filmmakers are judged. He represents both classical Hollywood and an entirely modern, uncompromising and unfussy directorial presence.There are those who adore him as a cowboy, a superstar, the rugged, unyielding yet introspective face of American machismo. There are those who read him as a great American auteur fashioning uncompromising, fascinating, intellectual films about his country, about life, about whatever the hell takes his fancy. No single figure in all of Hollywood, operates so freely outside of the strictures of commercial pressure. And yet, or perhaps that is because, he makes hit after hit. Separation of actor and director is almost impossible. They are intimately related, cross pollinating, but he has become in the latter half of his career to be view as one of the great American artists. While drawing connections from his wider work as an actor, and those who have influenced him, it is his identity as a director that this book will celebrate. This is not a career — it is a landscape.My Thoughts:This book provided a huge array of information about Clint Eastwood the man, the actor, the director, the musician, and the statesman. I see now why the man is so respected and it certainly increased my respect for him. I really like how he sticks to his beliefs and doesn't succumb to the commercialism of Hollywood. The photographs in the book are awesome. It covered every movie Eastwood acted in as well as everything he directed and gave background information on each of them. I was surprised that many times the movies have used Eastwood's own musical scores as background music. Such a talented man!

But when she discovers a dead body at an estate sale—even Phoebe wonders if this is simply too much.Rumors of Phoebe’s involvement force her to take action; she needs to find the killer and clear her own name, once again. She enlists Rich Lofting, the handsome private detective and her childhood friend, in her investigation, all while she sorts out her unresolved feelings for him. Is there something more sinister lurking in the shadows of this small tight-knit town? And does Phoebe really want to find out?With a dash of magic, a pinch of sleuthing skills, and a spoonful of friendly assistance, Phoebe needs to uncover the killer to keep Raven Creek safe once again. But if she doesn’t—will she find herself in even more hot water?My Thoughts:This book was lots of fun with Phoebe learning to be a witch and also sticking her nose into police business when there's a murder. Apparently in the earlier book she had gotten herself involved in a murder as well. In this book the murder happens at an estate sale, and there are several avenues to investigate to find the truth. I liked the character and found her cat, Bob, adorable. Bob seems to have his own agenda. I also liked the paranormal aspects. I'm wondering if there will be something in the next book about her nemesis's nephew she's going to rent property to for his candle shop. I'll be looking for the next book in this series since I enjoyed the characters in this small town. I assume the love interest will develop more as well as maybe the antagonism with the one person on the council who causes problems for Phoebe.

Description:Look into her eyes—she can tell you how you'll die . . .As a child, Faith acquired the ability to see when and how people would die—a “gift” she neither wanted nor could get rid of.After foreseeing a family tragedy and being ostracized, Faith learns to control her visions, and returns to perform in her family’s traveling carnival. But when an unruly customer attacks her, she has a vision in full view of a crowd.She is banned from the carnival she loves—and loses her only source of income to support her dying mother. Desperate to support her mother and with only one friend standing by her, she sees no reason to continue hiding her ability and goes to dangerous lengths to earn money. But when she sees herself in a man’s future death, Faith must face her own fears of her powers and tune into her gift to fight against a future that would ruin her life—and end someone else’s.With The Sight , celebrated author Melanie Golding delivers another suspense-driven masterpiece with unforgettable characters and an ending that will leave you stunned.My Thoughts:Faith's ability was intriguing, although it had to feel like such a heavy burden to her. Having ""the sight"" presented her with many challenges to overcome - many caused by other people's fear of her ability. I've read several of Melanie Golding's books, and this one was not my favorite, but it's still an interesting story and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read about circus life. It is a rather dark book though.Thanks to Crooked Lane Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I think I've read all of these though, and it was fun to see the characters again. This one is set in Greystone, a place Matthew had lived where his family was part of a religious sect he had left behind.Description:Fierce winds, dark secrets, deadly intentions.When Jem Rosco—sailor, adventurer, and legend—blows into town in the middle of an autumn gale, the residents of Greystone, Devon, are delighted to have a celebrity in their midst. But just as abruptly as he arrived, Rosco disappears again, and soon his lifeless body is discovered in a dinghy, anchored off Scully Cove, a place with legends of its own.This is an uncomfortable case for Detective Inspector Matthew Venn. Greystone is a place he visited as a child, a community he parted ways with. Superstition and rumor mix with fact as another body is found, and Matthew finds his judgment clouded. As the winds howl, and Venn and his team investigate, he realizes that no one, including himself, is safe from Scully Cove’s storm of dark secrets.My Thoughts:Ann Cleeves comes through again with a mystery that's a little more edgy than a cozy, but doesn't delve too much into dark and gory. I enjoy her books and this is a good series if you like crime fiction. The principal investigator, Matthew Venn, and his team work well together in solving the mystery which involved a famous sailor who was murdered and left in a dinghy. There are quite a few stones to uncover, some unreliable witnesses and a bit of a cover-up going on which throws the investigation in a few different directions. There was plenty here to keep me turning the pages.Thanks to St. Martin's Press, Minotaur Books throughh Netgalley for an advance copy.

The story kept me engaged and it certainly wasn't boring. I loved the humor. The characters were well written and so was the plot.

Molly Harper is a new author for me, but I enjoyed this book so I will be looking for the next installment in this series. Description:Riley Denton-Everett always felt like something was missing in her life—and her numerous odd jobs and short-lived relationships haven’t brought her any closer to finding it. Everything changes when she receives a mysterious message: You’re a Denton. You belong on Starfall Point. Once you’re here, I’ll tell you everything you need to know.When Riley arrives on the island, she learns her aunt has left her a historic mansion brimming with haunted antiques. Turns out, that’s not the only thing she’s inherited. Riley also hails from a long line of witches whose magic is critical to protecting the living.Edison Held, the town’s frustratingly hot librarian, is completely unaware of the ghosts in Riley’s ancestral home and is determined to convince her to open it up to the public. Riley starts to wonder if Edison’s knowledge of the island’s history can help her get a handle on her new powers—but can she trust him with her secrets? And can she trust herself with the simmering attraction brewing between them?My Thoughts:This was both a paranormal romance and a mystery. This house Riley has inherited is full of ghosts, so the book is a bit different in that respect. The romance was fun and the mystery surrounting Riley's aunt and her history was really interesting to me. This was a book with a different sort of twist.

Victor and I built Serenity Falls, a successful couples’ retreat, together. Honesty and trust were the bedrocks of our marriage, and we helped other couples repair their relationships too.Now my whole world has been turned upside down and I don’t know what to think.

The police have been unable to identify her and I’m forced to confront the painful reality that my own husband was hiding something. My grief is laced with anger.

And to protect my family, I have to make a choice.A choice that will turn me into a liar, just like Victor.And will end in murder…My Thoughts:The book was slow during the first half, but picked up in the second half. I didn't like Lorraine as a character and couldn't relate to her. The mystery woman in the car was interesting and I was surprised to find out who she was. The book had some good twists, but I had trouble staying focused on it. Don't know if it was my mood at the time I read it or the story itself.

I picked it up because the first one was an enjoyable cozy mystery and this one is as well. The book can easily be read as a one off and it would be easy to follow without having read the first book; however, the first book was fun too and does provide some background on the characters. This one involves initially one suspicious death in one of the local beach hut communities involving the burning of a beach hut. The qurstion is was it intentional or accidental. Description:It’s almost summer in Southbourne and the ladies of the Charity Shop Detective Agency are ready for another season of sun, sea and . . . murder.Amongst the rows of charming brightly painted cabins, an elderly man’s beach hut is set on fire in the middle of the night — while he slept inside.By day, Fiona, Sue and Daisy volunteer at the Dogs Need Nice Homes charity shop. But, by night, they investigate crimes. And they’re determined to get to the bottom of this murder.Malcolm Crainey was a bit of an eccentric, but he was harmless really. Who would want to kill him?The ladies soon uncover a long list of possible suspects. Neighbours who hated Malcolm for refusing to swap huts. Members of the snobby beach hut association who took umbrage with Malcom’s quirky beachcombed cabin decorations.Then another hut is burned down in the dead of night. Thankfully there was no one asleep inside this time. But the pressure is on — can Fiona, Sue and Daisy find the culprit before the beach hut murderer strikes again?My Thoughts:I enjoy the cameraderie surrounding the ladies who work in the charity shop. There is also the irritating nearby snobby charity shop across the way, whose owner is quite uppity - she's back in this one. They mystery surrounding the beach huts is interesting and provides some surprising twists. I enjoyed the investigation the amateur detectives were pulled into. I also enjoyed some of the side stories - the cake deal at the charity shop, the mysterious woman who dropped off a box, but didn't just wanted the shop to hold it until she was ready to give it up, the politics with the woman who runs the community center, and the issues with the nearby owner of the Cat Alliance charity shop owner. Some quirkly characters add a lot to the book. I really enjoyed the freee-spirited character the ladies met who had come down from London to stay in one of the beach huts and was friends with the owner of the Cat Alliance shop.Thanks to Joffe Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The first book, The Girls on Chalk Hill was good and I found the character's background and manner interesting.In this book, there are a series of deaths of young people that look like suicides, but something about each of them tells Lexi to look deeper. This was a difficult investigation and clues were few. I enjoyed following the investigation and the reasoning and search for the truth.Once again, I was impressed with the character, Lexi Bennett.

She has a lot to deal with to earn respect from both groups so she works really hard.In this first book, three women are missing from the reservation, and one of them is Paloma 'White Dove', who is Eva's best friend.

Smirnoff did an awesome job picking up this story and making it exciting and true to Stieg Larsson's original concept. Description:Change is coming to Sweden’s far north: its untapped natural resources are sparking a gold rush with the criminal underworld leading the charge. But it’s not the prospect of riches that brings Lisbeth Salander to the small town of Gasskas. She has been named guardian to her niece Svala, whose mother has disappeared. Two things soon become clear: Svala is a remarkably gifted teenager—and she’s being watched.Mikael Blomkvist is also heading north. He has seen better days. Millennium magazine is in its final print issue, and relations with his daughter are strained. Worse still, there are troubling rumors surrounding the man she’s about to marry. When the truth behind the whispers explodes into violence, Salander emerges as Blomkvist’s last hope.A pulse-pounding thriller, The Girl in the Eagle’s Talons sees Salander and Blomkvist navigating a world of conspiracy and betrayal, old enemies and new friends, ice-bound wilderness and the global corporations that threaten to tear it apart.My thoughts:Very well written and a great addition to The Millenium series. I liked this one much better than the previous book in the series. I've seen some bad s, but in my case I enjoyed the story. This time Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkvist go up against corporate criminals while both are, oddly enough, in the same town dealing with family situations. I found Lisbeth's niece interesting. The story was fast-paced and exciting, and kept my attention to the end - which is somewhat of a cliffhanger that seems to indicate a follow up to come. I sure hope so as I have followed this series from the beginning.Thanks to Knopf, Pantheon, Vintage, and Anchor through Netgalley for an advance copy.

It's a good start!Description: Crescent Cove, a small hamlet on Vancouver Island, is the last place out-of-work investigative journalist Luke Tremblay ever wanted to see again. He used to spend summers here, until his family learned that he was gay and rejected him. Now, following his aunt’s sudden death, he’s inherited her entire estate, including her seaside cottage and the antiques shop she ran for forty years in Crescent Cove. Luke plans to sell everything and head back to Toronto as soon as he can…but Crescent Cove isn’t done with him just yet.When a stranger starts making wild claims about Luke’s aunt, Luke sends him packing. The next morning, though, Luke discovers that the stranger has returned, and now he’s lying dead in the back garden. To make matters worse, the officer leading the investigation is a handsome Mountie with a chip on his shoulder who seems convinced that Luke is the culprit. If he wants to prove his innocence and leave this town once and for all, Luke will have to use all his skills as a journalist to investigate the colorful locals while coming to terms with his own painful past.There are secrets buried in Crescent Cove, and the more Luke digs, the more he fears they might change the town forever.My Thoughts:This is a good cozy murder mystery. I liked the characters and the story moved well and kept my attention. As Luke becomes the main suspect in the murder, he feels he has to investigate to find the real killer and get that cute Mountie's focus off of Luke as the prime candidate.

My Dad played both guitar and banjo and every Friday night at our home people would gather, pull out the instruments and songbooks and sing and play both country and bluegrass tunes. They called these picking session ""hootenannys"". Now one of my brothers plays banjo in a bluegrass band.It was fun to read about Ricky Scaggs and Marty Stuart playing from the time they were young boys. They were mentored by the legends of bluegrass music: Lester Flatt mentored Stuart while Earl Scruggs mentored Scaggs. The book described how the music grew and changed over time and the huge parts played by both Studart and Skaggs.I was amazed at how fluidly the musicians picked up and played at the drop of a hat with another band and seemed to fit right in. Also, I was surprised at some of the rock artists these bluegrass stars ended up working with at times. I loved reading about Skaggs' great relationship with Emmylou Harris and how what he learned while playing in her 'Hot Band' helped in his music production skills.

The Scarlet Letter was written almost two hundred years earlier, but it seems to tell the story of Mia’s mother, Ivy, and their life inside the Community—an oppressive cult in western Massachusetts where contact with the outside world is forbidden, and books are considered evil. But how could this be? How could Nathaniel Hawthorne have so perfectly captured the pain and loss that Mia carries inside her?Through a journey of heartbreak, love, and time, Mia must abandon the rules she was raised with at the Community. As she does, she realizes that reading can transport you to other worlds or bring them to you, and that readers and writers affect one another in mysterious ways. She learns that time is more fluid than she can imagine, and that love is stronger than any chains that bind you.As a girl Mia fell in love with a book. Now as a young woman she falls in love with a brilliant writer as she makes her way back in time. But what if Nathaniel Hawthorne never wrote The Scarlet Letter ? And what if Mia Jacob never found it on the day she planned to die?My thoughts:Great characters and great plotting. The depth of character portrayal made the characters come alive on the page. Mia was an interesting character who bravely faced hardship in the cult, but also after she escaped and built a new life. The connection with Nathaniel Hawthorne was an interesting segue. The book also throws a light on the past and current plight of unmarried, pregnant women and the difficulties they must face. While some things have changed, other stigmas still remain.

For Rain Wilmot, owner of the Lakeside Library, this is the perfect opportunity to bring back her mother’s summer book club. But the summer sun starts to really heat up when one of the club’s members, Lily Redlin, is found dead in her own home not long after the first meeting.Alongside her sidekick and neighbor Julia Reynolds and the charming Jace Lowe, Rain discovers that the murder is seemingly inspired by the book club’s recent selection of Agatha Christie’s classic mystery novel, Sparkling Cyanide. But who would kill Lily, and more importantly, why?The deeper Rain goes into the story, the more confusing and complicated the plot becomes. Was Lily murdered to cover up a tragic accident involving an old classmate years earlier? Or were the rumors true—did Lily really possess priceless original Laura Ingles Wilder manuscripts and someone killed her for them? And who stands to gain the recently inherited piece of waterfront property that Lily received from a long-lost relative?With a long list of suspects and motives, Rain realizes that all leads come back to people involved in the book club. Rain and her friends take a page from Agatha Christie’s book by hosting a reenactment of the club’s first meeting to flush out the killer. Will Rain’s plan succeed—or will this librarian’s book be checked out for good?My thoughts:The characters and the setting are fun to return to with each installment of this series.

Rachel Krall is a true crime podcaster. In this book she is pulled in to an investigation by the FBI to help with a missing persons case.Description:Terence Bailey is about to be released from prison for breaking and entering, though investigators have long suspected him in the murders of six women. As his freedom approaches, Bailey gets a surprise visit from Maddison Logan, a hot, young influencer with a huge social media following. Hours later, Maddison disappears, and police suspect she’s been kidnapped—or worse. Is Maddison’s disappearance connected to her visit to Bailey? Why was she visiting him in the first place?When they hit a wall in the investigation, the FBI reluctantly asks for Rachel’s help in finding the missing influencer. Maddison seems only to exist on social media; she has no family, no friends, and other than in her posts, most people have never seen her. Who is she, really? Using a fake Instagram account, Rachel Krall goes undercover to BuzzCon, a popular influencer conference, where she discovers a world of fierce rivalry that may have turned lethal.When police find the body of a woman with a tattoo of a snake eating its tail, the FBI must consider a chilling possibility: Bailey has an accomplice on the outside and a dangerous obsession with influencers, including Rachel Krell herself. Suddenly a target of a monster hiding in plain sight, Rachel is forced to confront the very real dangers that lurk in the dark corners of the internet.Rachel Krall, the true crime podcaster star of Megan Goldin’s acclaimed Night Swim returns to search for a popular social media influencer who disappeared after visiting a suspected serial killer.My thoughts:I enjoyed this book as much as I did the first in the series, The Night Swim. This was an entertaining read with a few twists, some predictable and some not so much. I found the social media conference interesting. I can't imagine putting one's life on display all the time though. Rachel came across as defensive in the book, and I get it - she got pulled in somewhat underhandedly.

They barely escape in a small plane, but gunfire hits the fuel line. The pilot, a man who has been raising them as his own, manages to crash land in the middle of the Montana wilderness. The siblings hike deep into the woods, searching desperately for safety—unaware of the severity of the approaching storm.Boyd’s sister Ruby left Los Angeles for the Army years ago, cutting off contact in order to help keep her niece and nephew safe and free from the horrors of the McIntyre clan. So when she gets an emergency call that the plane has gone down with the kids inside, she drops everything to try save them.As the storm builds, Ruby isn’t the only person looking for them. Boyd has hired an expert tracker to find and bring them home. And rancher Nick Lorenzo, who knows these mountains better than anyone and doesn’t understand why the kids are running, is on their trail too.But there is a greater threat to Kristen and Ryan out there. More volatile than the incoming blizzard, more dangerous than the family they ran from or the natural predators they could encounter. Who finds them first could determine if they live or die. . .My thoughts:This was an exciting, action-packed thriller that kept me turning the pages. Kristen and Ryan's family were evil and dangerous. The pursuit to get the two children back was unrelenting. Kristen was strong and determined to take care of Ryan, but she really needed help and didn't want to involve anyone else as they might get killed. I can't imagine being stranded in the wilderness in Montana during a brutal blizzard with killers out hunting for you. Lots of tension, survival skills, and difficult decisions here.

She's totally determined to do the right thing, has earned quite a reputation for solving some horrendous cases, and a has an interesting family history. Description:For Chicago police detective Annalisa Vega, Sam Tran’s death presents an ominous puzzle. The ex-cop turned PI is found hanging from a cemetery tree with a message across his chest that suggests someone holds a murderous grudge against the police. Annalisa suspects the real answer lies in one of Tran’s open cases. She believes he stumbled on a dark secret during his investigations and someone killed him to keep him quiet. Her own family harbors plenty of secrets, something Annalisa is reminded of when her brother turns out to be one of Sam’s last clients.Vinny Vega hired Tran to find a dangerous stalker on his daughter’s college campus. Now Sam is dead and the stalker remains at large, with Annalisa’s niece Quinn firmly in his sights.To protect Quinn, Annalisa begins tracing Sam’s steps back through his open cases, which include not only the campus stalker but also a brutal double homicide from twenty years ago. Did Sam finally find the killer? Did he uncover the stalker’s identity? Annalisa must figure out which secret got Sam killed, and fast, or someone else will die. Every move she makes brings her closer to the truth of Sam’s death, and closer to a murderer who will stop at nothing to remain free.My Thoughts:The case of private investigator Sam Tran's hanging was intriguing. It could be suicide, but the message on his chest certainly points to murder. Annalisa digs into Sam's background hoping to find clues. She checks out all the cases Sam had been working on when he died. Also, there's another case going on involving a guy in a chicken mask holding. Annalisa accidentally gets involved in that one as well, even though it is assigned to someone else. Oh, and is Annalisa pregnant or not. She is hesitant to take a test and find out - not sure she wants to the know the results. There's a second-chance romance going on here too that's interesting.I like this series! It's fun to read about Annalisa's adventures and the situations she gets caught up in. I hope this isn't the last.Thanks to St. Martin's Press, Minotaur Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

California Golden provides a view of the surfing culture as it grew in California and originally, in Hawaii. Specifically it shines a light on women breaking into the all male sport of surfing, both competitively and for their own enjoyment.Description:Southern California, 1960s: endless sunny days surfing in Malibu, followed by glittering neon nights at Whisky A-Go-Go. In an era when women are expected to be housewives, Carol Donelly is breaking the mold as a legendary female surfer struggling to compete in a male-dominated sport--and her daughters, Mindy and Ginger, bear the weight of her unconventional lifestyle.The Donnelly sisters grow up enduring their mother's absence--physically, when she's at the beach, and emotionally, the rare times she's at home. To escape questions about Carol's whereabouts--and chase their mom's elusive affection--they cut school to spend their days in the surf. From her first time on a board, Mindy shows a natural talent, but Ginger, two years younger, feels out of place in the water.As they grow up and their lives diverge, Mindy and Ginger's relationship ebbs and flows. Mindy finds herself swept up in celebrity, complete with beachside love affairs, parties at the Playboy Club, and USO tours to Vietnam. Meanwhile, Ginger--desperate for a community of her own--is tugged into the vibrant counterculture of drugs and cults. Through it all, their sense of duty to each other survives, as the girls are forever connected by the emotional damage they carry from their unorthodox childhood.A gripping, emotional story set at a time when mothers were expected to be Donna Reed, not Gidget, California Golden is an unforgettable novel about three women living in a society that was shifting as tempestuously as the breaking waves.My Thoughts:It's hard for me to imagine how life must have been for women when they had so few freedoms and society placed so many constraints on them. It is thanks to women who pushed at those constraints, like Carol Donnelly in this story, that allow women to have so many more choices and opportunities now. This was an emotional story and I found Ginger's life to be downright tragic. Mindy had to be admired for her perseverance and courage, even though she made some bad choices. Carol made some truly bad decisions with her family and did so in a selfish way to follow her dream and her passion for surfing. This book provided an in-depth profile of surfing lifestyle. I was fascinated with how the surfers lived for the waves and their time spent in the ocean. The book spans history from the 1950's through the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970's. The time Mindy spent on the USO tour provided a scary window on some of the things happening in Vietnam during the war from a visitors perspective.The writing was superb and the plot moved at a good pace. I didn't want to put the book down. I loved following the Donnelly girls through all of their hardships, dreams and passions.

This book can easily be read as a stand alone, though with any series it's always good to have the backstories of the characters. I do enjoy good detective series and Jonah Sheens has become a favorite, although this book is more about their team effort with Juliette and Ben more upfront.Description:A woman uploads her DNA online, searching for her father--but the man who contacts her is Detective Chief Inspector Jonah Sheens. From the acclaimed author of Little Sister, this endlessly twisty crime novel asks: What might a family do to protect or expose a serial killer in its midst?When the police found the first body, left on a bonfire in the fields, they worried it had the hallmarks of a serial killer.Now, as they find the second, they know for sure.Panic about the ""bonfire killer"" quickly spreads through the sedate, suburban area of Southampton. Women are urged not to travel alone at night, and constant vigilance is encouraged among the local residents. But single mom Aisling Cooley has a lot to distract her: two beloved teenage sons and a quest to find her long-lost father, whom she hasn't seen since she was a teenager growing up in Ireland.After much debate she decides to upload her DNA to an ancestry website, and when she gets a match she is filled with an anxious excitement, that her questions about her father's disappearance from her life might finally be answered.But to her horror, it's not her father who's found her. It's a detective.And they say her DNA is a close match for the bonfire killer...My thoughts:This is a fast-paced, well-plotted police procedural which provides satisfying tension and the investigation progresses. This one kept me guessing and I kept on being wrong. And dang - there's quite a cliffhanger! I love the way Jonah, Ben and Juliette work together so seamlessly and their friendship. I recommend to anyone who likes a good detective/police procedural with lots of twists and surprises.Thanks to Random House through Netgalley for an advance copy.

A great heroic adventure with lots of tension building to a climax. If you like thrillers, you will enjoy this one. It says this a squel to The Gatekeeper by James Byrne, but I hadn't read that one and had no trouble following the story.Description: Desmond Aloysius Limerick (""Dez"" to his friends and close personal enemies) is a man with a shadowy past, certain useful hard-won skills, and, if one digs deep enough, a reputation as a good man to have at your back. Now retired from his previous life, Dez is just a bloke with a winning smile, a bass guitar, and bullet wounds that paint a road map of past lives.Jaleh Swann, a business journalist hot on the trail of an auditor who was mugged and killed, lands in the hospital just one day after her Portland apartment is ransacked. When Jaleh’s sister, Raziah, reaches out to an old friend for help, Dez has no choice but to answer. The Swann sisters have been pulled into a dizzying web of cover-ups and danger. At the center lies an insidious Oregon-based tech corporation, Clockjack, which has enough money and hired guns to silence just about anyone—including this rag-tag trio. Luckily, Dez’s speciality is not just to open doors, but keep them open—and protect those working to expose Clockjack’s secrets.More stands in the way of the truth than just one corporation. When hired thugs come to the finish the job and attack the Swann sisters at the hospital, Dez does what he does best. Now, the two captured men (and the corpse Dez left behind) attract the attention of not just Clockjack, but of the Portland police, the D.E.A, and the U.S. Marshalls. Dez and the Swann sisters are on the run from powers beyond their control and means. Outnumbered, under resourced and outgunned, Dez must use all his skills to keep his friends safe and stand up to corporate conniving. After all, the one thing Clockjack didn’t count on? A good man with a simple job to do.My thoughts:Loved the character Dez with his gatekeeping skills. He's quite the hero! The plot was good and the story was so fast-paced I didn't want to put it down. I may go back and read the first book - just because I liked the Dez character so much. He seems to have a reputation as a legend - his trademark is the ability to open any door. That may not seem to be such an admirable skill, but after reading the book it's very special. There's some humor in the book too, that relieves some of the tension. Some of the situations were over-the-top and you have to suspend belief.Thanks to St. Martin's Press, Minotaur Books through Netgalley for an advance copy.

This one was no exception and Tempe is pulled into a dangerous and exciting investigation on the islands of Turks and Caicos.Description:Called in to examine what is left of a body struck by lightning, Tempe traces an unusual tattoo to its source and is soon embroiled in a much larger case. Young men—tourists—have been disappearing on the islands of Turks and Caicos for years. Seven years ago, the first victim was found in a strange location with both hands cut off; the other visitors vanished without a trace. But, recently, tantalizing leads have emerged and only Tempe can unravel them.Maddeningly, the victims seem to have nothing in common—other than the strange locations where their bodies are eventually found, and the fact that the young men all seem to be the least likely to be involved in foul play. Do these attacks have something to do with the islands’ seething culture of gang violence? Tempe isn’t so sure. And then she turns up disturbing clues that what’s at stake may actually have global significance.It isn’t long before the sound of a ticking clock grows menacingly loud, and then Temper herself becomes a target.My Thoughts:The plot moved quickly and the writing style is exactly what's expected in Kathy Reichs' books - always flows well and keeps my attention. I was surprised several times during the investigation and found things were much bigger than I originally thought. I really liked the detective Tiersa Musgrove and admired her dedication and accomplishments. The main character, as always, is brave, intelligent, and has good instincts. She bases her conclusions on facts and never fails to connect the dots. I loved the beautiful island setting, even as a backdrop to murder.Thanks to Scribner through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Description:Olivia ’s heart is breaking watching her mother Hattie withdraw after her husband’s sudden death. He was Hattie’s whole world and without him, she’s never been lonelier. Every morning, Hattie pulls a pair of tired old deckchairs from her equally tired-looking beach hut and places them looking out to sea. Seeing her mother sit next to the empty chair, Olivia comes up with a plan.One deckchair for hire! Must bring good conversation and have own flask.When she places the advert in the window of a local café, responses from other lonely locals looking for company start flooding in – which only makes Hattie withdraw even further. Olivia is so busy trying to bring the light back to Hattie’s life that she doesn’t notice the darkness creeping into her own. And as news of the advert spreads, Olivia realises her long-buried secret is in danger of coming to light…Can Olivia convince Hattie to let someone fill the empty deckchair and bring a smile back to Hattie’s life? And when Olivia is confronted with the demons in her past, is this her chance to finally move on – and to re-open her heart to love…?My Thoughts:Olivia's idea of renting out the deck chair to try to help her mother seems like such an outside-the-box idea, that it's brilliant. Though may would have refused to do this, Hattie reluctantly agreed to go through with it. The people who rented the deck chair were fascinating. I loved their effect on Hattie. Olivia's relationship with her own daughter, Beau was another drama playing out in the book. Olivia had some growing to do and some things to learn in order to work on the relationship with her daughter. This story kept me turning the pages. It is well plotted with enough going on to hold me interest. It also brought me to tears a couple of times.

Description:When she’s not piloting a glass bottom boat, showing the sights to tourists, Whit sells seashells by the seashore—among many other sea and sand souvenirs—to help keep her family shop, Nautically Yours, afloat. It’s a far cry from her corporate climbing ladder life in Los Angeles, but Whit and her frisky feline, Whiskers, love calling Catalina home and being close to family. Especially Whit’s grandmother Goldy, a fun and feisty senior who always marched to the beat of a different drum.In her youth, Goldy was an item with a Catalina catch named Darren. But it was actually a ruse to fool Darren’s parents who wouldn’t have accepted his preference for men. Eventually, he left the island and chose the life—and life-partner—he wanted for himself. Back in town for his mother’s funeral, Darren takes the opportunity to heal his open wounds, and settle some scores.In a surprise to the residents, Darren produced a documentary about the history of Catalina, and has arranged a premiere screening in the local theater. But his film career is cut short when his partner’s dead body is discovered the night before the opening. Rumors swirl about Darren’s past, along with his partner’s—and the things they’ve done—giving a lot of folks a lot of motives. Now, it’s up to Whit and her boyfriend policeman to catch a killer, and uncover just how much Grandma Goldy knows about the back door deals tied to Darren’s past . . .My Thoughts:The grandmother, Goldy, was the character I enjoyed most. She is quite a character. Domineering, yet quite respected, and everyone seemed to jump and try to do whatever she asked - no matter how strange. Whit is the one who is the investigator and she seemed to have good instincts and a dedictaion to her community. She followed clues relentlessly. I wasn't sure whether Darren was a good guy or bad during most of the book - Goldy seemed to defend him totally and she seemed sure he was good and couldn't be the murderer.I recommend this to anyone who likes a fun mystery with a little romance and good banter.

I’m that thing you call love.”In a little town in the south of France in the 1960s, a dazzling encounter with Love itself changes the life of infant orphan Marie-Jeanne forever.As a girl, Marie-Jeanne realizes that she can see the marks Love has left on the people around her—tiny glowing lights on the faces and hands that shimmer more brightly when the one meant for them is near. Before long, Marie-Jeanne is playing matchmaker, bringing true loves together in her village.As she grows up, Marie-Jeanne helps her foster father, Francis, begin a mobile library that travels throughout the many small mountain towns in the region of Nyons. She finds herself bringing soulmates together every place they go—and there are always books that play a pivotal role in that quest. However, the only person that Marie-Jeanne can’t seem to find a soulmate for is herself. She has no glow of her own, though she waits and waits for it to appear. Everyone must have a soulmate, surely—but will Marie-Jeanne be able to recognize hers when Love finally comes her way?My Thoughts:This was atmospheric and I think was reaching for magical in the writing. It was narrated by Love, and had characters like Death, Logic, Chance, Fate, Wonder and Time. It also had a very old olive true dispensing wisdom. I found the first half of the book rather slow and it didn't really get my interest until halfway through. I enjoyed the story of Marie-Jeanne and how she tried to help others find love through delivering books. Also, I enjoyed how reading books changed the community.

It's a fun read and a short happily-ever-after type story.Description:When Hollywood comes to small-town Ohio, the scene is set for an unpredictable romance in a fun and flirty novel by Sariah Wilson, the bestselling author of The Chemistry of Love . The small town of Patience needs a financial boost. Temporary librarian and aspiring film-score composer Jane Wagner’s plan? Invite movie star Nick Haddon to the town’s harvest festival and stand back for the tourist surge. No one thought he’d say yes―much less that he’d bring a documentary crew to stream his visit. Given Nick’s affinity for trouble, his reputation and films are tanking. Patience is the perfect stopover on a journey of self-improvement and his chance to put good karma out in the universe. Spending time with a sweet and lovely guide like Jane is a bonus. But Jane’s heartbroken past keeps her on guard against men. Especially when they’re jinxed. The truth is, Jane’s falling hard. But she can’t ignore the differences between them. He’s famous. She isn’t. He’s here for two weeks. This is her home. Where can it possibly lead? She’ll see. Because day after blissful day, Nick’s encouraging Jane to trust again and, best of all, to dream beyond Patience.My Thoughts:I enjoyed the banter between the characters. There were some humorous situations that made me laugh. It helped that I liked both Jane and Nick. The romance is sweet. The small town seemed like a caring community. This was a light, happy read. Yes, there were some moments and hurdles, but nothing too drastic. Might be a fun beach read.Thanks to Montlake through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Everyone in the Meadowbrook community lived in nice houses, dressed well, had good jobs, were fairly wealthy. Behind closed doors, this place is a mess!Description:On the night of the annual Summer block party, the Meadowbrook community Facebook page lights up with posts reporting sirens descending on the desirable and exclusive cul-de-sac neighborhood on Alton Road. Bit by bit, the comments trickle in, some taking pleasure in their neighbors’ misfortune and others showing concern. The truth eventually comes out. It's not an accident, or a drowning, or a fire, as some had predicted. For the first time in forty years, there's been a murder in Meadowbrook.The residents of Alton Road—The Fox family, the core of the neighborhood but each with secrets of their own; the Adair Family, the seemingly perfect all-American family; the Thompson Family, on the brink of an explosive divorce; The Kumars, the mysterious ""new neighbors""; Brooke Bailey, the ""Black Widow""; and Gus Fisher, the quirky salesman— are entangled in a web of secrets and scandal unbeknownst to the outside world and even each other.Who was murdered at the block party? Who committed the murder? And why? As the night unfolds, the residents will discover that the real danger lies within their own block and nothing—and no one—is ever as it seems. Propulsive and layered, THE BLOCK PARTY will keep you guessing until the very last page.My Thoughts:Fast paced and shocking in the revelations as this story unfolds. It seems like everyone on the block has a secret: alcohol dependency, drug dependency, cheating, stripping, anger issues, lying, murder. Just pick one. I would really dislike having these people on Alton Road for neighbors. I would hate all the drama, but it's certainly fun to read about it. All the tension and drama led to an explosive conclusion and the events at the block party are simply shocking. I can highly recommend this book. Great characters and a great plot kept me turning the pages.Thanks to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The Description:College student Cassie Soul hasn’t spent an entire summer in Avalon Bay in years, not since her parents divorced and her mother spitefully whisked her away to Boston. Now that her grandmother is selling the boardwalk hotel that’s been in their family for five decades, Cassie returns to the quaint beach town to spend time with family, ring in her twenty-first birthday… and maybe find herself a summer fling.On her first night in town, she finds the perfect candidate: Tate Bartlett, Avalon Bay’s fun-loving golden boy.Tate, sailing instructor and lovable player, is no stranger to flings. In fact, he’s always down for a good time. But the moment he meets Cassie, he knows she’s not the girl you play games with. Cassie is gorgeous, hilarious, and, frankly, the coolest person he’s ever met. The last thing he wants to do is risk breaking her heart, and so he reluctantly puts her in the friend-zone… only to realize he made a huge mistake. Soon, his attraction to Cassie becomes impossible to ignore. He wants that fling now. Big-time.And maybe even something more.As Cassie and Tate walk the line between friends and lovers, they’re about to discover that their situation is the least complicated part of this equation. Because Avalon Bay is full of secrets—and their relationship might not survive when those secrets come to light.My Thoughts:This would make a great beach read. Cassie is a great character. She's smart, considerate of others, and has been faced with some difficult issues. Tate, Cassie's romantic interest, is also a great character: good-looking, responsible, fun-loving and has good character. Cassie's mom, Victoria, is an evil person who is easy to dislike. Cassie's Dad is much easier to like. The setting, Avalon Bay, seems like a picturesque beach town and I liked all the sailing adventures. The Beach Games were just pure fun.

Eva is so wrapped up in believing her family is cursed due to their name that I think she's making some of her own bad luck.

After accidentally burning down the venue of her twin Hanna’s anniversary party, Eva discovers that her sister’s luck has completely turned around since her wedding day.

This is a fun murder mystery with a great many suspects and the ending surprised me, so I had no clue until the end - just suspicions.Description:Sixty-year-old Jane Hunter, forced into early retirement from her job as a university librarian, is seeking a new challenge to keep her spirits up and supplement her meager pension. But as she’s about to discover, a retiree’s life can bring new thrills—and new dangers.Cameron “Cam” Clewe, an eccentric 33-year-old collector, is also seeking something—an archivist to inventory his ever-expanding compendium of rare books and artifacts. Jane’s thrilled to be hired on by Cam and to uncover the secrets of his latest acquisition, a trove of items related to the classic mystery and detective authors. But Jane’s delight is upended when a body is discovered in Cam’s library. The victim, heir to a pharmaceutical fortune, was the last in line of Cam’s failed romances—and now he’s suspect number one.Cam vows to use his intelligence and deductive skills to clear his name—but with a slight case of agoraphobia, rampant anxiety, and limited social skills, he’ll need some help. It comes down to Jane to exonerate her new boss—but is he truly innocent?My thoughts:Jane and Cam make a good investigative team as they gather information and puzzle out the clues to solve the mystery. Jane provides the wisdom of years of experience and Cam provides a dogged determination and a knack for puzzles. Jane seems to be able to make people talk, but Cam is kind of tactless when it comes to people and lives the life of a wealthy recluse. I enjoyed the investigation. When the victim is so disliked by so many, it provides a lot of avenues to investigate and each one has to be researched to eliminate the red herrings. Good plot.

It's an interesting romance with an artist suffering from face-blindness (which I had never heard of) who falls in love with two different men. Such a dilemma! She's a portrait artist and a finalist in a competition when she is afflicted with face blindness. How will she ever paint a portrait when she can't see the face?Description:Sadie Montgomery has had good breaks and bad breaks in her life, but as a struggling artist, all she needs is one lucky break. Things seem to be going her way when she lands one of the coveted finalist spots in a portrait competition. It happens to coincide with a surgery she needs to have. Minor, they say. Less than a week in the hospital they say. Nothing about you will change, they say. Upon recovery, it begins to dawn on Sadie that she can see everything around her, but she can no longer see faces.Temporary, they say. Lots of people deal with this, they say. As she struggles to cope―and hang onto her artistic dreams―she finds solace in her fourteen-year-old dog, Peanut. Thankfully, she can still see animal faces. When Peanut gets sick, she rushes him to the emergency vet nearby. That’s when she meets veterinarian Dr. Addison. And she’s pleasantly surprised when he asks her on a date. But she doesn't want anyone to know about her face blindness. Least of all Joe, her obnoxious neighbor who always wears a bowling jacket and seems to know everyone in the building. He’s always there at the most embarrassing but convenient times, and soon, they develop a sort of friendship. But could it be something more?As Sadie tries to save her career, confront her haunting past, and handle falling in love with two different guys she realizes that happiness can be found in the places―and people― you least expect.My thoughts:I was rooting for Sadie the whole way through this book. She faced some tremendous hurdles and there were many emotional moments. I loved her relationship with Joe, the guy from her apartment building.

They make a good crime-solving team with each of them bringing special skills to the table to solve murder investigations. There are multiple murders in this one, but common threads are found. The setting at the strip club was interesting, as well as the interactions with the homeless and the way both Matthew and Danbury reach out to help those in need. I liked getting to know more about Penn, Danbury's girlfriend. I've followed this series from the start and watched the author grow and become more confident. The writing as well as the characters have grown and this book showcases the maturity.

Harry is a great detective who has solved several big serial killer cases and is quite famous in Oslo for his successes. He has a serious flaw in that he is an alcoholic and doesn't bend to authority well.The Description:Harry has gone to Los Angeles to drink himself to death, in the wake of his life back in Oslo falling to pieces. He’s nearly managed to, but Harry has been helping an older film actress, Lucille, to get away from the grips of a drug cartel to which she owes one million dollars, and in return she’s given him shelter, company and a tailored suit.In Oslo, two girls have disappeared and been found murdered and one of the suspects is a well-known real estate magnate. Katrine Bratt wants to bring in the country’s foremost serial killings expert, but the idea of collaborating with Harry Hole is out of the question for the chiefs of police. The real-estate magnate under suspicion on the other hand wants to hire Harry as a private investigator to clear his name from the case. Harry declines, but that’s before the drug cartel takes Lucille hostage. If Harry achieves the task, the real estate magnate will award him a bonus enough to cover Lucille’s debt. He puts together a team consisting of a cocaine-dealing childhood friend, a corrupt police officer and a cancer-stricken psychologist. The drug cartel has given them ten days. The clock is ticking, and a blood moon has been forecast over Oslo.My thoughts:This book had a good plot and it was an interesting investigation. However, I found the parasite situation pretty far-fetched. It was also just gross. This wasn't my favorite Harry Hole book, but it was still good and I'm glad I read it. There were several red herrings that threw the investigation in the wrong direction and I didn't guess who the murderer really was until it became obvious near the end. Harry may have some new options in the future. I hope to find out what direction he turns next.Thanks to Knopf, Pantheon, Vintage, and Anchor through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Looks like I've been missing out, because I really enjoyed this one. I liked the Kate Burkholder character and think I will dive into some of the earlier books in this series.The Description:On a crisp autumn day in Painters Mill, Chief of Police Kate Burkholder responds to a call only to discover an Amish man who has been violently killed with a crossbow, his body abandoned on a dirt road. Aden Karn was just twenty years old, well liked, and from an upstanding Amish family. Who would commit such a heinous crime against a young man whose life was just beginning?The more Kate gets to know his devastated family and the people—both English and Amish—who loved him, the more determined she becomes to solve the case. Aden Karn was funny and hardworking and looking forward to marrying his sweet fiancé, Emily. All the while, Kate’s own wedding day to Tomasetti draws near...But as she delves into Karn’s past, Kate begins to hear whispers about a dark side. What if Aden Karn wasn’t the wholesome young man everyone admired? Is it possible the rumors are a cruel campaign to blame the victim? Kate pursues every lead with a vengeance, sensing an unspeakable secret no one will broach.The case spirals out of control when a young Amish woman comes forward with a horrific story that pits Kate against a dangerous and unexpected opponent. When the awful truth is finally uncovered, Kate comes face to face with the terrible consequences of a life lived in all the dark places.My Thoughts:I like that Kate Burkholder is compassionate and thoughtful as she goes about her duties. Also, that she takes her cases seriously and looks for alternative scenarios, not always accepting an initial reaction as truth. The setting in a mostly Amish community was picturesque. It was intriguing to follow Kate's attempts to mesh her life now that she is no longer Amish with her family who are Amish. The murder investigation was tense and exciting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery.Thanks to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for an advance copy.

It sort of sounded like Agatha Christie's And Darcy Coates is a new author for me, but I picked this book up because the description was interesting. It sort of sounded like Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, only more gory.Description:When Christa joins a tour group heading deep into the snowy expanse of the Rocky Mountains, she's hopeful this will be her chance to put the ghosts of her past to rest. But when a bitterly cold snowstorm sweeps the region, the small group is forced to take shelter in an abandoned hunting cabin. Despite the uncomfortably claustrophobic quarters and rapidly dropping temperature, Christa believes they'll be safe as they wait out the storm.She couldn't be more wrong.Deep in the night, their tour guide goes missing...only to be discovered the following morning, his severed head impaled on a tree outside the cabin. Terrified, and completely isolated by the storm, Christa finds herself trapped with eight total strangers. One of them kills for sport...and they're far from finished. As the storm grows more dangerous and the number of survivors dwindles one by one, Christa must decide who she can trust before this frozen mountain becomes her tomb.My Thoughts:It seems to me this book should be classified as horror rather than mystery/thriller, although I guess they all fit. I'm not usually too squeamish, but some of the scenarios in this book really got to me. The scenario with the tour group stranded in the Rocky Mountains in a snowstorm with no one around to help them and nowhere to run to was bad enough, but with one of the group probably a killer who could they trust? If you like gory, nightmarish stories, this one is definitely for you. The plot moves at a fast pace and had surprising twists and turns. It was well written and flowed well.

I had heard about The Tibetan Book of the Dead for years and found the title intriguing but I had never really investigated it, so I thought this book for beginners would give me a good overview of the 8th century text - and it did I think. The book is basically a set of teachings that will help a dying person pass from death to one of the bardos (the state between life and death) and into rebirth. I found the principles apply to any religion and could help anyone in their life of with their death. The teachings could apply to anything and stress compassion, wisdom, kindness and meditation so that you can live in the present and clear your thoughts to focus on what is happening now. Short prayers and mantras are given as well as examples of certain situations. I found the book enlightening. Certainly a different view of death than what I am familiar with.Thanks to Sounds True Publishing through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Each of them clutches a red rose.

As she traces her beloved sister’s handwriting, her heart breaking, Lexi swears she will not rest until this brutal monster is caught. Will the diary help her find him before Paige is killed?

As day breaks, the warden dive team recovers not one but two naked corpses: the dismembered man and the married woman with whom he was having an affair. Mike begins to suspect the swimmers' deaths were not a senseless accident but a coldly calculated murder. Alone among his fellow officers, Mike begins to sense the involvement of a trained professional, smarter and more dangerous than any enemy he has faced. As Mike and Stacey get closer to identifying the killer, their own lives are suddenly put on the line, leading to a confrontation designed to silence them forever.""Mike seems to be quite resourceful and has a good background of experience to draw on.

This book has themes of dealing with grief, the relationship of sisters, the relationship of mother and daughter, and the dream of living forever.Description:Beck Birsching has been adrift since the death of her mother, a brilliant but troubled investigative reporter. She finds herself unable to stop herself from slipping into memories of happier days, clamoring for a time when things were normal. So when a mysterious letter in her mother’s handwriting arrives in the mail with the words Come and find me, pointing to a town called Backravel, Beck hopes that it may hold the answers.But when Beck and her sister Riley arrive in Backravel, Arizona it’s clear that there’s something off about the town. There are no cars, no cemeteries, no churches. The town is a mix of dilapidated military structures and new, shiny buildings, all overseen by the town’s gleaming treatment center high on a plateau. No one seems to remember when they got there, and the only people who seem to know more than they’re letting on is the town’s enigmatic leader and his daughter, Avery.As the sisters search for answers about their mother, Beck and Avery become more drawn together, and their unexpected connection brings up emotions Beck has buried since her mother’s death. Beck is desperate to hold onto the way things used to be, and when she starts losing herself in Backravel and its connection to her mother, will there be a way for Beck to pull herself out?My thoughts:The people and the town are definitely strange. They are warned not to take their car into town. Everyone walks or rides bikes. There are no churches or graveyards. Everyone seems to have to go for ""treatments"". It just gave me kind of a creepy feeling. The writing was good and gave you a sense of place and I liked that. There was some tension building.

Alexis and Sam find a fixer-upper Cape Cod in an exclusive, wealthy neighborhood in a D.C. suburb and decide to buy it, even though it will stretch their budget and the house will need a lot of work.

This is the only books I've read in this series, but it could easily stand alone. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to guess which characters are appearing from the previous books, unless it is Detective Eric Bolton - and he may be it.The description:""Rowan Wolff was five years old when she, her brother, and their babysitter were kidnapped by a serial killer in the Pacific Northwest. The babysitter was murdered. Rowan was saved. Her brother was killed and buried in the forest, his remains never found. The convicted killer refuses to say where he buried the boy. Twenty-five years later, Rowan is committed to search and rescue with her faithful canine and is obsessed with finding her brother’s grave—and closure.Detective Evan Bolton thrives on unraveling tough cases, but his latest is disturbing. There’s another serial killer hunting in Deschutes County, Oregon, and the crimes are identical to those committed by the sociopath languishing in prison. Each victim is linked to Rowan. When skeletal remains of several bodies are exhumed in the forest, Rowan’s connection becomes more entwined and impossible to ignore.Rowan and Evan are determined to solve the case before someone else dies. And someone else will, as the truth about the past is unearthed.""This is a tense, dramatic read that kept me turning the pages late into the night. I really didn't want to put the book down until I found out how it would end. My heart broke for Malcolm. The kidnapper was horror personified. I have to say I stayed angry through much of the book. I loved the relationship Rowan had with her dog, Thor. I admired Rowan's resolve and her chosen profession of helping other after her ordeal. Detective Eric Bolton came across as a strong, sensitive man and an intuitive detective. Thanks to Montlake through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Spending summers there with her grandmother, Meredith finally felt safe and loved.Now she’s returning in disgrace. Her late ex-husband swindled investors out of millions of dollars and made Meredith a figure of scorn—though she knew nothing about his scheme. But she still has the beach cottage she inherited from her grandmother and half ownership of the local café. It’s a place to work and earn a little money. That’s if her cousin, Tori, will let her through the door. Once, Tori and Meredith were as close as sisters—until Meredith chose her neglectful parents’ expectations over their bond. Now widowed with a teenage daughter, Tori isn’t setting out a welcome mat for the woman who let her down so badly.While Meredith tries to make a fresh start, she is drawn to a mysterious writer renting the cottage next door. Liam Byrne’s kindness is a balm, though she worries he might not be so friendly if he knew who she was. But Liam has his own secret and a mission that will help Meredith confront her past—and maybe, claim a surprising future…My thoughts:This wasn't exactly the beachy read I was expecting, it was more about starting over, healing old wounds,and was somewhat emotional. Meredith had a lot to deal with after her ex-husband's terrible swindling of his investors and the suspicions cast upon her. Meeting Liam was so helpful to her and yet, his secret was another wound to her already damaged soul. I can't imagine being in the position Meredith was in nor how I would deal with it. The animosity of her cousin Tori was just more she had to deal with. I had to admire her just for getting up in the mornings and trying.

But when she finds her husband, Parker, has been cheating on her with his assistant, she retreats, with her thirty year-old daughter Caitlin for support, to her childhood home on Cape Cod, in Chatham. Caitlin has always been bright but directionless, looking for her passion but keeps coming up blank. And Jess needs to regroup with the help of good food and wine, the company of her best friend, Allison, and come up with a plan for the future.Allison’s career has hit a low. After twenty years as an editor for the Chatham magazine, circulation is dwindling and though her boss and long-time friend, Jim, does everything to keep her, she has no choice but to take a step back. With a career on hiatus and her main relationship being with Chris, her ex-husband who is still a good friend, Allison is at a pivotal point in life. Her daughter Julia opened her own artisanal jewelry shop a year prior, and she has the kind of day-to-day fulfillment Allison yearns for.When Allison stops into her beloved local bookstore one day and learns that the owner wants to sell, a long-held dream turns into a reality, thanks to Jess. Allison and Jess set a plan in motion and what was once a place that held warm childhood memories is now theirs to run. As the two friends, along with the help of their daughters, reopen the doors of the cherished bookstore and adjacent coffee shop to the community, they also open themselves up to the possibility of romance, the bonds of mothers and daughters, and the magic of second chances.My Thoughts:I loved the long-time relationship between Jess and Allison. The way they supported and complemented each other. I also iked the friendship that developed between their daughters, Julia and Caitlin. The setting in Cape Cod, Chatham was picturesque. Although taking over a bookshop is risky, this was an exciting change and I loved reading about the development of the bookshop and the changes they were making.

But when a member of the group finds herself shattered, everything they know about themselves will be called into question.My Thoughts:This was a good story, though a little slow in places.

Samuel Adler was six years old when his father disappeared during Kristallnacht—the night their family lost everything. Samuel’s mother secured a spot for him on the last Kindertransport train out of Nazi-occupied Austria to the United Kingdom, which he boarded alone, carrying nothing but a change of clothes and his violin.Arizona, 2019. Eight decades later, Anita Diaz, a blind seven-year-old girl, and her mother board another train, fleeing looming danger in El Salvador and seeking refuge in the United States. However, their arrival coincides with the new family separation policy, and Anita finds herself alone at a camp in Nogales. She escapes through her trips to Azabahar, a magical world of the imagination she created with her sister back home.Anita’s case is assigned to Selena Duran, a young social worker who enlists the help of a promising lawyer from one of San Francisco’s top law firms. Together they discover that Anita has another family member in the United States: Leticia Cordero, who is employed at the home of now eighty-six-year-old Samuel Adler, linking these two lives.Spanning time and place, The Wind Knows My Name is both a testament to the sacrifices that parents make and a love letter to the children who survive the most unfathomable dangers—and never stop dreaming.My Thoughts:This is a heart-wrenching novel dealing with immigrants rights, love, loss, hope and most of all, humanity. The story began in Vienna, 1938 where six-year-old Samuel Adler was forced to leave on the Kindertransport from Vienna to England without his parents during the Holocaust. He eventually was placed with a Quaker couple, but his original family was lost. I was heart-broken for Samuel.My heart broke again for seven-year-old, nearly blind Anita and her mother. They were at a hospital I was on edge during Anita and her mother's flight from El Salvador to the United States, a journey that was fraught with hardship. Then they were faced with Trumps's family separation policy which had just gone into effect in the United States. Then I rooted for Selena in her quest to help Anita. The timelines collide and I began to feel some hope for Anita's future as Selena teams up with Frank, a young attorney.I highly recommend this book for those who like journeys of courage.

Books that let a person walk through walls or manipulate the elements--books of magic that half-sisters Joanna and Esther have been raised to revere and protect.All magic comes with a price, though, and for years the sisters have been separated. Esther has fled to a remote base in Antarctica to escape the fate that killed her own mother, and Joanna's isolated herself in their family home in Vermont, devoting her life to the study of these cherished volumes. But after their father dies suddenly while reading a book Joanna has never seen before, the sisters must reunite to preserve their family legacy. In the process, they'll uncover a world of magic far bigger and more dangerous than they ever imagined, and all the secrets their parents kept hidden; secrets that span centuries, continents, and even other libraries . . .""The first half of the story was kind of slow, and somewhat confusing. I have to admit to getting lost a little. I found the characters interesting and felt sorry for Nicholas. I found the second half of the book much more interesting as things started moving along at a better pace. I liked both Esther and Joanna. I loved Joanna's interaction with the cat and trying to win it over. The 'mirror magic' was good.Thanks to William Morrow through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Then there's the grand reopening of Darla's Cafe, where the doors are thrown open to reveal . . . a dead man, stabbed in the back.

This book was full of action from the start and continued throughout the book with a chilling scenario and a woman on the run.The Description:Former Army brat Morgan Albright has finally planted roots in a friendly neighborhood near Baltimore. Her friend and roommate Nina helps her make the mortgage payments, as does Morgan's job as a bartender. But after she and Nina host their first dinner party—attended by Luke, the flirtatious IT guy who'd been chatting her up at the bar—her carefully built world is shattered. The back door glass is broken, cash and jewelry are missing, her car is gone, and Nina lies dead on the floor.Soon, a horrific truth emerges: It was Morgan who let the monster in. ""Luke” is actually a cold-hearted con artist named Gavin who targets a particular type of woman, steals her assets and identity, and then commits his ultimate goal: murder.What the FBI tells Morgan is beyond chilling. Nina wasn't his type. Morgan is. Nina was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. And Morgan's nightmare is just beginning. Soon she has no choice but to flee to her mother's home in Vermont. While she struggles to build something new, she meets another man, Miles Jameson. He isn't flashy or flirtatious, and his family business has deep roots in town. But Gavin is still out there hunting new victims, and he hasn't forgotten the one who got away.My thoughts:I couldn't put this book down. The scenario was a scary one and the way the killer operated seemed realistic and could have been cut from the headlines. Women are deceived all the time. I liked Morgan - she was a hard worker, seemed to be a good friend, and she definitely had courage. The plot was racy and well thought out. The tension built as the novel progressed.

When romance-fanatic Candice meets writer Alexis, she thinks her happy ending is finally on its way. He walks into her struggling Cornish surf school, and they hit it off straight away. Until she discovers that Alexis has been using their courtship as inspiration for the romantic novel he's struggling to write. When Alexis offers to bring her in on the deal if Candice helps him deliver a winning book to his publisher, she accepts, and along with Alexis' agent Daniel, they embark on a very unusual summer of love, as Candice tries to teach the men the recipe for a successful romance. But you can't have a great love story, without a great romantic hero. Will Candice find hers before the summer is over?My thoughts:The Cornish setting seemed like a nice place right on the beach. I liked Candice's entrepreneural spirit in starting her surf school on the side while she worked at the cafe.

Edwards, so I missed the first book of this series. The noir atmosphere of this book permeated throughout. It gave me the same feeling of the old Perry Mason novels, with his Girl Friday, Della Street.Description:1950, New York. Viviana Valentine–Girl Friday turned partner to New York’s top investigator, Tommy Fortuna–is drawn into a sordid new case when Buster Beacon, a wealthy man of science, beckons them to a party at his mansion north of the city. There, Buster entertains blue-blooded friends as well as investors keen to make a dollar on the many advancements made in his home laboratory, but he’s been hearing strange noises in the night coming from his expansive estate, and he doesn’t know who to trust.Once Viviana and Tommy arrive, the party is snowed in. And suddenly, there is a dead body and nowhere to hide. Who killed the disguised federal agent in their midst? And how have details from the top-secret lab become public? Once chomping at the bit to be brought into this mysterious life, Viviana wonders if she’s ready for the risks that come with the territory—risks that rise treacherously high as the killer targets the next victim.Set in the gritty, noir world of 1950 New York City, Emily J. Edwards’s Viviana Valentine Goes Up the River packs all the elements mystery fans love: an irresistibly clever protagonist, a posh cast of heroes and villains, and a murder case that could defy even the most seasoned investigator.My thoughts:This was a fun book. The investigation was interesting and the perpetrator was certainly not obvious. Viviana Valentine made me laugh. I liked her character and her partner, Tommy Fortuna. I enjoyed following the twists and turns of the investigation. The group stranded at the mansion had intriguing backgrounds that kept me wondering about them. The book was well-paced and the plot was a good mystery. I enjoyed the setting and the noir feel. The witty dialogue was humorous.

I was totally fascinated and engrossed in this book. The writing swept me far and away in its atmospheric prose. I had read Cronin's The Passage previously and it blew me away as well.Here's the description provided:Founded by the mysterious genius known as the Designer, the archipelago of Prospera lies hidden from the horrors of a deteriorating outside world. In this island paradise, Prospera's lucky citizens enjoy long, fulfilling lives until the monitors embedded in their forearms, meant to measure their physical health and psychological well-being, fall below 10 percent. Then they retire themselves, embarking on a ferry ride to the island known as the Nursery, where their failing bodies are renewed, their memories are wiped clean, and they are readied to restart life afresh.Proctor Bennett, of the Department of Social Contracts, has a satisfying career as a ferryman, gently shepherding people through the retirement process--and, when necessary, enforcing it. But all is not well with Proctor. For one thing, he's been dreaming--which is supposed to be impossible in Prospera. For another, his monitor percentage has begun to drop alarmingly fast. And then comes the day he is summoned to retire his own father, who gives him a disturbing and cryptic message before being wrestled onto the ferry.Meanwhile, something is stirring. The Support Staff, ordinary men and women who provide the labor to keep Prospera running, have begun to question their place in the social order. Unrest is building, and there are rumors spreading of a resistance group--known as ""Arrivalists""--who may be fomenting revolution.Soon Proctor finds himself questioning everything he once believed, entangled with a much bigger cause than he realized--and on a desperate mission to uncover the truth. The novel is stunning in its intensity and, I have to say, there were some things I didn't understand. Regardless, I was still mesmerized.

As seasons pass, supplies run out, and fending for himself grows more desperate, Remy sets out on foot, unprepared for the great unknown of civilization.He is found—near feral, silent, and terrified—in the small rural town of Blaire. To Anne, a nurturing mother of two adopted teenagers who’s still dealing with her own childhood rejections, Remy is not a lost cause. Just a challenging one. As Remy cautiously adapts to his new foster home, his family wants nothing more than to reassure him that he can trust the world. But to do so, they must first reexamine how much they trust the world themselves, and how much they should. As Remy’s journey into the real world begins, figuring out how to navigate it becomes a path they will have to learn to walk together.""Remy was so brave!

Her vlogs celebrate a happy home with her husband and their three foster children, Bethany, Mason, and Andrea. Everything is perfect until the day the family’s private plane plummets into the ocean. Only Kaylee manages to survive—with a shocking revelation: Andrea did it.This is particularly devastating for Nora McTavish, a child protective services agent who is already familiar with Andrea’s troubled history. Given Nora’s own traumatic childhood, how could she not have sensed the profound darkness festering within the girl? What did she miss? Could she have stopped Andrea?As Kaylee struggles to cope with the crushing loss, Nora’s investigation begins. But her guilt soon turns to unease. Secret by secret, Nora pieces together a Volk family puzzle that’s more twisted than anyone saw—one far from the picture-perfect life Kaylee sold to the public. And the closer Nora looks, the more disturbing it gets.My thoughts:Not a bad beginning of a series. Nora McTavish is a social worker for child protection services. She has some issues from her past she has to deal with herself, but she tries to help others due to her past. I did like the character. The plot centered around Kaylee Volk who is an influencer, and the social media aspect here is currently relevant although I wouldn't like my life posted all over the place for just anyone to see. The loss of her family was tragic and the plot was interesting to follow. The ending was kind of unbelievable though.Thanks to Thomas & Mercer through Netgalley for an advance copy.

In this book after a terrible flood leaves Bethany Richter hanging in a tree, lucky to be alive, after being swept into the river, she shares her story with Annie.

That is, until she arrives at the mansion to discover a dead body in a secret room—and that nothing is as it seems.Not only does the arms dealer not exist but the murder victim turns out to be Harry Lancaster, a man with mob ties who used to be in Witness Protection.

Harry’s friend on the police force, Cynthia Cooper, warns that the season can bring an uptick in crime. Her words prove tragically prescient when Harry and Susan discover the body of a man by the side of the road, dead, without any clues to his identity. One suspicious death is bad enough, but when Cooper reports that two more bodies have been found, also unidentified, Harry knows trouble is afoot. The autopsies for all three bodies reveal the presence of a deadly drug. Could their deaths have been accidental, or is a devious killer on the prowl?With help from her feline sidekicks, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, as well as Tee Tucker the corgi and Pirate, Harry vows to find the answers and stop the spate of deaths so that all of Crozet can have a very merry Christmas.""It always throws me that a girl is called 'Harry'. I know male names for females is common, but Harry just doesn't ever seem right for some reason (just my bias I guess). The two stories in the book have one in current time and one set in the 1700s.

The book is set in 1873, late in the Victorian era, when seances had become very popular and people had a general fascination with the occult and with talking to departed loved ones.Lenna Wickes' sister, Evie, has recently been murdered. Before her death she had been obsessed with everything surrounding seances, and had studied with an internationally known medium, Vaudeline, whose specialty is contacting those who have been murdered. Although Lenna doesn't believe in this nonsense, she goes to Paris and studies under Vaudeline as well in hopes of conducting a seance to reach her sister and find out who killed her. Then there is the murder of the President of the London Seance Society, an exclusive gentlemen's organization with a strong reputation for holding seances and contacting the deceased. However, lately there have been rumors that something is not right in the organization and some customers are dissatisfied.The story is told in the viewpoints of Lenna and Mr. Morley, a member of the London Seance Society. There are quite a few surprises in the book and I kept finding unexpected outcomes. I liked Lenna's persistance and bravery in pursuing her quest to find out who murdered her sister. Vaudeline was an interesting character. Ther rules for her seances were very elaborate - unlike those of the London Seance Society. The author's notes at the end of the book gave more details of her research and the basis for the story.

He wrestles with first love, abuse in the family, struggles with algebra, working for people in the town and building friendships, a tragedy, grief and loss. Arthur's romantic interst is Nola, but she's not ready to settle down with just one guy - she's in that experimental stage where she's dating and trying to find her own way. Arthur had a strong bond with his brother. He showed characteristics of thoughtfulness, compassion, and a readiness to help others. Everyone liked him - and so did I; very much. I truly enjoyed the time spent with this book. Elizabeth Berg is a talented author and I've liked most of what I've read by her. If you have read The Story of Arthur Truluv you will enjoy reading about the young Arthur.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group through Netgalley for an advance copy of this beautiful book.

This was a moving story about family, tragedy, and most of all love. The characters were wonderful and the writing was beautiful.The description:""William Waters grew up in a house silenced by tragedy, where his parents could hardly bear to look at him, much less love him. So it’s a relief when his skill on the basketball court earns him a scholarship to college, far away from his childhood home. He soon meets Julia Padavano, a spirited and ambitious young woman who surprises William with her appreciation of his quiet steadiness. With Julia comes her family; she is inseparable from her three younger sisters: Sylvie, the dreamer, is happiest with her nose in a book and imagines a future different from the expected path of wife and mother; Cecelia, the family’s artist; and Emeline, who patiently takes care of all of them. Happily, the Padavanos fold Julia’s new boyfriend into their loving, chaotic household.But then darkness from William’s past surfaces, jeopardizing not only Julia’s carefully orchestrated plans for their future, but the sisters’ unshakeable loyalty to one another. The result is a catastrophic family rift that changes their lives for generations. Will the loyalty that once rooted them be strong enough to draw them back together when it matters most?Vibrating with tenderness, Hello Beautiful is a gorgeous, profoundly moving portrait of what’s possible when we choose to love someone not in spite of who they are, but because of it.""The family rift was devastating. My heart broke for William's upbringing. There were many touching moments in the story. Julie's family was so exceptional and caring the way they initially took William in and made him part of their family. These were great characters. The book title came from the way Charlie Padavano greeted all of his four daughters - ""Hello Beautiful"". I would recommend this story to anyone who likes moving, family dramas.

This one is a riveting, heart-pounding thriller where the past rears up to destroy the people involved. The blurb: Twenty five years ago, Jenna, Donnie, and Nico were the best of friends, a bond forged as residents of Savior House, an abusive group home for parentless teens. When the home was shut down—after the disappearance of several kids—the three were split up.Though the trauma of their childhood has never left them, each went on to live successful, if troubled, lives. They haven’t seen one another since they were teens but now are reunited for a single haunting reason: someone is trying to kill them.To save their lives, the group will have to revisit the nightmares of their childhoods and confront their past—a past that holds the secret to why someone wants them dead.It’s a reunion none of them asked for... or wanted. But it may be the only way to save all their lives.These foster kids have all made something of their lives until all at once it seems someone is trying to kill them all. The pace was fast with lots of action and excitement. My heart went out to Jenna. I had more trouble relating to the alcoholic rock-star and the gambling addicted actor. I really felt sorry for the Judge.Highly recommended for those who like a good thriller! all of Alex Finlay's books have been good, so if you haven't delved in yet - give them a try.Thanks. to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I loved Defending Jacob and was excited to read this one. I was certainly not disappointed! The drama was gripping as the story of this family unfolded.The description: One afternoon in November 1975, ten-year-old Miranda Larkin comes home from school to find her house eerily quiet. Her mother is missing. Nothing else is out of place. There is no sign of struggle. Her mom's pocketbook remains in the front hall, in its usual spot.So begins a mystery that will span a lifetime. What happened to Jane Larkin?Investigators suspect Jane's husband. A criminal defense attorney, Dan Larkin would surely be an expert in outfoxing the police.But no evidence is found linking him to a crime, and the case fades from the public's memory, a simmering, unresolved riddle. Jane's three children--Alex, Jeff, and Miranda--are left to be raised by the man who may have murdered their mother.Two decades later, the remains of Jane Larkin are found. The investigation is awakened. The children, now grown, are forced to choose sides. With their father or against him? Guilty or innocent? And what happens if they are wrong?A tale about family--family secrets and vengeance, but also family love--All That Is Mine I Carry With Me masterfully grapples with a primal question: When does loyalty reach its limit?I couldn't put the book down. It sucked me in quickly and built slowly for the first half, then the second half was so emotional it kept me glued to the pages. The characters were fully depicted so they seemed real. The plot was masterful and drew on my emotions. My heart went out to little Miriam and I just wanted to hold her close. This a family drama, a coming of age story, a mystery and thriller all wrapped up in a perfect package.

It is haunting and many times gory, but the solid storyline is intricate and absorbing. Oh yes, there are definitely nightmares here. The premise is a doctor can take nightmares away from children and they will no longer have them. However, he captures the nightmares in a book. When the book is opened for a certain short period of times the nightmare contained in the book can escape and become real. There are those who have nightmares and a few who can take nightmares away. There is a creepy, old mansion with an even creepier asylum on the grounds to set the atmosphere.There are some really good characters here. I most liked Detective Mills and his daughter, Samantha. I ended up sometimes liking Ben Bookman, the horror author, but not always. I really liked Ben's daughter though. There are a lot of characters to keep up with, so I have to admit to sometimes getting a little mixed up. The history of the nightmares and how they are passed was really interesting.I recommend this to anyone who likes scary stories and can handle some chaotic gore. It gets gross sometimes.

I've read quite a few of her books and haven't been disappointed once. Lewis is 24 years old and has just lost his job as a software developer in Buffalo, New York. When he arrived home after getting laid off he found his boyfriend packing the car. He was leaving Lewis and heading to California without him. To make the day even worse his wheelchair-bound, curmudgeon of a neighbor, Chester Wheeler, made a homophobic comment. then the neighbor's daughter knocks on Lewis' door and asks if he would be a temporary caregiver for Chester since he has scared off all available caregivers and she needs to go home as her daughter is having a baby. Since he really needed the money and Chester is dying and needs help, Lewis agrees to help - temporarily. While taking care of Chester he finds out Chester has a Winnebago and a wish to travel to Arizona to see his ex-wife before he dies. After a lot of thought Lewis decides it would be no worse driving that it would be staying in Chester's apartment. This story is character driven and the characters are outstanding. I loved Lewis for the responsibilities he shouldered because he felt it was right and for his determination to do a good job. I kind of felt sorry for Chester, but am not sure I could have stood his constant verbal abuse.Many thanks to Lake Union Publishing through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I will certainly be looking for more of the books in this series. I truly enjoyed my time spent following Isabel Puddles on her first trip to England from her native Michigan. This is the first book I've read in this series, but had no trouble reading it as a stand alone.Apparently, Isabel Puddles is in her sixties and has solved several murders previously as an investigator. Isabel has been invited by her friend Teddy Mansfield aka Archie Cavendish, a mystery writer, to visit him in his home in Mousehole (pronounced Mow-zul) Cornwall. Of course there's a murder in Cornwall and Isabel's expertise is called upon to help solve it.There were some great characters in the book and my favorite, of course, was Isabel Puddles. I also really enjoy Tuppence, Mr. Mansfield's maid. The murder victim seemed to be a despicable person and was disliked by many making it difficult to determine who had the best motive to kill her. It was intriguing to follow the investigation's path. I enjoyed the controversy over the cooking contest.

I've enjoyed several of this author's books and was looking forward to this one.Susan Norcross lost her parents when she was fourteen. Their car was hit by a drunk driver. Susan was raised by her wonderful grandparents. Susan is now 40 years old, single, and runs the bookstore in a small town. She wants to meet her ""Single Kringle"" just like her parents and grandparents did and have a wonderful companion to share her life with. Both her mother and grandmother met men who were dressed as Santa Claus and married them and lived happily ever after. Susan wants that for herself. This book was filled with a love of Christmas by Susan and her entire family. It's definitely an appropriate holiday read. Finding the ""Single Kringle"" was a fun journey. I did find the book kind of repetitive though and thought it could have been much shorter - but overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it as a light, Christmas read.Thanks to Harlequin Trade Publishing, Graydon House through Netgalley for an advance copy.

Sylvie Pelletier tells the story of her life on Gilded Mountain. Sylvie was the daughter of a coal miner and the family were very poor. The conditions the miners were forced to endure in order to work were harsh. The threat of a union hung over the company's head and they were determined to put it down. Sylvie wrote an essay at school for a contest, which helped her get a job at the local paper. The paper was run by a woman with liberal views and who was trying to draw attention to the plight of the miners. Sylvie gets drawn into the union movement as she reports on accidents that happened at the mine for the paper. Then she was offered an opportunity to work for the wife of the mine owner.

I was happy to be able to read this new novel because I have loved some of John Irving's ealier works: A Prayer for Owen Meany, The World According to Garp and The Cider House Rules were all great books. John Irving turns 80 this year - what an accomplishment to be releasing a new novel at age 80! This tome is 912 pages and follows the life of Adam Brewster. I can't begin to explain this book, so you'll have to read the book blurb for a description. Suffice it to say the book is good, the characters are memorable and funny at times. There are ghosts in the story that some can see and others cannot. There are a lot of sexual politics and the characters are a mix of diverse gender identities. The book is character driven and the characters are fully developed so I felt immersed in their lives - and I think I have a better understanding of various gender identities because of that. This is not a traditional family Adam Brewster has spent his life with, but it is a family filled with love and caring. There is a screenplay within the book as well. One of the central themes was Adam's quest to find out who his father is and since his mother won't tell him, it's not an easy quest to undertake. This book is very long and at times repetitive.

This is her fourth novel and the books have gotten better with each book in the series. I’ve seen a lot of growth in this author and her prose is more relaxed and more enjoyable to read. The “punch” happens right off the bat. Matthew and CiCi attend her law firm’s annual Christmas Gala and as they are coming in, one senior partner punches another senior partner and then stalks off. Later, the senior partner who was punched is found dead in his office. Was this due to the punch that happened earlier, or did the partner die of natural causes? Matthew is suspicious that this is murder. Enter Detective Warren Danbury (who has been in all the books) who is also suspicious. Danbury talks Matthew into working with him on the case as a medical consultant. As the case is investigated, several possible suspects are considered and investigated. Could it be Kennedy Reynolds, the senior partner who did the punching? Or possibly Aubrey Bartles, who is in love with the dead partner’s wife? Or maybe even someone else.There’s a backstory going on in the book as well. Matthew and Cici had split up in an earlier book. They had different goals in life and had decided to call it quits. Cici had gone to London to work for a year and is back for the holidays. It’s pretty obvious that they both still have feelings for each other, but has something changed? Could they work things out?Although this is part of a series, Christmas Punch could easily be read as a stand-alone. It is certainly nice to have all the history though, so I would recommend reading the earlier books. Both the mystery and the backstory romance are enjoyable. As with all the Matthew Paine mysteries, the book is not filled with gory violence and there are no explicit sexual situations. It’s a good clean mystery somewhat like Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple stories. There is one quirky character, and that’s Detective Danbury who is known for his abruptness (I like this character). I liked Cici better in this book than in earlier books. She doesn’t come across as so hard-nosed and driven this time. Matthew, what can I say, I still can’t find a flaw in that man! He always comes across as the perfect guy: professional, kind, thoughtful, and principled. A family man. The book is well paced and kept my attention for the entirety.

Vincent provides a great deal of information about the circumstances that influenced certain books and how and where they were written. Also, what was happening in King's life during the period he was writing a particular book.There were also interesting details about King's life before becoming a famous author, as well as during his life as an author. It provided information on the diffent genres King has explored such as poetry and non-fiction. It shows how many of the monsters in the book were extrapolated from something that was happening in his life. Some of the other things King became involved in like the rock and roll band, promoting various new technologies, and the radio station were of interest as well.King's writing has been amazingly prolific and he's still writing. This book is timed to be published just prior to King's 75th birthday. King has written a huge number of books and has, in book book, achieved legendary status.The pictures and inserts in the book were relevant and provided insight into the books. The only thing I didn't like was that some of the colors in the book make parts of it difficult to read - hard on the eyes - like the red background with black text and the black background with white text - it just kind of strobes and made my eyes hurt.

I recognized the author's name immediately and that's one of the reasons I wanted to read this book. After reading it, I can't believe I've never read anything by this famous author. I truly enjoyed reading this - especially the John Corey character's humor. This grabbed me from page one and held me through to the end. Great character, great plot, great humor! Now I need to go back and read books 1 through 7. Corey is a former NYPD homicide detective, and an ex Federal Agent. There are people who want him dead - including the CIA. He is legendary. Fired from his last job with the Feds, Corey is staying at his uncle's beachhouse and his second marriage is on the rocks. While there he meets up with an old girlfriend, Detective Beth Penrose, as well as his old friend Max. They convince John to apply for a job with a private investigative company. He gets suspicious during the interview that there's something going on in the company other than investigations. He confronts Beth and is convinced to infiltrate the company and try to find out what is going on and expose it.There are definitely some offensive ideologies throughout the book, but fitting for the situation I think. The Corey character is a risk-taker who loves danger. He doesn't hesitate to make things happen and refuses to take things slow. This kept the book interesting and the tension building. The title is appropriate in more ways than one.Thanks to Scribner through Netgalley for an advance copy.

I loved his beautiful writing! This is the story of the life of one man, Roland, from childhood to his elderly years. It spans and shows the influence of many historic moments from the Cuban Missile crisis, to the fall of the Berlin Wall, to the Covid-19 pandemic. It also shows Roland's personal experiences and how they shadowed and influenced his life - an inappropriate affair, a short marriage, bringing up his son, finding love again, and all the deep feelings he feels and his observations of life. It is a deep dive into an entire life.Although I adored the writing and enjoyed reading about Roland's life, by the time I halfway through I was starting to get bored because there is no action and I think the book could have been shorter. However, I'm glad I read it and feel I can easily recommend it as a good read that people will enjoy.Thanks to Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group through Netgalley for an advance copy.

A group of friends who knew each other in grammar school gather every five years on Holy Island for a weekend together. Their first visit had been with their teacher. At the first five year revisit to this place, one of the friends died in a car accident, being swept away by the tide crossing recklessly to the mainland. In present day, the friends are getting rather old and one of them is murdered at their weekend gathering. This is where Vera and her team become involved.The history of this group was interesting and, of course, they all became suspects. There were other suspects as well. There were a lot of avenues to investigate and Vera's team stayed busy following all the leads. I've ready quite of few books in this series and have enjoyed them overall. Vera and her team work well together and each seem to have their own special expertise. I like the characters very much.

That said, I absolutely loved this book! Carrie Soto is a great character and this book is about more than sports. You might recall that Carrie Soto made a brief appearance in Malibu Rising.Carrie Sota has grown up in the tennis world from birth. Her Dad had been a tennis champion and he mentored Carrie as she grew up. Carrie lost her mother at a young age and focused her entire life on tennis where she rose to the top, breaking many records and now she is retired and is a legend. Seven years into her retirement a newcomer in the tennis world, Nicki Chan, threatens to beat Carrie's record. Carrie decides that's not going to happen and she starts training hard with her father to make a come-back and defend her record. The competitiveness, the rivalry and the need to win and dominate the sport are front and center in the novel. It puts you deep into the drama of life in competitive sports and gives you a feeling of being on the court and living the crushing defeat of failure and the exhilaration of winning. There is so much more to this book than tennis though - father-daughter relationship, finding your way and your identity, and trust and love. I found the book dramatic and entertaining; I didn't want to put it down. Carrie's determination to make a come-back was admirable and riveting.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The new minister, Micah St. Pierre, has just had his marriage proposal rejected publicly and his congregation is trying to matchmake.

Molly has discovered a childrens classic, The Strawberry Girls, and discovers the author lives nearby. She sets up a meeting with the author, Iona, to discuss a reading at the bookstore. While visiting Iona, a man is discovered dead in the garden. He seems to have fallen from the roof. However, something is suspicious about his death -why was he on the roof? what was he doing here? Molly's uncle had been working on the roof that morning but was gone when Molly arrived, having been on a break. Had he been involved? Also, on the same day one of Iona's daughters mysteriously disappears. Her daughter had been working on a nearby archological excavation. Had she been involved in the man's death? Has something bad happened to her? Molly also learns of a long ago death of Iona's husband, who died from a suspicous fall from a tower. Had his death been a murder? Could Iona be involved in both?This was definitely a fun mystery to follow. Molly keeps following clues and is determined to find out, at least, the missing girl, and to clear her uncle of the man's murder. She and her friends dig into every lead they can find trying to solve the mystery. I loved how the book The Strawberry Girls reflected on the present day story.

With the cover Mercuryt Pictures Presents, I thought it would be a story about the movie studio and the movie business. And it was to an extent. Regardless of what I expected (I should have read the blurb so I would have known - duh), the story was mostly about people who were cast together during World War II and their circumstances. Mostly about Maria Lagana, who left Italy during Mussolini's rule and her father's prison interment, and came to Los Angeles with her mother. Maria has a huge amount of guilt for her actions that caused her father's arrest.My favorite parts of the book were Nico Piccone's story and Anna, the miniaturist's story. I'm seeing a lot of five-star s and I'm sure the critics will love this book. Unfortunately, I can only give it three. The writing is beautiful and lyrical and the stories of the people who worked at Mercury Pictures were interesting. However, mostly I was bored and wanted the book to end. There seemed to be a lot of unnecessary padding that to me, seemed irrelevant. Thanks to Random House, Hogarth through Netgalley for an advance copy.

There was an incident surrounding Wickham Foster, who Georgiana was involved with, that would have gotten anyone else expelled ffrom Pemberley Academy. But due to Georgiana's family name, she was still there even though the other students ostracized her. Georgiana was determined to redeem herself in the eyes of her big brother Fitz and her former friends. She will become the perfect Darcy by following a plan to rebuild her reputation with the marching band, forget about Wickham and all his lies, and distract her brother Fitz by getting him to fall in love with his classmate, Lizzie. Nothing ever goes as planned and Georgiana is having difficulty with following through with being the perfect Darcy. She has to get a handle on this before she loses it all permanently, including the one guy who truly understands her and cares about who she really is.This was a fun YA read. Teenage angst and blowing things out of proportion is par for the course of growing up but there are some real reasons for it in Georgiana's case. Her rebellion just makes things more difficult for her. She struggles with her choices and tries to do what's right, but sometimes gets side-tracked. I think all teens deal with this to some extent - it's part of growing up and finding out who you are. I had some trouble really liking Georgiana though, but in the end I did.

The book is full of eye-popping action and yet philosophical and relevant questions are raised about the human dilemma and our quest to save our world.Logan Ramsey is part of a plan to save humanity set in motion by his mother, the genetic genius Miriam Ramsey. Logan works for the GPA (Gene Protection Agency) and during a raid he is infected by a virus that modified his entire genetic structure. After being pretty sick for a couple of weeks, it seems he has had no effect from the gene editing. Then about a month later he starts to notice various changes. ""The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy. Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost."" Logan is the only one who can stop what is happening, but in order to do so he has to become something other than himself. This is a thought-provoking book that deals with morality and what it is to be human. The consequences of having power and wielding it. The subject matter is well-researched and genetic engineering is definitely a difficult concept and had to be hard to make it readable. Terrific plot and great suspense made for a great thriller.

River was her husband's best friend, and when he appears in her bookshop it brings back all the questions surrounding her husband's death three years ago.I enjoyed the banter between River and Tess as well as Tess's friendship with her book club members. I also enjoyed the plot. This would be a great beach read. The romance is rocky and develops well.

I'm hoping there could be more, but I will continue reading whatever Charles Martin writes because I love his lyrical voice. This series has been full of the horrors of child slavery, amazing heroism and bravery, redemption and forgiveness, and most of all love. A sacrificial love that is deep and abiding. This book puts Bones (Murphy's mentor) and his twin brother who is evil to the core in the forefront. Although Murphy had come near death in his last rescue mission, he has no choice but to try to stop Bones' brother.This book is tense and emotional. I think anyone wanting to read it should read The Water Keeper and The Letter Keeper first to get the background on Murphy and Bones. Their history is important to fully understand the relationship and what drives them. Gunner the dog is a hero too and is always present; he's a great character too. The philosophy taught by Bones and followed by Murphy runs throughout the book and in central to the story.Thanks to Thomas Nelson--FICTION through Netgalley for an advance copy.

In this novel three sisters, Georgie, Iris, and Nola (the GIN Sisters) grew up in Ballycove, Ireland. They lost their mother when Nola was still very young and the sisters came together protectively and made promises to always take care of each other. But then through some perceived betrayals they fell apart and didn't stay in touch or speak at all for years. Then their father died and they came back to bury him. His will had some difficult stipulations. Can they put their differences aside and come together as family? Forgiveness is a very difficult thing when hurt is so great.This was a well-written family drama. I felt I understood each of the characters well.

The evil characters are extremely powerful and knowledgeable. They are as determined to end the world as those on the ""good"" side are to save it.The world is full of scrivings (programs written on objects and embedded in people) that control actions and can be 'twinned' to allow them to work together.

This one was a very complicated case with many characters and suspects. It is a chilling tale that is a police procedural, but also a psychological thriller. It was definitely a page turner for me from beginning to end.It begins when DCI Jonah Sheens is at a local pub enjoying the afternoon and watching his infant daughter when a girl appears walking toward the pub. She's a 16-year-old red haired girl who is covered in blood. Turns out she is the oldest of two missing sisters, Keely. She refuses to tell where her 14-year-old sister Nina is and won't tell where the blood came from. At the police station, she begins a long story of things that have happened to these two girls who are missing from foster care, from the time they went into the system. She refuses to be hurried, but drops clues during the telling which the detectives are hurrying to try to figure out in order to save Nina before they are out of time.Keely seems to be a manipulative, damaged child and, though trying to believe her, evidence doesn't support a great deal of her descriptions of several horrifying events the girls have supposedly endured. There are many twists to this story and a lot of surprises. I loved following the drama play out. I wondered whether Keely even wanted to help find Nina or wanted her dead. The same characters on Jonah's team are back in this book and each of the team seems to be dealing with their own problems as well as trying their best to solve this case. My favorite characters in this series are Jonah and his co-worker DC Juliette Hanson.

I grabbed this book, even though I hadn't read anything else in the series, mainly because it is set on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. I'm a North Carolinian and enjoy reading books set in my home state when I get the chance. Lucy and Connor, who are engaged, have been lucky enough to buy one of the historic cottages on the beach at Nags Head, NC know as one of the ""unpainted aristocracy"". They have a lot of work to do to renovate the house while both working their regular jobs. Lucy works at a library set in Lighthouse and she used to live on the premises as well before moving in with Connor. Connor is the town Mayor and is also a dentist. Connor and his Dad are doing most of the renovations themselves, while Lucy is working on wedding planning and decorating the house. The house has a somewhat disturbing history and rumors of a ghost who haunts the premises. Lucy and Connor both dismiss the idea of a ghost. Then there are some unsettling occurrances where Lucy hears things in the house, sees someone watching her from the window, and then a man is found murdered in the house. Something is definitely wrong and Lucy begins asking questions and ""investigating"".This was a fun, cozy mystery. I like the setting, but there's not a lot of description of the area. There is some discussion of the history of pirates and rumrunners at the Outer Banks. I enjoyed the way the community came together during times of trouble with a helpful attitude.

Zeus is in charge, of course, but the land is ruled by a group of thirteen gods. The plot is mostly focused on a competition for the role of Ares, who will have a place at the table. Helen, Achilles and Patroclus are all contenders in the competition and there are many power plays going on. There is also subplot with the politics and threats going on in the land.

Essie is a recluse and most people she employs don't last very long. But for some reason Essie seems to like Liv and talks regularly with her.

I always enjoy her books and grab new ones when I can. This book centers on three women, Mikki, Bree and Ashley whose paths crossed at just the right time to enter a business relationship that benefitted all three. They share business space and their ventures support each other. Bree has a bookshop, Mikki a gift shop and Ashley a bakery. Each of them is at a different stage in life and has their own issues to deal with; however, they provide guidance and support to each other in both business and their personal lives. Bree grew up in a household with cold, indifferent parents and she had a previous romantic relationship that, combined with her upbringing, left her with trust issues. Ashley is living with her boyfriend Seth and is completely in love. She's just waiting for him to propose and can't wait to get married and seal their relationship. Mikki has been divorced for three years, has to children who are almost grown, and has a great, amicable relationship with her ex. She feels she is at a point where she needs to get back to finding a new relationship.Following these women traverse their issues was fun. The women gave each other strength and provided caring and advice to each other. Their support of one another was heartwarming and I think everyone wishes for such great friends in their lives. The novel was character driven and the characters were realistic and likable.Thanks to Harlequin Trade Publishing, MIRA through Netgalley for an advance copy.

It was with sadness that I read of Riley's death last year in the forward by her son. This book is being published posthumously and is the only police procedural/crime novel undertaken by the author. No surprise - it is well written!The book centers on a death in Fleat House at St. Stephen's, a boarding school in Norfolk. Murder can't be ruled out, and Jazz Hunter, who had left her police career in London, reluctantly agrees to lead the investigation. Concerns grow as the investigation progresses. It becomes more complex when a young student disappears and a classics master is found dead.This was suspenseful and secrets were revealed along the investigation that kept me reading and interested. The book didn't need to use violence and horror to provide a good story. The mystery was similar to a ""cozy"" type.

Tess becomes involved in a murder investigation, Bigfoott has been spotten in the woods near the cabin, and the Sheriff is very much like the lead character in Tess's thriller series, Detective Gonzales.The book was fun from the beginning. Tess is a likable character who knows much about murder. She is impulsive and inquisitive and takes things too far sometimes. She also daydreams about plots, sometimes at inappropriate times, and imagines scenarios that may or may not pan out. Gertie is a likable, precocious fourteen-year-old - very smart and helpful.

This book explores an intergenerational relationship between Steward Little (Stewie) and an elderly woman, Marilyn.Stewie is the village provider of fresh eggs. He's taking care of the chickens his grandmother left when she died and sells the eggs to help his family. He loves those chickens! Stewie lives with his brother and his older sister. He never knew his parents as they died in a crash when he was just a baby. After losing his grandmother too, he is a very sad 11 year old. He meets Marilyn while selling his eggs. Marilyn is kind of prickly, like his grandmother, and she reminds him of her. Even though she is off-putting, Stewie develops a relationship with her. Marilyn has some secrets and she is in hiding, staying with a woman and her child. She lives there and babysits the child while the mother is at work. The story is touching and I fell in love with Stewie. He's a wonderful boy and needs to find his place in life. This is a coming of age story as well as a story of love, loss, and grief.

The main character, Hattie Kavanaugh, makes a living restoring houses - working at her father-in-law's company. She is a widow who sunk all her savings into a money pit of an old house and she loses her money and her confidence. Then she gets an opportunity to star in a reality tv show with a handsome male lead - she just has to scrape together enough money to buy a house in need of restoring for the show and hopefully, make some money both on the show and the house.

I also really enjoyed her love for Savannah and her unwavering work ethic. I despised one character and I won't say who because I'm sure you will despise the same one.

Annie has graduated college and returned to her hometown in Texas. While she's trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, she works as a waitress. A waitress she's been working with disappears after a bonfire party, and Annie is drawn to the mystery of finding out what happened to her. Her grandfather, who is a retired sheriff, is now a private investigator. Annie teams up with her grandfather and his partner to find out what happened to the waitress. There are some interesting twists and turns to this story and a few diversions in the investigation. I liked the book and if there is another in the series (sounds like there may be) I would like to read it. I did not guess the ending on this one, so it was a surprise.

The writing gave me a feeling like I was there, especially the detailed descriptions of the long dance marathons that went on for extended numbers of days and the dancers slept on their feet. The descriptions of the hopelessness of the people, the political rivalry between Hoover and FDR, and the Dust Bowl captured the climate of the times.

It is set in both Europe and Canada, and there are two timelines: 1918 and present day. The 1918 timeline is riveting and was my favorite part, and the present day timeline is interesting as well.The present day timeline has Cassie, a museum curator in Canada, approached by a man who has bought a house in the area. He had knocked down a wall and found a hidden room full of 100-year-old liquor that has a small bluebird on the label. The house happens to be the house that Cassie grew up in and she wants to find out why the liquor was hidden in the wall. There's a mystery here to be solved.The 1918 timeline is dramatic. Adele Savard, a brave woman has volunteered as a nurse and ends up in Belgium working in a hospital taking care of soldiers who are sick and injured during World War I. These nurses, mostly nuns, are called ""Bluebirds"" by the soldiers because of their blue uniforms. While there Adele meets Jerry Bailey, a fellow Canadian, whose face was badly injured while he was working as one of the men digging tunnels under enemy lines and planting explosives. Adele and Jerry are very attracted to each other, but after and extended recovery, Jerry was sent back to digging tunnels. After the war Adele returns to Canada. She thinks about Jerry, but doesn't know if he made it out alive. However, they cross paths later and get together. Jerry had returned from the war with his brother, John, to find their parents both dead from the Spanish flu. Jerry and John become part of the lucrative, illegal rumrunning business during Prohibition, running liquor from Canada to the United States. (I didn't know Canada had Prohibition too!)This was a page-turner and I found it exciting and filled with action. The writing was delightful!

Parts of the book are given to conversations among characters buried in the town cemetery where the residents there feel their purpose is to look after the people in the town. The chapters start with notes by Ernest Harold Baynes, the ""real life Doctor Doolittle of New Hampshire"" (he was a famous naturalist who kept wild animals as pets). Baynes' fox and bear companions were entertaining stories. The story is mostly about family, but brings forward addiction and the opiod crisis and their effects. Emma was born with a gift of healing and the entire town knows about it. But she left home when she grew up and has just returned to help take care of her father, who has dementia. She has since lost her gift and cannot be expected to heal her father. Emma's best friend, Crystal has disappeared and Emma's father has been searching diligently for her. Emma and Crystal had become estranged and hadn't spoken in years, but Emma still feels the pull of their friendship and becomes involved in the search for Crystall through her father. This is a mystery to be solved.This story has enough humor to keep it from getting bogged down in the sadness of the dementia, the addiction, and the missing friend. The cemetery crew was fun and a nice paranormal touch.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through Netgalley for an advance copy.

The community seems welcoming, the leader is charismatic, and Alex is somewhat attracted to him. There are some very unsettling things happening at the house Alex is living in though, and Alex is afraid for her children's safety. And there are rumors of a witch.Renee lived on a farm with her husband Michael and her son Gabriel. Some creepy things happen and then Gabriel disappears. No one knows if he's dead or alive, if he was kidnapped, killed, or ran away. This farm is later the site of the ecovillage, Pine Ridge.A chilling tale with good tension building.

I do love a book with humor. This book reminded me of the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory.The story is set in the 1950s and early 1960s. Elizabeth Zott is working at Hastings Research Institute at a job for which she is over-qualified. She is not liked by the all male chemists because she is brilliant and many times makes them look bad, and is not liked by the women because she is attractive. They refer to her among themselves using a couple of derogatory nicknames. Elizabeth refuses to bow to anyone's preconceived expectations of what a woman should be and stands her ground when she feels she is wronged, regardless of social norms.Elizabeth meets the famous chemist, Calvin Evans, when she is swiping his beakers (because they wouldn't buy her needed equipment). Calvin came to the Hastings Institute not because it was the best place to work or because they paid him a lot, but because the weather in the town, he was told, was good for rowing. Calvin liked very much to row, but he hated rain. Anyway, through a few interesting meetings, Calvin and Elizabeth get together. I was rooting for Elizabeth throughout the book.

This is the 7th book in the Scottish Bookshop Mystery. I've read several of these and enjoyed them. This one involves an arsonist and a murder, and I have to say it kept my attention.Delaney Nichols and her co-worker Hamlet, booksellers at the Cracked Spine bookshop, were invited to a Burns night dinner (celebrating the famed poet Robert Burns). It is an exclusive group and Delaney can't figure out why she was invited. At the dinner it becomes clear that she was tricked into coming to alleviate a long-term beach of friendship between her boss, Edwin, and one of the invitees who thinks Edwin burned down his bookshop twenty years ago after a disagreement. These two had once been best friends. Delaney and Hamlet leave, and later find that the Burns House, where the dinner was held, burned down after they left and a body was found there. Hamlet is accused of the crime and Delaney is determined to prove his innocence.There turns out to be several mysteries here and it makes for a fun read trying to solve them (which I didn't).

He's perfect in the role of a crime novelist as he delves into the mystery of what is happening in the neighborhood. There are a few murders, some may be suicides, a mob character, and an affair that may be connected. I didn't guess the bad guy/guys ahead of time. The book was absorbing and a quick read.Thanks to Thomas & Mercer through Netgalley for an advance copy.

It is bordering on, but not quite, a ""cozy"" mystery. I enjoyed the first book, Dead Spots, and it made me want to follow this new author, so I was glad to pick this one up. It's a quick read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries without graphic gore and excessive violence.Matthew Paine is a physician living in Peak, North Carolina, a small town outside of Raleigh. He had developed a friendship and working relationship with Detective Danbury in the first book, and Danbury calls Matthew to assist when a local resident is found dead. Circumstances surrounding the murder start Danbury and Matthew into an interesting investigation that leads them into a more extensive situation than the murder of one man.The characters are good, although I keep looking for a flaw in Matthew - he just seems a little too perfect and wonderful. We all have flaws - there's got to be something! I enjoyed Danbury's very distinctive speech in conversations. He speaks in short staccato sentences that are a little disconcerting, but suit the character. Cece, Matthew's ex-girlfriend, is back in this book, but she is in London for about a year working for a client so her appearances are by phone. From the ending, it looks like there will be another adventure for Matthew Paine in the near future. I'm looking forward to the next installment in this series....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 08, 2022","Feb 11, 2022","Feb 08, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59618671-prefer-death

Her daughter has turned into bridezilla and is demanding to be married at the home - which just isn't going to work. Her son is eighteen and won't even discuss college.

That's quite a bit to deal with and Greta grapples with all of it on a cruise to Alaska with her father, a trip he had planned to take with his wife. There was a lot in this book I could relate to, especially dealing with a mother's death. The loss of a parent throws the remaining family into grief and turmoil and it changes lives and leaves a hole that can't be filled. Also, Greta's career goals are conflicting with her romantic relationships and I think this is a theme many deal with at some point.

The world as we know it has ended. A global nuclear attack has occurred and the people left are in chaos. Victoria Emerson, a former congresswoman, and two of her three sons have ended up in a town called Ortho and Victoria, with her organizational skills, has provided some leadership and structure to the town as people try to rebuild without electricity and technology. There is a steady influx of new people to the town and then some boats arrive with a group of National Guardsmen who intend to steal the town and its resources for themselves.

Lost Coast seemed a mystery, and Literary calls to the book lover in me. The story is charming and drew me in quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the characters, especially Emily Bryant, the main character. There's also a paranormal theme running through the book that kept my interest. Emily is faced with a life-changing choice when her grandmother dies and leaves her the beautiful Victorian family home. The will has stipulations that draw Emily from her book editing career in New York, to the lost coast in Cascata, California to a family she doesn't really know and has felt all her life had abandoned her.

The victim was a young man, naked and unrecognizable. The conscientious moving guys called the police and this seemed a simple accident. Except there's something else - blood is found nearby. Does it belong to the victim? Did something happen to him before the moving truck hit him? What else is going on? This was a complex crime that unfolded slowly as clues turned up.

I was so engrossed in this story I literally had to pry myself away from it to take care of other things I had to do when all I wanted was to read more. The story is set in several places: the Caribbean, Great Britain, and America. The story begins at the end. Eleanor Bennett died in California and her attorney asked Eleanor's two children, Byron and Benny to come to his office. Eleanor had left an audio recording for her children to listen to in the presence of the attorney. Byron had stayed close to his mother, but due to an earlier rift in the family, Benny had been estranged from her family for eight years and had not even shown up for her father's funeral! But she did show up this time to listen to the recording.The book moves back and forth between present and past as Eleanor tells the story of her life, things her children never even suspected. So many secrets revealed - some shocking and heartbreaking. Yet Eleanor kept a positive attitude and she and her husband brought the children up well - wanting only the best for them and providing them with strong values and an excellent education. The black cake is something from Eleanor's childhood that her mother made and Eleanor had carried the recipe with her throughout her life and shared making this special cake first with her mother, then with another woman who took care of her as a child, then later with her daughter. It was very special and was almost revered.The characters are well formed and flawed. I would describe the story as deeply introspective.

Tess Montgomery is a pastry chef, but her family's bakery only makes and sells breads and her mother refuses to allow any changes in their offerings - even though they may need changes in order to stay afloat Leo Castorini, the son of the restaurant owner next door, has been in New York for years working in finance, but has come back to town to help his family. However, Leo's father refuses to make changes to the restaurant or the menu, even though Leo has some great ideas to help the restaurant survive.Leo and Tessa are each facing the very similar problem of stubborn parents who don't like or want change. They were very competitive in high school and of course, there is the feud, so that stands between them. Even though they hate each other, Leo proposes a plan to work together that might just save both businesses: ""Tessa and Leo marry, live together for six months, and then go their separate ways. Easy peasy."" This was an interesting, crazy concept and I couldn't wait to see what happened - even though I figured from the outset a romance would develop.

Michael is a teacher in London who finds it more and more difficult to function normally. He is grown, but still lives with his mother. He is wrapped in despair and becomes increasingly hopeless. He resigns his job, takes all his life savings, and goes to America, the land of the free, to travel until his money runs out, and then he plans to die, thinking then he will finally be at peace. His travel journey is interesting and he has some adventures and meets interesting people, even finds some romance. Michael must decide if life is worth living.This is a sad, depressing book; however it is written in beautiful prose. Bola has published poetry previously and I'm sure that carries over into this novel. Michael's story is told in two timelines that go back and forth from London to America - it shifts back and forth with no dates, so I had trouble with the disjointedness.

This is the second in the Finlay Donovan series and I enjoyed the first one so much I was happy to get my hands on this one. Finlay is a recently divorced single mother of two. She's a struggling author dealing with writer's block and is working on what I think is her second book that involves murder and a hot police officer as a love interest (from the first book) and also, a hot attorney. Her live-in nanny, Vero (Veronica), is also her best friend and sidekick. This adventure deals Finlay discovering an online women's forum where someone has posted a subtle message that sounds like someone wants Finlay's ex-husband, Steven, dead and is willing to pay a hundred grand to anyone willing to get rid of him. Finlay and Vero try to investigate under the radar and also keep the two children away from Steven while he is in danger. Finlay and Vero get into some really hairy situations during their investigation, and the tension builds. It would really be good to read the first in this series in order to understand and appreciate this second book. It could be read as a stand alone, but I really don't recommend it.

I've loved most of the books she's written, and this one is no exception. The book is told in two different timelines, 2010 and 1965, and the past has definitely intruded on the present.In 2010, Kayla and her 3-year-old daughter, Rainie, are soon moving into the house she designed with her husband, Jackson, who tragically died while the house was being built. Kayla is ambivalent about moving into this dream home she and her husband worked so hard on because it won't be the same without him and because he died there. A mystery woman came to Kayla's office and tried to talk her out of moving into the house. She was threatening and warned Kayla to tear the house down or sell it, and that bad things would happen if she moved in. Kate goes ahead with her move with some trepidation. Sure enough some bad things start happening. What is going on?In 1965 Ellie is a pharmacology student at UNC-Chapel Hill with her best friend Brenda. Brenda gets pregnant and marries. Ellie wants to finish school, she doesn't want the same life as Brenda, and her boyfriend Reed is supportive. Ellie, during summer break, becomes involved in the SCOPE project where white students, the majority from Northern states, work to educate black residents about their right to vote and to encourage them to register. President Johnson is soon to sign the Voting Rights Act which will allow black citizens to vote. During this time, the students will live in the black community and stay with black families. Ellie sees first-hand the horrendous living conditions, the lack of electricity, running water, a decent wage - true poverty. She is resolute in her belief that being able to vote will allow conditions to improve, and she is determined to help make that happen. Ellie also becomes involved in something else that triggers tragic events.This book is heartbreaking. The themes are prejudice and racism, friendship, betrayal, hope, healing, and grief - all told in a sensitive and caring manner. I couldn't put the book down. I had not been aware of the SCOPE project, and learned a great deal. I shudder at some of the occurrences in this story, knowing that similar events actually did happen during the 60's while integration was happening and civil rights was front and center both politically and socially. The sad thing is that racial prejudice still exists today. I hope that someday people can put aside differences and just see each other as fellow human beings who can live peaceably together and treat each other the same.Thanks to St. Martin's Press through Netgalley for an advance copy.

At the start of the book Kate is called out to an indecent exposure incident at Tamara Callaghan's house. Tamara is a famous crime author. Then, after a book signing, every one of Tamara's books in the bookstore is destroyed and a message left by the perpetrator. This looks like a very personal attack. It seems Tamara has a stalker. Then, the flasher is found hanging in an old barn. It seems this stalker is a murderer.The book started off a little slow, but quickly got my interest. I enjoyed this crime thriller and raced through it to see what would happen. Kate has some help from a surprising source when she gets into some very scary situations where her life is threatened.

When you have an adorable quirky character and a mystery with some surprises, it's a treat. Molly Gray is absolute perfection as a maid, and is charmingly delightful. The plot kept my attention throughout and the book was well paced. I think this would make a great movie - or even a series with the adventures of Molly Gray in the fancy hotel. The story is told solely from Molly's point of view and is centered around a wealthy man who is murdered in his bed and Molly finds him. Molly loves her job as a maid and loves cleaning, returning each room ""to a state of perfection."" She has a crush on the bartender at the hotel. Molly is different than most people - she takes everything literally, she doesn't ""get"" jokes, she speaks formally - like an older person, and she says exactly what she thinks. She never quite fits in socially. This book was great entertainment. I was very surprise to find it is a debut novel for the author.

World War II is not the central focus, but is more of a backdrop for the story which is more about friendship, family, and prejudice. Steven Katz, son of a prosperous landowner, has made friends with three boys who all share a very different background than Steven: Ollie, Nick, and Suki (Itsuki). Steven is put in some very difficult situations that no one his age should ever have to deal with. And while the focus is on Steven, all three of the other boys have huge problems facing them as well. This was both a heartbreaking and heartwarming story. The book kept me riveted.

I've read quite a few of his crime novels. Kate Marshall has recently started a private detective agency with her friend and partner and Tristan Harper. They have their first major case when they are hired to find a missing journalist, Joanna Duncan. She disappeared 12 years earlier and the police have closed her case. There are not many clues to be found. But Kate and Tristan delve in and sift through the police reports and start interviewing people who knew Joanna. Following the few threads they find something much bigger than the journalist's disapperance.Kate is a great detective character as a former police detective with a great deal of experience and a reputation for solving serial murders. Tristan had worked with her in the previous book and has gone part-time at his job so that he can work at the detective agency as much as possible.

So far this is my favorite book in the series - it just gets better and better. The ending kind of floored me because it really didn't wind things up.

The murder is just an unthinkably grisly one and, of course, Natalie is drawn into the case. Unfortunately she is really burnt out due to a couple of previous sensational murder cases.

The book is certainly timely and delineates many facets of the COVID-19 pandemic through perfect characters. I couldn't put the book down and hated for it to end. Jodi Picoult's beautifully descriptive prose allows you to feel like you can see the surroundings and experience the feelings of the characters. Diana and Finn are living together and getting ready to travel to one of their bucket-list destination, the Galapagos. Just before they leave Finn finds out he can't go because he will be needed at the hospital as they are dealing with an increasing number of patients with something unknown that leaves them struggling to breathe. They have a lot invested in this trip, so Finn insists that Diana go without him.When Diana arrives she's on the last ferry to Galapagos and then it is shutdown due to the COVID pandemic. She is stranded. Her luggage was lost. The hotel is closed. The town is closed. The ferry has shut down. Very limited cell service. How in the world will she get back home?Finn, even though he is a surgical resident, is doing his best taking care of COVID patients. We see through his eyes what the physicians were seeing in the New York City hospitals. Through his emails to Diana we get a feel for the heartbreak and devastation of the disease.A poignant and relevant novel that captured me from the beginning to the end.

Of course I wanted to read a book about Jimmy Page - only this isn't a biography or a non-fiction book like I assumed. It is a beautiful book about a young girl growing up in North Carolina. Here's the blurb:""The unraveling of eighteen-year-old Luna Kane’s haunted past begins in the winter of 1988, when her dying great-grandfather, a self-proclaimed faith healer, claims he hears phantom owls crying in the night. “Them owls, like music. Can you hear the music?” he implores her in his final moments, triggering Luna’s repressed memory of her dead mother’s obsession with Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin’s legendary guitar wizard. Desperate to learn the truth about her mother’s suicide, to tease fact from family lore in order to weave her own personal narrative, Luna embarks on a pilgrimage from her family’s farm in the pines of eastern North Carolina to England, to search for the man whose music her mother held sacred, Jimmy Page.""Luna's an interesting character. She faced hardship and loss early in life and her journey to find the answers to her questions is fascinating. I loved her determination to reach her goal, regardless of what she finds and the lengths she went to achieve it. I liked the nostalgic feel to the story and the lyrical writing.

The second reason I wanted to read this This was an obvious choice for me to read since I enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See so much by this author. The second reason I wanted to read this book was because the title intrigued me. I had never heard the express ""cloud cuckoo land"" so I looked it up and found the meaning in Wikipaedia: ""Cloud cuckoo land is a state of absurdly, over-optimistic fantasy or an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. Someone who is said to ""live in cloud cuckoo land"" is a person who thinks that things that are completely impossible might happen, rather than understanding how things really are.[1] It also hints that the person referred to is naive, unaware of realities or deranged in holding such an optimistic belief.In the modern world, a ""cloud cuckoo lander"" is defined as someone who is seen as ""crazy"" or ""strange"" by most average people, often doing or saying things that seemingly only make sense to themselves, but also exhibit cleverness at times in ways no one else would think of.[2]"" The term originated from the Greek comic dramatist Aristophanes (450 - 385 BC) in 'The Birds'.This book encompasses that meaning with four stories set across four time periods. The book moves back and forth between the characters' stories, and each is fascinating. The stories are of Anna, Omeir, Seymour, Zeno, and Konstance, and each is very different yet alike in that they are all outside of mainstream society and they all have their own dreams.

It is set in North Devon and Detective Matthew Venn and his crew are called to the scene of a murder at the home of a group of artists. The man who died, Dr. Nigel Yeo, had been stabbed with a piece of glass from a vase made by the resident glass blower, his daughter, Eve. I like Matthew Venn as a character for his strong work ethic and interrogation skills. His husband, Jonathan, is an interesting guy and is artistic, calm, and caring - and he cooks too which is nice. Both Jenn and Ross are back in this book too. Jenn is a hard-working, single mom with great intuitive skills; and Ross is an ambitious brown-noser, but has good skills as well (and I liked the way he thinks of his wife, Mel). There are several murders in this book and the investigation is both interesting and surprising. I couldn't guess correctly who the real threat was, and I liked that.

The story centers around the family coming together to bury the father, Daniel Lighthouse.

Dahlia Lighthouse arrives at their Blackburn Island home after not seeing the family at all for years. When the grave is dug it is discovered there is already a body in it - Dahlia's twin brother, Andy, whose skull was split with an axe.

It turns out to be a man who disappeared thirty years ago and was never found. Back then they had interrogated and held a business associate of the man, but were unable to charge him as they didn't have enough evidence.

Konrad was the policeman who handled the original investigation, and he is brought in again, even though he is retired, to assist with the case since he has all the background information.

A terrible time in Mexico.Maite, a secretary leading a quiet life, becomes involved in a complicated policitical situation. Her neighbor, Leonora, asked Maite to feed her cat for a few days while she was away. But Leonora did not come back.

I find it disturbing how society can be persuaded by rumors and innuendos, normally untrue, to turn against certain people. In the case of witches, simply women who live alone, are many times widows, who have the knowledge to alleviate pain and suffering using plants. The times of the witch trials were a frightening time for women, and there was no defense or justice available to them. This book is written in two timelines. In 1661 Honor Seton and her daughter Alice, are herbalists and take care of many people in their community. When summoned to take care of the laird's wife, the woman dies despite Honor's attempts to save her. The laird is determined to seek vengeance against Honor. This timeline was very interesting and gives a feel for the time and the risks women faced.The second timeline is present day. Tess and her daughter Jemima, have moved to Thistle Cottage after fleeing Edinburgh when Tess's husband goes to prison. After moving in they find the cottage had once been the home of two women accused of witchcraft, and that Thistle Cottage is known at the Witches' Cottage. Some dark and unsettling things start happening at the cottage that keep Tess and Jem worried they might be targets for the things Tess's husband had done.I enjoyed reading this and found the writing flowed well and the characters were interesting.

Selma, Luisa's grandmother, is another prominent figure in the book. Selma is Luisa's anchor, and she and Luisa are very close.

The books in about family, sisters, relationships, jealousy, and love. Families are complicated and this one is no different. There are hurts that run deep, that arise over and over to influence actions. There are three stepsisters involved here: Daisy, Sage, and Cassidy, and the interactions are so interesting I was fascinated. How pain suffered in childhood carried over to adulthood. How things your parent told you influences your perception. I think I liked best how Daisy and Sage, despite their differences, came together to help Cassidy. There are some very flawed men in the book too. All in all an absorbing and interesting read.Thanks to HARLEQUIN – Trade Publishing (U.S. & Canada) through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Apr 11, 2021","Apr 13, 2021","Apr 11, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55004542-the-stepsisters

Now as the women are middle-aged and each is facing major life challenges, Liz, V and Rachel each receive a letter from Em with some sad news and she asks that all the girls reunite at Camp Birchwood one last time for a week.This book is a touching look at friendship, betrayals and forgiveness.

Thea travels to Scotland with the intent of staying awhile and sorting out this house, but ends up liking the town and the people. The house contains a library filled with some very rare books, that Thea could possibly sell. Thea needs a fresh start and thinks that maybe she could live there.

Letty is suspicious that her wealthy sister Tanya's ex-boyfriend and Maya's father, Evan Wingfield is the murderer.

A family adopts a 5 year old girl who was initially found in a park alone. They call her Penny. As Penny gets older there are some issues where they notice that her personality totally changes and they seem like distinctly separate personas. It gets to a point where she's finally diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), or having multiple personalities. Penny has several - Ruby, Chloe, and Eve - they know of, but there could be more.When Penny is a teenager she is arrested for a brutal murder.

Dorothea Lange was a much-celebrated American photographer who is most known for her influence on journalistic photography.Dorothea grew up on the East Coat of America and contracted polio as a child which left her with a limp. She grew up feeling inferior and invisible. When she was 22 years old, in 1918, she left her life at home and went to California to start a new life on her own. She had a major setback immediately upon arriving in San Franciso. Then she met Caroline Lee, a Chinese-American girl who was about her age. Caroline introduced Dorrie (Dorothea) to the artist colony of bohemians living at ""Monkey Block"". Caroline has her own tragic story which rivals Dorrie for center stage in this book.Dorrie found a job in San Francisco that was not as lucrative as her job on the East Coast had been; but, hey - you have to start somewhere, right? Then, through meeting the right people and taking some risks, things began to change for Dorrie.I loved this book, and loved the characters - especially Dorrie and Caroline. The writing is captivating and kept me enthralled with the story. The history of San Francisco revealed in the story opened my eyes to some parts of American history I was unaware of before.

The harmless ""bright"" things Ev sells at the Night Market, which is part of Chinatown, in Vancouver. Ev makes a meager living selling these objects.One day Ev's life intersects with another who can also sense the emotions attached to objects. Harriet is much older than Ev, and over her life she's collected many, many objects - only she doesn't get rid of them as Ev does - she keeps them all. Harriet is a hoarder.

Lucie and her best friend, Gavin (who is gay) have been working hard as nurses during the coronavirus pandemic and need a break from the stress and tension of their jobs. They decide to go on a vacation, and Gavin makes all the arrangements for them to stay in Corfu. The beautiful scenery and the people they meet there change their lives dramatically.

Anna Hart is a missing persons detective in San Francisco. She had a horrible tragedy in her life which has caused issues between Anna and her husband Brendan. Anna flees to her adoptive parents hometown of Mendocino to try to get her life together. But once there she gets drawn into a case of a missing 15 year old girl with an old friend from childhood, Will, who is now the Sheriff in town. Then they find there are two other girls who have gone missing in the area recently. Anna throws her entire focus into solving this case.This isn't really a typical police procedural. The case is steered more by Anna's gut feelings based on her own life experiences as well as her years of experience in locating missing persons. It is very intense and looks deeply at feelings and emotions, triggers and responses. The book is a mix of facts drawn from missing persons cases, including the well-known Polly Klass case, and fictional events. It is well written and somewhat atmospheric in nature. It is told only from Anna Hart's point of view and her forte is dealing with people with a great degree of sensitivity and care. I liked the descriptions of the terrain in Northern California.

This is a novel about the development of the Oxford English Dictionary, and traces the life of a young girlWhat a great debut novel for Pip Williams! This is a novel about the development of the Oxford English Dictionary, and traces the life of a young girl, Esme, who grew up in and later worked in the Scriptorium where the dictionary was written, and the continuous development of the dictionary. Esme's mother died and so Esme accompanied her father to work every day and played under her father's desk while he worked on the dictionary. She was fascinated with words and the context in how they were used. In the Scriptorium words were written on slips of paper with some context of how they were used, and occasionally Esme would find one on the floor or find duplicates and slip them in her pocket. She then would save them in an old trunk that belonged to Lizzie, a maid. The first word she ever took was ""bondmaid"". As Esme grows older she realizes that many words don't make it into the dictionary - words that are offensive and other words that are used primarily by women. Since the dictionary was written by men (although there were women who contributed information or who assisted them at times), many words didn't seem important to the men and were, therefore, omitted from the dictionary. This forms the groundwork for this story. Set against the backdrop of the suffrage movement and of World War I, change was coming to Europe, and here you see the changes through Esme's eyes and through her work at the Scriptorium, as well as her fascination with women's words.This book was a wonderful book for me because I have always loved words and spent much time reading a dictionary as a child. I was fascinated with all the words, their meanings, how to use them, where they came from, and how they were pronounced and spelled. Wish I were a better wordsmith though and could turn my love of words into a way to make a living, but I've never been a great writer. This story was totally engaging and fascinating for me.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through Netgalley for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jan 25, 2021","Jan 28, 2021","Jan 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49354511-the-dictionary-of-lost-words

Rain has gone to her family's lakeside cottage to attempt to heal after the death of her husband. The quiet she craves doesn't happen as she is immersed back into the community of year round lakeside residents, finding both old friends and new. The community is anxious for her to open the library that her mother has opened each season for the small town. Then there's a murder on her parents' property. The characters were well developed. I liked the rekindling of the friendship between Rain and Julia. It's so true how old friends, even after not seeing each other for a long time, can see each other and immediately they are as close as they were before. The plot was good - not one of those you couldn't put down, but kept my interest.

She is one of my favorite writers. Her writing is always beautiful As soon as I saw that Isabel Allende had written a new book, I requested this one. She is one of my favorite writers. Her writing is always beautiful and passionate. This book was a little different in that it is not fiction. It is a reflection/meditation on women - what it means to be a woman and the hardships they have faced under a civilization ruled by patriarchy. She brings to light the plight of women, especially those in third-world countries, and the fate they suffer in life in a world where all the rules are made by men. Things are getting better for women in some countries, but there is still a long way to go. Allende discusses what feminism means to her and how being a feminist has a role in her life's decisions and choices. She says she has been a feminist since early childhood. I laughed when she talked about being expelled from Catholic school when she was six! Allende discusses some of the things she has seen in her extensive travels throughout the world, and these were interesting. Good things about women coming together in groups for a communal purpose, but also some terrible ways women are looked upon in different cultures.In her advanced years, she has married Roger. He is her third husband and she says that she is happy. I am glad she is happy because she deserves to be. She has spent her life writing beautiful books that portray strong and courageous women. She also has established a foundation to help women - I didn't know that - and invests much of her income towards it.Kudos to Allende for another great book! I hope she will be writing for many, many more years.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through Netgalley for an advance copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Dec 27, 2020","Dec 31, 2020","Dec 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54814872-the-soul-of-a-woman

It was action-packed and kept me turning pages to see what would happen next. The story centers on the Pine family. Dad and Mom, Erin and Olivia, and four children. The oldest son, Danny, is in prison for murdering a girl - but his family believes he is innocent and is fighting through all legal avenues to get him out; Matt, the second oldest son, is in college at NYU; Maggie is in high school; and Tommy is in elementary school. A documentary had been made about Danny and the murder of his girlfriend. It portrayed the Dad, Erin, as kind of deranged. The family was basically ostracized by their small town in Nebraska after the murder, and had since moved to another state.The story opens on the murder of a family on vacation in Mexico - Erin, Olivia, Maggie and Tommy - all dead. At first they think it was a gas leak. But an FBI agent's, Sarah Keller, instincts tell her something is not right. Matt has to go Mexico to get the bodies released and gets into a dangerous situation. The story goes back and forth between present and past. It is filled with building tension and fast-paced action. The characters are well-developed and inspire empathy. My favorite characters were Matt and Maggie.Excellent debut Alex Finlay!

Danubia and Vesria are at war. Wren is part of the Queen's Guard in Danubia. She makes mistakes with her magic due to showing too much compassion (how is that bad?) and the Queen (who is Wren's aunt, but has no affection for Wren) removes her from her position and sends her to the abbey. Wren is a very talented healer and all she ever wanted to do was impress the Queen and gain her favor. Wren receives an invitation from Lord Alistair Lowry, from the small kingdom of Cernos, who wants her to come and heal one of his servants. Wren sees it as an opportunity to make an alliance with Cernos and gain the Queen's favor and respect. But she knows if she goes, she will be disobeying her orders and will be in big trouble. Once at Lord Lowry's crumbling mansion she finds out the servant she is to heal is her country's sworn enemy, Hal Cavendish, who is known as The Reaper.I enjoyed the story and the characters. There was political intrigue, religious aspects, betrayal, an ongoing war, and some romance in the book. I liked the romance the best.

In looking for a new place to live, she gets accepted into an artist community called C.A.S.A. which has some strange rules, but Clarissa is willing to agree to them. Clarissa and her first husband, Toby, are still close friends. They have a daughter together, Jordan, who lives in London. They also had a son died in the womb, but Clarissa still had to go through birthing him. Her sorrow and ability to handle it was the source of Clarissa and Toby's divorce.

Victoria is a member of the House of Representatives and gets shuttled to a bunker in case of nuclear war. However, when they refuse to admit her son - no family members allowed in the bunker; not enough room - Victoria makes the decision to leave and goes searching for safety elsewhere. Victoria has had survival training and is somewhat of a prepper - something she has also instilled in her sons. This is a story of survival and of bringing some semblance of order out of chaos.

After he was killed, Jason, the second son enlisted. Then there's Gibby, the youngest son, who is still in high school. Jason, came back from Vietnam dishonorably discharged, was a heroin addict, had served prison time, and was estranged from his family.

They arrange a day to spend together. That day Jason has two girls with him when he meets up with Gibby and they have an adventurous day.Later, a woman is found murdered. She had been horrendously tortured. The police start digging and begin to look at Jason due to his prison history and the stories of the many he had killed in Vietnam. Gibby wants to prove Jason is innocent. Their Dad doesn't know what to think, but it doesn't look good for Jason.This book is a thriller - and yes, some of it is really gory! But it is also a coming of age story. It is told from Gibby's viewpoint and he does a lot of growing up really fast. And, it's a family drams as well.

Melanie Benjamin has created a fictional portrayal around an actual event known as The Children's Blizzzard that happened on January 12, 1888 in the Dakota Territory. It was a relatively mild day after a severe cold snap. People had gotten out of their homes to get supplies, get their animals out to in the fields, and the children went to school as it was the first day they could after it had been so cold. They went to school with lighter clothes because it was so mild.The blizzard hit just before children were dismissed from school or they had just left, and it came on fast. Teachers had to make the agonizing decision of whether to keep the children at school or let them try to make it home by themselves. Some made the right decision and some did not.This story follows Raina and Gerda Olsen, two sisters who were both very young schoolteachers in different schoolhouses, and what happened to them both during and after the terrible day of this blizzard. It is a heart-breaking story of the tremendous hardship they faced.I love the beautiful prose in the story. Benjamin gives you a full appreciation of the beauty and danger of life on the Plains. The charcters were vividly portrayed and so was the land they lived on and farmed.

When I first started it I was a little put off by the short, choppy writing, but the more I read it seemed to fit perfectly. The story was told in short chapters from four different points of view. Emily, a dentist and lives alone; Emily's boyfriend Alastair, who is in forensics, divorced and trying to raise his son with the help of his Mom; Tomas, who moves in next door to Emily with his wife; and Jade, Tomas's wife, who is totally paranoid and is off her rocker. When Jade and Tomas first move in next to Emily, Jade knows right away that Emily and Tomas will have an affair. Jade warns Emily off right off the bat - talk about paranoid!

However, I enjoyed this police procedural regardless (but now I'm curious about some things so I need to go back and read that first book!).Natalie Lockhart is a young detective in Burning Lake, New York. The town is apparently a hot spot during October due to a history of witchcraft, but this book isn't about witches. After a long, hard night dealing with the crowds and revelry of Halloween, a local business owner finds the body of a naked young woman in an alley dumpster. Natalie is nearby and is notified immediately. This begins an intriguing investigation trying to find out who the woman is and whether her death is a suicide or murder. Diving into the woman's background turns up some surprising discoveries and there are several suspect possibilities. I had fun reading this book. It wasn't too gory and focused on Natalie and some problems she is dealing with (which apparently occurred in the first book). Natalie is a good person and a strong protagonist, but she does have some issues to work through. There's a little romance, but that is not the main part of the story.

Kate Marshall and her son find a dead body while diving at the Shadow Sands reservoir. The detective chief inspector quickly ruled the death a drowning; however, to Kate things didn't add up and she suspected foul play. Apparently there had been a series of deaths and missing persons in the same area around the Shadow Sands reservoir; then a researcher from the university Kate lectures at goes missing. Kate and her associate Tristan Harper start investigating and uncover some disturbing information. The become increasingly desperate to find the truth.Truly I couldn't put this book down and read it quickly following the information and wanting to know more. I really like the character Kate Marshall who is dealing with some problems of her own. The plot was paced just right to keep me turning the pages and devouring the book.

I love her upbeat, contemporary writing style and her characters are quirky, amusing and entertaining. The main character in this one is Ava who has gone on a writing retreat in a monastery in Italy. At the retreat she meets a dreamy guy, but she doesn't know anything about him because at the retreat everyone uses a fictitious name and isn't supposed to reveal anything about their real life. 'Aria' and 'Dutch' fall for each other and it gets kind of serious real fast. Then, when they return to their real lives, and their true personalities and lifestyles are revealed. What happens to their relationship? Are they really compatible? Are they the same people they were when they met at the monastery?Lots of humor and romance - and a show-stealing dog. A family of friends with their own quirks.

Margery Benson is a child at the beginning of this story. She's with her father in his study. He walks out and she hears a gunshot and never sees her father again. She and her mother go to live with her aunts, where Margery is basically ignored. Forty years later, Margery walks out on her teaching job, hires an assistant, and goes in search of a mythical golden beetle she thinks will be found in New Caledonia. Margery is a large woman who is socially awkward, is single, has no friends, but has been obsessed with researching beetles all her life. The assistant, Enid Pretty, is totally unqualified to assist Margery, but Margery had been unable to find anyone else. Enid turned up at the last minute determined to go on this journey. However, Enid has a secret and Margery has no clue. Also, there is a man who applied for the job, but Margery found him unsuitable as he made a bad impression at his interview. He's a POW who definitely has PTSD and imagines things that aren't really there.Strange characters, and strange story. But it works! Overall this was an unexpectedly fun read. The characters are quirky and interesting. Their interactions are complicated by closely held secrets.

This book, the prequel to Practical Magic and The Rules of Magic, beautifully takes us to the source of the curse in the Owens family. This is the story of Maria Owens who was abandoned in a snowy field in rural England in the 1600s. She was taken in and raised by Hannah Owens, who taught Maria everything she could about herbs and healing and incantations. One important lesson Hannah taught was to always love someone who will love you back.The story starts in Essex, England and moves to Curaçao then to Salem, Massachusetts, and to New York City - Hannah traveled a great deal. Her life was filled with hardship and much of her story is very dark and sad. She is very mistrustful of love and is betrayed at several different ages by various people. The 1600s was very dangerous for women, especially if they were truly witches. It was important to keep their gifts a secret.The book is masterfully written and gave me the feel of being in that time and how difficult it was for women.

She remembered spending her time in Egypt on a dig with a man she loved and had so much in common with, Wyatt. She left all this when her Mom was sick and then met Brian. They have been together for fifteen years. She is torn between her current life with Brian and Meret (although their marriage is having difficulties) and the life she left behind.I found this book insightful and compelling as it focused on the choices we make in life and how they affect not only the person making the choice, but those close to them as well. It is about regrets and missed opportunities. It is about complicated relationships. And it is about change.I did find the extensive focus on dead Egyptians and the parts about quantum physics to be difficult at times as my eyes glazed over a little and I'd start yawning - so I give this one four stars instead of five. Don't get me wrong, it is still a really good book I would recommend it - just be warned it's kind of an intellectural read.

There are a lot of characters in this book and sometimes I had to stop and figure out who a character was and how that person fit, but its all good. The main characters are Bridget and Will who are long-term friends and are musicians who play in a trio together and live in New York City, but they don't have a romantic relationship. The story focuses on changes in their lives over a summer at Bridget's country home in a small town in Connecticut.I enjoyed the characters and the relationships were interesting. I also enjoyed all the animals: the dogs, cats, sheep. I also found Bridget's wealthy father very interesting at his advanced age with the changes in his life.This was a fun book and the first book I've read by Amy Poeppel.

An intricate plot that involves murders across the country.Michael comes home and finds a dead woman in his bathtub. He calls his sister, Megan first, then calls 911 and LAPD detective Garrett Dobbs arrives to investigate; but Jessica Gimble from the FBI arrives soon after and claims jurisdiction.

Second, because I keep hearing about Pillars of the Earth and The Century trilogies and keep meaning to read them, but haven't yet. When I read that this book was a prequel to The Pillars of the Earth trilogy I thought I would pick it up as a start to the other three. I didn't expect to be blown away, especially after reading the first few pages and realizing it was set in 997 CE during the Dark Ages and that it is 928 pages. I thought, uh oh - the is going to be difficult to slog through; but, no! I truly loved every minute spent with this story and can't wait to delve into the trilogy.The setting is England during a time when Vikings raided villages, and times were difficult. The main characters were Edgar, who was a boatbuilder and was MacGyver-like in being able to put together a plan quickly and make something work from nothing; and Ragna, a Norman noblewoman, who comes to England when she marries an English earl, and is very smart and courageous. I loved these two characters and happily became wrapped up in their lives as they navigated treacherous times and great difficulties.The plot is full of action and tension that was perfectly paced. The characters, many who are filled with greed and ambition, were so well-developed I felt I knew them. This was most definitely a five-star book for me.

It is written with sensitivity and compassion. I felt so bad for Jess, who was trying so hard to be a good mother to a baby that cried all the time and taking care of two other small children. My heart went out to her. I aslo felt so worried for her daughter Betsey, and just wanted her to be safe.I picked up this book because I enjoyed Vaughan's 'Anatomy of a Scandal' and wanted to read more by the author.

Fern, the protagonist, is an anxious, nervous adult who was really psychologically abused in her childhood, but she doesn't feel she's been abused because there was no physical abuse. She has a really strange attachment to her father, I think. She is married to a kind, supportive man. When her father calls and wants her to come help him pack up the house so he can move to Florida, she thinks it's strange but she goes to help anyway. Fern hears about a woman who's missing and something about her makes Fern feel she recognizes her - but this is not a person she's ever met. The woman's name is Astrid, and she keeps appearing in Fern's recurring nightmares.The story unfolds while Fern is back in New Hampshire to help her Dad. There are some twists and turns to follow so I didn't really know who the ""bad guy"" was for sure until near the very end - although I had a couple of good suspicions.

January Andrews, a romance writer, has been having problems after her father's death and moves into his beach cottage while struggling with writer's block. She meets her grumpy neighbor, Gus Everett, who is a literary fiction writer. The summer is spent with these two authors competing against each other. While January writes happily ever after stories, Gus's literature is dark and gloomy. They strike a deal - January will write a book of literary fiction and Gus will write a romance novel and they will see whose book sells.This book was a lot of fun. I loved the well-developed characters, the banter of their conversations and the story itself. I would highly recommend the book which I found a little deeper than a typical romance novel.Thanks to Berkley/Penguin Publishing Group and Edelweiss for and advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 20, 2020","Apr 24, 2020","Apr 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52867387-beach-read

Electra is the youngest of the group and she is out of control. Although at the top of her game as a successful model, she is strung out on drugs and alcohol and headed for trouble fast. All the other sisters have found their roots through the letters Pa Salt left for them when he died, but Electra hasn't even opened her letter to make any steps towards learning where she came from before Pa Salt adopted her. She does receive a letter from a woman claiming to be her maternal grandmother, but Electra ignores the letter completely - until the woman shows up on her doorstep.Thus begins Electra's journey to her roots. Her grandmother begins a tale of a woman named Cecily who went from her home in New York to visit her godmother in Kenya, Africa just before World War II began. Electra's story is fascinating and I didn't want to put the book down. From the earlier books I wasn't very fond of Electra - she always seemed like the spoiled, detached sister, but I liked her much better in her own story as I gained an understanding of her circumstances. Now I will be anxiously anticipating the next book - I'm assuming there will be one - to find out whether or not there is one more sister, since the possibility has been alluded to throughout the series. Also, at some point I hope we can find out more about Pa Salt - who was he, where did he get his money, is he really dead, and what possessed him to choose these particular children to adopt? I have so many questions I want answered!Thanks to Lucinda Riley for an outstanding book!

It is a feminist novel from modern day Japan and dwells on a woman's body and the desire for children and explores the options of having a child without a partner. I found it easy to read and interesting - truly well written. I mostly liked the main character, Natsu, but had a hard time relating to her obsession with her body. The prose was engaging and read easily, although a little repetitive.Part of the book dwells on eggs and part on breasts, each in a different time period. The 'breasts' time period was the better part in my view. There are three main topics in the book: menstruation, breast surgery, and pregnancy. All the topics are relevant to women, but I've never known one with these extreme obsessions - although they are true issues for all women.Thanks to Ingram Publisher Services through Edelweiss for an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 02, 2020","Apr 11, 2020","Apr 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50736031-breasts-and-eggs
