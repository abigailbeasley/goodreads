My own writing has been inspired by Salter. When I read an article Lauren Groff wrote about Light YearsI came to Lauren Groff by way of James Salter. My own writing has been inspired by Salter. When I read an article Lauren Groff wrote about Light Years i knew it was the same for her. Fates and Furies is about a married couple and her writing captures their depth of character with brilliance in much the same way Salter did with Light Years. Her tribute is an honor to Salter and she has made it her own. Below is an excerpt from her essay on Salter.""...But Light Years, his 1975 novel, glows in a holy way. I buy it in multiples because I press it into the hands of practically everyone who enters my house, and I reread it a few times a year to reset my expectations of what a great novel looks like.Those nights, I stay up alone in the quiet house, hearing my babies’ sleeping breath in the monitors, and open Light Years to let myself feel the beauty, and the ache of sadness that I’m so careful to modulate in my own domestic sphere. To function, I need my ecstatic experiences controlled, limited to the time it takes to read a book. Light Years sits beside me like a good friend during those sleepless nights, and together we watch the morning dawn with its just-bearable brightness. The description of the book belies its power: Light Years traces the unexceptional marriage of Nedra and Viri, a well-off couple with a house on the Hudson, two little girls, a pony, a bunny, a dog, all the accoutrements of a comfortable bourgeois life. They love each other, have lovers, fall apart. But the true story of Light Years is more mysterious and far colder, found in the way it is told, in brief, vivid scenes strung like pearls on a filament of decades. The book has been called impressionistic, but I think that’s false, because impressionism implies a blurred close-view and a cohesive long-view, and every sentence and scene in Light Years is cut by diamonds. It’s more like a series of careful explosions, strobing one after another through the darkness of years. Or it is a deep river glinting in the sun.""Salter wrote of his characters Nedra and Viri: ""Their life is mysterious, it is like a forest; from far off it seems a unity, it can be comprehended, described, but closer it begins to separate, to break into light and shadow, the density blinds one. Within there is no form, only prodigious detail that reaches everywhere: exotic sounds, spills of sunlight, foliage, fallen trees, small beasts that flee at the sound of a twig-snap, insects, silence, flowers.""Groff essay continues and she writes about Light Years: ""When the reader is not being tenderized by the sophisticated undercurrents of emotion in this book, she is being seduced by Salter’s language. His dialogue hides more than it reveals; the sudden darts into his characters’ points of view uncover the author’s profound generosity toward them, even when they’re acting terribly. It is this wild generosity that is James Salter’s greatest gift to a reader, the ability to hold within a single character or scene or sentence the precise and the deeply mysterious, the admirable and the dirty, the flesh and the spirit. To look upon it all with clear and warm eye, without judgment or false sentiment. To offer it up in a way as aesthetically devastating as anybody ever has in the history of novels. If such kindness to we hungry, sleepless, aching readers of the world isn’t saintly, I don’t know what is.""I do know what it is to be mesmerized by James Salter’s writing. His novels have depth and beauty. Fates and Furies is a great book. I will read all her books!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 04, 2023","Oct 15, 2023","Sep 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24612118-fates-and-furies

Intense and mind blowing, this book is the story of Nico, a man that uses his power to manipulate everyone, and Luna, a woman who gets caught in his trap. It is amazing how the author elicits the reader's emotions by flawlessly detailing the characters' behavior, needs and chemistry. Very well written, fast paced and thrilling. This is one of those stories you can't forget. --- The Bookery ReviewA well written erotic read that had me gripped. I love when an author manages to change your mind about how you feel about a character. I went from thinking Nico was a charming sexy guy to really disliking him. Looking forward to reading more from this author. --- Cheekypee Reads & ReviewsA testament to the author's talent for writing characters so rich in detail I had to take several deep breaths to remind myself it is a work of fiction. I recommend this book to experience the dark personality of a psychopath. --- 2 One Click ChicksGreat storytelling with richly written and exposed characters. You won't forget this book --- Melissa's Delicious BooksA suspenseful seduction that begins in the mind of a sociopath sociopath and ends with an exploration of love and humanity. --- McWood Publishinga snip:Luna took off her helmet releasing her hair into the cool mist blowing off the ocean. Closing her eyes, she could taste the salt on her tongue. She felt the weight of his sadness. There weren’t any words that would make it better.

I must have lent it out because I can't find it on my shelved. So, I reread several essays online. I did find a collection of 12 her essays, ranging in publication date from 1968 - 2000, in a wonderful book called, ""Let me tell you what I mean.""My favorite, ""Why I Write"" is one of her most renowned essays. It's brutally honest and revelatory. The other is, ""Last Words"" which is about Hemingway who is one of my favorite authors and an inspiration to me, as he is to many other writers. I recommend this collection to anyone who wants to read Didion essays that cover a broad range of time.

There is darkness and hopelessness in these stories. The honesty is often brutal. O'Conner said, ""All fiction is about human nature.” her stories exemplify that statement. The racial epithets are hard to read, like being stabbed each time. Flannery O'Connor is a product of her time and place like Faulkner, and more than that.... she is openly bigoted. Supposedly she respected and supported the work of MLK, and yet disliked Baldwin. All irrelevant to her writing. Her writing is powerful and poignant and as abrupt as Hemingway.

Complex characters, twisted relationships and expected strong female protagonist! All delightful. It's just time consuming to read today what had been dished out piecemeal in an earlier, slower time.
