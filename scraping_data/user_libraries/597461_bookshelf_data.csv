The best part of this oddball novel for me was the narrative- chatter- dialogues. Parts were hilarious… Other parts just weird! Themes are strong: death, love, loss, fear and reconciling with God > and a ‘kiss-of-death’ love story between a brother and sister. Here are a few excerpts to give a little taster…. “It had snowed lightly in the night and her frozen hair was gold and crystalline and her eyes were frozen cold and hard as stones. One of her yellow boots had fallen off and stood in the snow beneath her. The shape of her coat lay dusted in the snow where she’d dropped it and she wore only a white dress and it hung among the bare gray poles of the winter trees with her head bowed and her hands turned slightly outward like those of certain ecumenical statues whose attitude asks that their history be considered. That deep foundation of the world be considered where it has its being in the sorrow of her creatures”.  …. the above was the (dynamic & visual) beginning: a young woman had hanged herself. More? Okay!  “We’re savage divers. We do what we are paid to do. Anyway, I’m sure you know more about this than I do”.  “All right. Thank you for your time.  “They rose from the couch simultaneously. Like birds leaving a wire. Western eased himself from the bed”.  “Maybe I really should look at those badges again”.  “You have a peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Western”.  “I know. I get that a lot”.  “Jesus, said the Kid, rising and coming forward. God’s bleeding piles. No no no no no. For the love of Christ. What the fuck do you think this is? You can’t come in here hawking this crap. We ask for straightforward acts and we get some fucking tinker minus his forelobes. Good God. Out. Jesus. All right. Who’s next? Christ. Where do you have to go for a little talent? To the fucking moon?”  “What’s out there? Dunno. Some atavism out of a dead ancestor’s psychosis come in out of the rain. Over there smoking in the corner. Well what the hell. Let me get the lights. No good. Shut off the projector. Who the fuck ordered this anyway? Roll up the screen and the fucking things are on the wall. The other thing you called me was a pathogen”.  “You are a pathogen”.  “See?”  “Are they coming in or not?”  “Is who coming in?”  “Cut it out. I know they’re out there”.  “The horts, that would be. “That would be”.  “All in good time”.  “I can see their feet under the door. I can see the shadows of their feet”.  “Feet and the shadows of seat. Just like in the real world”.  “What are they waiting for?” “Who knows? Maybe they don’t feel welcome”. “The Passenger” is the first of a two-volume saga. And….. THESE ARE the TWO excerpts that solidified my wanting to read this book: “Grief is the stuff of life. A life without grief is no life at all. But regret is a prison. Some part of you which she deeply value lies forever impaled at a crossroads you can no longer find and never forget”.  “I had trouble with the God thing. A lot of people do. And then I woke up one night in the middle of the night and I was lying there and I thought:If there is no higher power and I am it”. ...more",Notes are private!,2,8,1,not set,not set,"Feb 09, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60581087-the-passenger

Then I ‘saw’ the movie ( and not right away - it took a friend telling me to ‘go’)- it was so outstanding- I saw it twice. Looking ‘back’ at the trailer ‘after’ having seen the movie- it looks better to me - but still does not do the movie justice. That’s how I feel about “Lost in the Beehive”. The name of the book itself didn’t grab my attention right away. The blurb alone is ok - and even accurate- but it sounded ‘busy’ to me - lightweight whimsy with some emotional heart - yet with so many books to choose from - it simply sounded like another tale that would be good - but not INCREDIBLE! I think it’s INCREDIBLE- and WONDERFUL!! I almost completely passed this book up. Many thanks to *Marilyn* for sending me a book recommendation. Her  convinced me. I checked this book out yesterday- read it - and it’s MUCH BETTER than the blurb let’s on. It’s actually important and relevant to some issues happening in the news today. BEFORE I GET INTO MY REVIEW....I want to mention that Conversion Therapy on minors is still legal today. The pseudoscientific “Gay Cure” attempts to change sexual orientation or gender identity through techniques that have included electric shock and induced vomiting. Just a couple of days ago - in ‘The Washington Post’, is an article which headlines:“A BISEXUAL STATE DELEGATE WANTS TO BAN CONVERSION THERAPY ON MINORS. HER STATE SENATOR FATHER DISAGREES”. I’m not going to debate this topic — and the entire article in the Washington Post is just heartbreaking to me....but research has found that Conversion Therapy is ineffective - dangerous- harmful — with a list of potential serious effects. I bring this topic up....because it’s relevant to this story. Now for my REVIEW....NO MAJOR SPOILERS!!!TIDBIT STYLE REVIEW: MANY REASONS TO READ THIS BOOK: .....BIGGEST REASON ......YOU’ll LOVE IT. It will tap deeply into your mind and heart......It’s fast reading - very engaging - lovely ease in the writing which DEMANDS OUR FULL ATTENTION...because the writing flows effortlessly. Kudos to author Michele Young-Stone. I’m digging this author. My first experience reading her. .....The setting takes place in the 60’s and 70’s. Many memorable references: Walter Cronkite, Waldorf salads, Swanson TV dinners, mini skirts, faded bell-bottoms, Woolworths, Lucky Strikes, Carole King, ‘Tapestry’, the pull-out sofa, Bourbon in Dixie cups at picnics, tuna casserole, Nancy Sinatra Go-Go boots,crocheted top with exposed midriff, Mutoscopes( at the Museum of modern Art in New York,MoMA), Vietnam War, Nathan’s famous Hot Dog’s - slice pizza & coke,“Catcher in the Rye”, The National organization for women was calling a ratification for the equal rights amendment, Patsy Cline, ‘Walk-in After Midnight’, “NEAT”....( isn’t that just NEAT?), Old records: Bessie Smith, Benny Goldman, Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar, a golden retriever, small town gossip, Hostess Sno Balls, canned spaghetti O’s, and ravioli, Three layered chocolate cake, Frank Sinatra, ‘Fly Me To The Moon’, Rolling Stones,’I. Can’t Get No Satisfaction’, Donna Summers, and footie pajamas. .....As vile as the Belmont Institute was —- Gloria Ricci and Sheffield meet under those dreadful conditions- and become best friends. They are both gay. They were also both minors. Gloria 16. Sheff, 17. Their parents had control of their choices. Be aware there ‘is’ one scene that is painfully graphic - yet important to understand the magnitude of the therapy practices. .....Gloria got out first. Goes back home in Maryville, for awhile, to live with her parents Frank and Molly. We get to know the parents well throughout the years changing. Even though they had sent Gloria to Belmont to ‘heal’ her .....we will learn other sides of her parents - actually very supportive - not typical of most parents who sent their teens to institutions to change them. .....Then Sheff. He goes to New York. .....Gloria follows Sheff. One afternoon they rented a boat at Turtle Bay in Central Park...it wasn’t only the sky’s reflection that matched Sheff’s eyes, the warm sun, the dragonflies that made that day wonderful for Gloria.We saw her open up more. We knew their relationship was deepening- she loved him. Lying close to him that night she whispered in his ear, “I’m going to marry you, Sheffield Schoeffler”......Life doesn’t always go as planned:.....Gloria meets Jacob Blount - marries him. Moves to a small town called Greeley. Not too far from Washington City. They moved into a house that was built in 1927. A tobacco farmer had once owned it. The best thing about the town was meeting Betty, who owned a restaurant/ bakery in town. .....You’ll meet other interesting and or mysterious characters: Uncle Eddie - Big Mama - Madame Zelda - Early Bird - Darlene - etc. ....A ‘little’ about the Bees: ( just a context) ... “There are all these myths- Native American, African, and Celtic- about how bees are symbolic of birth and creativity; they can be spirits traveling from one world to the next”. Gloria says:.....”I felt caught between two worlds, one where I was special, some magical beekeeper, and another where I did what I was told. I kept the house neat, made dinner, spread my thighs as wide as they would go. I was a trapeze artist walking a tightrope”. .....”I best skedaddle”...... ( when’s the last time you heard that phrase?) :)I hate to leave this book....We’ve all experienced somebody wanting to change us. If we are truthful - we know people we wish we could change....This book inspires genuine living — Queen & King Bees of our own happiness!Thank You Simon & Schuster- Netgalley - and Michele Young-Stone...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Sep 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35297693-lost-in-the-beehive
