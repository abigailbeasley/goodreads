As a result I spent most of the novel trying to get a hold on his style, which I've finally decided was ""Journalistic"". This is written more like an essay than a novel. He seems for most of the book to be in a hurry to get it done. Which brings up a point I've made before. Why do we read? Do we read (and I've accused myself of this) so we can boast about how manny books we've read this year? Or do we read with the seldom achieved goal of discovering something about the humanity we see around us? Auster's novel tells a story, describes characters, brings out conflicts, etc., but it never, to my mind, gets across the sense that these people are more than just faces passing me on the street. I can't put my finger on just what is missing, but there never seems to be that sentence, that scene, the makes me really know the people he's describing. Yes, they go here, do that, react to this, feel for that, but the people passing me on the street are affecting me that way. He seems to be in too great a hurry to be done with the thing to really take the time to accomplish what I would like. The ending, which I will not spoil for anyone who has not read the book, affirms my feeling that Auster's greatest goal in writing the book was to get it done. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 06, 2013","Dec 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7944987-sunset-park

The five star s are often written by or for the publisher. One star s are not always perfect - so many complain of the price, etc. - but often you get a hint of whether or not you might like the book. (I know you can do the same thing on Goodreads). The one star  I read of the Goldfinch almost kept me from reading it. The er complained that the pace was too slow moving, with too much description. Did it go on like this forever? I finally decided to give the book a try despite the bad  and was enthralled by what a great book it is.Which leads me to the thought that too many of us today read for the same reason we watch TV: to pass the time quickly without too much involvement, to escape and be entertained. And there are thousands of books that do just that. But is that the only reason to read? Or even reason to read at all? What if a book can slowly drag you into its world, surround you with a the smell and feel of where it takes place? And what if the characters become so real you grow furious with them when they make bad decisions? This is what you find in Dickens and Tolstoy and all the greats. This is what makes literature memorable.The Goldfinch does this better than any contemporary book I've read in years. It's a book for a stormy night and a nice fire (or good radiator). Along with the ability to make you see and know the characters, Tartt tells a good story, making you wonder from the beginning how all of it is going to get straightened out. The breath of the setting, from New York to Las Vegas, from art to antique furniture to drug dealing and criminality id wondrous.So far it is my favorite book of 2013.

Can't beat the price.It's an interesting book, very well written, but I have absolutely no idea what the author was trying to tell me.The story centers on a young woman who goes from Nevada to New York in the 1970s to become an artist and the art scene takes up a good part of the book. She falls for an older artist who comes from a very rich Italian family, visits Italy with him, and becomes involved with social riots taking place there.What did I find wrong with the book? Well, like most literary fiction these days the story jumps around. It's written in the first person when the young woman is speaking. But then tells the story - in bits and pieces - of the Italian artist's grandfather. Added to this are narratives of revolutionaries in New York and stories that might be lies of one of the main artist characters. And then it just ends. It's unfortunate that in today's literary fiction the idea of love and commitment are not allowed. Theres a great deal of sleeping around, but never the connection that seems so important to society's well being and the goal of most of us. Heaven forbid the main characters live happily ever after.Why this is up for a NBA is beyond me.

The founding member of the family is captured by indians, lives with them, survives terrible hardships and through grit and cruelty starts a dynasty that end up owning hundreds of thousands of acres of land only to see it ruined by overgrazing and irrigation. It is saved by oil, which makes the family fabulously rich. The story captures well the greed and ruthlessness of the family, and also the guilt of the more thoughtful members. I don't want to say too much to give away the story, which jumps back and forth though the generations, telling the story of the family though the eyes of each generation.

All of them suffer from the great fault of history, which is to shorten time and make it seem that everything happened quickly, even as they present you very clearly with the dates. The advantage of Mantel's book is that it stretches out time, and shows how each incremental event added to the sum total. It also explains how Napoleon was able to eventually rise to power, even though the story predates him and he is mentioned only once in passing. The leaders of the revolution, including the three main characters, suffered from a sort of paranoia that doomed them to failure and the guillotine.Excellent book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 19, 2013","May 20, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/101921.A_Place_of_Greater_Safety

Of course, the fact that I spent my entire work career at Polaroid may have something to do with my take on the company and why I feel Bonanos didn't get it quite right. I joined Polaroid in 1965 and was not a part of the early years, which the author covers quite interestingly. Where he fails to win my praise is in the two areas. First, he gives too much credit - and spends too much time - talking about the affect Polaroid had on the arts. True, Andy Warhol did use a Polaroid, but I think that should be a footnote and not a main focus. The other part, and where he really dropped the print coater is in describing the decline of the company. In the early eighties I was a forecaster for film sales and we showed clearly that over time film sales would declined to the point of insustainability. No one believed us, even when we showed that out estimates were accurate year after year within three percent. I finally had to move to a different job within the company because the VP's said I was always too negative. People refused to believe that Polaroid prints could be supplanted by something else. I saw my first digital photo print about 1982. I thought it was better than a Polaroid and that was the very birth of digital. The general consensus was that digital would never be as good a Polaroid. Even when HP was printing 8x10 glossies for about fifty cents, the powers that be thought we could compete by offering a printer that would spit out a Polaroid print for about a dollar. Needless to say, we ended up with warehouses full of the ridiculous printer. I could go on and on. Digital photography and terrible management killed a company that could have been a player in digital printing. I have no regrets. Polaroid was a great company to work for and I did very well there. I just wish that a little more blame was handed out and less gushing over the celebrity photographers who used the product.

So much for my resolve.The reason I pickedHow do I  this book?I said I would read no more ‘modern’ literary fiction, but here I am at it again. So much for my resolve.The reason I picked up Gilead is because 1) it won the Pulitzer, and 2) I read a  of a book by Jeffery Hart (The Living Moment) that supposedly describes how literature became modern and cites Robinson as a prime example of a modern writer. The book has also received universal praise. One er said it will be read for years to come.I have trouble with accepting the praise because I think the book lacks the very things that I love most in great literature.The ‘story’ is told as a letter being written by an elderly father to his very young son. The father is a minister in a small town in Iowa called Gilead and is the third generation to preach in the town. Much of the book is a commentary on faith and the value of religion. It is very well written, even beautifully so. The main story has to do with the return of the prodigal son of the preacher’s friend and fellow minister. But, like other modern works of literature, it fails in many ways.Evidently, the modern novel is allowed to do away with plot, chronology, character development, and description. It’s only late in the novel that I figured out that the preacher’s son is seven years old or that Gilead is a town in the open plains or that the preacher is writing in the nineteen fifties. The book meanders along, jumping from the Civil War to the age of television at will. The text is mostly a commentary on religion with the ‘plot’, such as it is, dealing with the friendship of the preachers young wife to the returning rake. It takes a lot of time for the failings of the prodigal to be told and then offers a reveal at the end that doesn’t seem to fit the rest of the story. I really think this is a long short story and not a novel at all.None of characters leap from the page. You are told of the young wife, the returning rake, the aged friend, and the young boy, but I could not feel their presence. Only the narrator’s grandfather came close to what I expect and that only because he had one eye and a fierce personality.Robinson writes beautifully and many people seem to find solace in the commentary on faith, but even that I found lacking because the story takes place before the advent of televangelists, mega churches, the Higgs boson, DNA, and creationism, which have changed modern Protestantism beyond recognition. Maybe it is a wish to return to a simpler time that people find rewarding in this book. It did not do it for me.I want great writing in a novel. But, too, I want characters that leap from the page. I want an absorbing plot, and when a reveal comes I want it to blow me over.

War histories turn a lot of people off because they focus on battles, which generally only serve to show the utter stupidity of mankind. This book covers the battles and proves the stupidity, but it does much more. The brilliance of Foote’s work is that it captures the tenor of the times and characters of the many figures who played a part in the war. His use of anecdote brings these people to life – strange things, like the fact that Stonewall Jackson would not eat black pepper because he claimed it made his left leg hurt.Reading the book today adds another dimension to the work because I can see the same sort of divide on our country now that existed then. And, in fact, I believe that in ways we are still fighting the Civil War. The idea of how large the Federal government should be and how much power it should have was really at the heart of the war as much as the issue of slavery – maybe more so in the beginning. And of course, we have still not solved the issue of race no matter how hard we’ve tried in the last hundred and fifty years.This is a great book by a brilliant writer. The fact that it is still in print (and even on the Kindle) fifty-four years after it was published says much about what a great work it is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,Sep 2012,"Sep 03, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44236.The_Civil_War_Vol_1

I read it because it's the first CreateSpace book I've seen ed in a major publication (the Economist). CreateSpace is Amazon's self publishing wing.The book is interesting because I was written by a Republican 'food soldier' who was a writer for George W Bush. The book pretty much lambastes the current political situation in Washington and especially the ultra conservatives who now have so much say in Congress. The book starts out as a farce - a conservative president has just defeated the first black president (think BO and MR except that MR is an ex general). The country is entangled in an endless war in Mexico, of all places, where we are supporting the Mexican government in a war against the drug cartels. Into the fray comes the heir to a mustard fortune, a loser by the name of Walter Schotzke who must find job to keep his grandmother from cutting off his very substantial allowance. He goes to work as a Senatorial aide and is soon up to his eyes in the horrors that have become Washington.It would be nice if what Walter sees is an exaggeration of reality, but from all I have read and heard, this is closer to the truth than any of us would like. We no longer have statesman trying to compromise the issues facing the country. We have crazy ideologues trying to prove with made-up facts that the country will collapse unless we follow their way and only their way. And of course, both sides are in league with people who are only in it for the money while trying to prove they are 'of the people'.The book started as a farce, but ended up a tale of horror in my eyes, because what Frum is describing I think is far too true.A very good novel and a great read....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2012","Aug 15, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13613963-patriots

When he finds one he really likes, he tries to get me to read it. I usually defer, but sometimes, if I'm searching for something to red, I'll relent. The Long Gray Line is a case in point. It is about the West Point class of 1966, which had the misfortune of graduating into the Vietnam war. At first glance it would seem a book about the war, but it is far more than that. Atkinson, who is a fine writer, follows the class from 1962, when they enter the academy to the late nineties (in the version I read - the book was first published in the 80s and reissued in the 90s). He picks a handful of recruits and follows their entire careers, but he tells the stories of dozens more. He also tells he story of their girlfriends, wives, and children. Only a small, terrible part of the book covers Vietnam. The rest really tells the story of the changes wrought by the war in both West Point and the Army. And, of course, the changes that took place in America during the same period.Most of the cadets leave the Army and he follows them into civilian life. Some never lived up to their potential, but all of them were smart and some hugely successful.It's a very interesting book and a great read.

The Power Broker is an outstanding study of a man's life. In many ways the characaters of the two men Caro has chosen to writer about are similar. Both were great leaders with deep flaws. Robert Moses was a man with a brilliant mind, a commanding presence, an all engulfing charm, and flaws that destroyed his place as one of the greatest builders in the history of the world. He built massive projects, ones that even I, as a non New Yorker, are familiar with. He built Jones Beach, the Triborough Bridge, and most of the parkways that anyone driving through New York has used, like the Cross Bronx Expressway. His achievements were massive, but flawed as well, because he built transportation for the automobile at the expense of mass transit and in the process created traffic jams of monumental size.He was from a rich family and had a disdain for the poor. He built Jones Beach, maybe his best accomplishment, for the people of New York, but refused to build a mass transit line so as to keep out all but those who could afford a car in in the 1920's. For good measure, he build the overpasses of the roads leading to the beach too low for busses to pass under. He did not want his great beach marred by unworthies.His roads dislocated thousands of people, most very low income, and destroyed neighborhoods that gave character to the city. His lust for power was unending and the people of the city were secondary to his grasp for it. Only his vision for the city was allowed. To this day the city is a tangle of smoke filled traffic jams. The Cross Bronx Expressway is the scariest road I have ever driven.This is a very long book, over 1100 pages, but there is not one page that fails to hold your interest.

In the English writing world, we seem to have forgotten how to write novels that people might actually want to remember and even read again. Of course, we have thousands of novels published every year, thrillers, romances, books about vampires and werewolves and dragons, and the successful ones are good reads, books to take to the beach or curl up with before the fire. They are not very deep and most if not all will suffer the fate of Thomas B. Costain, who was immensely popular in my mother’s day and is now completely forgotten. It’s not this sort of book I’m talking about. I’m thinking of the great works of art that will be read a hundred years from now, like The Great Gatspy or Wuthering Heights.Infinite Jest will not be among that number, which is okay except for the fact that David Foster Wallace seems to be a hero to so many young writers. The only reason I picked up his so-called novel is because I keep hearing what a wonder he was as a writer, perhaps more influential than any other writer of the last fifty years.It is very seldom that I don’t finish a book. I have kept a list of all the books I read for the last forty years or so and very few carry an X, indicating I didn’t finish it. I make it a rule to read at least a hundred pages to give the author a chance to get going. This rule kept me from giving up on The World According to Garp, which took forever to get going and turned out to be a find novel. After a hundred and twenty pages of Infinite Jest I had no idea what it was about, cared for none of the characters, and was generally lost by the time switches that were not explained.Part of the allure of this work might be that it is a long and ‘difficult’ novel. But I’ve read long and difficult novels before – I’ve read Ulysses twice, all of Proust, all of Kafka, all of Thomas Mann, etc. Long and difficult is not the problem with this book – making sense is.I can’t really explain what Infinite Jest is about because I never really figured it out.I am always on the lookout for literary fiction that is well ed or talked about. When it comes to English works, I have of late always been disappointed. I have a feeling that writing is becoming like modern art – if you don’t like squiggles on a canvas that look like something a four year old would do it’s because you don’t understand it, which maybe indicates you are incapable of understanding it. (Once when my daughter was about five we went to the MFA in Boston and as we entered the current exhibit she shouted in a voice that everyone could hear – “Look daddy, this is what we do in school.”) I don’t mean to say that there is no great modern art, because of course there is. It’s just that so much of it is elitist hype for the sake of sales.The same is true for much of current ‘great’ writing. It would seem a sin to have a coherent story, a chronological time line, and characters that are happy. Good marriages are forbidden, good relations with one’s children are considered false, and people who are not stoned most of them time must live in small town Iowa, which of course we would never want to write about, unless they were poor, ignorant, and ready to shoot each other.As I write this I think of Dickens. For all the trials and tribulations of his main characters, his books are filled with joyous couples, proud fathers, and loving children. I think of Tom Jones, one of my all-time favorite books. For all Tom’s troubles, the book is a hoot from start to finish and vibrates with life. I don’t think either Dickens or Fielding would be published today.I think it’s sad that the best and most popular books today are for young adults (The Hunger Games and Harry Potter) or legal thrillers (John Grisham) and that the best literary fiction is written overseas (A Fine Balance, A Suitable Boy, etc.).Infinite Jest is a terrible book and why Wallace is so lionized is beyond me. If you are looking for a great book to read, pick up Bleak House or Tom Jones or Middlemarch. Believe me, you’ll find them much more rewarding that the crap we now call Literary Fiction...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Jul 15, 2012","Aug 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest

The problem is that this is the fourth book in the set (with one still to come) and each one is huge. No matter, it is still the finest biography I have ever read. It's the biography of Lyndon Johnson, who really seems almost forgotten now. We remember John Kennedy and worship Camelot, and remember that Johnson became president on his death, but that's about it. This volume covers the Kennedy assassination and the role Johnson played in keeping the country together in a time when most of the citizenry thought the Russians, the Cubans, or the mob had killed the president. The fact that we transitioned in peace was due to this stranger man who realized his greatest dream when Kennedy was shot. Without Johnson, much if not all of the plans that Kennedy undertook as president would have languished and died in Congress because the Kennedy people seemed to have no idea how to make Congress do what they wanted.But the story of Johnson's success when he took over the presidency is not alone what makes this very long biography so absorbing. It is Caro's description of the man, who was almost Shakespearian in his contrasts. He was petty and often cruel, and dishonest to say the least, but he was also the greatest Senate leader ever and as president was responsible for the first true Civil Rights legislation to make it though Congress in a hundred years. He fathered there Civil rights Act, the Voter Rights Act, Medicare and Medicaid, legislation that changed the face of our nation for the better.Caro's brilliant writing captures the man, warts and all, and he had many warts. My favorite detail is that he entered Congress with $1000 to his name in 1932, never had a job outside politics, and was worth $17 million when he became Vice President. He was filled with insecurities, fought all his life to be someone, and was often ridiculed for being a rube. The Kennedy people made a joke of him as Vice President, giving this great Senate leader nothing to do and calling him Rufus Conpone and making fun of his every remark. A lesser man would have sought revenge when he took over the presidency, but Johnson swallowed his pride and begged the Kennedy people to stay on until things settled down. He even kept Bobby Kennedy as his Attorney General, when the two men hated each other with a passion.Believe me, if you want to read a masterful work of biography about a man who would have been a subject for Shakespeare, The Years of Lyndon Johnson should be on your list....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 25, 2012","May 25, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13049569-the-passage-of-power

I read it years ago – actually the whole set of novels that make up In Search of Lost Time (then called Remembrance of Things Past). I read it again because of something that has bothered me for years. I used to belong to the Folio Society (when I apparently had more money than brains) and when the millennium turned, they sought a list of the greatest works of the twentieth century. The greatest novel was deemed to be In Search of Lost Time. I think that was a case of literature snobs being snobby.First of all, let me say that the set of books that make up In Search of Lost Time are, indeed great works of literature. Even in translation, the writing is beautiful. The story of Swan’s Way is timeless. It’s the story of a man who falls in love with his mistress, a woman with a checkered past who drives him to near madness with his love for her. The narrator, Proust himself, has a similar fixation, when they are children, with Swan’s daughter from his marriage to this mistress.If you’ve never read Proust, be prepared for sentences that may go on for two pages and paragraphs that never end. Be prepared for a deluge of description, mostly of feelings, and of feelings that flit between happiness and despair, often on the same page.In Search of Lost Time is a great novel, but I don’t agree with the Folio Society that it’s the greatest of the twentieth century, because I don’t think it’s truly a twentieth century novel.Proust is sedentary. Dialog is mostly the talk at grand dinners. Action usually consists of going for a walk. These are hardly stock items for books written in the last century, which, if nothing else, features movement, dialog essential to that movement, and action based on incident. I think the movies – or at least film – color the way novels are written in the modern world. The lengthy descriptions we find in Proust are not needed any more. I’ve never been to Paris, but I know what Paris looks like. And, as was often the case in Swan’s Way, I want the characters to do something.

Of course, it seems we must always have had information, facts that we know, but that's not quite what Gleick is getting at. When you begin to see that codes can carry messages that hold information, then you begin to get an inkling of a far more complex definition of information. For instance, DNA, a code of chemical identifiers, holds the information about you and I and much of our past. Bits and bytes are just electronic states, off and on, but they are the means by which you are reading this right now. Gleick traces the history of coded messages from the invention of writing to the invention of Twitter and how the idea of information theory grew in the twentieth century to create the overwhelming glut of facts (?) that now inundate us. Much of this story has to do with the underlying concepts of computer science, which has always fascinated me. I found out from the book that Lord Byron's daughter Ada can be considered the first programmer because she conceived of programming long before a computer was possible. The books tells the stories of many geniuses who played a part in creating this world we now live in. The only fault I find with the book is that Gleick is not careful to tie the story together as well as he could. I never quite figured out what the long section on random numbers had to do with it all.

It makes me wonder if I know a good book when I see one, or a bad one for that matter. 1Q84 has been chosen for any number of Best of the Year selections. I have absolutely no idea why. First of all, it's around a thousand pages long. Seven hundred and fifty of those pages could have been cut without affecting the story. Do we really care that the hero made a salad - forty times.  Murakami writes magical realism, and he's very good at it. This story concerns a young girl who writes a fantastical story about 'little people' who come from the mouth of a dead goat. It turns out the story is true, witch leads to all sorts of involvement with a strange religion. Central to the story are the man who polishes the story to make it a best seller and a girl he knew briefly when he was ten. It turns out this is a love story put on hold for twenty years while the two grow up and come together again because of the strange novel. So what did I find wrong with the book other than its unnecessary length? It seems to me that in good fiction there is resolution. The author sets a world in motion, spins a web, and brings it all together in the end. Not so with this book. What happens to the girl who wrote the book? Or the religion that the protagonists damage? What was the significance of the little people? Were they real? Imagined? A thousand page book should not have so many unresolved ideas. And why should it take about eight hundred pages for the reader to realize this is a love story twenty years delayed. And why should so many pages be devoted to waiting for the hero's father to die when he apparently has no part in the story other than the fact that he's dying? I guess when you become a famous international writer you can write crap and it will still be chosen as best of the year.

I watched maybe three episodes and gave up on it, thinking it was an incomprehensible story. I came back to the book because it was getting so much play.

But it is deeply flawed. A novel consists of many parts. The writer should be able to write. The characterLet me begin by saying I enjoyed this book. But it is deeply flawed. A novel consists of many parts. The writer should be able to write. The characters should be believable. The narrative should flow along to hold the reader's interest. And the story must be consistent. The first three parts are pretty much okay in the book. I read it with interest, got the characters, and it moved along nicely. But then the last part got me. The book is not consistent. Now, what do I mean by that. First, let me say that writing a novel is very difficult. It may seem easy, but it is not. You have to set a style, stick to it, and have all the plots and subplots converge at the end. This is true even if the book is part of a series. The Girl in the Lighthouse starts out as a historical novel. It tells of a young girl whose father is a lighthouse keeper in Maine. A lot is made of the two boys she befriends. All well and good. But suddenly she is transported to Georgia and finds herself in the clutches of a romance novel with an evil grandmother. Now don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with romance novels. They are usually very good stories. But the people who buy them know they are buying a romance. If you think you are reading a historical novel and it morphs into a romance, you might question what happened. And if you are going to be sent to an evil grandmother, the reason for it must be made clear. And what motivates her to evil must be hinted at, if not exactly stated. It is not enough to build up to a startling ending that tries to explain it all. For a hundred pages you are being told how awful this person is. And for those hundred or so pages you are totally in the dark. I think the author is better than this. It is clear that the story is not finished. You realize there must be a part two when you finish it. This is very unfair to the reader. If I were editing this book, I would have had Sanford chop out a good deal of the book because it does not advance the story. The 'romance' between Lillian and Warren stays in the same place for too many pages. The reader gets the idea and wants to move on. And if I were the editor I would have slapped her hand every time she typed ""his sea green eyes."" The beginning of the book was excellent. The second half was too long, too lacking in motivation, and too much like a romance novel, when it should have been the continuation of a historical novel.This book demonstrates the problems with self published books. There are two types of editing. First is copy editing, which finds misspellings, typos (and should have noticed that the Kindle edition does not indent paragraphs, which can be awfully confusing). The second type is content editing. Does the story make sense? Is the flow correct? Is the grandmother filled out. An author will always listen to a copy editor. Most think they don't need the other type. Big mistake.The book has become very popular and that's good. I just wish it was a little more finished.

I try to read forty books a year, but that can be very expensive. EBooks are cheaper. But now the publishers are forcing up the price of ebooks (I saw one recently where the ebook was more expensive than the paperback! But that's a different subject.) The counter to more expensive ebooks is causing an even bigger revolution, and I don't think the publishers realize it yet. The book in question is a self published ebook and cost the grand total of 99 cents. This is my third self published book, and it was by far the best I've read. In fact, I have no idea why no publisher picked it up because it was better than some of the mainline books I've read recently. It has some flaws, but they are minor. The story concerns a small town in Vermont. The recluse of the title is a woman with an anxiety disorder that keeps her from ever leaving the mansion she lives in that sits on a hill overlooking the town.

One of the flaws is that there is no real reason until the very end for the two story lines. I will give the author poetic license and forgive that minor problem. The other flaw, and I would like to advise the author on this. She seems to have no ear for dialog. The writing is fine, but no one talks like her characters. The language is far too formal.

This is a book I've always planned on reading and probably would never have thought of it if one of the people following my s didn't read it recently and bring it to mind. It's a very good book, the one good book Anderson had in him. It's more a series of related short stories about a small town in Ohio than a traditional novel and it is pivotal for a number of reasons. First, it treated sex realistically, which must have been scandalous when it was written. And it described the desperation of people, especially women, living in small town America. Winesburg must have been a terrible place to live. According to Anderson, there was not one happy person in the entire town. As I was reading it, I kept thinking of the lives of women today versus the lives then. The women he describes were unfulfilled, unhappy, unloved - I can't think of any more 'uns.' And I wonder if this work didn't play some small part in the mystique of the feminist movement. Feminism was a rebellion against the very things he was writing about. I've never believed that things were, or could be, as desperate for any human being as what he and the feminists described. But then again, he wrote a classic American novel and the feminists changed the world, so maybe I'm off base here. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 16, 2011","Sep 13, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80176.Winesburg_Ohio

Unfortunately, I came down on the side of hating it. What got me to buy the book in paperback (and not my usual Kindle version - something I never do) was the recommendations I saw for it. First, Harold Bloom, no less, called in one of the best novels of the 20th century, and then my son and his wife, both English professors, insisted I read it. With recommendations like that how could you go wrong. Well, I went very wrong. The book is well written, I'll give it that, but the story flat out does not exist - at least I couldn't find it in the 200 pages I managed to struggle through. The story concerns a family that has the power to see fairies. What this has to do with anything is beyond me. (Note that I just gave high marks to the Windup Bird Chronicle, so it's not that I'm apposed to magical realism). To say the story ambles along is to give it far more credit for speed than it deserves. Crowley's trick seem to be to lure you into interest with the start of a story (or sub story if you will), like when the grandson goes to live in the strange house in the city and meets a girl who might have the same fairy seeing power. Suddenly we might have a story. But no, just when that starts to get interesting we have to go back and describe summers when the boy was part of the main family. What happened to the girl? Who cares about the picnic he went on that has nothing to do with anything. A good book to me has first a story. A great book has that and characters you can see as clearly as your see your own family. Throw in great writing and you have a masterpiece. My experts, I guess, look for great writing at the expense of the other two items on my list.

It comes under the heading of magical realism, which may put some people off. Murakami is quite subtle, however, in that he goes quite a bit of the way into the novel before magical things start happening. By the time you get the magic, you've been hooked. The story concerns a Japanese lawyer who quits before his bar exam because he feels he doesn't want to be a lawyer. This gives him time to sit at home to think and investigate the neighborhood. He becomes enthralled by an abandoned house and makes friends with a fifteen year old girl who live across the alley from the house. Before you know it crazy things start happening.

It's the story of Emmett Love who is charged with taking five or six prostitutes and one mail-order bride from Rolla, Missouri, to Newton, Kansas, in 1856. Of course, the trip is grueling. As I said, the story is entertaining, but it leaves something to be desired. It has too many cliches. And some of the sex scenes are a bit over the top. (I find that in books I find less than literary they are usually done in by highly improbable sex scenes. The authors seem to require a sex scene when none is needed). The other fault is that none of the scenes seemed finished. By that I mean we never go under the surface to get the the real emotions of the characters.

It's a good old-fashioned multi-generational family saga that takes place in China. It was a huge best seller in China and has been made into an even more popular TV series. It covers the years from the 1930s to the present. Obviously a lot has happened in those years in China. The history is told through everyday lives of the main characters. The narrator is a very modern Chinese business woman. The story infolds as she thinks back on the city she came from, Old Town, and recounts her grandfather's life. Ninth Brother (names follow the Chinese way) becomes a Christian early on and holds to his faith through all the tribulations that follow. Ninth Brother was a good, simple man and it is this simplicity that the narrator, who lives a thoroughly hectic modern life seems to think China has lost. I thought the book was remarkable, too, in its portrayal of the cultural upheavals of the Mao years. It often criticizes the period and the various governments while at the same time maintaining that Communism has been good for China.

The individual scenes clip right along. A good read. Then why only three stars? Well, what bothered me was the structure of the book. It's not so much a story as a series of short stories. The scenes jump from past to present and back again. A character is focused on for a chapter, then disappears while a (sometimes vaguely related) character takes over the story. The writing, which reminds me somehow of Wired or Rolling Stone, keeps the flow interesting, but toward the end of the book it's difficult to remember who the characters are. For instance, the last chapter contains a character, Alex, who tries to remember a character from the beginning of the story who once worked for the man he is now working for. I couldn't figure out what the relationship between Alex and the earlier character was until I remembered a scene where he visited her once in the beginning of the book. Adults turn up who were children of characters that had a place in the story, but who didn't really fit in with main characters. All of this makes for a bit of confusion. I always believed that what marks a good novel is the change that takes place in a character. In going from A to B you begin to understand the character's life and how that life reflects your own. In this book, that progression is missing. Rather we jump from A to B without the space between that explains how we got there. And when you manage this jump for a large number of characters, I think that much of what makes a novel a novel is lost. It can be argued that writing must change and I should get with the program. But the Iliad has been around for 5 thousand years and it still works. Change is good. But so is a story that flows rationally and characters you have time to get to know completely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 18, 2011","Jun 18, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad

I grew up on a farm in New England and found little I recognized. It was praised for its depiction of a dying man and of his memories of his father and his love of fixing things - thus the title. Sorry, I did not connect. The novel has absolutely no plot. What was left then was the writing. That was what won it the critics praise and the prize. And this is what most bothered me. Self indulgent rambling is NOT beautiful writing. If I describe entering a room and saying hello to you in ten pages of musings on the love life of ants and the construction of window sashes in words with no poetic value it's a stretch to call my prose beautiful. When I think of beautiful writing I think of Proust or Lawrence Durrell in the Alexandria Quartet where the words flow like syrup to place you in the scene, to make you feel what the character is feeling. Wordsmithing doesn't do it. There will always be great writers, and maybe Harding will become one. What I question is will there be great readers?

And yet it's a really good read. There's something happening on almost every page. It's the story of the Vikings and takes place in the late 900's.

It's an old fashioned page turner in a setting that really no longer exists. It's about a train circus, set in 1931. A young college student jumps a passing train to escape a life falling apart around him and finds himself in a world of wild animals, clowns, performers, and roustabouts. Of course there are good and evil characters and a love story. The story is told through the memories of a 93 year old nursing home patient with a tendency to be grumpy. The circus is a world unto itself and Gruen has done a great job of capturing the color and flair of the traveling life as well as the hardship. I thought it odd that there was a great deal of male sex in the book (written by a women), but the brutality of the story is well placed in the setting.

I have trouble understanding what he was getting at in writing it. It's sort of a history of a place called Port Bonita in the far northwest corner of the US. Part of the story takes place in 1889/90. The rest takes place in 2006. The story isn't told as a normal progression - rather, he jumps between the two periods, telling fragments of stories at each jump. The stories involve a large cast of characters. The major flaw with this method of storytelling is that you never really have time to fully engage with the characters. And it's not always clear what one set of characters have to do with another. There is only one character in the modern part who can claim to be a direct descendant of a major character from the earlier part. The stories from all the different times and people are usually interesting, which leads me to think that this would have been a much better project if the author had written it as a series of connected short stories.

It's a history of the Korean War, but in the hands of a writer like Halberstam it becomes much more. It chronicles how domestic politics and influences can direct events in a way none of the participants can imagine. In 1948 Mao defeated the nationalist Chinese and took over China. At the time the Democrats had been in power for almost 20 years and the Republicans were desperate. They used the 'loss' of China as a wedge against the Truman administration. This was driven mostly by the China Lobby, which was made up of people whose only contact with China was from the description of missionaries who painted a idealistic picture of a nation dying to become Christian. Add to this the complimentary charge that the Truman administration was 'soft' on Communism and you have the stage set for the McCarthy hearings and a terrible war against Communism that killed thousands of young Americans and hundreds of thousands of young Chinese.This is history at it's very best. The forces that led to Korea also led to Vietnam and even to Iraq. What we saw in 1950 is what we are seeing today in our national politics.

I find they are either vapid or lame excuses for justification. This one sparked my interest when I heard Patti Smith interviewed on NPR. When it won the National Book Award I decided I'd give it a try. And I am very glad I did because it's an excellent book. First of all, it is beautifully written. Smith was a poet before she became a rocker and it clearly shows in the prose. The story recounts her friendship/affair with Robert Mapplethorpe - when they were just kids. They met by chance when she was eighteen and he, I think, twenty. They remained close until he died of Aids in his forties. I found two things remarkable in the story. First, her utter innocents when she headed off to New York to become an artist, pretty must without a dime. This was in the late sixties and New York was not a very safe place. The other thing that impressed me was that she managed to fit in with art scene and came to know almost everyone of note in that time of drugs and rock and roll. It's mostly the story of somehow getting by with almost no money until the breaks came. Of course, she fit in because she was smart and talented. Its the feeling of floating along with the tide and the wistfulness of memory that make the book flow. Mapplethorpe became the bad boy of art and is pretty much remembered for the terrible photographs he produced. This books redeems him somewhat without hiding the strange daemons that drove him. S&M and gay life were one of his subjects, but flowers were another. There are times toward the end of the book when it almost feels like she is name dropping, but I think she was just trying to fit everyone in. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 25, 2011","Jan 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/341879.Just_Kids

He's considered one of our greatest writers, after all. Up until now I've found him almost impenetrable. But I've decided to try. This is the first in the eight books I've chosen. Two impressions came to mind as I was reading. One was remembering as a young man my friends telling me I just had to meet these certain people who were oh so interesting and advanced. Meeting them never lived up to expectations. They were always just ordinary - or worse utter bores full of themselves. The other impression was of a group of teenage girls gossiping endlessly about their friends, squealing wildly about every factor of their lives. Both of these impressions are probably unfair to James. The story in question concerns a man who is sent to Paris to 'rescue' the son of a leading Massachusetts family who has fallen into the clutches of a French woman. The hero, a staid 58 year old, soon finds himself falling into the clutches of Paris itself. And he finds the son much improved by his relationship with a married countess. Of course, in James' time there was no talk of sex in novels - and more than likely none period. He has to sort of beat around the bush about what is really going on. I would think at the time this must have been a rather shocking novel. The problem with it is that there is too much beating around the bush. I think the story could have been told in half as many words. The ironical part is that as I waded through the squealing gossip and gave the 'oh so very interesting people' the benefit of the doubt, I actually began to LIKE the book.

If we went to his home - an English parsonage built in 1851 - for dinner we would, of course, talk about the house, but like all really great conversation the talk would ramble off in every direction with stories that had nothing to do with this particular house or houses in general for that matter only to touch base again and ramble of in another direction. That a discussion of English parsonages could cover the building of the Erie canal and the use of children in coal mines is not something usually found in history books - but can be found in a great dinner conversation. The fact that it is so rambling and disjointed caused one er on Amazon to give it a one star rating. Poor man. He missed the point. Try a little more wine and enjoy the conversation.

I think this is more because of what it represents than for the book itself. The book itself is quite dreadful. Frankenstein has been greatly helped by the many movies and Halloween costumes devoted to the character. Mary Shelley wrote at the height of Romanticism and the book is a sort of example of it's extremes. For instance, the monster tells of his pain with very elegant prose (as if he came from Eaton rather than a cemetery). What the book represents is a backlash against science, which, with the industrial revolution, was transforming Mary Shelley's world. The landed gentry saw the rise of industrial wealth as an invasion of the vulgar into their refined drawing rooms. The non-landed were supposed to know their place. The ugliness of the monster represents the ugliness of the new world order. Dr. Frankenstein's sin is that he created his new order through science. For all the overblown writing and the longing for nature, what turned me against it was that I sympathized more with the monster than with Dr. Frankenstein. All the poor monster wants is a companion like himself and he will go away. Frankenstein will have none of that! No more factories! This rejection by the good doctor sets the stage for desolation. A book we should perhaps all read. But quite dreadful for all that.

Hume is one of the easier philosophers to read - his writing is clear and precise. That is not so say that he is light - he is one of the most influential philosophers of the modern era. This work is posed as a dialog between three friends who attempt to determine the place of religion in the education of the young man who is narrating the dialog. It gets into the nature of God, how man can know God, and the influence of God in the life of man. Hume was a great and famous skeptic, but in this work he comes to the conclusion that religion is valuable as a moral guide to man however tenuous it claims.

String theory is the latest way physicists are trying to connect relativity theory with quantum mechanics. Most people are familiar with relativity theory. Greene gives the best description of it I have ever read. Quantum mechanics is the other side of physics. Where relativity theory tries to explain the workings of the greater universe, quantum mechanics tries to explain the working of atoms. The two views of the universe - the very large and the very small - should fit into the same theoretical framework. Unfortunately they don't reconcile. String theory is the latest attempt to come up with one grand theory that explains both the large and the small while keeping relativity theory and quantum mechanics in place.This sounds too complex for words, but Greene makes it all very understandable and clear. At least until he gets into multi-dimensional strings, which only the most fervent can understand. This is all, of course, based on mathematics (he describes one physicist who has an equation 1000 pages long!) but the only equation given in the book is E=mc squared, which we've all seen before. Most of his examples of what's going on are based on everyday things.

Ahamed tells the story of the men who ruled the financial world from 1914 to the start of World War II. I've read quite a few books on this period. All try to explain not only what happened but why it happened. This book, I think, answers the question of not only how and why the great nations of the world destroyed themselves, but also explains how we cam to depend so heavily on central banks today. Ahamed tells the story with great clarity and (sometimes) humor.

Each period reflects it's own writing style. But writing alone is not enough to make a good book. The various 'stories' in the book seem to have no relation to each other. There is always a reminder of a previous time/story/plot or even a reference to characters in them but only indirectly so. The 'stories' are told in parts and seem to stop abruptly in the middle. Only after all the half stories have been told does he go back and finish them giving the book a pattern of A B C D E D C B A. Which brings me to what it is he's trying to say in the novel. What the heck is it about? Well, it seems to me he's trying to tell us that man is corrupt and is corrupting the planet - we're destroying all that is natural and honest and always have been. In fact, in the distant future we will retreat back into barbarism. And it all began two hundred years ago.

It was fun and fast moving enough that I could overlook the the quirks in Brown's writing. This time, ignoring them is a little more difficult because the story is so ridiculous. The Da Vinci Code was at least possible. The same cannot be said for this clunker. First, we are asked to believe that the 'ancients' had a wisdom they thought mankind was not ready for, so they buried it somewhere in Washington, DC. Once revealed, this wisdom would change everything. Those old boys knew the TRUTH (this emphasis should be in italics in the Brownian style, but I don't know how to do italics in this ) Most of the book, when it's not describing the villain's sinewy legs, deals with deciphering a Masonic map that supposedly tells where the Sacred Mysteries, as they are called, are buried. This is so important even the CIA is involved!!! There are secret passages and hidden rooms and all sorts of things that delight a pre-adolecent. But just as we draw near to the great ancient treasure house of wisdom it somehow morphs into a WORD of wisdom. By the time we narrow it down to a word I know what the word is - HOGWASH. Everything, of course, gets resolved in the end, but we a left none the wiser. I never believed the ancients were anything but ignorant, aristocratic, superstitious, muddlers anyway. People rushed out to buy this book because of The Da Vinci Code. I doubt if there will be a rush for the next one. Because the story is so lame, all of Brown's faults as a writer come through. HE USES ITALICS FOR EMPHASIS, because using good writing is more difficult. He uses 'facts' to prove his point - endlessly.

Life was hard and cruel, but it was a period of deep religious faith. Cantor makes it all very interesting.It was good to read something substantial. I needed that before tackling The Lost Symbol, which tries to convince us that the ancients knew secrets we are not capable of handling.

The events of the days during and after the great feat are told in a series of first person narratives that have nothing to do with the walker.

It chronicles how the conservative Republicans set out to destroy the government. This sounds too crazy to believe, but this is a story I've read of elsewhere (ie. see The Right Nation by the man who writes Lexington for the Economist, for instance). Mr. Frank actually quotes from Grover Norquist's speeches and writings where he, along with many others, sets out the plan. The idea was to privatize where possible (Blackwater and FEMA) to cripple the bureaucracy by under funding it and shrinking the work force (EPA and FDA) and by running up such dept that the liberals would not be able to fund social programs (a trillion+ dollars now). All this would allow business to prosper and the rich to get richer (look at CEO pay). This is a well documented history, not a made up rant.The problem with the book is the author's absolute loathing of everything these people did.

The book is a rewrite of three novels Matthiessen published about 30 years ago. He claims he dropped about 400 pages from the original, but in my mind 400 was not enough. The book could easily have been about half as long as it is (over 900 pages).The story revolves around one E.J.Watson who was a planter in the Florida keys with a storied, violent past. Out of fear of him, his neighbors one day assassinate him as he comes into town. I'm giving nothing away since this happens in the first few pages of the book. The rest of the novel is dedicated to trying to figure out whether he was the monster everyone took him to be. It's told in three sections; one a description of what his neighbors saw and believed, one where his son tries to establish his innocence, and a third where he tells his own story. At least I think that was the third story because by then I found the constant repetition of theme so boring I gave up on it.The writing is very good and the description of the everglades is outstanding. (What a horrible place to live). It's the story that's the problem. I have lost faith in the National Book award. The last few years it has picked books that are pretentious but boring.

The story is very localized to Sweden, but somehow that doesn't matter at all (you would certainly get more from it if you knew Stockholm and the rural parts of Sweden) because the story is so good. At the start a journalist (very much like the author) has been convicted of libel. He is in disgrace and must lay low for a while.

All to often they ignore the classics because they are too long. When Dickens is offered most people turn to A Tale of Two Cities or Oliver Twist because they are short and they come away not liking Dickens that much. All I can say is read the long ones. Bleak House is long but well worth the read. It's Dickens' second best book in my estimation (Martin Chizzlewit is my favorite). It concerns a property law case that has been before the Chancery court for years and years and the young people who stand to win or loose by the outcome. Dickens has ample opportunity to poke fun at the court and does so hilariously. He also introduces a huge array of characters that paint a picture of London that resonates still. (When we think of Victorian England we see it through Dickens' eyes and we still use those images every Christmas. I can't think of another author in the history of writing who has left such a mark). Bleak House introduces scores of characters and subplots, but never looses its way. It is a brilliant novel and anyone who loves reading should give it a try.

This (and the other two in the set) is the best biography I have ever read. Lyndon Johnson was without doubt the most complex man who has ever been president. Good and evil. Noble and petty. The most ambitious, power hungry man who ever lived, greedy beyond words, he did more for the poor and downtrodden than perhaps any politician in our history. He went into politics with $1000 to his name and was worth $17 million when he became president - the the help of a Texas company called Brown and Root who eventually became Haliburton.

Office work is even worse because very little happens. What fascinates about an office is rumor, speculation, gossip, and inter-relationships. Making such unrelated material interesting is hard. Joshua Ferris has succeeded brilliantly. For anyone who has ever worked in an office, especially one in the throes of a layoff, this book will ring absolutely true. It is both funny and sad, and it's exagerations only bring the zanyness of an office more to life.
