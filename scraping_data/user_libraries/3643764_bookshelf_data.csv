Set in tThe Nature of Fragile Things is not a writing masterpiece or particularly deep but it was a compelling story and I found it hard to put down. Set in the early 20th century in California, the story starts around the time of the San Francisco earthquake and focuses on the story Sophie tells about her marriage to a man she meets through a newspaper advertisement. From the beginning, we know that the man disappeared during the earthquake and that Sophie did not report him missing until some time later. There are multiple layers of mystery in the story so I will say no more to avoid spoilers. I liked Sophie's personality and her voice. I liked the slow unveiling of the mysteries. I liked how the story ended. Good entertaining novel with plenty of drama and feel good moments.

The story is told from the perspective of Leo, a documentary film maker, as a documentary is being made of him, as he is dying of cancer. His mind wanders. He seems intent on telling truths that no one knows but it’s not clear what is true and what he is imagining. As the story progresses, Leo’s fragmented narrative becomes more intense. After a while, he lost me. I could appreciate what Banks was doing intellectually, but I lost interest in the story. At the end the day, it’s a bit suffocating to be stuck in someone else’s fragmented wandering dying mind. It was an interesting idea. There were moments of brilliance. But it didn’t sustain me, and I felt myself wandering back to my own thoughts. This was a buddy read with Diane and Angela.

She grew up in East Prussia, which was part of Germany before and during WWII, and is now part of Poland. A few years before Inge died, O’Donnell broke through her grandmother’s silence and found out much of what happened to her during WWII and in the few years after. Silence was how Inge and her generation dealt with the atrocities Germany committed during the war and their own hardships in that time. O’Donnell broke through Inge’s silence with trepidation; she did not know in advance on what side of history she would find her grandmother and other relatives stood. O’Donnell writes with compassion but historical realism about Inge’s life as a German teenager and young woman living through the war and after. I really liked how O’Donnell writes with self-reflection about Inge and the historical context.

For now, I really enjoyed this essay about Patchett’s friendship with Tom Hanks’ assistant, SoukI’m looking forward to reading this whole collection. For now, I really enjoyed this essay about Patchett’s friendship with Tom Hanks’ assistant, Souki. Patchett first struck up a friendship with Souki through email, and then invited her to stay with her and her husband in Nashville so Souki could receive experimental treatment for pancreatic cancer - at the beginning of the pandemic no less. It’s much more than an essay about friendship. There are so many rich strands to this essay. Patchett reflects on how she puts her stories together, on how you get to know someone, on illness, kindness and gratitude, and on much more. I loved how Patchett makes short shrift of Souki’s gratitude by saying that she should have known that the cost of living with a writer is that you will be written about. As I say, this is a good taste of what promises to be a rich collection.

The story is set a few years in the future on a street in a Long Island neighborhood, with a focus on two families. The story takes place one extremely hot summer. A sink hole opens up. The tensions between the families escalate. Other families take sides. The children have more sense than their parents. I understand that this was meant to be a reflection of our times -- where we're heading if environmental issues are unchallenged and if people remain susceptible to mob influence and misinformation -- but I found it all a bit too much. There were too many issues and the characters and their actions and reactions were too extreme for my tastes. There are lots of positive s but this one didn't really work for me.

No point saying much about the plot other than it’s a tense tight story about motherhood. Is there something wrong with Blythe as a mother? Is there something wrong with her daughter Violet? No holds barred in plumbing the dark side of maternal self-doubt. Audrain knows how to write. There is depth to the characters and nuance to the emotions and story. But...

For some reason, it took me forever to get through this one. I wanted a quick intense thriller or mystery and I felt like I got bogged down in a murky labyrinth. The premise was interesting. A few years back, Matt’s brother is sent to jail for the murder of his teenage girlfriend. Flash forward a few years, and the rest of Matt’s family dies while on a trip to Mexico. Are the two incidents connected? The whole story has a media overlay because Matt’s family has developed a level of notoriety due to a documentary on Netflix. My interest picked up at the end, but overall I found this one a bit disjointed and also that there wasn’t much depth or originality to the characters. There are good s for this one, so I suspect it just wasn’t for me.

It felt uneven. It is set in the late 19th century in what seems to be the southwestern United States in a community where women are labelled as witches if they don’t have children. At 19, Ada is banished from her family and community because she still has not had a baby after a year of marriage. She finds her way to a group of other women who have been banished and live on the proceeds of crime. I liked the first third in which we see Ada with her family and the community that turns on her. But I found that the rest of the book tried to do too much. There was a lot of action and adventure. The story cycled — too quickly and superficially in my opinion — through a lot of issues — like racism, mental illness, homophobia, etc... And, other than Aida, we never really get to know the characters other than quite superficially. I read this as a buddy read with Angela and Diane. As always, it’s great to share the reading experience even if we don’t necessarily agree.

Set in the 1950s and 60s, the story focuses on a family in a coastal town, Burnt Harbor, Maine. Liddie and her husband Henry return go live in Liddie's family home, where Liddie's mother, Margreete, is developing dementia. There, Liddie and Henry raise their three children, while all keeping an eye out for Margreete. The family goes through ups and downs, sometimes at odds with each other, but still functioning as a complicated organic unit. The writing is great -- understated with an occasional flourish. The characters are ordinary and real -- and very relate-able. The sense of time and place is strong -- civil rights, Vietnam war, etc... -- without making this an issues novel. I especially loved the depiction of how the family relates to Margreete -- she is never defined by her dementia. This was a monthly buddy read with Angela and Diane. I went in with no expectations but we all ended up loving this one. It was hard not to get attached to this family and I definitely was not ready for the story to end.

The story is told primarily from Fern's point of view with some diary entries by Rose. On the surface, Fern struggles with ordinary life -- she is awkward with people, uncomfortable with light and noise and generally idiosyncratic. Rose appears to be her protector. But are things as they seem? I really liked Fern's character and I liked the relationship she develops with her co-workers at the library and with a patron at the library. But the ""things are not what they seem to be"" plot line between the sisters was quite predictable. I have read several of Hepworth's novels. This was not my favourite.

Her mother was Armenian American. Her mother left when she was three years old. She lived with an aunt in England until her father and stepmother took her and her sister to live in Italy. Her father died when she was 14 and she lived in different parts of Africa with her stepmother, sister and half brother until she was 18, when she moved to the US. There are no spoilers in what I have just described. This is all clear from the outset. But Owusu’s beautiful memoir is a long meditation on the repercussions of this life without stability or a clear sense of identity. She moves back and forth in time and place, always coming back to a few days in her late 20s when her life seemed to have fallen apart. Owusu’s writing is rich and intense. Her thoughts about identity are interesting and nuanced. At times, it was a bit claustrophobic to be so immersed in Owusu’s head. But overall, Aftershocks was well worth reading for Owusu’s life experience and broader insights.

The story is told from Ambrosia’s point of view, moving back and forth between her undergraduate years and 10 years later when she is newly married. Something terrible happened when Ambrosia was in college and she doesn’t want her husband to find out. But she feels compelled to go to her 10 year reunion. In general terms, it’s easy to see where the story is going. But Ambrosia’s personality and the clever end throw a bit of a wrench in the predictability of the story.

She knows how to tug at my heartstrings without leaving me feeling manipulated. A Town Called Solace in no exception. Set in the early 1970s, in a small town in northern Ontario, this is a beautiful story -- full of sadness, things left unsaid, people trying to be kind and people trapped by the limits of their own personalities and circumstances. The story is told from three points of view. Clara is seven years old and is worried about her sister Rose's recent disappearance. Elizabeth, Clara's neighbour, tells her story from her hospital bed as she lies dying. Liam moves into Elizabeth's house, with his own complicated baggage. There's a beautiful symmetry in the connection between these three characters. The story telling is low key but the emotions are intense.

The stories are set in Maine and span from early 20th century to 2017. They focus on a series of character related by blood or marriage. This is an impressive first work of fiction. I did not love every story and I found them a bit uneven in tone -- most were dark and melancholy whereas a couple aimed at humour but felt a bit like caricatures. But a few stories knocked my socks off so I am forgiving of the inconsistencies. To my surprise, one of my favourites featured a ghost -- what if you died and were able to hear your adult children's reactions and musings about your life... I will definitely look for Winslow's next fictional work. This was a buddy read with Angela and Diane, and, as usual, so nice to read with them.

In a number of parallel narratives, Engel depicts a Columbian/American family struggling with the realities of choosing between two difficult realities. Mauro and Elena meet as teenagers in Columbia. After having their first child, they migrate to the US. They have two more children, after which Maur0 is deported back to Columbia. Elena soon sends their youngest child back to live in Columbia with her mother and Mauro. Most of the narrative takes place 15 years later, told from the points of view of all family members who have lived different and separate realities. Talia, the youngest, is scheduled to go back to the United States. But it's really not clear that she will make it. The plot is unconventional. The characters are strong. And the writing is immediate.

And it's hard to describe why because there's not much to the plot and the writing and pacing are so understated. This short novel focuses on Zorrie's life, from beginning to end. It starts just after the depression in Indiana, where Zorrie has lived with a harsh aunt and must quickly figure out how to make her own way in the world. She works briefly in a factory in Illinois, where they use radium to paint clock faces. She then moves back to a farming community in Indiana where she spends the rest of her life living and working on a farm. She has her share of hardship and heartbreak, but also some good relationships and the satisfaction of working hard and making order in her life. There really isn't much to say about the story. Zorrie's strength is the writing. Hunt conveys Zorrie's emotions perfectly with deceptively simple language and without melodrama. By the end, Zorrie felt like a real person -- a distant relative who lived a good but melancholy life. It was hard not to mourn the end of her life as I finished the novel. This was a buddy read with Diane and Angela and we all loved it.

I liked aspects of Trio, but I felt it didn't quite deliver. Set in 1968 in Brighton, the story focuses on three characters linked to the shooting of a cheesy film. Annie is the star and her life is complicated by past and current lovers. Elfrida is the director's wife, trying to resurrect her career as a novelist, while rationalizing her ever escalating drinking. And Talbott is one of the producers, walking a fine line between a secret life and his professional life. Boyd is great at creating a strong sense of time and place. While the characters were not particularly likable, they were interesting in their flaws. But the plot felt somewhat aimless and plodding. I liked Any Human Heart enough to remain a Boyd devotee. I still love how he grounds his characters in their historical contexts. But I know not to expect to love each of his books. This was a buddy read with Diane and Angela.

""Sonya"" is the code name for a woman of German Jewish descent who was enlisted as a Soviet spy in her 20s. She lived in China, the Soviet Union and Switzerland and ended up living in England for several years, seemingly as an English housewife, but meanwhile passing important secrets to the Soviets. Later in life, she lived in East Germany, where she became a children's author. Meanwhile, she had three children, none of them knowing her background until later in life. Ben McIntyre does a great job of depicting ""Sonya""'s life and personality and what motivated her. It's a sympathetic portrait of an unconventional, fearless and adventurous woman. I listened to the audio, which McIntyre narrates in his beautiful British accent. I would have liked to know more about the perspective of Sonya's children on their mother but, otherwise, his was great. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in 20th century cold war history. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Oct 31, 2020","Nov 30, 2020","Oct 31, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya

It’s not perfect, bur it’s very much the type of novel I love to sink my teeth in. There are two timelines. In the earlier timeline, in 1972, an American family lives in Bangkok. From the outset, we know that one of the children went missing while they were there. In the later timelines, in 2019, the younger sister, Laura, receives an email suggesting that her brother has been found. The earlier timeline is seen from multiple points of view, with everyone caught up in the drama in their own heads. The later timeline is mostly seen from the perspective of Laura, who has lived all these years with the emotional fallout of her brother’s disappearance. The writing is strong. The plotting is intricate. There is a delicious edge of your seat tension to both storylines. And there is a subtle— but not preachy — commentary about colonialism and class. My only real criticism is that I wasn’t very interested in the subplot involving Laura’s melodramatic contemporary relationships. But otherwise it was a good read.

I really couldn’t get into all the magic in a contemporary setting. So I was pretty nervous about reading Magic Lessons, but it was a buddy read and I was willing to give it a try.I’m glad I did. It took me a while, but around a third of the way in, I realized that I was hooked... I think magic works better for me if it’s in the past. Regardless, I really liked both the story and the historical setting. The story starts in the mid-1600s in England and moves to the end of the century through Curaçao and then to the United States - including Salem - at a time when witches were persecuted. The story focuses on Maria Owens, who is born with special powers and an unusual independent streak. There’s some love, lots of heartbreak, adventure, courage, complicated parent-child relations, politics, a lovely crow and lots of magical spells. In the hands of a different writer, this would not have worked for me. But Hoffman does such a good job of creating great characters and a complex plot, that I ended up feeling enchanted by this one.Thanks to Netgalley and Edelweiss for giving me access to advance copies. And I’m so glad to have read this one with my reading buddies Diane and Angela — I don’t think I would have read it otherwise and it was lovely as always to read together....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Oct 17, 2020","Oct 25, 2020","Sep 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892349-magic-lessons

The story is set in San Francisco in the 1980s, told from the perspective of 13 year old Eulabee. Eulabee is both so so smart and so so deluded as only 13 year old girls can be. She goes to an elite private school, feels on top of the world, in awe her best friend Maria Fabiola. In no time, everything turns upside down. I loved how Vida managed to convey the melodramatic headspace of a thirteen year old girl without telling a melodramatic story. I loved the last chapter when we catch up with Eulabee at age 50.

Akhtar writes a fictional account of his adult life with a special focus on his father. His parents are originally from Pakistan and he grew up in Milwaukee where his father worked as a cardiologist. Nothing about Akhtar’s perspective or his parents’ perspective is predictable or simplistic. Akhtar dwells on contemporary politics and issues of belonging and not belonging.

Set in contemporary London, the story dives deep into complicated contemporary dynamics. Zara is a former barrister, who now works with victims of sexual assault.

This novel takes place in the mid 19th century at the end of the gold rush in the UnitedA high 4 stars!What a beautifully written and original story! This novel takes place in the mid 19th century at the end of the gold rush in the United States. The story is told primarily from the point of view of Lucy, a young Chinese American girl who's parents hoped to find fortune during the gold rush. At the beginning of the novel, Lucy and her sibling Sam are left alone after both parents have died and they must figure out how to survive. From there, the story goes back and then forward in time, showing us how Lucy and Sam came to be where they are and where they end up. C Pam Zhang writes beautifully. Much is left unsaid, and we are left to understand the story through Lucy's impressions. The story has a very bleak feel and Zhang does not romanticize or sugar coat any of her characters and their actions. But this makes for a story with complex characters and a different perspective on a familiar time in American history. I don't like historical fiction that romanticizes history. This is my kind of historical fiction. I had the pleasure of reading this one with my readings buddies, Diane and Angela. During these challenging times, connections with friends are especially important.

I absolutely loved the part of the book that focused on Ivy’s childhood and early adolescence and thought the part that focused on her adult life was more ordinary. Ivy starts life off as the daughter of poor Chinese immigrants in New Jersey. Yang does a superb job of depicting Ivy’s complicated inner life and attempts to navigate between her family and school life. Flash forward several years and Ivy reunites with old school friends in ways that conflict with different layers of her past. I won’t say more to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say that this was worth reading. Ivy is an original character and Yang breaks lots of conventions in her depiction. But, in my humble opinion, her character lost its complexity in the later part of the story. I nevertheless look forward to seeing what Yang writes next.

There was a lot of depth to the story and characters. Big Summer was worth reading but not quite as satisfying. The story is told from Daphne’s point of view and focuses on her friendship with Drue. Daphne is now a plus sized social media influencer but it was a long road to her own self-acceptance. Drue wasn’t much help when they were teenagers — playing her like a yo-yo. In their early 20s, Drue re-enters Daphne’s life to ask her to be a bridesmaid. Daphne can’t figure out Drue’s motivation but can’t resist Drue’s lure. There’s some romance, a mystery and quite a few pulls at the heartstrings. Weiner draws on lots of themes in Big Summer — body shaming, social media and class differences, to name a few. I liked Daphne and I also liked that Drue was not uni-dimensional. I didn’t love the mystery and I especially didn’t like its resolution. This was really a mixed bag. Entertaining but not as strong as Mrs. Everything.

It’s a mystery focused on a deadly opiate making the rounds in Vancouver, British Columbia. The investigators are an emergency room doctor and a police detective, with their own pasts and a romantic interest in each other. The author himself is an emergency doctor in Vancouver, where he clearly deals with many opiate deaths. It’s not a complex mystery, but it makes its point without being pedantic, moves quickly and pulls at the heartstrings. This is the type of books that seems to work well for me these days.

The writing was good. But I just couldn’t get into the story. Unfortunately, reading Simon the Fiddler felt like a real slog to me. In his early 20s, Simon is an orphan making his way through the south toward the end of the American Civil war. He is conscripted against his will, and meets a small group of other musicians. Once the war ends, they make their way into Texas, as Simon tries to find Doris, a young Irish maid he caught sight of at one of the band’s gigs. I really liked Doris, but most of the story focused on Simon, his band members and their adventures. I just didn’t feel engaged or particularly interested in Simon and his challenges on the road to finding Doris. It felt a bit too predictable and slapstick — lots of action but a bit thin on emotional depth. But don’t trust my reaction. This was a monthly buddy read with Angela and Diane, and they liked it more than I did.

I have been distracted by the relentless scary news about covid 19. As I hunker down with my family, I'm hoping to get back into reading as a form of relief...Brian Panowich writes a good mean story. I've read all of his previous boos. Hard Cash Valley fits right in there. I'm not going to give much of a description to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say that we're back in McFalls County. Dane Kirby, who works for the FBI, is called upon to help with a murder investigation that starts in Florida but leads back to cockfighting in McFalls County.

Michael and Caitlin have been lovers for years. They meet once a month on Coney Island. The rest of the time, they endure marriages that seem to have long passed their expiration dates. O’Callaghan paints one of their afternoons together, while flashing back to parts of their separate lives. The writing and attention to detail is absolutely beautiful. At times, the emotional pitch felt almost overwhelming or suffocating. But I really appreciate O’Callaghan’s craftsmanship and the complex emotional and moral vortex he plunged me into.

I keep trying and they don’t quite work for me. I know why I keep trying. The settings and atmosphere are alluring. But the stories always end up feeling overwrought. I liked Unwilling more than The Hush, but I still found the emotions and story to be a bit much. The story is set in 1972, and focuses on two brothers, Jason and Gibby. A third brother, Robert, was killed in the Vietnam war. Jason is a Vietnam vet and just out of jail for drug offences. He has lots of dark secrets. And Gibby is 18, just graduating from high school, and trying to decide which of his older brothers to model himself off. Great set up, right? But it’s all shot to pieces by some crazy storyline involving over the top psychopaths lurking in the background. Enough said. I didn’t hate it, but I wish Hart toned it down.

There is a terrible drought in Peaches, and many of its residents are in the grip of a cult led by Vern, who promises that the drought will end if the members of the cult do his bidding. His idea of what the members should do is pretty outlandish and brutal. Lacey May is 14 years old, and it seems that nothing good has ever happened to her. Her mother is an alcoholic who has had a series of bad boyfriends. The cult was meant to be Lacey May and her mother's salvation, but it doesn't do much to improve Lacey May's life. Lacey May starts off as a believer but her eyes gradually open to what is really happening in her community. There's a surreal and dark tone to Godshot. It's not quite clear when the story takes place and all of the characters and events are pushed to the extreme. For much of the novel, I liked the idea more than I enjoyed the story. But the end was very strong and I found myself much more emotionally engaged in the last few chapters as I rooted for Lacey May.

Told in 1000 short segments, it tells the story of two men who have lost daughters to violence — one is Israeli and the other is Palestinian. This is based on a true story. Rami and Bassam are joined together in their grief and through the united project of finding a road to peace. The fragments of McCann’s brilliant narrative go back and forth in time, zeroing in on different parts of these characters’ lives and families, weaving in scraps of history, politics and nature and seemingly random anecdotes and thoughts. I can’t really do justice to the power of this book through my . As I read some parts — especially those dealing with Rami and Bassam’s grief and their paths forward — I found myself holding my breath in awe. What was not perfect? At times, I found myself losing focus — this is a long book with many tangents. But this is a minor flaw.This won’t be for everyone. It’s not a straightforward narrative and it’s infused with a political message. But it really turned my crank.I think I’ve given a five star rating to every one of McCann’s books I’ve read.

I loved The Dept. of Speculation and, again, loved Weather. This is a very short novel, told through a series of first person vignettes. The narrator is a librarian, living in New York with her husband and young son, and eventually her addict brother. Each paragraph is a quick impressionistic reflection on the library’s patrons, parenthood, the state of her marriage, her “enmeshment” with her brother, climate change and the state of the world — with an occasional joke thrown in.

In very bare terms, it’s the story of two families who become new neighbours, and what that does to them and the neighbourhood. There is tension between the adults and a budding romance between their older teens. A complicating and crucial factor is that one family is African American and the other family is white.There was lots I loved about A Good Neighborhood. I loved the way the story was told from the perspective of the neighbours as a chorus. I loved the mother son relationship between Valerie and Xavier. I found the ending difficult but necessary. The issue at the centre of the story is pressing and Fowler didn’t shy away from its ugliness. And it was really hard to put down. My only criticism is that the main characters were arranged a bit too tidily on the good/bad spectrum.

This novel was barely published a week ago and it has already generated such polarized reactions.

It starts with the murder of Lydia’s whole family, except her son Luca, in Acapulco, and continues on as their perilous journey through Mexico to the United States. On their journey, they meet many people. It’s never easy to know who to trust and it’s not possible to survive without trusting some strangers. Early in their journey, Lydia and Luca meet two teenage girls, Rebecca and Soledad, who are also escaping violence, in their case from Honduras. Cummins keeps the tension and fear at a maximum from beginning to end. Survival is far from guaranteed, and even those who survive become different people.I’m not sure how realistic Lydia and Luca’s characters are as illegal migrants to the US. They come from a middle class intellectual background and Luca is a child prodigy. But I found it hard not to care about these characters, especially Luca and the teenage girls, and I appreciated the vivid picture Cummins painted of their journey.It’s not a masterpiece. One of the niggly things that bothered me is that, toward the end, the story suddenly shifted from only being told from Lydia and Luca’s points of view to being told from several other points of view. But is was a solid 4 star read for readability and emotional engagement.This was a monthly buddy read with Angela and Diane. I think we all had similar reactions. I’m really glad to have read this one as a buddy read....more",Notes are private!,0,144,1,"Jan 23, 2020","Jan 26, 2020","Dec 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046527-american-dirt

Again, I was compulsively consumed by the story. Shay is living in New York, leading a ho-hum life. One day, she sees a young woman jump in front of the subway. This changes everything for Shay. Oddly, at first, it seems to change this for the better... To say more would be to say too much.The end left a few loose ends and didn’t quite deliver the same kind of aha moment as the previous novels by these authors.

Ava is an Irish expat living in Hong Kong, where she teaches English. The story focuses on Ava’s inner tortured thoughts and feelings as she feels the pull between relationships with English expat banker Julian and local lawyer Edith. Ava does all the wrong things. She can’t commit to the one she loves and she sticks to the one she knows treats her poorly. It’s well written but I have no patience right now for self-absorbed self-loathing. I think I’m also probably a bit too old to relate to these characters’ sensibilities. It took me way too long to read this relatively short book because my attention was easily diverted by other things. As I say, it’s well written so I may simply be the wrong audience or this might be the wrong time.

I like a good mystery but I rarely give 5 stars to any books in the genre. But The Familiar Dark gripped me from beginning to end. The story is set in a small town in Missouri. The story starts with the murder of two twelve year olds and is told from the perspective of one of their mothers, Eve. Eve grew up in the “hollers” under the thumb of a violent and harsh meth selling mother. When she got pregnant, Eve was determined to give her own daughter a different childhood than her own. Her daughter’s death and her path to figuring out who did it opens lots of wounds and questions. I loved this book because it has all the necessary ingredients for a good page turning mystery: gritty without being too violent, great characters, real emotions, surprising twists without being over the top and a strong narrative voice. Eve and her mother were especially good characters. This was the first book I’ve read by Amy Engel but it won’t be my last.

I’ve never read anything by Britt Bennett but this won’t be my last. The story focuses on twin sisters, Desiree and Stella, and their daughters, Jude and Kennedy. The twins come from Mallard, Louisiana, where having light skin is greatly valued. The twins’ skin is light enough that Stella decides to “pass” as white and disappears from Desiree’s life in the late 1960s when they are in their early 20s. The story then moves back and forth in time and from the different characters’ perspectives. Bennett’s writing is lovely, making the read smooth and engaging. The structure of the story is original. And the story and characters kept me interested and curious from beginning to end. Can’t ask for anything better in a novel — especially at a time when I find it challenging to find novels that keep my attention.

She’s a corporate lawyer in New York City and she happily calibrates every minute of her day. She has a five year plan that includes being a partner at her firm and marrying her corporate finance boyfriend. The only part of her life that is a bit less controlled is her strong bond with her childhood friend Bella. Then a dream or premonition shakes her up — she sees herself in 2015 with a man who isn’t her boyfriend. This part seemed hokey. But the story doesn’t end up going where I expected. This is really a lovely emotional story about friendship. I won’t say more to avoid spoilers. But Kleenex is a must! Short and powerful and worth the read.

I started reading a book that my Kindle said was Such a Fun Age. About 10% of the way in, I thought the story has nothing to do with the description, and I went back to the title page, only to discover I was reading a completely different book — The Supper Club. By that point, I really wasn’t enjoying it much. Most human beings in this situation would stop reading and find the book they meant to read. But not me. Once I’ve started reading a book, even if I don’t much like it, I have trouble putting on the brakes...And I wish my accidental reading of The Supper Club had led me to discover a book I loved. But, alas, no such luck. The Supper Club is primarily about Roberta, a young woman living in contemporary England. The story focuses on two alternating times in her life — when she was a young university student and a few years later when she is in her late 20s. Roberta is deeply lonely and socially awkward. Her relationships with men and friends are fractious and difficult. But she and her friend Stevie land on a liberating idea — a small club of young women who have supper together every now and then where they break through many conventional norms — food comes from dumpsters, they drink a lot and take drugs, they vomit, they wear weird costumes, and they dance late into the night. I get it the concept. I also recognize that Roberta’s troubles are borne out of legitimate trauma. And some of the writing was top notch. But I just couldn’t get into Roberta’s sad anxious headspace. It was all a bit too claustrophobic for me. This is probably better suited to a younger audience. There was some great information about food and cooking, but otherwise this was not for me.The good news is that I finished The Supper Club quickly because it’s quite short, and then moved on to Such a Fun Age, which I really liked...Thanks to the publisher for the inadvertent advance copy.

The story certainly pulled me in, but at the beginning it felt kind of simple, almost gossipy. But by the end, it had a symmetry that was very clever and left me with a pleased smile on my face. The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Emira and Alix. Emira is a 25 year old African American struggling to make ends meet and to figure out what she wants to do with herself. For the time being, Emira works part time babysitting Alix’s 3 year old. Alix is a white upper class woman in her 30s, recently transplanted from Manhattan to Philadelphia. Both women are surrounded by a chorus of three best friends. The story starts with a late night incident in a high end supermarket involving Emira and Alix’s daughter — the security guard and a customer assume that Emira has no business being with a white toddler close to midnight in a fancy part of town. From there, Emira has to deal with Alix’s not so altruistic desire to befriend her... She also has to deal with the attraction of a bystander who caught the whole thing on video... I won’t say more to avoid spoilers other than to say that the novel works well because Reid doesn’t take the story in predictable directions. And, while she takes on some politically loaded themes, this is not a didactic story. Some may bristle at a big coincidence in the story, but it’s absolutely necessary to the plot. I certainly understand why this one is getting some buzz.

Shuggie’s mother is a severe alcoholic. As the youngest child of the family, Shuggie’s early life is entirely tied to his mother’s moods and drinking cycles. While his two older siblings manage to escape, Shuggie remains loyal and miserable. It doesn’t help that he is gay and can’t seem to find a comfortable place amongst his peers. Set in Scotland in the 1980s, this semi autobiographical novel is a heart-wrenching portrait of the devastation addiction can cause. There is empathy for Shuggie’s mother and some acts of kindness and love, but mostly this is a harsh portrait. It took me a while to read Shuggie Bain, partially because it’s long and also because it’s painful, but it was well worth reading.

It was still a good read, but not as good as it seemed to promise at the beginning. It’s the second novel I’ve read this past year focused on the dynamics between jury members. In this case, the story is told from Maya’s perspective in two timelines. Maya sat on a jury that acquitted a young teacher accused of murdering his teenage student. Ten years later, Maya is a criminal defence lawyer, and she’s invited to a reunion of all the jury members. The old murder remains unsolved and the reunion leads to another mystery. Clever idea, but it didn’t entirely wow me in its execution.

She often tackles big topics, sometimes at the expense of depth of character or believable stories. Big Lies in a Small Town is no exception. The story is told in two timelines. In 2018, Morgan is released from jail early because she has been chosen to restore a mural in a small town in North Carolina. In 1939, 22 year old Anna has been selected to paint the mural as part of a post depression initiative. As Morgan works on the mural, it becomes obvious to her that there was something not quite right about Anna. In parallel, we find out what happened to Anna who had moved on her own from New Jersey to North Carolina to work on the mural. I won’t say more to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say that Chamberlain uses this story to explore issues of racism, mental illness and sexism. I didn’t dislike Big Lies in a Small Town, which is why I’m giving it 3.49 stars. It was very readable and there were lots of twists and turns. But I found that the characters lacked depth and that these serious topics were treated rather superficially. I keep meaning to give up on Chamberlain but always find myself attracted by the description of her novels. I’m not sure what I’ll do next time...

Twelve year old Edward is the only survivor of a plane crash. He was on a flight from New York to Los Angeles with his parents and brother. After the crash, Edward goes to live in a small town with his childless aunt and uncle. The story alternates between chapters from the few hours on the plane leading to the crash and from the first few years of Edward’s life after the crash. The flight chapters focus on a handful of characters other than Edward — showing their personalities and where they are in their lives at what turns out to be the day of their deaths. The chapters that follow Edward’s life after the crash show his struggle to deal with the intense grief and guilt of being the only survivor. They also show Edward’s connection to the families who lost people on the flight. Dear Edward is intensely sad, but written in a way that’s not overly dramatic or ponderous. I loved the structure of the story, and how the author shows Edward moving forward with his life, connected to those who died. In the end, it felt like a beautiful very readable story.

Antonia is recently widowed, living by herself in a small town in Vermont. She has three sisters, who live in other parts of the USA. Antonia's instinct is to retreat into her grief, but the outside world intrudes. Her oldest sister, Izzie, who is erratic and impulsive, disappears. At the same time, Antonia finds herself charged with the well-being of a pregnant underage illegal Mexican immigrant. Alvarez does a great job of portraying Antonia's inner voice and turmoil -- Antonia struggles between wanting to isolate herself and feeling a sense to duty to her sisters and to the plight of her young charge. This is not a long novel. The beginning and end are very strong, but it felt a bit slack in the middle, which is why I couldn't bring myself to give it 5 stars.

It started off really strong, but had one feature that led me to lose interest. Rose is in the locked unit of a nursing home seemingly suffering from some kind of dementia. But all her instincts tell her to get out, so she escapes, and keeps escaping. I won’t say more to avoid spoilers. In the beginning, Barr did a great job portraying Rose’s state of confusion, and the claustrophobic feeling of being confused while having an instinct to flee. I also really liked Rose’s feisty 13 year old granddaughter. But what drove me nuts is that the novel had way too many lengthy action scenes. Rather than making the best of a great premise and strong characters, Barr had one scene after another of Rose physically struggling to get out of various tricky situations. The scenes were lengthy, unrealistic and not particularly interesting. This tells me that Barr is probably not for me. I suspect many other readers would enjoy this one far more than I did.

Malcolm Keyshaw is the first person narrator. He is part owner of a mystery bookshop. A few years back, he wrote a blog posting about eight classic mysteries with perfect murders. Flash forward, and he gets a visit from a detective who suggests that someone may have picked up on his blog to replicate the murders... From there, Swanson builds a delicious tangled web. So much of the story draws on other mysteries, which is so much fun. And as Malcolm ponders the increase in unreliable narrators, one wonder how reliable Malcom is...This won’t be for everyone because it’s slow and careful. But I loved the slow layered shifting narrative. And I loved all the references to other classic mysteries. It definitely made me feel like reading — and in some cases rereading — all eight books on the list.As I said, I didn’t love the end. I felt the story lost some of it’s originality as we discover what’s really going on. But I still thought that this was mostly fabulous.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Dec 21, 2019","Dec 24, 2019","Sep 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52225186-eight-perfect-murders

In fact, on occasion it has blown me away. But I found the magic in this book confusing and jarring, and I’m not sure why. Especially since in many ways this is a very powerful book.The story is set during World War II, and starts in Germany where a Jewish mother enlists the help of a rabbi’s daughter to make a Golem who will get her 12 year old daughter safely to France to live with some relatives. The rest of the story takes place in France, focusing on a handful of characters, including the daughter, the Rabbi’s daughter and Ava (the Golem). I loved the parts in which Ava did not feature. Hoffman brings to life the mix of terror and will to live of her young characters. And the writing is beautiful. But, oy, the Golem! What can I say? I struggled with magic playing a role in a story set during such an atrocious period of history. I struggled to understand the Golem’s meaning – was she meant to be a metaphor? If so, representing what? The funny thing is that Ava soon becomes just one of the characters in the book, and the spotlight was often focused on other characters. So I could mostly focus on what I loved about the book without being too bothered by the Ava.But that’s my reaction. I read this one as a monthly buddy read with Diane and Angela. They both loved it, and I’m grateful to them for giving me insight into how they understood the role of the Golem. I didn’t feel it as I read it, but in the end I think I understood and appreciated it more. So take my views with a grain of salt. I suspect many people will love this powerful beautifully written story.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for giving me access to an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Sep 06, 2019","Sep 09, 2019","Sep 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43822062-the-world-that-we-knew

The story is set in 1982 and 2018 in a small town in upstate New York. In 1982, 20 year old Viv moves to town and takes a job as a nighttime clerk at the Sun Down Motel. A few months later, she disappears... In 2018, Viv’s niece Carly comes to town to figure out what happened to her aunt after her mother dies. She too takes a job at the Sun Down Motel… I couldn’t quite say why I liked this one so much – despite the ghosts. There’s something about the ominous atmosphere, the smart female characters and the clever parallel plots that had me hooked. I must admit that I guessed what was going on fairly early on, but I still enjoyed it – despite the ghosts. My only other quibble is that, in some respects, the author painted 1982 as though it was in the stone ages. Ahem -- it really wasn’t that long ago!

At the centre of the story is Amanda, who is found dead toward the beginning of the novel. The story is then told from the many points of view of people in her neighbourhood who live in a tangled web of secrets. What I liked most about Someone We Know is how Lapena tells the story. We move quickly from one point of view to another. Layers of secrets and lies are revealed one after the other. It's never clear whether people of telling the truth or lying, and whether what their lies are to protect themselves or someone else. Well done!

In one narrative, four co-workers with a New York high finance firm are trapped on an elevator, where they are supposed to be involved in an escape room team building exercise. In parallel, one of their former colleagues tells her tale of working at firm. I must admit that I was a bit turned off by the the escape room concept, but it ends up being a clever device for exploring the dynamics between these characters and their backstories. Near the end, I figured out what was going on, but I still found this one compulsively readable. It sure doesn’t paint a pretty picture of life on Wall Street but it makes for good fun suspense.

It’s getting a fair bit of attention and is on several books to watch in 2020 lists, but I found it hard to keep focused on the narrative. Wallace is an African American graduate student in biochemistry at a mid western university. He comes from a brutal impoverished family in Alabama. He is gay. His father died recently. The story focuses on a weekend in Wallace’s life amongst his classmates when his emotional life seems to unravel. He feels out of place and misunderstood. But there are no better places on the horizon. The author paints an intimate portrait of alienation. It’s well written and delves deep into contemporary interpersonal dynamics, but I didn’t feel very engaged by the story or the characters. Perhaps it was too much of a micro-emotional exploration for my current tastes.

The novel is partially based on Erdrich’s grandfather, who worked as a night watchman in a jewel factory and who led the fight against “dispossession” of residents of the Turtle Mountain Reservation. In parallel, the story focuses on fictional sisters Patrice and Vera, who were born on the reservation. After moving to the city, Vera disappears, and Patrice is determined to find her. In combination, these characters allow Erdrich to pain a political and personal picture of this time in history. Life was very harsh and no one had much money. But the sense of community was strong. And despite some pretty dramatic hardship, Erdrich manages to infuse the story with some humour and optimism. This made for a great monthly buddy read with Angela and Diane.

The 3.25 starsI thought I needed a light read after reading a few intense novels, but The Authenticity Project, while enjoyable, was a bit too light. The concept was clever. 75 year old Julian, a lonely aging artist, writes about his loneliness in a notebook titled The Authenticity Project which he then leaves in Monica’s cafe. Monica then writes about her desperation for a family, and then passes the notebook on to another stranger. Slowly, all these strangers become connected, and the reader realizes that authenticity is more complicated than it seems. It all had the feel of a Sophie Kinsella novel, with imperfect characters on a road to understanding their truer selves. I actually like the occasional dose of Sophie Kinsella, and I liked parts of The Authenticity Project, but overall it was just a bit too predictable and the characters were a bit to stereotypical for my tastes.

He grew up in Texas with a single mother Buddhist convert who suffered from congenital heart disease. This memoir spans Jones’ life from ages 12 to 25. Jones gives his readers a raw taste of his life in that time span, including the rough ride he got from peers in high school and his successful but self-destructive self-reinvention as a student in at a small college in Kentucky. Jones also delves into the strong bond with his mother and the fractious relationship with the rest of his family. I loved Jones’ honesty. I also loved that he is not self-flattering or self-pitying. I especially loved the last part in which he deals so honestly with the grief of losing his mother at 25. I hope Jones produces other segments of his life in memoir form.

I think I liked the topic a bit more than the execution. The story is set in Germany in the 1960s, and focuses on the the war criminal trials of some Nazis as seen through a handful of fictional characters. The primary focus is Eva, who is in her early 20s and works as a translator during the trials. Despite having grown up in Germany right after the war, she learns about what the Nazis did and her own family’s role during the war from the trials. This is an important topic and the author does a good job of showing the fractious relations between Germans trying to reinvent themselves in the shadow of their dark past. What worked a bit less for me is that at times there was almost a farcical tone to the story. As an example, Eva’s family and boyfriend felt like they had exaggerated personalities and their reactions to events seemed overly grandiose. This doesn’t mean that I didn’t like The German House, but I might have liked it more if it had been more straight up in tone. Having said that, the translation from the German was very good.

The story is set in the near future, in a dystopian southern California. The narrator is 16 year old Rorie, who in real time recounts the events that led her and her friend Fee to become hunted fugitives. Rorie is a smart, independent thinking and mouthy 16 year old, living in a privileged gated world where abortion is illegal and girls are pressured into making a pledge to their fathers that they will not have sex before marriage. Meanwhile, outside the gated community, the world is populated by homeless people desperately seeking food and safe drinking water; they are largely made up of illegal immigrants. It's not hard to see where the idea for the novel comes from. What really carried it for me was Rorie's voice. At times, she is a petulant 16 year old and at other times she seems to be the only sane person in her crazy world. Lansens's prose really flows smoothly, adding to the intensity and immediacy of the story. And the end -- well the end is quite something -- but I can't say more without spilling the beans.

I was vaguely aware it had been nominated and had no idea it was going to win that day. But I’m happy to see that it won. I absolutely loved it. It will likely be my favourite novel of the year. It feels original and contemporary, while delivering great characters and good storytelling. Evaristo tells the story of 14 interconnected characters — primarily women of colour in England. Their stories span the 20th and 21st centuries. There’s some heartbreak, a bit of humour and a tad of a political undertone — but mostly lots of heart. I loved each story and I loved how they were connected, and especially how they come together beautifully at the end. I rarely read books twice, but I could definitely see reading this one again. It would make for a great audiobook.Thanksgiving to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"Oct 14, 2019","Nov 03, 2019","Jul 26, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41081373-girl-woman-other

The first 10% seemed completely hokey, but then the story shifts and the beginning made sense and I fell in love with this novel and its narrator and I gobbled it up. The story is told by Abi, who at 37 is a single mother with more than her share of sadness in her past. But since she was 16 years old, she had been receiving unsolicited chapters of a quirky self help book in the mail. Now, she is called to attend a reunion of all the other people who had been receiving chapters from the book. Hokey, see! But there's far more to the story than this unpromising beginning. Abi is funny, sad and introspective, and the whole story is written from her lovely point of view. The beginning of Abi's sadness was the disappearance of her brother when she turned 16, which is a mystery and ache than permeate the whole novel. And the puzzling chapters and their provenance morph into a lovely subplot of human connections. I'm trying to say enough without saying much because this is a lovely reading experience to be savoured as you go. This novel is human, philosophical, sad and funny -- but it doesn't take itself too seriously.Thanks to Goodreads friend Bianca for bringing this one to my attention.

The story is set in the 1930s in a small town in the hills of Kentucky. Eighteen year old Alice arrives from England, newly married to Bennett. Living with her husband and his tyrannical father, Alice is bored out of her mind until she becomes involved in a local library project. Alice is one of a few women who deliver books on horseback to barely literate families in the surrounding area. The story comes to focus on Alice and the other women involved in the library. Each in her own way is unconventional, and struggling with the pressures of convention. Their friendship keeps them sane and afloat. While the story deals with serious issues, such as domestic violence, racism and sexism, the story was told relatively lightly, with a focus on the strength of these women. It was an ode to libraries, books and friendship, which together made it well worth reading.I was especially lucky to read this one with my two reading buddies, Angela and Diane, who are both librarians. I couldn’t help picturing them heroically delivering books on horseback.

The story3.25 starsA Single Thread had the ingredients for the kind of novel I usually love, but unfortunately I found it quite flat in the delivery. The story is set in the early 1930s, and focuses on Violet. Violet is 37 years old, and thinks of herself as a “surplus woman”. She wasn’t able to marry because so many men were killed during WWI, and her options in life are seriously limited by her sex and marital status. The story focuses on a year when Violet leaves her mother’s home and goes to live in Westminster, where she works as a typist and joins a women’s embroidery group. She also befriends one of the cathedral’s bell ringers. My favourite part of the book was one of the sub characters, Louise Pessel, who is based on a real woman who designed embroidery. The end also came together nicely. And the writing is decent. But otherwise this one felt a bit didactic at the expense of creating fully formed complex characters and a more subtle plot. I don’t regret reading it, but I feel that it could have been much better.

Jaquira Diaz was born in Puerto Rico to a Latino father and a white mother. Her mother and maternal grandmother were both schizophrenic and addicts. Her father has his own issues. Her paternal grandmother was a lifeline. From a very early age, Diaz lived an edgy messy life, first in Puerto Rico and then in Miami. Her memoir is not linear. She narrates experiences, feelings and observations, more or less in chronological order. By the end, she explains that she called her memoir Ordinary Girls as a tribute to her younger self and all other girls and women who have lived messy reckless lives -- they are all worthy humans and no one should be left behind. I liked the way she moved her memoir in that direction. I liked the writing and the rawness. It doesn't make for an easy read but it's well worth it.

The writing was not spectacular and the story was a bit obvious, but I thought Ragen did a really good job of dealing with a complicated and fraught topic. Leah is in her mid 30s. Her grandparents were practicing Jews, but her mother rejected religion and brought her up with little structure and too much freedom. After more than her share of bad experiences, Leah searches for structure and belonging in an orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. Yakov is a recent widower who was left with five children, and he and his younger children are not coping well at all. Leah volunteers to help Yakov and his family. And you can kind of guess where this is going... But what I liked about the story is that Regan delves pretty deep into Leah and Yakov's personal struggles with religion and their orthodox community. Regan does not paint an idealized picture of the community she depicts. She makes it clear that all communities reproduce what are often harsh hierarchies, but at the same time she also suggests that a religious community at its best can take care of its own. It's not my world, but I really appreciated how it was depicted through the characters in this novel.

There are three strands to the story which appear to be completely separate but come together in the end – like a braid, of course. The first strand focuses on Samsi who lives in India, and is part of the “untouchable” cast; Samsi desperately wants to give her daughter a better life. The second strand is about Giulia who lives in Sicily, and works for her family run business of recovering and treating hair for wigs. And finally there is Sarah, who lives in Montreal, a single mother of three who also works as a high powered lawyer. All three women are at crossroads in their lives. Their stories alternate and come together nicely at the end. It’s a bit didactic, but I couldn’t help being pulled in by these three vivid characters in different circumstances.Version 2: It’s always dangerous to write about circumstances that aren’t your own. It’s easy to simplify and to make assumptions that end up turning people into caricatures rather than fully formed people with complex emotions and motivations. The author of The Braid is French, and yet she writes about about characters in very different parts of the world. Being familiar with the world of one of the characters – Sarah – the depiction of her life and the people around her really struck me as superficial. Which, of course, made me wonder about the less familiar worlds of Samsi and Giulia.Two sides of the same coin. I wish I had known that The Braid was translated from French before I started it because I would have read it in the original version. Having said that, it is a very good translation. I never felt that I was reading a translation.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Sep 22, 2019","Sep 24, 2019","Jun 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43822317-the-braid

This mystery is set in Texas and features Darren Matthews, an African American Texas Ranger. This one focuses on the disappearance of a 9 year old boy, who is the son of a convicted white supremacist. Darren gets involved in the investigation because this might be the opportunity to get more information about a white supremacist group. But his own emotions and sense of what’s right and wrong become complicated when the main suspect is an older African American man. Locke doesn’t shy away from complex contemporary politics and issues, and she delves into the complexity without being pedantic or didactic – in other words, Locke assumes her readers are intelligent and interested in the world – one of my favourite kinds of mysteries. It’s worth reading #1 before reading this one, because Darren’s moral and emotional struggles carry through from book 1 to book 2.

Zee is 26 years old, and her life I think I get what Bryn Greenwood is doing in This Reckless Oath We Made, but it was a bit too over the top for me. Zee is 26 years old, and her life is a mess. Her father died in jail as a convicted murderer, her mother is a shut-in hoarder and her sister has recently disappeared, leaving her to care for her 5 year old nephew and to try to find her sister. Initially, the best way she comes up with to help herself, her sister and her nephew is by selling weed and getting what she can from creepy guys. That is, until her knight in shining armour, Gentry, comes to the rescue. Actually, Gentry is a 24 year old autistic young man, who only speaks in Middle English, has a few obstinate invisible friends and is obsessed with swords and chivalry. Gentry believes that he is Zee’s “champion”, which means that he is obliged to protect her. The collision of Zee’s world with Gentry’s world leads to pretty dramatic and — in my humble opinion — over the top results. I won’t say more about the plot to avoid spoilers. This feels like a mash up of a very dark fairy tale with what some have described as “Appalachian noir”. In theory, I don’t have a problem with the concept. After all, I loved Patrick deWitt’s Undermajordomo Minor — a dark fairy tale if there ever was one — and have really enjoyed Brian Panowich’s books — a true writer of Appalachian noir. But some of the key plot twists went way too far for me — especially what Gentry ends up doing for Zee, and what ends up happening to him as a consequence. I wasn’t shocked — I just fell out of my suspension of disbelief bubble and thought “no way”. That said, there were things I liked about the story — I liked Gentry’s character for the most part, I liked Zee’s transformation throughout the story and I quite liked the end — so I’m comfortable with a 3 star rating. I think my disappointment with this one is that I would have liked it so much more if Garwood had held back on some of the more over the top aspects of the plot.I suspect many people with love this book. But it didn’t quite work for me. This was a buddy read with Angela and Diane, and this was a rare occasion when we each had different reactions. So make sure to read a bunch of s before deciding whether to give this one a chance or to write it off.

The idea is interesting but I wasn’t always very happy with the delivery. Nat is a struggling art student in New York, and she gets the idea of finding a sugar daddy to help support her. Nat then finds Gabe, and the story focuses on the dynamic between the two of them. With hands over my eyes, I wanted to yell “no” at Nat many times, but things between them got creepier and creepier. I understand that the author did research on the increase in sugar baby/sugar daddy relationships and that this inspired her book. I appreciate that this is somewhat of a cautionary tale for young women. But Nat’s personality and the creepy factor were at times a bit too much for me.

She's always well informed, and clear about her opinions and how she supports them. But these days, I can only take her in small doses because all of her reporting focuses on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and there's only so much coverage of the pandemic I can listen to. As I was finishing listening to Blowout, which focuses on the oil industry, Maddow was ramping up her coverage of the pandemic on her nightly show. Blowout is important, interesting and really well researched and narrated. But its immediate relevance faded for me toward the end. Nothing about the book. Everything about timing.

The story is set in 1966 Baltimore and focuses on Maddie Schwartz. Maddie is somewhat at odds with the times. She is restless in her marriage, has a healthy sexual appetite, is itching to work at something engaging and is willing to take risks. But she’s no hero. She gets a job with a newspaper and starts meddling in the murder of Cleo Sherwood, and things become complicated for Maddie and people around her. The story is told mostly from Maddie’s point of few, with the occasional perspective of the people she comes in contact with. I liked the writing. I liked the perspective on the 1960s in the US. And I mostly liked the story, but I thought it didn’t always hold together as well as it could.

She seems to pop up everywhere and have thoughts on everyone's business. This is what happens when you teach grade 7 in a small town. You end up knowing something about pretty much everyone. And if you're Olive, you have pretty strong opinions about them too. This is a reflection on how Strout structured this book and her previous Olive Kitteridge book. These linked short stories alternate their focus from Olive to other people in Olive's periphery. The stories that focus on Olive span her 70s and 80s as she moves toward the end of her life. It is a compelling picture of aging -- of trying to make sense of one's life while remaining firmly grounded in life's small irritants and delights. The stories that don't focus on Olive have the same tone -- the feel of real people struggling undramatically with life's nuanced complications. I must admit that I generally preferred the chapters that focused on Olive, so I'm not quite at 5 stars.

This is meant to be a fictionalized account of some of Jim Jones’ followers. I read The Road to Jonestown with interest and thought this novel might provide more insight into what led so many people to follow Jones to their death. But I feel like I got the opposite of insight. It starts off well, focused on young couple, Evelyn and Lenny, who become entangled with Jones and his cult. Evelyn quickly leaves Lenny, and becomes Jones’ mistress, putting up with his abuse and self-absorption. I had trouble seeing what motivated Evelyn. And, quickly, the novel shifts its focus to a whole raft of characters, and I found myself losing interest and having trouble keeping everyone straight — and having trouble understanding what motivated all of them. In the end, I felt that the characters were given superficial treatment, and I gained little or no insight into what attracted them to Jones. I much preferred The Road to Jonestown.

Red at the Bone is told from the perspectives of five members of a somewhat unconventional family. At the centre of the story is Iris, who was 16 when she had her daughter Melodie. The three other family members are Iris' parents and Melodie's father. There is no linearity to the story. Slowly, through different layers, we get a bit more information about what happened to the characters and mostly a strong sense of their very distinct personalities. The end is terribly sad and beautiful at the same time. I'm feeling a bit tongue tied by this one. Read it. It's short. I definitely have to read more books by this author.

Mickey and Kacey are two sisters living in Philadelphia. Their mother died of a drug overdose. Mickey is a police officer. Kacey is a drug addict. The book moves back and forth from the sisters’ childhood to present day. We see everything through Mickey’s eyes. How she tried to steer her sister away from drugs and their nasty consequences. How she now can’t find Kacey. But by the end, the story is a bit more complicated than Mickey makes it seem originally. I found Long Bright River to be a great combination of smart storytelling and powerful emotions. I also found the end to be a great reminder that drug addiction doesn’t fit into an easy moralistic narrative.I haven’t read anything else by Moore, but I’m certainly now tempted to read Heft which gets excellent s from many GR friends.Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Dec 14, 2019","Dec 20, 2019","Apr 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43834909-long-bright-river

Sweet because I got to catch up with you and our friends in Three Pines a little earlier in the summer than usual. Bitter because our time together is already over until next year.I found this year’s dose of Louise Penny got off to a slow start. Armand Gamache is struggling, as usual, with his place in the Quebec police, and the mystery at the centre of A Better Man focuses on a seemingly straightforward missing person case. And I must admit that the story itself didn’t really grow much in intensity for me. Armand continued to struggle. The people of Three Pines were thrown into turmoil because Clara’s paintings are getting bad s. And I quickly guessed what was meant to be a not so obvious resolution to the missing person plot.But for true fans of Louise Penny, like me, the plot is often beside the point. As usual, Armand, his family, his colleagues and his neighbours make up for any plot weaknesses. It’s hard not to be enthralled by these deep feeling and thinking characters, who are also equipped with a good sense of humour and a love for the good things in life. Despite the murders and carnage, Louise Penny presents an inspiring and warm world view of human connections. (I can’t believe I just wrote that sentence, but I can’t think of any other way to express it.)But because this was not my favourite of Penny’s books, I thought I should probably be fair and give it 4 stars rather than my usual 5 stars. And then I read her afterword, and I knew I couldn’t rate this one any less than 5 stars. Penny explains why she named one of the dogs in the book Fred, which made me teary. Then she explained that “these books are about community. About love and belonging. And the great gift of friendship.” Indeed! So the afterword pulled me over the 5 star line – not for the first time -- and it’s another five stars for me. Because, despite the plot’s weaknesses, these are the feelings I walk away with each year after I finish Penny’s latest offering.So, goodbye for now, Armand. I hope you’re planning something good for next year. In the meantime, enjoy your family and friends, and don’t get into too much trouble ;)Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for giving me access to an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Jul 24, 2019","Jul 26, 2019","Apr 29, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44034500-a-better-man

I’m all for psychological thrillers based on secrets, but there were too many improbable secrets here for me. Grace and Miles run a resort in Mexico for couples trying to reunite. The stay even includes therapy sessions. But it turns out that they have problems of their own. Big problems that affect their ability to help their guests. Then there are couples Joanne and Ben, and Shell and Colin, who show up at the resort with their own secret problems. Lurking in the background is the threat of a big tropical storm — that Miles is keeping secret from the residents. The strands of secrets seemed all a bit too disparate and melodramatic. And the resolution at the end a bit to tidy given all the drama. I probably should have given up on this one, but I’m never good at giving up on books. And I wanted to give this Canadian book a try.

I really didn’t expect to like Mrs. Everything as much as I did. I’ve read some of Jennifer Weiner’s novels in the past, and I think of them as entertaining but generally quite light. This felt different. The story spanned four generations, covering what felt like complex situations while delivering real emotions. I found myself fully engaged and was oh so grateful to have a leisurely Saturday to plough through most of the book — and grateful for a few tissues too. The story focuses on sisters Jo and Bethie — I hadn’t made the Little Women connection until now — starting in the 1950s when they are children. At first, it feels like Weiner is portraying Jo and Bethie as overly recognizable types — Jo is boyish and at odds with her mother and the world, while Bethie is pretty, feminine and popular. But things turn out to be way more complicated. And the complications reverberate through the generations. I don’t want to say too much to avoid spoilers, but I will say that I loved how Weiner wove in political issues about women’s roles, sexual politics and race relations without letting politics make her characters unidimensional. The only thing that kept me from giving this novel 5 whole stars were a couple of coincidences that irked me, but these were minor flaws. Overall, this was a powerful contemporary tableau of women in the 20th and 21st centuries. I’ll definitely be on board to read Weiner’s next novel.

Five adult siblings are called to return to the children’s camp owned by their recently deceased parents to hear the reading of their parents’ wills. This takes them back 20 years to an unresolved tragedy at the camp. Over a period of three days — with lots of flashbacks — the mystery is resolved. I liked the setting — a camp in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. But overall I didn’t find myself particularly taken by the story. The characters were a bit indistinct and not very likeable, and the mystery wasn’t that intriguing. I won’t give up on McKenzie because I have really liked some of her previous books, but again this was not my favourite.

I would say this novel falls into the “domestic angst” genre. Penelope hits a crisis point in her life when her best friend dies, and she realizes that she may not want to stay married to the father of her two young demanding children. Penelope’s feelings are a somewhat typical trope in contemporary domestic fiction. The twist if that she is the breadwinner and her husband is at home. Also Penelope’s husband is a somewhat multidimensional character. There were some good scenes and some real emotions in I’m Fine and Neither Are You, but it didn’t knock my socks off.

A happily married couple with two young teenagers seem to lead a pretty normal life, except that mum and dad have developed a bit of a psycho pastime... The story is narrated by dad, who finds it a tad challenging to balance his enthusiasm for his wife and their psycho pastime with his desire for a happy loving family... I’ll say no more. Read it.

The story is set in the 1930s, told from the perspective of an old man looking back at a few months when he was 12 years old. When Oddie and his older brother Albert become orphans, they are sent to live in an Indian residential school. The conditions are horrific, and Oddie, Albert and a couple of other kids find a way to escape. The rest of the story focuses on their adventures and their attempts to survive in the harsh world of the Great Depression. They meet a fair balance of people who help and people who want to harm them. The novel has the feel of old fashioned story telling – some adventure and suspense with plenty of heartbreak and good feelings. I enjoyed it, but found it a bit long and a tad sentimental. Many readers enjoyed it far more than I did, so you should read their s too.

The story started with Francis and Lena in the 1970s, and then shifted focus to Kate and Peter several years later. Francis is a cop, and he and Lena live in a small town outside of New York. You would think they would become close with their neighbours, Brian and Anne, given that Brian is also a cop, but things are complicated. Despite the distance between the parents, their kids Kate and Peter are close, and then things get really complicated. The writing is very straightforward, and at first I was deceived into thinking that the story was a bit simplistic. But as the story progressed, I stopped worrying about the writing and became immersed in the story and characters. It's a story about imperfect people, some plagued by mental illness and addiction, who make decisions that have dramatic consequences. But it's also a story about people who hang in there, and keep things together. I cried a bit. I was satisfied with the end. You can't ask for much more.

It’s somewhat of a courtroom drama but much of the story goes back in time and outside the courtroom. The story takes place in Sweden and focuses on 18 year old Stella and her parents. At the beginning of the book, Stella is accused of murdering a man in his 30s. The story is told in three parts, from the points of view of the father, then Stella and then the mother. The story is as much about complex family dynamics as it is about whether Stella committed the murder. These are not cookie cutout characters, but because all families have their secrets and complex dynamics, this is indeed a “nearly normal family”. I loved being in their heads, and trying to put all the pieces together. This may not be for readers who like fast paced crime fiction, but it’s great if you like something more smart and introspective.

Daisy Jones is an aspiring songwriter and singer, and she ingests any substance that comes her way. The Six refers to a band led by Billy Dunne. Billy also has his own struggles with drugs and alcohol. The story is told through a series of alternating quotes from different interviews with Daisy, Billy, other band members and others. It's a great way to see the story from different perspectives. There's some humour, lots of love and broken hearts, plenty of soul searching and some good old fashioned rock and roll.

This time, what tried my patience was the premise. I have never read Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood, but the premise of We Were Killers Once is that Brigid becomes aware of a confession by one of the two killers Capote focuses on that implicates a third killer. Somehow, Brigid and her husband Carlo come into contact with this third man and the story flows from there. The story itself is actually quite clever although a tad predictable. And I liked the dynamic between Brigid and Carlo. And as always I like that this series focuses on a flawed late middle aged female detective. But the connection to Capote’s book and real historical events just seemed a bit weird and unnecessary to me. I suspect that even if I had read In Cold Blood I would have had the same reaction. Grafting a fictitious mystery series onto a real crime that may or may not have been accurately reported by Capote was all a bit distracting... I will give Masterman’s next book in the series a try, but I hope that she sticks to true fiction rather than this odd true crime-fiction hybrid.

The Women of the Copper Country really hit the mark. The novel focuses on a mining strike in Northern Michigan in 1913 as mostly seen through the eyes of the women of the town. Specifically, the story focuses on Annie Clements — known as Big Annie — who was the head of the Women’s Auxiliary and instrumental in getting the strike going. Annie was a real person, and the author clearly did a lot of research about her life and the strike. This is not a happy story — because it’s based on a difficult historical time and because this author does not romanticize what happened to Annie and others. But it’s not all bleak — the story really highlights the role and strength of women involved in the labour movement and it brings home the dramatic improvements in working conditions over the last 100 years — with perhaps a warning to be careful not to backslide. And I should mention that the writing was excellent. This was my first but won’t be my last book by this author. This was a great buddy read with Angela and Diane.

There was something about the characters and their story that really worked for me. Eve andI must admit that I had a hard time putting this one down. There was something about the characters and their story that really worked for me. Eve and Daniella meet as freshmen in a small girls college in the south in the early 1960s. Eve comes from a very wealthy southern family, and Daniella is half Jewish and comes from an academic family. The story chronicles several decades of their frought friendship. The novel doesn't really play out in the way one might expect given their backgrounds. Rather than playing on stereotypes, the author gives them both distinct personalities that also influence their paths. Eve has an extremist idealistic tendency, and she throws herself into everything with passion -- often to her own detriment and to the detriment of others. Daniella is more careful and measured. This brings them into conflict, but there is nevertheless a deep bond between them. In later years, the story shifts a bit and focuses on their daughters -- a part I liked too, but not quite as much. The end was not quite tidy, which was another plus as far as I'm concerned. I would call this a really good character study.One warning: don't read this book if you have any issues with reading about animal cruelty.

Katie is in her late 20s and just divorced, when she moves back in with her grandmother with her dog Bark in tow. Katie has a lot of baggage stemming from her father's death and her mother's subsequent abandonment. Katie's grandmother and her group of friends were her anchor as a child and serve the same purpose after Katie's divorce. The story is a quite predictable and Katie is a bit melodramatic for my tastes, but the grandmother and her friends we lovely -- they really carried the book for me. These are not sweet older women -- no, they are hip and savvy. A decent light novel if that's what you're craving.

I grew up in Canada hearing about the “troubles” in Northern Ireland, but I only had the vaguest idea of Irish history. Last summer, I was in the Republic of Ireland and really appreciated the vivid introduction to Irish history and culture. I seem to have caught the bug, because this summer I will be traveling to Northern Ireland. Say Nothing is a great look at some of the causes and consequences of the North’s fraught history. The author has done in depth research into the plight of two women on different sides of the conflict. Jean McConville, the mother of 10 children, disappeared in 1972. Dolres Price was a young active member of the IRA in the 1970s, imprisoned for many years. Keefe makes no apologies for anyone’s behaviour but he gives context to the events. It’s an intense deep dive into recent history. It felt a bit too dense at times, but it really comes together at the end as Keefe ties some loose ends as best he can. Strongly recommended to anyone with an interest in this part of history.If you listen to the audio, the narrator has a lovely Irish accent....more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Mar 02, 2019","Jun 17, 2019","Feb 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40163119-say-nothing

The story focuses on Amanda Sternberg and the plight of her two daughters during WWII. After Amanda and her daughters are forced to leave Poland, there are no good choices for Amanda to ensure the survival of her daughters. Early on, she sends one daughter off to live with her brother in Cuba, and the rest of the story focuses on the survival of her younger daughter. Who stays in France. This should have been better, but the writing and emotions felt a bit flat. Also, the plot got a bit hard to follow and convoluted at times. I think I would have liked this one better if it gave us more of a perspective on the life of the daughter in Cuba. This was a monthly read with Diane and Angela.

I listened to Calypso a while ago, and I loved it - funny, smart and real. Me Talk Pretty One Day is an older book, and gives me a glimpse at a younger Sedaris, but the humour and view onto himself, his family and the world are recognizable. There are some great stories about teaching a writing class and learning to speak French that I especially loved. Exercising self restraint will give me a chance to savour the books I have not yet listened to. And I suspect there may be a risk of too much a good thing ruining the effect if I listen to them all at once.

The Red Daughte3.25 starsI tend to find anything to do with the history of the Cold War era and Eastern Europe interesting – fiction and non-fiction. The Red Daughter is an odd mixture of both. I read it with interest but I’m still trying to figure out what to make of it. The book is described as a novel, but it is about Svetlana Alliluyeva, who was Joseph Stalin’s daughter, focusing on the time in her life after she immigrated to the United States. In real life, the author’s father was an American lawyer who accompanied Alliluyeva as she went to the US. The novel includes a central character who was a lawyer who played such a role in Alliluyeva’s life. But the author proclaims in the afterword that the relationship between Alliluyeva and the lawyer in the novel is entirely fictional, and does not reflect the real relationship between his father and Stalin’s daughter. The book also purports to be based on Alliluyeva’s journal as it was delivered to her lawyer after her death, but it turns out there was no such journal or delivery. Weird, I know. Much of the book portrays Alliluyeva as a difficult person who led a difficult life. If there was no such historical figure as Svetlana Alliluyeva, I’m not sure there would be any reason to read this novel. Given the admission that much of this book was made up, it’s not to be read for the purpose of understanding Alliluyeva. So why read it? I’m not sure, but I did read it with some interest. I guess I’m still feeling a bit perplexed about this one.

The first chapter had my stomach in knots — one of the tensest opening scenes I ever remember reading. And then it doesn’t really let up. Like Lions is a sequel to Bull Mountain, which I did not read. It’s set in the mountains of Georgia and features a group of people who live by a whole different code of what’s right and wrong. The book opens in the 1970s when Annette Burroughs leaves her husband and three sons in the tensest of circumstances. The story then flashes forward to a time when only the youngest son — Clayton — is alive. Clayton is now the local sheriff and he is recovering from injuries he got while killing his older brother — Hal. Until his death, Hal was the local drug lord — a business he had taken over from his father. Clayton is now dark and broody, and having trouble keeping it together at work and with his wife and young son. Bull Mountain is now in disarray without its drug lord. And external forces are trying to take over. There’s lots of action and quite a bit of violence, which is not my usual fare, but the characters and the writing were top notch. I found myself fully engaged, head spinning and really not knowing who or what to root for. The end is pretty interesting too. I think I now need to go back and read Bull Mountain to better understand what happened between Clayton and Hal. But this was still good as a stand-alone.

I knew nothing about 20th century Korea and certainly nothing about the island of Jeju and its history of female divers. Lisa See does a fabulous job of laying out Jeju’s history through this novel focused on two fictional divers, Young-sook and Mi-Ja. The story has two timelines. In the contemporary timeline, Young-sook is an old woman approached by Mi-Ja’s granddaughter and great granddaughter; Young-sook denies knowing Mi-Ja. In the historical timeline which is narrated by Young-sook, we see these two characters growing up close like sisters and the events that wrenched them apart. Some of the events are brutal and horrific, but they are based on real historical events so they are important to the story. I loved the history in this book; I don’t always like historical fiction because sometimes it seems to romanticize or trivialize history, but See’s novel does neither. I also liked the story and the characters, although at times the tension between Young-sook and Mi-Ja seemed a bit drawn out. It’s a minor flaw. If you like historical fiction, this is a good one.

You never know when it will strike.”This quote pretty much sums up what The End of Loneliness is all about. Jules is the youngest of three siblings. His parents die when he is 11 years old, and he and his siblings go live in a boarding school. Later in life, Jules looks back on different points in his life — how he and his siblings distanced themselves from each other and slowly came back together. But, always, for Jules and his siblings, the early loss of their parents affects their relationship to the world and to each other. Knowing young that terrible things can happen leaves lasting scars. And experiencing a terrible loss at a young age doesn’t immunize anyone from further terrible losses. The prose is simple and the story is narrated in a understated way, but this short novel packs a lot of emotions.

Masha lost her young son over 10 years ago, and she’s coming to realize that her life is dominated by grief — and maybe it’s time to change. In parallel, single mother Alice is not well, and she and her son are slowly descending into disarray. The end was not much of a surprise to me, but that’s besides the point. The book is really about people in difficult situations and their emotions. Hogan does an excellent job of getting into Masha and Alice’s heads, and she surrounds Masha with really interesting characters, including Sally Red Shoes.

Crank up the emotions, and the tears start flowing. The Wartime Sisters had that impact on me. The writing isn’t special and the plot is a bit predictable, but the story and the characters got to me and had me all choked up. The story is set in the 1930s and 40s, focusing on sisters Ruth and Millie. Ruth is older and jealous of her younger sister’s good looks and more endearing personality. It turns out that being the younger good looking sister is no walk in the park for Millie. Part of the story takes place in Brooklyn in the 1930s when the girls are in their late teens living with their parents. The other part takes place several years later when Ruth and Millie live in Summerfield, Massachusetts, working at the armoury during the war. I don’t want to say too much about the plot, because there are a number of buried secrets that are revealed as the story progresses. This wasn’t a literary masterpiece, but it had me fully engaged and the way the author deals with her characters’ emotions is not trifling or simplistic. People can be horribly cruel, spiteful and self centered, and people can be generous and gain strength through friendship and empathy. This book runs the gamut of those emotions and behaviours. The tears are welling again...

What more can you ask for in a psychological thriller? Theo is a psychotherapist. He goes to work in a psychiatric care facility for the purpose of working with Alicia. Alicia was found guilty of killing her husband, and she has not spoken a single word since he died or in her own defence. Theo sees Alicia as a challenge. Meanwhile, Theo discovers that his wife is having an affair. And saying more would be saying too much. This psychological thriller is very readable — clever without much explicit violence.

I don’t really associate Joshilyn Jackson with psychological thrillers, but this one sure felt close to the genre. After a tragic event during her adolescence and subsequent years of self loathing, Amy reinvents herself as a wife, stepmother to a teen, mother to a baby and diving instructor. She seems to be leading a pretty normal middle class life until Roux shows up. Roux seems to know all of Amy’s secrets. What follows is a tug of war between two women who have lots to lose. It’s definitely a book I read with a knot it my stomach, but the tension was worth it. Jackson’s characters are different and the plot is clever without being too twisty or improbable.

In her late 20s, Land found herself coming out of an abusive relationship as the single mother of a toddler. She had very few financial options, so she took what help she could from government assistance and started working as a maid. Her book is a memoir of the three or four years she struggled to support herself and her daughter before finding a way to get into university. I struggled a bit with her book, because I couldn’t figure out what the focus was. Was I reading a memoir about the struggles of a single mother with limited resources? Or was I reading the observations of a someone who got a peak into other people’s lives through her work as a domestic worker? Both are important and interesting, but they didn’t quite mesh together for me in this book. Having said this, whether I enjoyed reading Land’s book or not, her memoir does paint a vivid picture of the effects of economic inequality.

The story spans a couple of generations, ultimately focusing on Rita and Nabil. Rita is the daughter of a Lebanese father and an Irish mother, growing up in the US and becoming a war correspondent. Nabil is an Iraqi translator, who works with Rita when she is stationed in Iraq. The story builds slowly, spanning the US, Lebanon and Iraq. At times, it felt a bit too slow and a bit aimless, but eventually it comes together powerfully. Correspondents is both personal and political, which worked well for me and reminded me of what I liked about Tim Murphy’s previous book, Christadora. Without lacking subtlety, Murphy delves into the complexity of the US’s role in Iraq, while reflecting on the effects of anti immigration movements in the US. But the politics don’t overwhelm the story. This is still very much the story of Rita and Nabil — strong characters struggling with impossible situations. I didn’t love it as much as Christadora, but I thought it was well worth reading. And I will definitely read Murphy’s next book.

At the beginning of the book, Diana is found dead. Diana is Lucy’s mother-in-law. The story goes back and forth in time, and back and forth between Diana and Lucy’s points of view. Their relationship is fraught from the beginning. Diana and her husband Tom are very wealthy, but Diana is determined that her children should succeed on their own, without the help of her children. She comes across as judgemental. Lucy is married to Diana’s son Ollie, and she finds Diana hard to take. Hepworth does a good job of giving both Diana and Lucy personalities and back stories that are somewhat more complex than they first appear. It’s hard to like Diana, but she isn’t unidimensional. But, to me, the resolution didn’t really fit with the build up. I won’t say anything to avoid spoilers, and plenty of readers have loved this book — although some have really disliked it — so you’ll have to judge for yourself.

Miriam Toews announces at the beginning that the book is based on true events in Bolivia, where a number of Mennonite women were raped and abused by a group of men in their community. Women Talking imagines a two day conversation amongst the women as they decide whether to stay or leave their community. The book is very short, but there is so much to the narrative that it defies easy description or critique, but here is a list of thoughts and reactions in no particular order:-The story is narrated by August, who sits in on the women’s conversation for the purpose of taking minutes because none of the women is able to read or write. August infuses much of his own history and his own thoughts into the narrative. His point of view and personality add a lot to the texture of the story.-The women’s conversation is varied in the way real women interact – they move seamlessly between painful recollections, philosophical debates, religious scripture, bickering, teasing and tenderness.-Through their conversation, we get a glimpse into the unusual and vulnerable lives these women have led – it’s hard to imagine living without knowing how to read, without knowing anything about the world beyond your small community and feeling that your community will not protect you from this type of aggression. It’s hard not to feel claustrophobic. -The end is beautiful.-I would have loved to know what happens to these women after they make their decision.-At times, I found it hard to keep track of the different women -- although Ona, who was August’s childhood friend, is a real standout.-Despite the difficult topic, there were a few delightful touches of humour.-At times, especially in the middle, the narrative felt repetitive. Mind you, many conversations involving a group of people trying to make a decision are repetitive…The bottom line is that, despite its flaws, Women Talking is well worth reading. It is rich and potent.

My very favourite of his books is The Reluctant Fundamentalist. I didn’t love Exit West as much, but I recognized Hamid’s strengths. On the surreal side, Exit West takes the reader to a world in which the disasters on which our world is teetering come to be reality — brutal regimes creating floods of safety seeking refugees, economic chaos and ecological disaster. That’s the backdrop to Saeed and Nadia’s story. Living in an unnamed country that is less and less livable, these two young people travel through doors to other places where they hope to find a home or at least safety. But things are complicated everywhere. And their relationship is an anchor — but a complicated anchor. The hopefulness at the end is of the most tepid kind. It took me a long time to read Exit West, even if it’s a short book. It sagged a bit in the middle, but mostly I found that it was best read in small chunks. The world Hamid depicts is claustrophobic. The emotions are subtle. There’s lots to think about.

Our annual date usually takes place at the end of the summer, but this year I had to wait until Christmas to read the next chapter in your life. But it was worth the wait.Louise Penny knocked it out of the park again this year. If you don’t know this series, it’s well worth it but you should start from the beginning. Through Gamache and a number of recurring characters, Penny tackles real and pressing issues, with depth, compassion and humour. This time, while Gamache is on suspension from the Surete du Quebec, he is named as the executor of a mysterious will and he is living with the consequences of allowing a large shipment of opioids enter into Quebec. As usual, the mysteries get resolved, all the while we get to spend time in Three Pines with the usual cast of charming characters.I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that the story takes place in the dead of winter in Quebec. Winter is depicted perfectly — the effects of a blistering snow storm, the different textures of snow, the hazards of winter driving, and the sheer pleasure of coming out from the cold and eating comfort food.As always, it feels like Penny covers familiar terrain, but with much intelligence and originality.After finishing, my heart skipped a beat when I read Penny’s afterword in which she said that, before writing Kingdom of the Blind, she thought she was done writing books in this series. Her husband, after whom Gamache is modelled, recently died of Alzheimers, and she assumed that it would be too painful to keep writing. Fortunately for me and many other fans, Penny found that, once she sat down, it turned out that writing this book came naturally and she was happy to be reunited with Gamache and the other eccentric characters in this series. Hopefully, she will feel the same about writing the next book in the series.Armand, you’re keeping things fresh by making me guess if and when we’ll meet again next year. But I know you to be considerate and gentlemanly, so I trust you won’t keep me guessing for too long.

Memoirs seem to have been amongst my very favourite books this year. I used to be really squeamish about memoirs, worrying about authors being too self-indulgent or self-pitying. But this year, I read and listened to a few memoirs that knocked my socks off. At the very top of my list is Michelle Obama’s Becoming. I just can’t stop talking about this book.2.	I seem to have a harder time finding works of fiction that I love. I’m usually stingy with my 5 star s, but only ended up with 7 works of fiction in that category this year. 3.	I keep thinking that I’m done reading books and articles about contemporary American politics, but it seems that I can’t stay away. This is obviously not the healthiest of my trends...4.	A visit to Ireland earlier this year has placed a number of Irish writers on my radar. I will happily look for more.5.	With mixed success, I have been trying to make more time for books I’ve been meaning to read for a while rather than the newest shiniest ARCs dangling just on the horizon.And what are my reading aspirations for next year? No plans or resolutions other than to follow my flitting fancies!As I mentioned, I’ve had less time for reading and for Goodreads this year. But, when time permits, I am always thankful to have a chance to catch up with friends and s, and I still very much enjoy this community of fellow book lovers. I feel like I’ve made some real friends. I’ve discovered many books through the GR community. And I’ve been moved and made to laugh by so many thoughtful and heartfelt s.

Author David Vann writes a fictionalized account of the last few days of his father’s life. Jim Vann is a bipolar dentist whose life has gone off the rails. Twice divorced, owing huge sums to the IRS, miserable with a chronic sinus condition and mostly miserable with the perpetual self loathing and angry thoughts in his head, Jim travels from his home in Alaska to visit his family in California. For Jim, this is meant to be goodbye. For his family, it’s meant to be an effort to help him get better. But it’s hard for his family and for readers to cope with Jim, because he is difficult, crude, self-destructive and self-centred. I don’t know if Vann got his father’s inner voice right, but he has done a great job at portraying a tortured soul. Having said that, at times, Halibut on the Moon is almost unbearable to read. Jim is hard to take. Knowing what’s coming is heartbreaking. And knowing that Jim is based on Vann’s father makes it even more heartbreaking. My 3.5 star rating reflects my mixed emotions, but this is certainly a potent read. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy.

Queenie is 26 years old, living in London, of Jamaican background and her life is one hot mess. She and her boyfriend Tom are on a halt — or so she thinks. In the aftermath of the breakup, she has extraordinarily bad judgment when it comes to having sex with nasty men. Not to mention that work is going badly, her living arrangement sucks, and her family life is complicated. Thank goodness for strong female friendships and the almost unconditional love of grandparents. At first, Queenie seemed like a light read — a la Sophie Kinsella. But it grew more complicated, and my attachment to and empathy for Queenie grew too. We see Queenie’s life spiral out of control, and then we see her slowly putting herself back together — with help from friends and family. There’s a fair bit of humour, but I must admit that that I was quite teary more than a few times. Queenie reminded me of that friend we all have who’s self-destructive life choices are exasperating, but who is nevertheless endearing — and who might be more complicated than apparent on the surface.

The earlier timeline is set during WWII, and told from Alina’s perspective. Alina is in her late teens, living on a farm in Poland, where she and her family are trying to survive after the Nazi occupation. The second timeline is told from Alice’s perspective. While Alice tries to juggle a complicated family situation, her 95 year old grandmother Hannah asks her to go back to Poland to find Tomasc. This doesn’t make sense to Alice, because her grandfather Tomasc died of dementia the year before. So from the get go, it’s clear that there’s a mystery in Alice’s family that is linked to Alina’s story. I absolutely loved the historical part of the story. Alina and her family are great characters, and Rimner really captures the different emotions they experience as they try to survive in such a crazy upside down terrifying world. I wasn’t as enamoured of Alice’s story line, although I really liked her trip to Poland. There was a lot of drama and chaos in Alice’s life that didn’t seem entirely necessary to telling Alina’s story. I especially didn’t like the depiction of Alice’s mother, who is portrayed negatively as an older ambitious feminist, who is too consumed by her work to properly care for her mother Hannah or her daughter Alice. But this was still well worth reading for Alina’s story. I quickly guessed the mystery, but that’s besides the point. I felt that Rimner did a great job depicting the atrocities and courage that come with war.

I found the mix of focus on the author’s life and her observations of the people she worked for as a maid somewhat incongruous. In a way, The Trauma Cleaner does the same thing, but so much better. Sandra Pankhurst runs a company that cleans homes that seem beyond the possibility of being cleaned — the homes of hoarders, people plagued by disease and addiction, and the sites of horrendous deaths. Sandra herself has survived — and gracefully so — what seems like an impossible life. Born a boy, adopted into a horribly abusive family and changing sexes in the 1980s in Australia, her survival and spirit are quite extraordinary. The author of this biography follows Sandra for a few years, writing about her life and her work. The parts about her work also include a peak at the lives of the people who live in the houses Sandra cleans. The story is emotional, but it’s also full of sharp edges and humour. This is a powerful tribute to a woman who went to extraordinary lengths to live an ordinary life. I especially liked listening to the audio because the narrator did a fabulous job giving Sandra a voice. Thanks to GR friends Debbie and Bianca for pointing me towards this powerful book.

She had me sitting in the bar with Maurice, listening to him make a toast at 84 years old to each of his five favourite people. Maurice had me laughing, crying, getting angry — including at him more than a few times — and shaking my head. Maurice grew up in a village near Dublin, and he never left. But he managed to get out of the poverty of his childhood, marry Sadie, have his son Kevin, and amass more than a few grudges and regrets. He has now sold everything he owns, checked into the local hotel and climbed onto a stool in the bar. In the form a toast per chapter, he addresses his son, recounting his life, tallying his regrets and coming to grips with his life. He has a sharp tongue, a stubborn streak and a hard shell - but also has a bit of a soft side. There were a couple of small things in the plot that I didn’t love, but this was nevertheless a true 5 star read for me. I can’t wait to read Griffin’s next book.

I like my mysteries and psychological thrillers rooted in the complexity of the characters and interesting situations. I'm not big into action packed plots or chase scenes. The Homecoming started out with all the right ingredients. After the death of his father, the narrator, his mother and his two siblings are taken to a place deep in the woods ostensibly to find out about their father's will. However, a clause in the will requires them to spend 30 days on the property without contact with the outside world before they can get their share of the estate. Then four other people arrive and things start to get more complicated. The set up is very good and the dynamic between the characters is interesting. But what followed had too much physical toing and froing for my taste. There are many twists and turns, and the big reveal is clever. Pyper's writing is very good. Ultimately, this one comes down to a matter of taste. I didn't love it but there are many positive well deserved s.

Her memoir, The Art of Leaving, is almost a companion to her book of short stories – she covers many of the same places and I recognize the sensibilities and experiences of her main characters. Although she is only in her 40s, Tsabari has had an interesting life and her writing is expressive and engaging. Tsabari was born in Israel to parents of Yemeni origin. Her father died when she was 10 years old. Her grandmother had been abandoned by her own mother when she was 2 years old. Until recently, Tsabari has led an unconventional life, traveling the world, strongly attached to her family and people but often looking to leave and looking to move on. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of her life – her father’s death, her military service, her travels to India, time spent in New York, returning to Israel to learn more about her family, becoming a mother, etc… As she writes, she slowly discovers where she comes from and what motivates her. This is a rich memoir with lots of food for thought. I’m definitely looking forward to her next book.

I really enjoyed reading Anne Lamber’s The Birds That Stay, and I know it’s largely because it takes place in contemporary Quebec — but I also found this to be one of those thoughtful mysteries that delves below the surface. An older woman is murdered north of Montreal in the Laurentians. As the story unfolds, it focuses on one of the neighbours Marie Russel, on Detective Romeo Leduc and on an apparent con artist operating in seniors’ homes in Montreal. The mystery isn’t that complicated. But I really liked the characters and the strong sense of time and place. Lambert uses the story as an opportunity to explore some of Quebec’s history and contemporary cultural complexity. I especially liked Marie and Romeo. Both in late middle age, their struggles with aging parents, adult children and loneliness felt realistic and three dimensional. I hope they surface in future books Lamber writes.

They are part of a mystery series set in Canada, and they typically deal with recent events and contemporary issues. The last one involved a mystery amidst Canadian relief workers working with Syrian refugees in Greece. In this case, the mystery is centered on a shooting in a mosque in a small town in Quebec just outside of Ottawa. With this setting, the author again takes on some important and complicated issues. Her afterword is brilliant, reflecting on the recent shooting in a mosque in Quebec City and its relationship to the recent political climate. Despite the topic, I must say that I struggled with the story and delivery in this case. There was far too much focus on the overwrought emotional and romantic lives of the two main detectives, Rachel and Esa. I struggled a bit with this in her last book, but this time I found it hard to take the story seriously. Every step in their investigation seemed to be affected by their respective romantic entanglements. I also found the solution a bit disappointing. I won’t give up on this series quite yet. The very end points to the next mystery, and I confess that my curiosity is piqued. But I wish that the author focused more on what makes her novels so engaging and less on the romantic turpitudes of her detectives.

Her stories are unconventional. And the feelings in her books run deep. So it was a bit of a surprise to read My Lover’s Lover, which is only recognizable as a book by O’Farrell for its beautiful writing. The first half is taken up by an odd and unpleasant relationship between Lily and Marcus. They meet at a party. Days later Lily moves in with Marcus, only to realize that his attention is still taken up by Sinead, who it seems has disappeared. Lily then becomes obsessed with Sinead, who starts showing up in Lily’s peripheral vision — a ghost, an apparition? I was pretty unenthusiastic after the first half. Marcus is a cad. I couldn't relate to Lily’s emotions. And I don’t really like supernatural tinges mixed in with my fiction about otherwise normal - even if unpleasant - people.Fortunately, the second half offered somewhat of a redemption. We learn more about Sinead, Marcus' friend Aidan takes on a good role, and the story makes a bit more sense.Final verdict? If this hadn’t been written by O’Farrell, it wouldn't have been worth it at all. O'Farrell's writing carries this one, and allowed me to give it a tad more than 3 stars.By far, the best part of this one was reading it along with my reading buddies, Angela and Diane....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Dec 15, 2018","Dec 16, 2018","Dec 01, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/862779.My_Lover_s_Lover

The other story line involves Yuri’s parents, and their move to the US from the former Soviet Union in the 1980s.

I find that Jewell's novels are often a cut above many other psychological thrillers. She writes well and her characters are well developed. Watching You is definitely well written and tense, but I figured out what was happening quite early on and I'm not sure the denouement worked as well for me as in some of Jewell's other books. The story focuses on a group of characters in a small town in England. Joey - aka Josephine - and her new husband are living with Joey's brother and his wife. Joey - and every other woman and teenage girl its seems - is attracted to her neighbour, Tom. Tom, his wife and son have recently moved to the community, where Tom is the new head of the local school. There's a suggestion that of something sinister about Tom. But is there? My favourite characters were Tom's son and another teenage neighbour. Jewell is always strong in her depiction of children and teenagers. I didn't love the adults or ending. But my 3.5 star rating reflects that it was still worth reading.

But I must admit that I didn’t love reading it. It was a question of genre and style rather than content. Set at some point in the future in the US, life for African Americans has become an exaggeration of what it is today. Levels of surveillance and incarceration are very high. There are fenced ghettos. Etc... The narrator identifies himself as one of the 10% lucky enough to avoid the fate of most African American men. He is lawyer in a large firm. But he is obsessed with the precariousness of his situation and especially with his 13 year old son’s vulnerability. As far as he’s concerned, the solution is a “treatment” increasing in popularity that will make his son white. The idea underlying this novel is clever, the topic is timely and there are many inspired details. But I’m not a great fit for the genre.

One day, a man shows up and tells her he thinks she went missing as a child in Kentucky, USA, in 1990. The story unfolds in two plot lines -- one focusing on Kim as an adult trying to figure out whether this is true and what happened and the other going back to the early 1990s at the time of the abduction. It's a dark story with quite a few interesting twists and turns. Some of the characters and their interactions were especially strong. While also takes on some real contemporary issues -- that I won't mention for fear of giving away some spoilers. The only reason it wasn't quite a 4 star read for me was that there were a few too many sharp turns at the end that left me shaking my head. But, still, it kept me reading and I will definitely look for White's next book.

Marianne Power recounts her year of living according to a different self help book each month. Each book contains a different set of instructions: do one thing that scares you every day, get a handle on your debts and finances, say f*ck it and do what feels good, find your personal angel, seek out rejection from one person each day, etc... The concept seems designed for a lot of humour. But it turns out to be a bit more complicated than a lighthearted poke at self help books. Which gets me back to the Kinsella style heroine. Power approaches her task with humour, but also with a fair bit of sincerity. I laughed but was left with some food for thought. Do self help books make people too self-centered? Is there any way in which advice books can be helpful? It depends on the book and the person is the pretty obvious answer. But Power’s sincerity and self-deprecating humour made it worth the ride.

I usually stay miles away from anything that has a sci-fi or surreal feel. But I read so many positive s of The Dreamers that I became curious. And I must confess that I had requested an advance copy without realizing what it was about. So I dipped my toe in the first few pages and got hooked. In fact, I loved it. The premise is simple. A small isolated university town in California is hit with a sleeping disease. It starts with a few students and then spreads to many people in the town. The story is told in a somewhat dreamy tone, shifting between different characters whose lives intersect in various ways as they are caught up in the effects of this mysterious illness. The fabulous writing and the depiction of the characters and their various reactions are what had me glued to this book. It made for an intense reading experience — leaving me with lots of food for thought. It wasn’t quite a 5 star read because I felt like the story got a bit bogged down in the middle, but it was awfully close to 5 stars. Again, the writing was just phenomenal. I’m definitely not a convert to sci-fi or speculative fiction or whatever genre this book would fall in, but the door is no longer shut as firmly.

Love Is BliReading a William Boyd novel ensures a view of history, some travel and a somewhat naive main character trying to make sense of the world. Love Is Blind is no exception. The novel is set in the late 19th and early 20th century, focusing on Brodie Moncur, a Scottish piano tuner. Brodie comes from a large dysfunctional family near Glasgow, and he is fortunate to be sent off to Paris to work for a Scottish piano manufacturer. There, he meets Lida, a Russian singer, thereafter becoming blinded by love. The story is somewhat of a picaresque, moving to many countries, where Brodie meets various people as he pursues Lida, vying for her competing attentions. Brodie’s poor eyesight is a pretty stark metaphor for his lack of insight — as is the title. Yet, it’s hard not to like him and root for him.

The story is set in India, moving between the 1930’s and the 1980’s. The narrator, Myshkin, is in his 60’s, and looking back on his childhood. His mother left the family when Myshkin was 9 years old. Later in life, having received a package containing letters written by his mother in the first few years after her departure, Myshkin tries to make sense of this time in his life. As the backdrop to Myshkin’s family crisis, WWII was raging and India was marching toward independence from British rule. I loved the writing which was descriptive without being overwrought. I loved the historical setting, which allowed me to learn about a part of Indian history. And I loved Myshkin’s character and perspective — the abandoned awkward child as much as the contemplative adult. There were holes in the story, which at times were a bit frustrating. But, to me, this was a minor flaw — I really enjoyed this one.

And perhaps you can guess the rest... Predictable — but enjoyable and warm-hearted. And Reid is a lovely main male character...

But I haven’t loved her more recent books as much. She remains a good writer and still has deep insight into people and their complexities, but there’s an edge of preachiness to her writing that I find a bit jarring — even if I tend to agree with what she is preaching about.Unsheltered was yet another such book. Told in two timelines, Unsheltered tells the stories of people pushed out to the margins making do and forming communities. In the contemporary storyline, the story focuses on three generations of a family forced to live in a old decrepit family home due to economic circumstances. The historic storyline set in the late 19th century is also set in the same family home. Other than the house, the thematic connections between both stories are not obvious, other than the focus on people trying to make the best of difficult economic or political circumstances.I must admit that I much preferred the contemporary storyline. While I found Kingsolver’s political message a bit too naked, I nevertheless really enjoyed the characters. I found the 19th century story really flat, even though it dealt with interesting historical figures.I expect true fans of Kingsolver’s books will like this one, but I wouldn’t suggest starting with Unsheltered if you’re interested in this book.Thank you to my reading buddies, Angela and Diane, for reading this one with me, even the though I lagged far behind in reading this mammoth book.

I recently read I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes with Death and The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox, and now I’ve just finished This Must Be the Place. Her two other books got 5 stars from me, and this one gets a high 4 stars.The novel focuses on Daniel and Claudette, who are married and have two children together and each have children from prior relationships. Claudette is a former film star escaping her previous life and Daniel is troubled by a few ghosts of his own. When they meet, Claudette is a recluse living in a remote area of Ireland. The story is told though multiple characters who have come into contact with Claudette or Daniel at some point in time. Theirs is a relationship made complicated by their various demons but held together by the strong bond with their children.The storytelling is original and the writing is beautiful. I really loved the multiple points of view and the slipperiness of time — the story felt much like a puzzle that slowly came together through its multiple small parts. The only reason it didn’t quite make it into my rarified 5 star basket is that I wasn’t enchanted by Claudette or Daniel. They were both a bit too melodramatic for my tastes. Having said that, I loved most of the secondary characters through whom Claudette and Daniel’s story is told — I particularly liked their unusual and lovely children. O’Farrell puts so much substance into her characters — not relying on stock characters or stereotypes I will definitely read more books by Maggie O’Farrell.

The story takes place over the course of a few days during the trial, and is told from the perspective of a number of characters including the owners of the chamber. Everyone has multiple layers of secrets that come out slowly as the story unfolds. It’s hard to categorize this one by genre. It’s not really a psychological thriller or a mystery.

But there are some excellent novels based on real events that serve as an important reminder of this dark time in history. Auschwitz Lullaby mostly worked for me. It is based on the true story of Helene who was a German woman married to a Roma man, who at the time was referred to as a Gypsy and was part of one of the groups targeted by Hitler for annihilation. At the beginning of the book, the Nazis come to Helene’s house to apprehend her husband and their five children. Unable to let her children go, Helene makes the decision to go with them. She ends up interned as a prisoner at Auschwitz with her five children and separated from her husband. Because she is German, she is entrusted with running a nursery for her children and other gypsy children under Mengele’s supervision. The novel is an account of how Helene does what she can for her own children and for the other children in the nursery, while surrounded by death and depravity. The writing is straightforward but it works to convey Helene’s story and the story of the horrific treatment of the Roma people by the Nazis.My one quibble is that the story is presented as Helene’s journal as found and read by Mendele many years after the war. This is apparently not based on fact. It feels hokey and I felt that it diminishes the story of Helene’s courage and the suffering of the people she tried to help. This flaw is only evident at the beginning and end of the book, and wouldn’t deter me from recommending it.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Aug 24, 2018","Aug 25, 2018","Aug 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36576005-auschwitz-lullaby

Not Her Daughter had me riveted and reading at breakneck speed, but not because I enjoyed it but because I couldn’t quite believe what I was reading. This is yet another child abduction psychological thriller. The twist in this case is that Sarah abducts 5 year old Emma because she is concerned that Emma is being abused by her mother Amy. The story opens with the abduction, and is told from the points of view of both Sarah and Amy at different points in time. I don’t object as a matter of principle to this odd sub genre of psychological thrillers. In fact, I’ve enjoyed a few including What Was Mine and a few others I listed in this  of What She Knew https://www.goodreads.com//show.... But in this case I just couldn’t suspend disbelief and found myself shaking my head over and over. A few issues in no particular order:-The characters — including their motivations and actions — just didn’t ring true. For example, while Sarah’s decision to abduct Emma is completely nutso, she is far too perfect in how she treats Emma. Also, no 5 year old would behave that perfectly after being abducted no matter how dysfunctional the original family. -There were a few glaring logistical inconsistencies in the plot. For example, Sarah emphasizes that she can only pay for things with cash, but at one point rents an AirBNB apartment online.-There were too many weird plot threads, including why things didn’t work out with Sarah’s ex, the over the top success of Sarah’s business and Amy’s exploration of prior lives through some kind of hypnotherapy.-And the ending! Good grief! It leaves so many questions unanswered...Again, my objections to this one are not on moral grounds. I just found the story to be one hot mess.But I’m an outlier.

Having now read The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox, I see that O’Farrell has incredible talent. Her writing is phenomenal and her perspective on people, relationships and life is scary insightful. Iris finds out that she has a great aunt — Esme — she never knew existed who has been living in a psychiatric hospital for 60 years. Iris takes her great aunt home as the hospital is closing. The story is told from the perspectives of Iris, Esme and Kitty. Kitty is Iris’ grandmother and Esme’s sister, and she is suffering from Altzheimers. It turns out that there’s a heartbreaking backstory to Esme’s hospitalization. She is odd but certainly not mentally ill. Esme’s story comes out slowly through snippets of consciousness and memory from both Esme and Kitty. They spent their early childhood in India, and then moved to Edinburgh at a time when social norms were painfully rigid and there was no language available to discuss many topics. In such a world, Esme’s oddness makes her horribly vulnerable. And the ending is quite something. Beautiful, infuriating and heartbreaking. This book makes me want to read all of O’Farrell’s books.

But I must admit that I liked this one I was not very generous with my  of Conversations with Friends, which was Sally Rooney’s previous novel. But I must admit that I liked this one a whole lot more. Rooney really gets into the heads of her characters. Her novels are angsty and introspective. I couldn’t relate to the characters in Conversations with Friends, and I just couldn’t get interested in their inner turmoil and interpersonal dynamics. But the characters in Normal People interested me far more. The story focuses on Marianne and Connell. It starts when they are teenagers in a small town in western Ireland, and it follows them to university in Dublin. They are both complex characters, whose efforts to communicate and connect keep misfiring. They come from different class backgrounds and have very different family lives — both factors that play a big role in who they are and how they connect and don’t connect. Rooney’s writing seems effortless, yet she conveys a lot through few words and brief interactions. Because of the age of the characters, at times the novel felt like sophisticated YA fiction — which is not a criticism as far as I’m concerned, but it might be a turn off for readers who like more mature characters. I’m glad I gave Rooney another try. I’ll be looking forward to her next book.

But it took me a long time to listen to the audio because it felt like I could only listen to so much bleak information about the opioid crisis at any given time. Beth Macy looks at opioid addiction from many perspectives, including its causes and the failing efforts to implement a solution that works. But what makes this one especially difficult and compelling are the stories of individual addicts and their families. Macy got very close to several of her subjects. This made for a powerful, and sometimes almost unbearable, listening experience.Recommended and important, but brace yourself for the experience....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Nov 15, 2018","Dec 27, 2018","Jul 31, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37486540-dopesick

Ted Grayson is a reputed news anchor, who is caught online saying something horrible to the young woman fixing his hair one night before a broadcast. From there — thanks mostly to the relentlessness of social and online media — Ted’s life spirals out of control. But it turns out that his life was pretty shaky already — his wife is leaving him and he is alienated from his adult daughter. What I loved about Talk to Me is that it gave me a lot of food for thought while stirring up real emotions. Much of the book is taken up with Ted’s self-reflection. Ted has some deep flaws, but he isn’t a monster. Yet, he lives in a world where social media can turn you into a pariah almost instantly. I thought Kenney does a masterful job of not excusing Ted while making him human — a reality that can get lost in a world curated by the scandal seeking media and social media comments. And the beginning of the book is absolutely brilliant.

I've been in a bit of a reading slump, but fortunately have found a few decent mysteries recently to keep me interested in reading. Open Your Eyes is definitely one of them. It's the second book I've read by Paula Daly and by far my favourite. Jane lives in Liverpool with her husband and two young children. One day, her life is turned upside down when an attempt on her husband's life leaves him brain damaged. Jane then has to deal with a husband who doesn't recognize her and doesn't remember what happened to him, the fear of not knowing why someone tried to kill her husband and all of the other ordinary life stresses of family, work and small children. I liked Jane as a character. She comes across as a normal person dealing with extraordinary circumstances. I also liked that both Jane and her husband are writers. This fact plays an interesting role as the story unfolds, and especially at the end. Low on violence and high on interesting smart human interaction. My kind of mystery! I now want to go back and read some of Daly's other books.

Our final verdict: it took a while to get into and the solution to the mystery was kinda crazy and messy, but it was ok “I guess”. At the heart of The Au Pair is a lineage mystery. The story is told in two timelines. In present day, 25 year old Seraphine has just lost her father. Her mother died the day she was born. She has a twin brother and an older brother. And she is convinced that there is some mystery in her family background she needs to find out. The earlier time frame is focused on Laura, who is the au pair who came to live with Seraphine’s family before the twins were born. If you think the story of Seraphine’s lineage is obvious from this description, it isn’t. The Au Pair is entertaining, but all a bit convoluted and improbable for my tastes.

The book opens with the line “My husband did not mean to kill Annie Doyle, but the lying tramp deserved it”. The story is told from the perspective of Lydia who is the murderer’s wife, Lydia’s son Lawrence, and Annie’s sister Karen. It’s best to say little of the plot because this one is worth going into cold. Suffice it to say that Lydia’s narrative holds the story together. From the first line, it’s quite clear that there is something not quite right about her. Lawrence starts off in his mother’s thrall but slowly things get complicated for him.

Set in North Carolina in the 1920s, the story is told from the point of view of A high 4 stars!Call Your Daughter Home is a fabulously intense novel. Set in North Carolina in the 1920s, the story is told from the point of view of three very different women who’s lives intersect at pretty terrible times in their lives. Gertrude is a very poor white women, caught in a violent marriage, trying to figure out how to protect and feed her four daughters. Annie is part of the local gentry, married to a landowner with four living adult children, her two daughter being estranged. Oretta is an older black woman, who works for Annie, and who lost her only daughter many years earlier. Both Annie and Gertrude end up relying on Oretta to help them through some really hard times. I don’t want to say too much to avoid spoilers, but the title is definitely apt for one of the main themes in the book. The characters are great — they each have very distinct voices. Outside forces make their lives challenging, but, without being perfect, they draw on each other and deep wells of resilience to carry on. This is a great period piece and I gather it is based on stories from the author’s great grandmother and grandmother. I found it hard to put down and it definitely made me teary more than once. This was also a great book to read as a buddy read with Angela and Diane.

There’s a deadpan quality to Bauer’s writing in Snap that really worked for me. On a late summer day, 11 year old Jack and his two siblings are left by the side of the road while their mother goes to get help for the broken down car. Their mother never comes back. Flash forward three years, and Jack fends for his siblings and is on the lookout to figure out who killed his mother. While Jack’s determination to look after his siblings is admirable, there are no adult heroes in Snap. The police are not particularly clever and the other adults could do better. The mystery became obvious to me fairly early on, but I still really enjoyed this one because of the characters and atmosphere.

But I quickly found myself scratching my head. Cass and Jonathan have been married for five years. They live in New York, are both having work troubles and wondering whether it’s time to have a baby. Then Cass panics and decides it’s time to have a relationship “intermission”. She moves to Los Angeles and he stays in New York. They meet every few weeks as they trade their dog back and forth. The story is told from their alternating points of view. There is a bit of a Sophie Kinsella feel to Friedland’s writing. I have room for lighter rom com type fiction every now and then, but this one didn’t really work for me. I found myself intensely disliking Cass. I could not figure out what was motivating her decisions and what type of person she was meant to be. There is one decision she makes that was particularly unappealing and cringe making. Jonathan didn’t make much more sense to me. And it felt so long... I’m sure there’s an audience for this lighthearted look at the vicissitudes of early married life, but I wish I had given it a pass.

The Secrets Between Us features some of the same characters as her earlier book The Space Between Us. Set in Mumbai, India, the story focuses on Bhima and Parvati, two older women with difficult pasts living precarious lives. Bhima lives in a slum with her granddaughter, surviving on income made from cleaning and cooking for others. Parvati barely survives by selling six heads of cauliflower every day. Both women are hardened and guarded in their own ways — Bhima determined to be proper and Parvati quick to be irreverent. Through necessity, the women forge a business relationship and eventually a friendship selling produce together in the market. Their backstories are heartbreaking, but this is also a forward looking book, suggesting that there is room in modern India for women to be more independent and for the class system to lose some of its rigidity. This isn’t a literary masterpiece, but I really liked the characters — especially the relationship between Bhima and Parvati — and found the story kept me reading.

Her stories are deceptively simple, but the strength of her writing is in the nuanced interactions between her characters. Clock Dance wasn’t my favourite Anne Tyler, but it still gave me the satisfaction of reading fiction written by a master. The story focuses on different slices in the life of main character Willa. We see Willa at age 11 when her mother disappears for a few days, Willa at age 21 when she brings her boyfriend home from college, Willa in her early 40s when faced by a terrible loss and Willa in her early 60s when she is unexpectedly propelled to care for someone else’s 11 year old. As I write this description, I realize that there’s a symmetry to the story I had missed as I read it. The real focus of Taylor’s novel is how Willa is shaped by these events, and how her personality simultaneously helps and hinders her. Taylor is the master of scenes where emotions are potent and much is left unsaid, and there are plenty of such scenes in Clock Dance. Without saying it explicitly, Taylor shows Willa’s life as a life of kindness, hindered by hesitation and carefulness. It feels painful and real, although the end is satisfying. Recommended for fans of Anne Tyler.

It was completely quirky and weird, but seriously turned my crank. Unfortunately, while French Exit has a similar oddball sensibility, this one fell quite flat for me. The story focuses on mother Frances and adult son Malcolm. As the story opens in New York, Frances learns that all her money is lost, after which she and Malcolm move to a friend’s apartment in Paris, where a number of people drift into their world. De Witt writes beautifully. I love his use of language which has a deadpan oddball feel. I didn’t even mind some of the surreal elements to the story – a dead father channeled through a cat as just one example. But ultimately the story didn’t really engage me. I wasn’t particularly charmed by the characters or interested in their fate. And the story felt somewhat aimless – like a collection of odd events rather than a whole that came together. It looks like de Witt is hit or miss for me – I didn’t much care for The Sisters Brothers but loved Undermajordomo Minor. That’s ok. Given the quality of his writing, I’ll keep giving him a chance.

He deserves this unusual name because he is a quirky man living in an odd town at the centre of a unusual story. From one perspective, Virgil is an unlucky man living amongst many unlucky people. The story opens with Virgil recovering from a spectacular car accident, and other characters die or have unfortunate accidents. But this isn’t really a story of woe, but more about community — how the people around Virgil are in each other’s business and how they care for each other. There’s also a fair bit of goodnatured humour to the story. I loved the writing. It’s simple, but every now and then, seemingly out of nowhere, there’s a stunning moment of insight or beautiful description. I liked the original characters and the strong sense of community. I generally enjoyed the plot — although I felt that it got wobbly in the middle and I’m not sure what I think about one aspect of the end — but I was certainly interested in seeing where Virgil was taking me. In the end, this was a 4 star read with a + in recognition of the strong writing. This was another lovely monthly buddy read and Diane and Angela.
