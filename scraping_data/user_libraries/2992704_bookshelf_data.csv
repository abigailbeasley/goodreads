The artist, who has been reading Thoreau for over 20 years, chose his favorite short excerpts from Thoreau's journals, organized by theme. They are the passages that inspired MacIver's life and his art, making it a very personal book. He believes that Thoreau ""challenges us and asks us to live our own truths with joy and discipline."" There are over 90 vivid paintings that reflect his own deep affinity with nature, where he finds both wildness and serenity.These journal writings of Thoreau present his raw, unedited and sometimes contradictory feelings and thoughts about his deep beliefs about what give value to life. We come to understand his belief that there must be contemplation, observation and attentiveness to nature. And that then ""we must walk consciously only part way toward our goal, and then leap in the dark . . ."" to find our own paths to the fullness of life.Because of the paintings and the MacIver's choice of Thoreau's passages, this is not your standard Barnes and Noble cut-rate remaindered gift books of the past-copyrighted writers....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 29, 2010","Apr 11, 2010","Mar 16, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7762546-thoreau-and-the-art-of-life

I remember being stunned, in college to hear a goddamn professor talking about Caulfield's ""mental illness,"" for crying out loud, (since he wasn't a hippie, a beat, a slacker, a member of any counterculture, but a wealthy prep-schooler.) I thought that I must be mentally ill then, too. Sensitivity, alienation, soulfulness, which so many readers identified with, were seen by lousy academics and critics as Caulden's dysfunction. So we got to hear the praises of the big-mouthed hot-shot American Virile Men of his generation, like Hemingway, Updike, Roth and Mailer who either made it in the crappy conventional world, (despite Mailer's shooting of his wife) or Hemingway at least having the grace to kill himself. Those hot-shots kept publishing and satisfying the (mostly male) publishers and critics. Whereas, Salinger, Vonnugut, Heller, and Harper Lee, the soft-hearted, soul-searchers, who were the authors that were most influential and beloved by Readers, male and female, of that generation, were put on the B-list, for christsake. It seems only Wallace Shawn editor of the New Yorker, his original publisher, respected his wishes not to publish and didn't judge his choice of life-style, which was partly exaggerated and mythologized.Catcher in the Rye is funny and moving, with beautiful details and dialogue. It speaks to us, not just the adolescents, but those of us who who are sensitive and still carry the sting of feeling like outsiders. And because of it, we sought out his short stories, Franny and Zooey and the search for meaning in life, partly finding some, still searching for it, and partly sensing the futility of it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 07, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye

Through the use of stories of individual medical mysteries she takes on the bigger picture of medicine, such as how the physical examination can reveal so much, yet is not emphasized at med schools and often forgone in lieu of the technological tests. She also writes about the art of listening, and not jumping to conclusions, or pursuing those conclusions too long and looking with ""fresh eyes""' and the lack of good communication between doctors.

The book is her personal story, what she has gone through, including being so suicidal that she was hospitalized. After years of unhelpful (to say the least) psychiatrists and other practitioners, unenlightened advice from friends, and through determination and tenacity she has found some things what has made her life as a writer, mother and wife possible. She includes a list (her ""twelve-step program"") what has helped her, and what has been proved to be helpful to some sufferers. She includes some great quotes from people like Peter Kramer ""depression is an illness, not an attitude"" and Kate Redfield Jamison. She also writes about being highly sensitive, which can lead to over-arousal and the need to set boundaries.She writes with humor and compassion and knowledge. I found very moving her epilogue ""I, Too Have a Dream"" in which she lists her hopes that one day there won't be the stigma of mental illness, that genetic, neurological and biochemical research will lead to better treatments (and affordable!!), that the public will be better educated, and thus less judgmental, about depression and bipolar disorder.I would recommend this book to an someone suffering with depression and their friends and family, especially those who might be judgmental, in denial, or put off by more impersonal, dogmatic, or overwhelming self-help books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 04, 2010","Dec 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6380409-beyond-blue

Although it begins in Dublin in the 50's and ends in NY in 2006, almost all of it is seen through the stories of ordinary people around the time of and on the day of Phillip Petit's tightrope walk across the still unfinished Twin Towers in 1973. As Phililp walks, dances lies down, like an angel in the sky, ordinary people below are stumbling, criminals ""parading"", hookers ""on the stroll"" -- people always walking, some away from grief, and towards love, beauty, hope.The writing is so textured and vivid and grounded in physicality, yet soaring with lovely metaphors. At a time when Vietnam vets are returning home alive, or in body bags, New York is a bankrupt, crime ridden, corrupt city. Yet, McCann shows us the beauty and humanity in the characters. the characters find beauty in others. Some of them are: A worker priest trying to give any solace to the elderly and the hookers, fighting his physical desires for a woman he loves. One of the hookers, filled with humor and pride, yet driven to grief and lamentation. Women grieving the death of their sons in Vietnam, one of them married to the judge who sentences Petit and the hooker on the same day, the hackers at the very beginning of the computing ""internet revolution"" sending out signals, trying to connect electronically. A boy fascinated by the courage of the subway tunnel graffiti artists and taggers . He emerges from the underground and takes a picture of Petit on the tightrope, with an airplane in the image, forshadowing 9-11. These peoples stories all connect in some way, as they carry on, trying to stay upright, a balancing act in a spinning world....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2009,"Nov 29, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin
