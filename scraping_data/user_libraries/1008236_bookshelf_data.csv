Without the editors’ copious annotations, in fact, readers would be completely adrift in a sea of requests for clean shirts and money. Elizabeth’s thinly veiled hostility and the book’s unnecessary length also drew some critics’ ire. However, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal did detect a progression along professional and personal lines—enough to enhance their understanding of him. Nevertheless, Under the Sun will probably only appeal to fans and those with an academic interest in Chatwin.

But as long as readers can see South Africa through the lens of Beukes’s deliciously dystopian alternate present, who needs those guys?

The work is bleaker and more melancholy, introspective, and metafictional than previous installments, but no less compelling. About dysfunctional relationships, love, and parent-child bonds, the novel excels in its depiction of individual struggles, passions, and choices. Only the Telegraph felt that the novel bogged down in tedious asides and flashbacks, and the Salon critic wondered whether Jackson Brodie’s adventures would become too contrived in future books. But until that happens, Atkinson provides another worthy and compelling look inside modern-day culture.

Some ers thought Just had brilliantly reconceptualized the Künstlerroman (or a novel about the maturation of an artist) by abandoning many of the clichés of the coming-of-age narrative. But some, while appreciating what Just was trying to do, felt that the relationships between the various people and places in the book were just too confusing to enjoy.

Between 1944 and 1974, more than 20 medical experiments charted the effects of radiation on pregnant women, including one at Vanderbilt University, where poor, white pregnant women were given cocktails of radioactive iron.

Stoic, cool, self-possessed, and relentless, Pike not only complements his partner but gives the series greater depth and flavor. Most ers felt that The Sentry, like previous novels in the series, has a confident plot, fast-paced action, an insider's view of a multifaceted Los Angeles, and enough suspense to keep turning the pages. Only a couple faulted the plot and some contrived villains. Though it's best to start at the beginning of the series, The Sentry is a good place to get to know Pike better, as well as an excellent entry in the series.

First, Simon Winchester is one of the best-loved nonfiction writers in the English-speaking world: his journalistic style has won over millions, and the minority that find it annoying already know why. Second, Winchester's project -- a comprehensive history of the Atlantic -- is simply impossible. Therefore, most s measured the book's success as a great writer's attempt at a worthy challenge. Critics all assessed that effort differently. Some found the book's structure unwieldy, for example, while others praised it as a brilliant solution to the challenge of containing an ocean's worth of stories.

Schiff delved into recent scholarship on women in the Hellenistic period, as well as older written sources, to offer a juicy portrait of Cleopatra that makes us rethink the queen we know from history and paint a panoramic picture of her world. The main players, including Caesar and Antony, come breathtakingly alive; so, too, does Alexandria, a sumptuous city exploding with sounds and scents. Psychologically astute and beautifully written, Cleopatra is sure to become the definite biography of the ruler, a work worthy of Cleopatra's own wisdom and learning.

The automatic weapon is, of course, the focus, but Chivers goes far beyond a mere technical history to offer ""an engrossing yet plainspoken exploration of what guns are and what they do,"" from their psychological effects to their economic and political impacts (Salon). Chivers, whose firsthand reportorial and military experiences informed his book, left few sources uncovered; he even interviewed the aging Kalashnikov. Despite general praise, a few critics thought the broad historical perspective (such as the long sections on the American M-16 assault rifle) too digressive, but most agreed that The Gun is a riveting, well-handled look at one of the modern world's most influential -- and destructive -- technologies.

But less picky critics seemed to truly relish Mentor as a book for literary insiders. As to whether the memoir should be recommended to aspiring writers, critics severely disagreed.

Reviewers interested in business and trade had no trouble understanding Lobo's importance, but many who would have otherwise not shown much interest in sugar were similarly impressed by Rathbone's use of the tycoon's life to show how Cuba has changed. A few critics, however, found the fit unsatisfying and some of Rathbone's personal digressions distracting (his mother was a Cuban exile of Lobo's social class).

A few ers thought that Spencer sometimes obscures his own message; others noted some uneven prose and dialogue. But the verdict is in: after reading the book, ""you should expect to come out of the woods shaken, and satisfied"" (Cleveland Plain Dealer).

Longtime admirers of Hiaasen's fiction will relish the wicked wit, fast-moving plot, and delightfully odious cast of characters in this satirical send-up of celebrity culture. However, some critics found Hiaasen's subject matter passé in the wake of the latest entertainment industry scandals, and one objected to contrived characters and plot developments. Despite their complaints, ers generally enjoyed Star Island, and readers will also laugh at Hiaasen's ""latest celebration of the grotesques and morally ambiguous citizens of his native Florida"" (San Francisco Chronicle), even if the novel doesn't rate as one of his best.

""And a way of further surrendering freedom is to spend quite a bit of time acting on those convictions."" Certainly, the novel's title announces its big theme--what freedom means to ideology, family, career--and the picture is not pretty. Patty, who recounts the Berglunds' past in a third-person autobiography, reflects that ""all she ever seemed to get for all her choices and all her freedom was more miserable."" It turns out that Franzen, too, thinks that America's obsession with personal liberty is illusory and ruinous. Even more tragic, Darwinian competition defines freedom: Richard and Walter compete for Patty, and Patty and Walter compete for their children's love, for example. Certainly, wrote Slate, ""everyone in the novel comes to rue freedom, their own and others'."" Many critics thought this leitmotif truly reflects modern American life. But a few called it heavy-handed. ""Unfortunately,"" noted the Washington Post, ""the novel doesn't offer its themes so much as bully us into accepting them with knife-to-the-throat insistence."" Then again, that kind of ""insistence"" is Darwin for you.The Approach: A Tolstoyan Perspective ""Given his book's scope and its repeated allusions to War and Peace,"" noted the San Francisco Chronicle, ""Franzen seems intent on writing a full-throated 19th-century-style novel--the personal played out against the backdrop of history""--9/11, the war in Iraq, late free-market capitalism, suburbanization, profiteering, wildlife conservation, and gentrification. Yet while his wide lens allows him to use the Berglunds as a filter to explore contemporary America, Franzen keeps his characters' messy tensions in sight and absorbs ""Tolstoy's astonishing capacity for [individual] empathy"" (Slate). Franzen turns his characters' private lives into public discourse as well: through the Internet, blogging, and YouTube, the Berglunds broadcast their concerns until their ""personal crises are thus framed as a microcosm of a national obsession with freedom and global pre-eminence"" (Wall Street Journal). Could Franzen, as Slate suggested, be ""the Tolstoy of the Internet era""?The Result: How Does It All Stack Up?Nine years have passed since the publication of The Corrections, and almost every critic made the inevitable comparison. ""Here's another Midwestern family, another surgical exploration of the spent body and wretched soul of America, another ... inquiry into the paradox of being human,"" said the San Francisco Chronicle. A few opined that Franzen breaks little new ground with Freedom, and the Washington Post went so far as to call it ""stale."" Others thought that the novel ""sharpens the focus of [Franzen's] investigations, avoiding the excesses of the earlier novel"" (Los Angeles Times), and that, more tenderly and soberly, it walks the line between social satire and realism. ""Franzen's characters still fail here, and fail spectacularly, but the writer's final instinct, having given complex life to the Berglunds, is now to catch them when they fall ... where once he would have mocked,"" wrote the Telegraph. Most agreed that Franzen has evolved as a novelist since The Corrections--and that Freedom is equally enjoyable, ""equally dire"" (Slate).""[To] do something new is not to develop a form for the novel that has never been seen on earth before,"" Franzen told Time magazine. ""It means to try to come to terms as a person and a citizen with what's happening in the world now and to do it in some comprehensible, coherent way"" (8/12/10). Critics agreed that Freedom, heralded as a Great American Novel, offers a crystal clear portrait of our times, for better or for worse, and that, like The Corrections, it is a sweeping canvas of contemporary American life. Through richly nuanced characters whose large and small concerns we all recognize (from recycling batteries and using cloth diapers to wrestling with values), Franzen delves deep into the disturbed state of American life and its denizens, ""confused, searching people capable of change and perhaps even transcendence"" (New York Times). They may not all be likable, but they're human. Many critics thought Patty--and her autobiography--one of the most compelling, wrenching characters in recent literature. And there are few prose stylists as masterful: ""Love him or hate him ... you've got to admit [Franzen is] an extraordinary stylist, America's best answer to Martin Amis,"" wrote the Washington Post.Of course, with a novel built with such great expectations, criticism was inevitable, even from ers who professed to be enthralled with the work. A few took issue with what they described as Franzen's superior tone and dialogue, which sometimes ""lapses into filibuster"" (San Francisco Chronicle) and threatens to undermine the novel's liberal politics. Some also faulted Patty's manuscript, which plays an important role in chronicling the source of the Berglunds' problems, as inconsistent, confusing, and acerbic. A few far-fetched plots (including Joey's involvement with a corrupt, Halliburton-like corporation) confounded others. But most disturbing of all, perhaps, is Franzen's bleak view of human nature. ""The only way to get through hell, Mr. Franzen suggests, is to resign yourself to living there,"" noted the Wall Street Journal. But classic works--those destined to live long lives on our bookshelves--always raise questions about the questions they raise. To sum it up: ""If Freedom doesn't qualify as a Great American Novel for our time, then I don't know what would"" (Telegraph).

A similar challenge faces the er, and critics reading Pearl Buck in China mostly used their articles as occasions to celebrate the subject rather than the biography. Still, if ers were not effusive in their praise, they had few complaints about Spurling's book and clearly admired her thorough research and elegant prose. But as the New York Times pointed out, ""Ms. Spurling's book isn't a full-dress biography""; instead, it focuses mostly on Buck's formative years as a writer.

The Onion AV Club provided the only major dissent, claiming that in its attempt at profundity, the novel instead delves into ambiguity and aimlessness.

However, Winspear's melancholy voice, vivid descriptions of Depression-era London, and war-haunted characters add just the right amount of gloom to keep modern readers turning the pages. Winspear focuses nearly as much on Maisie's personal life and social circle as she does on the mounting body count, but most critics thought that the momentum and suspense don't suffer as a result. Though the Washington Times carped about Winspear's prose style, Maisie's followers will delight in her new adventure.

With devastating precision, Marlantes evokes the sights, smells, and horrors of the Vietnam War in a novel destined to become a war classic. There were very few quibbles, the most notable being an overly large cast of characters and the occasional stylistic blunder. Ultimately, however, critics hailed Matterhorn as a ""raw, brilliant account of war that may well serve as a final exorcism for one of the most painful passages in American history"" (New York Times Book Review), destined to stand alongside such classics as Catch-22, The Naked and the Dead, and The Things They Carried.

Certainly, it's a quirky book, filled with bizarre, proud characters and gruesome details. Yet while most ers praised Milgrom's clear-eyed, compassionate reporting, a few quibbled over the uneven prose, the weak links between chapters, and the lack of personal insight into Milgrom's choice of topic. A couple also commented that the numerous details clouded what could have been a larger story about our cultural history. So Still Life is what it is, but it is not more than that.

Everything Lewis has touched since has turned to gold, and The Big Short seems to be another of those books, combining an incendiary, timely topic with the author's solid, insightful, and witty investigative reporting.

Crime readers who don't yet know Nesbo will embrace the author, his tormented Harry Hole (comparisons have been made to Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch), and the complex, noirish Norway hiding beneath the placid surface.

They then proceeded to do so. Some critics, noting that this novella is not nearly as enmeshed with American life as the author's longer works, defended DeLillo's right to do something different. Others saw continuities with recent titles, claiming that in Omega Point, DeLillo finally achieves the mystical minimalism he sought in books like Falling Man. But many critics saw Omega Point as an attenuated version of the author's best work or, at worst, a kind of self-parody.

Most critics appreciated Aciman's nods to various novelists, poets, and composers--particularly Proust and Dostoevsky--but a few found the continuous stream of clever references belabored and affected. Aciman's decision to disengage his characters from the more humdrum realities of 21st-century life (such as unemployment, the economy, and the war in Afghanistan) left them strangely uprooted and diminished, and all but the Washington Post eventually grew tired of the narrator's perpetual interior monologues.

There is no doubt that telling the story of North Korea is a challenge, and Bradley K. Martin, a reporter who has written his own book on North Korea (see below), respected the way that Demick's work paralleled the academic trend of accepting defectors as reliable sources without taking everything they say as the gospel truth. Meanwhile, NPR correspondent Frank Langfitt wrote that he admired the way that Demick's storytelling skills helped her to make a ""page-turner"" out of the dreary years of famine under an inscrutable regime. Through telling the stories of the everyday lives of those who left North Korea, Demick humanizes the strict and indoctrinated society, sheds light on the plight of its citizens, and provides a compelling read.

However, Smith is an important voice in modern fiction--and, as one would expect, critics felt there was something here for everyone, but few liked the whole book. Some called Smith's republished movie s outdated and self-indulgent, but others were fascinated by what this greatly respected novelist had to say about Date Movie and 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin'. One point of critical consensus, however, was praise for Smith's essays about her father which, many ers noted, exhibit the spirit of her novels but in a more personal form.

Fans of Fforde's other work seemed to have little problem with the novel's bias toward exposition instead of plot, since world-building is what they enjoy. Critics note that Fforde fans should be prepared for a more subtle sense of humor in Shades of Grey compared to the Thursday Next series.

But Chabon comes out on top, impressing ers with his usual balancing act: on the one hand, a multitude of finely examined details, anecdotes, and references; on the other, a solid core of a story. That he could extract such a core greatly impressed some ers, although a couple noted that a few of the essays felt as if they had been written for men's magazines—for which they indeed already had. Others found his balancing act not so exceptional in an era of confessional fiction; nevertheless, they were impressed that Chabon could pull it off without falling into the usual pitfalls of the form.

Critics were quick to point out that this rollicking adventure tale will appeal to a broad spectrum of readers despite its religious overtones. Soskice's scholarship is impeccable, and she engages readers in the controversies surrounding the Bible in the late 19th century while skillfully evoking the prejudices of the Victorian era and placing her charming subjects squarely within it. The spirited sisters struggled for recognition and control of the """"Lewis Codex"""" amid academic suspicion, resentment, and treachery, and Soskice has penned a worthy tribute to their perseverance.

And like the vast majority who take chances, he occasionally strikes the wrong chord. In the slight Homer & Langley, the author's treatment of the history was a negative for some critics.

Surprisingly -- and dangerously, warns the New York Times Book Review -- Laird rests this multilayered, character-driven novel on two unlikable protagonists: the bitter, unapologetic David and the thoughtless, self-absorbed Ruth. However, the believable relationship between David and James, a more sinister version of The Odd Couple, is possibly the most fascinating aspect of the novel. Laird's prose, considered elegant and incisive by most critics, vexed the Telegraph, which labeled him ""a slightly fussy, clenched writer.""

In deft, graceful prose, See depicts the challenges and hardships -- many unimaginable -- that the Chin sisters face. However, despite the realistic detail and excellent research, particularly in the portrayals of Angel Island and the poverty-ridden China City, some critics thought that the descriptions about the women's divergent lives in Los Angeles slowed the story. And while most ers praised the sympathetic, flesh-and-blood characters, a few thought they succumbed to cultural platitudes and lacked introspection into their relationships and self-deceptions. Yet despite these flaws, Shanghai Girls is a compelling, educational portrait of Chinese assimilation, sure to be enjoyed by readers of See's previous work.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jul 30, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5960325-shanghai-girls

They also appreciated the book's unusual pacing that ""carries us along as it branches and swells, as if inspired by the great river on which so much of this book takes place"" (Washington Post). Gautreaux establishes much of Sam's backstory in the beginning and then devotes the rest of the book to Sam's time working on a steamboat and pursuing the missing girl. All of this adds up to a work that critics found moving and highly original.This is an excerpt from a  published in Bookmarks magazine....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jun 01, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5631674-the-missing

Lincoln a fine and useful addition to the growing canon of Lincolniana.This is an excerpt from a  published in Bookmarks magazine....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Apr 15, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4059448-a-lincoln

The book also does an excellent job of connecting the writer to his literary and social context. The Oregonian notes that while Barthelme can be difficult to read, ""in Daugherty's hands the stories seem not nearly as challenging as they are inviting,"" a point echoed by the Washington Post.

Drawing on such a wide range of source material has its benefits and drawbacks: Alford covers a lot of ground, but the result is, for some ers, a narrative that's a little too slack and uninspired.

They were impressed not just with his unparalleled access to the main actors in Iraq but also with his ability to integrate two commonly held but seemingly irreconcilable views -- that the war was a mistake and a catastrophe (as expressed in Fiasco) and that Petraeus and the surge represented an amazing turnaround.

Banks has become one of the most recognizable figures in a growing stable of gritty British crime solvers (Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus comes to mind). Critics are divided as to whether Robinson's latest effort is his best, but they are unanimous in praising the author's continued strong plotting and his main character's growth.

Drawing comparisons to Lady Macbeth and Medea, critics were repulsed and fascinated by Serena. Though some felt that her wickedness, undiluted by the slightest pangs of compassion or empathy, crossed into the realm of caricature toward the end, they all agreed that it was impossible to put the book down. Serena is not overtly political, despite a depraved doctor named Cheney, but it does provide a stinging indictment of the devastation wrought by greed, unfettered capitalism, and the misuse of power.

Roiphe has done her research and produced an elegant, provocative, and entertaining description of an era and some of its more eccentric denizens.This is an excerpt from a  published in Bookmarks magazine....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/919633.Uncommon_Arrangements

Carter has crafted a literary thriller peppered with shrewd observations about wealth, power, race, culture, and politics. Several critics were disappointed with the murder mystery, citing a melodramatic plot with too many characters. However, the Washington Post declared, ""Let's be honest: No one should read a Carter novel for the mystery."" Indeed, Carter's astute dissection of the upper-class black milieu and his scathing portrait of the subtly racist community surrounding the university shine brightest, offering a compelling exploration of ethics and power.
