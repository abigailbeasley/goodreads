Gosh darn it, I found this novel affecting, even if it was for all of the obvious reasons. Nothing snuck up on me here. The reason for my score I suppose is personal. Although I wasn’t adopted, many of Cyril the squirrel’s lifelong struggles around this theme somewhat mirror my own. Adoption *does* play a part in my life. My own astonishment and dismay at the hypocrisy so prevalent among the leadership of organized religion is present in this novel. I miss my mother. I fail to understand virtually all of the straight men in my admittedly small family tree. And this novel is beautifully, simply written. Immensely readable.

Not a romance, at least not in the traditional sense. This is a story about two characters’ slow recalibration of normal so that their lives can begin to make sense. All made much more difficult in an era when prejudice and sexism are worn on the sleeve and not shamefully so. Is this a good and well-written book? Yes it is, but I felt kept at arm’s length. This is often the case when the main character isn’t likable in the usual sense.

This is an elegant story written with a subtlety and nuance for which King is commonly underrated, and when employed by the writer, often misunderstood as weak. For a writer of his age, King’s audience skews young, and the appeal of a story like this might not be understood. That’s ok. It’s just not a story for them, for right now.
