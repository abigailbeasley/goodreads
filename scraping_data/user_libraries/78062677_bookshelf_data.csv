She takes a call from a young lady that is in distress and considering ending her life. From there, Felecia gets wrapped up in a situation that hits close to home. Though short, this was thoroughly entertaining. In my younger life, I was a 911 operator and so it brought up some calls that I answered, which will never leave me. It was easy to insert myself into the scenario.There is nothing overly surprising about this book. It is short and gets right to the point.

It is based on the trope of Strangers on the Train, by Alfred Hitchcock, which I have never read. It started slow and didn’t hook me in the way a previous thriller read had. A slow burn for sure. Then at 30% it picked up pace and you wondered where it was all heading. I for one, didn’t see it all clearly until the last few pages.Why four stars? I felt that parts of it were not authentic. The background was New York but I found some of the speech of the characters to be more British in language and style. (This is probably just me.) Also, as stated, it started slow and parts were a bit unbelievable. Still….. read this book. I can understand the high s this is receiving.
