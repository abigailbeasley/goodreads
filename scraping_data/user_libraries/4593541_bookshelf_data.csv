Ignatiev explains how the Catholic Irish in the late 18th/early 19th centuries fled persecution A landmark work that seems to only grow in relevance. Ignatiev explains how the Catholic Irish in the late 18th/early 19th centuries fled persecution from the colonised, Protestant-ruled Ireland to find new, freer lives in America. The Irish however quickly found themselves at the very bottom of American society, a rung they shared with Black people. In order for the Irish to engrain themselves in American society, Ignatiev suggests that they had to learn to become just as, if not more, oppressive and racist as their fellow Americans, in essence, the Irish had to become white. The book traverses the 19th century, bill by bill and riot by riot, showing how the new Irish Americans entered 'perpetual warfare' with Black people in order to gain a place in American society.Ignatiev's research is immense, undeniable and myth-shattering. There's many reasons why this book is heralded as a classic, one of those reasons however is not because of its readability. Sadly, Ignatiev's writing often descends into info-dump as you have dates and names and events just thrown at you and god help you if you aren't paying full attention. The result is a work that is harrowing in both its subject and style, something that is better referenced than read....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jun 04, 2020","Jun 12, 2020","Jun 04, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2767792-how-the-irish-became-white

His writings on gender theory were always pitched as more readable (and fun) than Butler's since he generally read gender through culture rather than Butler's impenetrable poststructuralist lens. Female Masculinity was a gospel but I never actually got around to reading it.A couple years later and I can finally call myself a Halberstan. Female Masculinity is a thorough exploration of the history of the masculine female and everything that entails. Ranging from the pre-Victorian era up to its time of publication, Halberstam looks at famed masculine females in history such as Anne Lister and Radclyffe Hall, the difference categories of female masculinity from tomboys to stone butches to FTMs, and even dedicates a chapter to the state of the drag king scene in the 90s.Despite being a book about gender theory and sexuality, it is incredibly readable and often entertaining as Halberstam has a knack for explaining even his most complex arguments in plain language (take THAT Butler). My one major criticism of the book is that Halberstam had the misfortune of writing it in 1998. A lot of the discussion, especially in the chapter about Butch/FTM border wars, seems very rudimentary and under-researched. This isn't a fault of Halberstam, there simply just wasn't enough research at the time for him to create a truly nuanced discussion that would survive the next twenty years. But thanks to his writing here, we now have troves of discourse on this topic, so it balances out.This is an excellent and expansive work of gender theory that will leave you questioning why men getting in touch with their feminine side is seen as good but women getting in touch with their masculine side is seen as strange and unpleasant. Why are feminine gay men lauded but masculine butch lesbians treated as outsiders? Ultimately the question that Halberstam asks us in this books is: what exactly does masculinity have to do with men?...more",Notes are private!,0,73,1,"May 27, 2020","Jun 04, 2020","May 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39304856-female-masculinity

Decades later, a Palestinian writer risks her life trying to obtain more information about this ‘minor detail’ in the wider history of an atrocity. These two narratives are melded together in Adania Shibli’s stunningly scrupulous novel, Minor Detail. Despite being a mere 112 pages, Shibli worked the best part of a decade to hone her novel down to a political narrative so sharp and so streamlined that not a single word seems out of place. The result is a novel that should be heralded as not only a masterpiece, but as a landmark in political fiction.

It's a sorta sequel toAlthough marketed as a standalone novel, not much of Dance Dance Dance would make sense if you haven't read A Wild Sheep Chase. It's a sorta sequel to Murakami's Trilogy of the Rat where we once again meet the unnamed narrator with a penchant for Cutty Sark and Bill Evans. A couple years after the events of A Wild Sheep Chase, our narrator finds himself returning to the strange and ethereal Dolphin Hotel in Sapporo. However, upon his arrival he is shaken to discover that the Dolphin Hotel has been entirely razed and on its site now sits the grand and opulent l'Hotel Dauphin. He asks around what happened to the Dolphin Hotel but nobody is letting on. It seems that all knowledge of the Dolphin Hotel has been expunged from history. In his attempt to find out what happened to the Dolphin, our narrator once again finds himself tangled in a cat's cradle of a plot which sees him revisiting his not-so-recent past.Murakami returns to his semi-hardboiled, semi-insane style of novel with Dance Dance Dance. In terms of bibliographical chronology, this novel was written after the surprising and runaway success Murakami had with Norwegian Wood. Completely bewildered by his sudden status as a literary celebrity, Murakami decided to retreat to familiar territory and wrote this sequel to his earlier series. If you're familiar with Murakami's novels, you'll know what a change of style Norwegian Wood is. At this point in his career it was perhaps his least Murakami-style novel but it was the one that became a massive success. It's still his most popular and enduring work, despite the fact it's so different from everything readers expected from Murakami.As a knowing reference to his new-found celebrity, there's a character in Dance Dance Dance named Hiraku Makimura, barely an anagram of Murakami's name, who is a novelist who became a 'darling of the literary community' but his success is sort-lived with critics panning all his subsequent novels and he eventually pivots to becoming a moderately successful travel writer. Perhaps Murakami suspected the same career path for himself, however, as we know, the success of Norwegian Wood was only the beginning of the dazzling career of Japan's greatest literary export. Yet just as the plot of A Wild Sheep Chase seemed to flounder and flop as the reader is taken on a disorientating journey of dead ends and MacGuffins, Dance Dance Dance suffers from the exact same problem. Murakami loves to leave the reader in the dark until the very last moment. A consequence of this is that the novel can read like an episodic jaunt through several completely unrelated scenes. This novel is also not as quickly paced as its predecessor, whereas Sheep Chase felt genuinely frenzied, this is more a gradual descent into the maelstrom.But yet I really enjoyed Dance Dance Dance. By reading Murakami's works in writing order, this is my fourth and final dalliance with the unnamed narrator and I feel it is a fitting end to the series. Meeting him in his early years in Hear the Wind Sing now feels like looking at an old black and white photograph, ah I remember you back then, I think to myself, wistfully. Then watching him stumble into his first weird adventure in Pinball, 1973. I think of the Rat, ah the poor Rat. Years pass. A Wild Sheep Chase. How did you ever get out of that one? Will you ever know peace? Years pass. Dance Dance Dance. A fitting coda. I'm weirdly sentimental for a character who isn't particularly likeable, nor does he even have a name.Alas....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Aug 22, 2019","Aug 24, 2019","Aug 22, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23687785-dance-dance-dance

Aciman's accounts of his family are almost unbelievable. Whereas many families may have one character who stands out amongst the rest, Aciman's family seems to have been entirely comprised of characters with strange origins and wild lives. All of these lives are projected against the fraught setting of Alexandria before, during, and after WWII. Oftentimes you forget you're reading a memoir, due to Aciman's novelistic approach, which transforms this book from a random memoir of a would-be novelist to an almost essential work of non-fiction.I hope that this reissuing (which is actually a first printing) gives this book a second wind.

She perhaps isn't helped by Marilyn Booth's translation which often reads like a direct translation of the original Arabic and thus falls completely flat even when the story turns fantastical. Abdallah's airborne chapters keep the novel from crash landing, thankfully. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jun 24, 2019","Jun 25, 2019","Jun 24, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39653535-celestial-bodies

The book vanishes anything resembling a timeline and is instead split into arbitrary categories of the author's own creation. Therefore we get chapters on flop musicals that went under due to their star, a chapter on the flops of major writers, a whole chapter on musical adaptations of films (which are nearly always flops) and so on. Whilst the book is always enlightening, it is severely disorientating as Mandelbaum flips back and forth between years as if linear time were a mere plaything.Mandelbaum himself seems to have fallen off the face of the earth in recent years, which is disappointing because, as many of the other s of this book states, a new edition is badly needed. This book was written in 1991 which means that nearly 30 more years of flops have happened since. It would also be interesting to read Mandelbaum's views on the fact that the musical once considered the greatest flop of all time and the very spark for this book, Carrie, has gone on to actually become a pretty well-respected work of musical theatre and even getting good s off-Broadway.Overall it's a very enjoyable book for those of us somewhat familiar with our Broadway history and also a cold-water reminder that success must always work in tandem with failure....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 19, 2019","Jun 21, 2019","Jun 19, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14462.Not_Since_Carrie

We all had to sit through think piece after think piece about form and narrative and how the book isn’t even a novel in the first place.

I still think the Yanks should be banned, not just from the Booker but from society as a whole. But eventually the think pieces quelled and we all moved onto the next faux controversy. Conversely, if we were to suggest that the amount of ratings a book has on Goodreads is a good indication of its popularity then Lincoln in the Bardo has been one of the most enduring Booker winners of recent times.

Much of the recent discourse around many post-Impressionist masterpieces have less to do with the actual painting and more to do with the subject. Exactly whose gee are we looking up in Courbet's L'Origine du monde? who was Manet's brazen Olympia? and so on.In her book Lucey adds to this discourse by demystifying four portraits by perhaps the most famous portrait artist of the Gilded Age, John Singer Sargent. So far, so relevant. Lucey gleans most of her information from primary sources, reconstructing narratives from fragments, letters, and diaries to create her four profiles, all of which are complete and in-depth.With the amount of work Lucey put into this book, you'd think that she'd actually have made it good. One of the biggest problems with this book is that Lucey had the whole Singer Sargent catalogue to work with and yet she chose to work with fairly obscure portraits. Therefore there isn't much of a point revealing the backstory of the sitters because the portraits aren't known in the first place. In fact, two of the works belong to private collections, so who exactly these profiles were written for is a mystery as they cannot possibly be of any benefit to anyone except the portrait owners. In one case the profile isn't even about the woman in the portrait, it's about her sister.Lucey also really tries her absolute best to break free from the tortuous world of academia and attempts to make her prose sing but instead the final product is more a bad cover version than an aria. There are huge tracts of this book where Lucey descends into wikipedia-esque reportage instead of using her prose to reflect the glitz and glamour of the Gilded Age heroines who she is bringing alive.However the most thudding disappointment about this book is how Lucey somehow makes it all so dull. Genuinely how is it possible to make these women dull? Every woman discussed is a classic Gilded Age ingenue ripped straight from the pages of Edith Wharton and yet in the hands of Lucey they become boring and lifeless like a coven of Hester Prynnes.This book is getting two-stars because I did learn a lot from it, however the information I learned literally has no real life applications whatsoever.

Juno Mac and Molly Smith purposefully stray from this narrative. They are not in the business of recounting the horrifying biographies of sex workers or tale after tale of deportation, abuse, and murder. Instead they take a systematic approach to sex work, identifying why it exists, how it continues to exist, and investigating the different forms of sex work legislation around the planet.'Continue reading my  on my blog: https://liquidays.wordpress.com/2019/......more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jan 07, 2019","Jan 10, 2019","Dec 28, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36424668-revolting-prostitutes

It’s a tradition as old as and as common as Christmas. One could argue we all have Joan Crawford to blame for this. Christina Crawford’s book Mommie Dearest acted as a shocking exposé of the once respected actress and described, in campy detail, Crawford’s less-than-conventional approach to motherhood.

It was like witnessing a car crash in slow motion. ‘Conversation with Friends’ also lacked a cohesive mood and prose style.

I went into it expecting him to talk all about his music - his operas, his scores, his albums. Not shockingly, what I actually got was a memoir of Glass mostly just talking about this actual life and not much discussion of the music. Opera on the Beach however, is exactly the book I was hoping Words Without Music to be.This book, which looks to be completely out of print and I only availed of it when I came across a rather battered old copy in my library, focuses mostly on Glass' trilogy of portrait operas, namely 'Einstein on the Beach', 'Satyagraha', and 'Akhnaten'. It begins with Glass retracing his musical education very briefly and in nowhere near the amount of detail we find in his memoir. The main bulk of the book is made up of Glass discussing, in fantastic detail, the processes of the creation of his three most famous operas. He talks about everything, even down to the funding and the accounts. If you're a fan of Glass, and these operas in particular, you'll just absolutely adore this book, much like I did. A really wonderful extra is that the librettos of each opera are included in here as well. For those of us who really only know the music (I must admit that the only opera of the trilogy that I've watched is Einstein, because it is the most popular and therefore is available on YouTube, the others will involve a much deeper hunt) the librettos are a goldmine. The book ends with a short chapter on some of Glass' other projects that he worked on over the period that he composed the operas, namely the Glassworks album, Songs from Liquid Days, and The Photographer. All of which are hugely popular within the Glass canon so it was fun to get little insights into their creation too.Overall I really loved this book. I will admit however, if you're not already a fairly devoted fan of Einstein, Satyagraha, and Akhnaten then you're not going to get much out of this. It's something of a Glass book for Glass fanatics. But it does confuse me as to why this hasn't been reprinted in years, it seems like such an important primary source on some of the most important operas of the 20th century. Now I'll have to track down a personal copy, ugh, wish me luck....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Nov 30, 2018","Dec 06, 2018","Nov 30, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/753427.Opera_on_the_Beach

'What is writing?', 'Why write?', 'For whom does one write?' etc. Does he answer them? I mean, I guess. The major idea to come from this essay is Sartre's distinction between prose and poetry. That prose is utilitarian and that the author is always mirrored in their prose. Prose is the author making you see things from their point of view. Poetry however is not like this, it is much closer to a painting, as the viewer instead looks at a poem and gives their own interpretation. Therefore prose has the far greater revolutionary benefit.Which, well, just isn't true is it? I suppose Sartre was unfortunate to have written this in 1948. Perhaps back then it was possible to assert such dichotomy between the political usage of prose and poetry, but surely just a couple of years later was Sartre not proven wrong by the Beats and the New York School?There are some snippets I enjoyed in here. Like Sartre's rage against so-called 'poetic prose' in which the message of the text seems to be lost between the pages of the author's thesaurus (which is very similar to what Orwell writes in his 'Politics and the English Language'). Also the essay's final line, 'Of course, all of this is not very important. The world can very well do without literature. But it can do without man still better.' The line is almost laughably Sartrean, which is why I enjoy it so much.I wouldn't call What is Literature? essential Sartre. But I am pleased to have read it. As is often the case with Jean-Paul, it is nice to have his ideas floating about you but just within touching distance.

Whether you believe they're real or not, the sights on which the Virgin Mary has allegedly been seen have become some of the most important pilgrimage spots in the Christian world; namely Lourdes in France, Fátima in Portugal, and Knock in Ireland. Of course we've all heard of these places, and likely know people who've been, but I personally did not know the stories of what actually happened there. Which is why I really loved this book.McClure is not a priest or a theologian, he is a researcher interested in 'anomalous phenomena'. Therefore he approaches these Marian apparitions from the same point of view as someone investigating the paranormal or UFOs. He presents us with eight in-depth accounts of the most famous Marian apparitions, of course covering Lourdes, Fátima, and Knock, but also lesser-known ones such as La Salette, Beauraing, and Garabandal.Each account is matter of fact, or well, reported facts. McClure is purposefully nonpartisan in his accounts. He simply tells us the full story of what allegedly happened at all of these sights. It isn't until the final chapter, when he assesses the evidence, does he begin to analyse the many questions that Marian apparitions raise.Like why did they mostly happen to poor, peasant children? Why did the Virgin nearly always request a chapel to be built for her? Why did she always impart 'secrets' to the children, many of which were wholly cryptic and often spoke of war and famine? Why did the majority occur in Western Europe? I could go on.Overall this was a pretty fascinating book and really piqued my interest in the phenomenon. I'm pretty sure this book is next to impossible to actually buy anywhere, as I picked it up by luck in a secondhand bookshop in Dublin, which does make this whole  utterly pointless. But still.

There I am, sitting, just listening to the same couple of notes being played over and over again, sometimes for hours. And I love it. Glass' memoir thankfully doesn't follow his trademark repetitive style. Instead he has produced a really wonderful account of his life, specifically focussing on his early years. We follow him from childhood, through his early music lessons, to Juilliard, to Paris, to India, and beyond. His sheer dedication to becoming a great composer is inspiring. However, the memoir is slightly off-kilter. The book is just shy of 400-pages, and yet his chapter on his first major masterpiece, Einstein on the Beach, does not come until page 283 - almost at the final quarter. You see Glass spends a lot of time discussing his great musical education but then decides not to actually discuss the great works that he would go on to produce. In fact, all of the discussion of his actual music is relegated to the final hundred pages. Everything from Einstein to now, in one hundred pages.The absences are glaring. There is no mention of Glassworks for example, apart from a single sentence on its commission. In The Upper Room, Dance, Songs from Liquid Days, and Dracula don't get a single mention. Almost criminally, there is also no word on Metamorphosis, Mad Rush or any of his Etudes, which are by far his most popular works. I understand that if he did actually discuss all of his major works, the book would have been a behemoth. But strangely he decides to dedicate a whole chapter, the final chapter, to his Cocteau Trilogy, which I doubt anyone would refute my saying are very much minor works within his oeuvre. I feel he just needed someone beside him as he was writing to say to him, 'this is all well and good Phil but how about you write about some of your famous ones?'However, I do think I am expecting too much. Glass has had an amazing life, peppered with wonderful people and stories. I shall decide to take those stories with me.

Mishima's queer classic, his second novel (written in his early 20s) and earliest currently available in English, is a coming-of-age story of a young boy who struggles with his queerness. When Kochan happens upon a reproduction of Reni's Saint Sebastian in a book he is immediately drawn to the overt homoeroticism of the work. The perfect male physique pared with the gashes and wounds of the arrows implanted within his torso act as a mirror for the novel itself. For the two main themes of Confessions (and quite a lot of Mishima's other works) are male queerness and sadomasochism. Both are explored beautifully through Mishima's unflinching prose. When reading this I was somewhat taken aback by its sheer influence on the world of queer literature, particularly in the works of Edmund White. I was not aware of just how much of A Boy's Own Story owns a debt to Confessions. In fact nearly all major coming-of-age queer tales seem to eventually trace their genealogy back to Kochan.An engrossing and influential tale, Confessions of a Mask is still as fresh (and shocking) in 2018 as it was in 1949.

This problem plagues Faulkner as well. People go into Pynchon's and Faulkner's novels and quickly realise that things happen very differently in here and thus, unnerved by the shock of the new, hastily retreat. It's a pity. My best advice for reading Pynchon? Stop trying to understand everything. If a passage, or a page, or hell, even a whole chapter doesn't make any sense, don't bother yourself over it. Just move on. The only person who's ever fully understood a Pynchon novel is Pynchon.There's a couple of ways to read The Crying of Lot 49. You can read it as a mystery novel, you can read it as a meditation on 1960s post-war America (à la Breakfast of Champions) and you can also read it as a great satire on the postmodernist novel. I read it as the latter. If you stand back from this novel and try to see it as Pynchon essentially taking the piss out of all the tropes and plots and characters often found in postmodernist literature, then I think it starts making the most sense.The novel follows Oedipa Maas who, after discovering a strange trumpet-like symbol on the wall of a bathroom, goes on an incredibly convoluted and complex journey to unmask the symbol's true meaning. Despite the novel's brevity (only 142 pages), Pynchon's trademark dense but intricate prose turns what is essentially a long short story into a fully-fledged novel, packed with a vast cast of characters and an equal amount of plots.Pynchon has a lot of fun with The Crying of Lot 49. You can almost hear him sniggering as he types out names such as Genghis Cohen and Dr. Hilarius and Mike Fallopian. He isn't exactly being subtle about the inherent ridiculousness of this novel. His comical names are mirrored in the novel's many comic moments. A stand-out scene from early on in the novel describes Oedipa's attempt to glean answers from the lawyer, Metzger. He suggests that for every question she asks she must take off an item of clothing. Oedipa excuses herself to use the bathroom, where she proceeds in donning every item of clothing she can find. She then traipses back into Metzger's office looking like, as Pynchon brilliantly puts it, 'a beach ball with feet'.There are innumerable scenes like that in Lot 49. However, whilst this is a fantastic comical satire, I found myself somewhat longing for more. The narrative is incredibly episodic. Oedipa trundles along from scene to scene, meeting a new character at every stop and unlocking a small part of the novel's greater mystery, like a sort of postmodernist Canterbury Tales. Pynchon also just adores digression, which I know is something of his trademark, but when the novel is 142 pages long, you'd think that he would have reigned it in slightly. Overall I found The Crying of Lot 49 to be a fun satirical romp. This novel is often suggested as a good starting place for Pynchon virgins, mainly due to its brevity. And I think that's fairly solid advice. Read it whichever way you want to, or even try to find a new angle to approach it from. But most importantly, have fun, that's what Pynchon would want....more",Notes are private!,0,133,1,"Mar 31, 2018","Mar 31, 2018","Mar 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6241137-the-crying-of-lot-49

This is how you write a character who is irritating, unlikable and oftentimes repugnant without making the novel itself irritating, unlikable and oftentimes repugnant.I loved Eleanor Oliphant and I hated Eleanor Oliphant, our jerkin-wearing narrator. Early on in the novel I thought of her as essentially the female Ignatius J. Reilly, purposefully verbose with a penchant for bluntness. And oftentimes, her complete lack of social awareness and decorum lead into the novel's most comic scenes. I think Sarah Gilmartin summed up Eleanor best in the Irish Times by comparing her to a Victorian woman who 'takes language literally and speaks in a comical antiquated register'.However Eleanor is slightly more complex than that. She has to be one of the most complex heroines to appear in British literature in recent times. I haven't been this utter mystified by a female protagonist since Ottessa Moshfegh gifted us all with Eileen. Both novels are fascinating character studies of women who (to paraphrase Almodóvar) are on the verge of a nervous breakdown.I really must applaud Honeyman for creating such a fascinating character. Eleanor will annoy the hell out of you, but you'll never not adore her. A novel is more than its main character however. And I feel this is where Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine falls down. I didn't care for, or even believe in, most of the other characters in this novel. It feels like Honeyman was hoping that everyone would be so enamoured by Eleanor that they'd turn a blind eye to the fact that most of the supporting cast are barely fleshed out and despite the fact that I finished the novel less than an hour ago, I've already forgotten most of their names.That being said, I did find this to be a funny and tragic tale of a woman who really is not fine. I'll be thinking about Eleanor for a while. I don't often say this, but I hope Honeyman produces a sequel. Or a plethora of sequels.

Also in her By The Book in the New York Times she recounts that she once accepted a gig in Dubai just because the flight gave her nineteen uninterrupted hours of reading time. I love that. She seems like such a fun and likeable person. Therefore it really does hurt to write that An American Marriage savagely disappointed me.The novel concerns a married couple, Roy and Celestial, who live a fairly normal life until Roy is sent to jail for allegedly raping another woman. Whilst in jail, Roy and Celestial try to keep the marriage going as normal but when Celestial experiences surprise success with her doll company everything between our couple begins to buckle and wane. I’ll begin with what I admired about this novel. I adore Jones’ turn of phrase. She has a very biting and almost sarcastic writing style which complements the plot well. Take this little sentence, which I loved, for example: ‘“Who are these men?” the white cop asked me. His accent was thick and gooey, all Marietta, turn left at the Big Chicken.’Isn’t that just wonderful? There’s little lines like that strewn throughout the novel like confetti.The novel is also very well structured. It employs three narrators, each rewarded a perspective, as the plot flows through their voices. Oftentimes I’m quite ‘meh’ about constantly changing perspectives but Jones makes it work flawlessly. She has a real master touch.However, no matter how much I polish it up, there’s no helping the plot of An American Marriage. Oprah recently chose this novel as her book club choice and, no offence to Oprah (I mean, she did get your aunt to read Anna Karenina) but this novel is such an Oprah Book Club pick.This novel reeks of Lifetime Original Movie. There are some moments that are just achingly sentimental whilst Jones often seeps into melodrama. The climax of the novel, a scene which I won’t spoil but tree huggers beware, was meant to be this great symbolic event in which every bottled emotion is finally unleashed. And I found myself… howling. Just howling at the utter ridiculousness of it. Talk about forcing a metaphor. Jeez.Thankfully this novel hasn’t put me off Tayari Jones. I’ve heard wonderful things about all of her other novels and I’m excited to get to them. But as for An American Marriage, I’m glad that Oprah saw something in it that I didn’t.

First conceived in 1989In the sweeping and monolithic Pachinko, Min Jin Lee documents four generations of a Korean family in Japan from 1910 to 1989. First conceived in 1989, Lee worked on this novel for over 25 years and what a masterpiece she has to show for all her work. Only really comparable in scope to Zola's Rougon-Macquart cycle, Pachinko is an education as well as a flawlessly crafted story. It theorises on an ugly aspect of Japanese society and the people who struggle against this open prejudice.What I know about the history of Koreans in Japan wouldn't fill the back of a postage stamp. To call my knowledge of the culture and politics of east Asia in the 2oth century a blindspot would be offensive to actual blindspots. (Honestly, all my knowledge of Japan comes from Sondheim's Pacific Overtures) What I'm saying is that I probably know minus-information about this area of the world and its history. So Pachinko was a real history lesson for me. But, as the Financial Times'  put it, 'we never feel history being spoon-fed to us.' Lee imbues the history into her characters. Through them we witness WWII and the division of Korea, the stories and journeys of the millions of post-war Korean migrants in Japan (a people known to the Japanese as the Zainichi), and the frank bigotry that many of them (and their subsequent generations) faced in Japanese society. One of the novel's best characters, the Dickens-loving Noa, is described as having to 'pass' for Japanese and even hides his true Korean identify from his wife and children. I had no idea about any of this stuff and it was truly eyeopening.But the novel is not just a history lesson: it's a veritable soap opera. I described it to one of my friends as 'Maeve Binchy goes to Asia'. There are twists and turns in Pachinko that would have caused Jackie Collins to down the driest martini. Love, marriage, betrayal, kimchi, death. I mean, the yakuza play a very significant role in this novel. It's a blockbuster of a book. Your mother who only reads Danielle Steel deep-cuts would get as much enjoyment out of this as a thesis student in Asian Studies.I devoured Pachinko. It is a somewhat dense 531-pages but I had to constantly pull myself away from it. If left to my own devices the whole book would have been conquered in just one prolonged sitting. Sunja's story captivated me, Noa's story intrigued me, Mozasu's story broke me, Hansu's story enraged me, Solomon's story gave me hope, and Yangjin, the woman who starts it all, she enthralled me from page one.It is difficult to think of any novel published in the last couple of years that is even comparable to Pachinko. One year since its publication and it has already been deemed a modern classic. Min Jin Lee has created a literary juggernaut.

Thus far, being one of these team members has a 100% mortality rate. Just what is Area X and what is killing everyone?This novel would be nothing without Tarkovsky's Stalker. I think the best way I can describe Annihilation is imagine a cross between Stalker and The Day of the Triffids but y'know, with women. Despite being published in 2014, the plot and prose of VanderMeer's novel reads more like classic sci-fi than anything more contemporary. I can see John Wyndham in there, as well as Richard Matheson and Walter Tevis. It is a welcome break from the sci-fi of our era, which I find can sometimes get slightly too caught up in its own mythology.VanderMeer imbues his novel with a thick and sooty atmosphere which only helps heighten the dank thread of dread which is taut throughout. Most of the novel could be accompanied by a shrill and prolonged note on the violin, an overwhelming build-up only broken by staccato'd reprieves of jump scare horror. In other words, this book is a whole lot of fun.When people saw that I was reading this novel I received a couple of messaging saying that it wasn't that great or that it's a good idea but not very well executed. Of course I understand those reservations but I personally do not agree with them. I thought this was a fine little book. To quote Ronseal: 'it does exactly what it says on the tin'. I had loads of fun reading this.A dark and suffocating exploration of the unknown, Annihilation, like its mother Stalker, purposefully leaves the reader with more questions than answers.

Even if the picture painted isn't exactly a pretty one. Is this how Londoners and New Yorkers feel all the time?The Glorious Heresies is a Bailey's Prize winning look at the criminal underbelly of Cork city. This isn't the Cork that Stephen visits with his father in Portrait of the Artist... anymore. We have Ryan, a young drug dealer with an absolute gowl of a father (god, this novel has rekindled my love for Cork slang), who is the novel's sort-of main character. We also focus on the lives of several other characters throughout the narrative. Maureen, an accidental murderer and former laundry incarcerate; Jimmy Phelan, the Corkonian Tony Soprano; Karine, Ryan's long-suffering girlfriend; and many more.McInerney recounts her tale at breakneck speed and makes fabulous use of the Cork patois. For far too long Irish novels back been Dublin-centric. I mean, Dublin's grand but it isn't Cork, y'know? The city and its river becomes one of the novel's most tragic characters as we panoptically zoom in and out of its streets to follow our cast of characters. There's something wonderfully engaging about McInerney's descriptions of where each scene is set and I was able to be like 'oh shit, I actually know the house where this is all taking place' or 'I've sat on that bench between the opera house and the gallery'. It's a familiarity I've never felt before in a novel.But then I am not sure if my reason for liking this novel so much is because of that familiarity. Would I have enjoyed this novel just as much if it were, god-forbid, set in Galway? I doubt I would have. But it isn't set in Galway. So it doesn't matter.The novel tackles a wide range of topics and storylines, but perhaps the most relevant one is Maureen's. Maureen is the one who accidentally bludgeons a man's head in with a holy stone and lights the spark (literally) for the events of the novel. She's back in Cork after forty years in England, originally being sent there by her vile mother due to her unplanned and unholy pregnancy. But Maureen is back in Cork with a vengeance for everything the Church and Ireland and her mother did to her. Her character seems to be a fan favourite, judging by the other s on here. Honestly, I want a whole Maureen novel, I adored her that much.Often heartbreaking and often hilarious, The Glorious Heresies is an unflinching look at a side of Ireland that is rarely portrayed in our literature. It is a fantastic addition to that great and unparalleled literary pantheon. Luckily, this is the first book in a proposed trilogy.

There was no distinct plot - nothing major seemed to be happening except for a girl describing her classes at university. But I persisted. Thank god for that.The Idiot is the story of Selin, a student at Harvard in the mid-90s. The mid-90s were strange time to be at university. Selin begins her tale with the line, 'I didn’t know what email was until I got to college.' Batuman is obsessed with liminality, or the state of being in between. Selin's world is moving from analogue to digital, from books to computers, letters to emails. Just as she herself is moving from her teens to adulthood. She, like the world around her, is caught in this liminal space and she is just lost.Enter Ivan: who is the fucking worst. Honestly he's up there with, like, Daniel Quilp in terms of dislikability. Selin falls for this actual rag of a man and all we can do is squirm and fidget as she blindly plays along with his fuckboy antics. But I don't think about Selin or Ivan when I think about The Idiot. What hits me first is Batuman. I don't personally know Elif Batuman, but I do know that we would probably get along quite well. Roxane Gay described this novel as 'dense' and I think that is perfect. Batuman has an incredibly dense prose style, in that she takes her influences and her references and she piles them up onto each other so that each paragraph is like a literary puff pastry. Honestly, I have never used my degree in English and Art History more than when I was reading The Idiot. At one point Batuman states that one characters reminds Selin of what Andre Breton's Nadja might look like. Another time Selin is reading a paragraph from Madame Bovary and she says it reminds her of Björk's video for Human Behaviour. The Unabomber is in there too. It's reference after reference after reference. Batuman knows her shit. And she knows a lot of it. There's probably a hundred other smart asides and sly comparisons that completely went over my head, thus is the nature of her prose. It's a novel that rewards the reader based on their own cultural knowledge. It's like watching an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 or 30 Rock, two shows that rely on the viewer's grasp on popular culture. Yeah, you're not gonna get all the references and the gags, but the ones you do catch will make you howl.From wanting to end it all on page 100 to eventually hoping the novel wouldn't finish, my own critical turnaround on The Idiot honestly gave me whiplash. It's a novel that I feel would stand up to multiple readings and each time gleaning something new from it. Or maybe I would read it again and focus more on all the fantastic secondary characters. The Idiot is a superb novel about a woman who is just lost. I mean, she is an idiot.

If only it was covered in pine needles and pine trees and had the scent of pine wafting around it. Then Robert would truly be happy.'For Whom the Bell Tolls is allegedly a novel by Ernest Hemingway. Set during the Spanish Civil War, it is a story about an American dynamiter who is attempting to blow up a bridge in order to counteract Franco's forces. Our main character, Robert Jordan, who is essentially a bad haircut personified, might win the title of 'most boring protagonist to ever appear in print'. Robert spends most of his time sitting on the forest floor and thinking about breasts. Poor Robert, his life really stinks! When he isn't thinking about boobs, he goes off on fifty-page long flashbacks to his life before the war when he was a young American in Madrid, cornering young girls at house parties and telling them how Kid A is actually the connoisseurs' choice when it comes to Radiohead albums but he has a soft spot for Pablo Honey. What Robert needs is a feminine foil. A woman who can really stand-up to him and someone the reader can truly get behind. So Papa Hemingway shits out Maria, a woman so badly written that the only thing I can remember about her is that her nipples point upwards. Possibly the most lamentable aspect of Maria's character is the fact that she was raped by a group of fascists, a tragic backstory that Hemingway glosses over into order to talk about what a fantastic rack she has.Hemingway's prose has always been an easy target. I would never, ever stoop so low. In fact, I will say thank god for Hemingway's prose! If For Whom the Bell Tolls was actually written at a literacy level higher than that of a kindergartener then it would genuinely be unreadable. On top of that, Hemingway makes the frankly strange decision to self-censor all of the obscenities throughout the novel. 'What the fuck' becomes 'what the muck' and so on. Hilariously, he also often substitutes obscenities with the word 'obscenity'. So there are genuinely moments in this novel where characters say 'what the obscenity are you doing?' and 'go obscenity yourself'. My advice to all of you is to stay well away from this mess. There's nothing to see here folks. If you are interested in a book on the Spanish Civil War, read Orwell's Homage to Catalonia. If you want a good book about a bridge, and hey who doesn't, read Willa Cather's Alexander's Bridge. God, for whom the bell tolls?

Weighing in at 5kgs and almost 1,000 glossy pages, this book is an utter nightmare to actually read. Thankfully, its contents make up for pain.Spanning a period of roughly the beginning of Home Rule to the end of the Civil War, the Atlas of the Irish Revolution is a step-by-step account of the creation of the modern Irish Republic. Presented as a book of essays from basically of all the country's leading historians, the Atlas is truly a landmark of research.However it is not without its flaws. Perhaps the most glaring omission, in my opinion, is that the section on the Anglo-Irish Treaty begins with the signing of the Treaty. There is no essay discussing the Treaty negotiations. I am aware that they weren't exactly the most riveting of talks, but considering what an important document the Treaty was, the exclusion of its creation is glaring.Then there is also the fact that many of the essays in this collection are but the briefest summaries of events. Many of the essays are essentially a condensed version of the book that the author has written on that specific subject. Therefore it is best to think of these essays as samplers. If you really enjoyed one essay, then you can go and read the author's book. Special praise must be given to the emphasis given to the role of women in this book, as well as a fantastic selection of female historians (it is just wonderful to see the great Margaret Ward on these pages). The history of the Irish Republic is often summarised by the recitation of the names of the seven men who signed the Proclamation. The Atlas does its absolute best to emphasise the 'Irishwomen' mentioned at the beginning of that document. It is not surprising that this book won Irish Book of the Year at the Irish Book Awards. Its editors deserve free drinks in every bar for life for the sheer amount of time and effort that must have gone into compiling this mammoth volume. Was the effort worth it? Absolutely.

I was going in order from the beginning but then I saw this in a charity shop for like a euro and obviously couldn't leave it behind.I've never been a fan of non-realist works of fiction. Hence science fiction doesn't brandish my shelves and you'd actually have to pay me to read fantasy. So I was apprehensive about Oryx and Crake, the first book in Maggie's trilogy of post-apocalyptic speculative works.The novel begins with Snowman waking up, outdoors. He seems to be the only human being left after some unknown world-ending event. His name isn't actually Snowman, he's Jimmy. Throughout the book we discover who Jimmy is and what part he played in ending the world. The novel flips between Snowman surviving in the new world and flashbacks to his life as Jimmy. When he isn't scavenging, he's musing on life. Slowly we discover who our title characters are, Oryx and Crake, and why the little mutant children who inhabit the former planet Earth with Snowman seem to treat Oryx and Crake as the great creators.I found the novel to be wonderfully balanced. There's two plots happening at once, interspersing between each other, and Maggie handles this beautifully. Oftentimes in books with concurrent plot lines you get somewhat bored with one of them and sigh and moan whenever the novel switches to that plot. That does not happen with Oryx and Crake. Maggie has essentially written two great books and mashed them together.I also greatly appreciate that even though this novel is full of futuristic made-up jargon and somewhat complicated conversations about the nature of genetics, Maggie never makes this a difficult read. I had known what the basic plot was about before reading this novel and honestly, that really put me off. Mutant pigs and rabbits and magic pills and a land segregated by communes. But these things are treated, and written about, as if they were just the status quo. At times I forgot I was reading a dystopia, I was thinking god those awful pigoons, as if they were a real and present danger to my well-being. Usually I would be so cynical about the fantasy of it all, but I wasn't.I really loved Oryx and Crake. Although I'm a bit meh about book series and trilogies, I will definitely be continuing on. The novel gives you a lot to think about. Even Maggie herself said that the novel is essentially a warning against what might eventually happen. And since we seem to be nose-diving deeper into a world akin to Gilead, I'm terrified that even with a novel as strange and terrifying as Oryx and Crake, Maggie might once again be right....more",Notes are private!,1,57,1,"Feb 27, 2018","Feb 28, 2018","Feb 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48262.Oryx_and_Crake

You always hear of killers being described as loners or introverts or just weirdos, but Cunanan broke that stereotype. He was a preppy guy who loved reading Vogue. He'd make up amazing lies about himself and his past in order to impress those around him. In the midst of his murder spree he used to go clubbing and tell his fellow clubbers that he was a serial killer. They all laughed.Vulgar Favours is a fairly in-depth account of the life and murders of Andrew Cunanan. Maureen Orth was the media's go-to journalist for all the info on Cunanan when he was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. She knows this case inside out so there was no better person to write this book. However, as much as Cunanan's murders were tabloid fodder, Orth's book reads as nothing more than tabloid journalism.My main gripe with this book is the same gripe that every other er on Goodreads points out. Orth is such a prude. There are pages and pages dedicated to descriptions of the 'gay lifestyle' and how (omg!) many people in the gay community take drugs. Orth also goes on about Cunanan's addiction to S&M and pornography, which was essentially nothing more than just a kink, never mind a motive for murder. There are sections of this book which made me think, is Orth trying to make a connection between Andrew's queerness and his penchant for shooting people in the head? Many of her observations on the gay community are, at best, laughable and, at worst, staggeringly offensive. At one point, Orth enters a gay bar and states that a man started grinding on her so vigorously that she could feel his 'protrusion'. That had me howling. It's like this whole book was written by your homophobic grandmother and Orth thinks she's some sort of queer John Howard Griffin.Looking past Orth's prudishness, if you can, she also could have benefitted from a good editor. Sometimes you find yourself deep in a chapter and you realise that what you're reading has absolutely nothing to do with anything. Even many of the interviewees are, at best, stretches at relevancy. A lengthy chapter on the ins-and-outs of the exclusive gay club that Andrew was briefly a member of was the icing on this bulging cake.What this book is actually good at is showing the sheer incompetency of the entire investigation. There's a reason why the book's original title referred to the attempt to find Cunanan as the 'largest failed manhunt in U.S. history'. Cunanan was always ten steps ahead of the FBI and they essentially did nothing. The most basic of mistakes such as failing to even hand out flyers with Cunanan's picture and details on them just shows that everything that could have gone wrong with this investigation eventually did go disastrously wrong.It is not egregious to say that if the FBI had actually did their job, Versace would not be dead. The fact that after killing four people, Cunanan was able to stay in a hotel, make friends, go clubbing, and do all this for several weeks just shows what a mess this all was. Orth's book isn't great. But the absolute outrageousness of the Cunanan case almost makes you forget that. Earlier on I said that this book is nothing more than tabloid journalism, but in many ways, that fits. Cunanan was a tabloid murderer. He used to buy all the newspapers and magazines that wrote about him when he was on his killing spree. He loved the attention.

He points out that art history can often descend into hagiography, especially when it comes to its greatest minds. Both Vasari and Kenneth Clark placed Leonardo on a god-like pedestal, untouched by any other human in history and in possession of a truly divine mind. Isaacson does his best to refute this. He paints Leonardo as almost painfully human, as a man who rarely finished any of the jobs he began and whose attention and interests fluctuated like the waves.Most of us know Leonardo first and foremost as a great artist. However, we are all also aware of his notebooks, filled to the margins with meditations on geometry, mathematics, anatomical studies, studies of hydraulics and numerous to-do lists. If you want a book solely on Leonardo's artistic endeavours then this book is not for you. Isaacson has numerous chapters on every facet of Leonardo's studies. Which means that you will often find yourself deep in a chapter about studies of the flow of water or efforts to square the circle. Interdisciplinarity was something of Leonardo's forte, melding art and science together in his notebooks and canvases, and Isaacson reflects this in his biography, creating a book which covers a vast amount of topics.Having a degree in art history, I was interested to see how Isaacson would tackle Leonardo. I am very familiar with most of the accounts that Isaacson relies upon, especially Vasari's short, fanciful biography. I found Isaacson to be more than competent when writing about art. I think he keeps it to the basics though, discussing only the most surface analyses of each work, which was probably more an editing issue rather than the fault of the author. Also by not having a background in art history, Isaacson avoids writing in 'international art English' or 'Artspeak' as those of us in the field call it. Basically it is the incomprehensible form of English that many art historians write in which is just drenched in metaphor and imagery and is completely inaccessible to the common reader. Therefore it was actually quite refreshing to read about Leonardo's works in a language resembling English.However, Isaacson is not afraid to put his opinion across on the meanings on some of Leonardo's most complex mysteries. I suppose he's allowed to be impartial, it is his book, but it does come across as somewhat jarring when the author suddenly jumps from the role as narrator and then begins to give his opinions on topics. Another fault of Isaacson's prose is his repetition of facts. He doesn't use a linear timeline for this biography, instead going topic-by-topic. Therefore, in his jumping around of the timeline he often states things that he has stated before, and events that we have already discussed. It doesn't happen often enough to constitute as bad editing, but it does happen often enough for me to notice.Overall I found this to be an expansive and well-researched biography of one of the Renaissance's greatest minds. Some may take offence at Isaacson's portrait of Leonardo, which shows him not as a god but as a flawed human being. I found this quite refreshing, personally. It made Leonardo almost seem relatable when we hear about his Olympic-level procrastination and his lifelong inability to actually finish projects. Isaacson has done an amazing job of humanising Leonardo and that is the book's greatest achievement....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,Feb 2018,"Feb 05, 2018","Jan 02, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36192695-leonardo-da-vinci

Babitz often hears of Hollywood being described as a 'wasteland', a fake town full of fake people where even the greenery is plastic. In Eve's Hollywood she refutes that myth.Babitz had a highly privileged upbringing, her father was a violinist who worked on movie scores for Fox and her mother was an artist. Stravinsky was her godfather, seriously. She became one of the most famous 'It girls' of 60s and 70s LA and knew everyone from Jim Morrison to members of the Manson Family. Eve's Hollywood is a part-memoir and part-novel of Babitz's early life and her attempt at a vindication for her beloved childhood home of Hollywood.Nobody can write an opening line like Eve Babitz. Just take some of these examples: 'Death, to me, has always been the last word in people having fun without you.' and 'The cat I had most of my adult life so far committed suicide last summer and we buried her under the apricot tree in back of my parents' house.' Just dazzling. Babitz is like if Joan Didion had a sense of humour.However, whilst all of the vignettes that make up this collection are fascinating insights into Babitz' life, there doesn't seem to be any common connecting factor threading them all together. Reading this book is like hopping along the stepping stones of Babitz' memories and not stopping until you reach dry land. Everything seems to crash together and there is no semblance of a structure or timeline. Thus reading this book can be quite a disorientating experience. Much like listening to Stravinsky actually.This book's raison d'être is to show the world that Hollywood is not a wasteland. Does Babitz succeed in this? Most definitely. Eve's Hollywood is an oasis of culture and effervescence that makes New York look like Cripple Creek, Colorado.

Back in Canada, Foster was hailed as a literaAt the beginning of Lady Oracle, Joan Foster is hold up in her Italian apartment after faking her death. Back in Canada, Foster was hailed as a literary sensation and a major author on the rise, so why did she choose to die at the height of her hype?In many ways, Lady Oracle is the polar opposite of Atwood's previous novel Surfacing. Surfacing is a quiet, introverted, atmospheric novel that concerns only a handful of characters over a few days. Lady Oracle is a globe-trotting saga that follows our protagonist from early childhood up to the present day in a style that mirrors the Gothic romances that she secretly authors. This novel is bloated but enjoyable. It is clear that Atwood had a lot of fun with this one. As it was written has a partial pastiche of Gothic romance novels, there are a lot of scenarios and characters that fall into the realm of the ridiculous. I mean, there is literally a Polish count in here and a dude called the Royal Porcupine. As the novel is told through flashbacks when the author is in self-exile in Italy, a lot of her memories read like heightened fantasies which leads you to question just how truthful she is being. My favourite parts of the novel were the early chapters when Joan was recounting her early childhood. She was an obese child who found solace in the company of her Aunt Lou. These are the most touching and, shall I say 'rational', chapters before everything turns slightly bonkers. Overall, I feel this novel needed a better editor. My edition almost hits the 400-page mark and that is so totally unnecessary for this novel. One could argue that Atwood was somewhat over-indulgent in her tale of Joan Foster and gets carried away in the minute details and events of her life which have no overall impact on the plot. It is as if post-Surfacing she decided to have the literary equivalent of a binge and pen a novel which is essentially all plot and nothing much else. But there are many fun aspects to Atwood's binge.

This book is a critical rebuttal of the work and influence of the yBas, hence much of my dissertation was dedicated to critiquing Stallabrass and his views. The following  is constructed from sections copied straight from my dissertationIt comes as an anomaly that there is so little critical scholarship on the yBas. In fact, when it comes to serious, academic discourse on the yBas there has been only one book written – High Art Lite (1999) by Julian Stallabrass. [...] Stallabrass’ book puts the yBas’ art within the context of a country rising from recession and the effect that had on the art market. However, most of High Art Lite is marred by the fact that Stallabrass openly detests the yBas. In fact, he refuses to even call them yBas and instead makes up his own term, ‘high art lite’, in order to describe their ‘low art’. ‘High art lite’ is ‘an art that looks like but is not quite art, that acts as a substitute for art’. He emits this stubbornness for 295 pages. [...]In High Art Lite, Stallabrass dismisses the application of theory to yBa art as ‘comic’ and suggests that the theories of Sigmund Freud, Jean-François Lyotard and Georges Bataille now had to be ‘cool and self-mocking’ if they were to be applied to ‘high art lite’ – as if this ‘low’ form of art was not worthy of having such names attached to it. This rejection of theory by Stallabrass could be one of the contributing factors as to why yBa art has been dismissed by some critics over the past three decades. Many of the yBas ‘play[ed] down the conceptual and theoretical sources of their work’ even though a vast majority of the artworks produced by the group was embedded with clear theoretical groundings.[...]In the last pages of High Art Lite, Stallabrass questions when the yBa craze will die. Writing in 1999, he could already observe ‘one or two clouds on the tendency’s horizon’. The sensation of the yBas did not last that long into the 2000s. Much like Young British Art’s musical counterpart, Britpop, the ‘movement’ eventually died out as the 90s died out. Most great art movements, no matter how famed or influential, usually only last a mere number of years. The yBas were no different. However, for their brief decade in the limelight, they not only dominated the British art scene, but they also revolutionised it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jan 2017,"Nov 22, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2589812-high-art-lite

He opens his mouth aIn 1916 in the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich a man named Hugo Ball is standing on a small stage dressed in a suit made of cardboard. He opens his mouth and out comes a procession of nonsense words and sounds. He sounds like he’s having a stroke. But what he’s saying isn’t nonsense, it’s a poem he wrote called Karawane. And you in the audience, you’re a young man who is disillusioned by the war happening around you. Machines are killing man. How did this happen? Modern life has become an absurdity. Just as absurd as Hugo Ball up on that stage in his cardboard suit and saying words like ‘jolifanto bambla ô falli bambla’. Back then they called this display of insanity ‘dada’ and it eventually became one of the most important movements in twentieth-century art history. Times of great political unrest are when we need absurdity the most. 1916 had Hugo Ball but 2017 has Blindboy Boatclub.Many of you will know Blindboy as one half of the artist duo the Rubberbandits but this book is a solo venture. The Gospel According to Blindboy is a collection of fifteen Gas Cuntist story stories. Gas Cuntism is the aesthetic movement founded by the Rubberbandits, an artistic venture described as ‘Dada and Fluxus on a horn’. Therefore, this book acts not only as a conventional collection of stories but as an endeavour for Gas Cuntism to be recognised within the public sphere. Much like how André Breton’s novel Nadja has become one of the major texts for understanding the beginnings of French Surrealism, The Gospel According to Blindboy acts as primer for those wanting to learn about Gas Cuntism.But ultimately, none of this means anything if the stories do not hold up. I am happy to report that not only do these stories hold up, but this book is one of the most eloquent and well-crafted debut collections I have ever read. Short story collections are very often hit-and-miss, in a collection of fifteen like this one you would expect maybe one or two standout stories, peppered with a couple of middling tales and handful of duds thrown in just to bulk the whole thing up. The Gospel According to Blindboy is astonishing in its consistency with each new story being just as strong as the previous. It’s the ABBA Gold of short story collections, there isn’t a bad one in there.To give an example of the Gas Cuntist stylings of these stories, let me describe what I believe to be the masterpiece of the whole collection, ‘Arse Children’. This story (which is actually more a novella) takes place on a November evening in the Mansion House in Dublin. Éamon de Valera and Michael Collins are hypothesising what is to be done about the Cairo Gang. We discover that De Valera has been given the gift of a womb in his bowels and is able to give birth to arse children, an army of two-foot tall soldiers with a bloodlust for killing the Cairo Gang. Eventually the story leads to a scene in which Michael Collins is fucking Éamon de Valera in the arse after being liquored up on tiki cocktails. The final section of the story deals with the apparent author of this tale and the outrage the story causes when it is released online. Only Blindboy Boatclub could turn a story about De Valera birthing children out of his anus into a meditation on online culture and the mob mentality. In fact, many of the stories are not what they seem, with the overwhelming absurdity masking deeper meditations on mental health and modern life. Perhaps the most affecting story in the collection is ‘Ten-Foot Hen Bending’ which involves a young woman dealing with crippling anxiety and how it essentially ruins her life. Ultimately, we see her attempting to overcome her anxiety by tormenting a group of Italian tourists in Bunratty Castle with Australian actor Sam Neill.The Gospel According to Blindboy is a blindingly inventive collection. Echoes of Flann O’Brien and Leonora Carrington permeate the pages, whilst Blindboy’s unique prose style could be described as a lyrical patois. There is just something so wonderfully visceral about phrases like ‘tit milk’ and ‘rape brothel’. Chuckles beget hysterics. And all of this from a debut collection. It really is unheard of.

Due to its style it is nearly impossible to skim this book, or not give it your full attention. So you are forced to read every single word in order for any of it to make sense. Which means you are forced to witness every murder, every rape, every mutilation, and every single blowjob.

St. James' style is truly unique, at least in the true crime genre. In that much of the book reads like St. James talking directly too you, very quickly, and rarely shows signs of stopping. He makes full use of BLOCK CAPITALS and BLOCK CAPITALS IN ITALICS and BLOCK CAPITALS IN ITALICS AND BOLD when relaying his many scandalous stories. It's a writing style that may put people off - having to sit there as you can practically feel St. James spitting at your face - but I found it totally enlivening and I doubt this story could be told any other way.Then of course there is the fact that much of the gruesome murder is recounted with an almost startlingly blasé attitude. Both St. James and Alig were not fans of the deceased Angel, and even after his murder St. James describes him as just another drug dealer. It's the attitude which really typified the Club Kids and it was one of the reasons for their downfall - Warholian indifference in a k-hole.Party Monster really is one of the wildest entries in the true crime genre.

She is 13 years old and her newly discovered sexual drive is all she can think about. Her home life is a mess. Her father has a penchant for mistresses and her mother is utterly clueless. When Victorine was first published in 1959 it was sold as erotic pulp fiction and given the title 'The Hands of Love'. This is another one of NYRB's attempts to rediscover a 'classic' but I'm afraid, with Victorine, there isn't much to rediscover.The overall story of Victorine is fine. Where the novel strives is that it is an open and unapologetic document of a young girl's sexual awakening, describing her incestuous urges and lesbian encounters with total candidness (which is brave considering the era during which this novel was written). The secondary plots involving the rest of her family are somewhat expendable. This novel falls down however due to no fault other than the pen of the author. Maude Hutchins just was not a very good writer of prose. Oftentimes her stray observations or images are far too on the nose and she seems to struggle to make one cohesive narrative. The novel is incredibly episodic, which I doubt was intentional, considering that it is a very slim volume. Each chapter almost reads like a short story and each can be summarised by simply stating 'And then Victorine did this'. However I did enjoy this novel, despite its major flaws.

The O'Briens run the local shop, they're working class and Clare is only able to further her education by being gifted and winning scholarships. The Powers are 'to the manor born', David is off at boarding school for the early parts of the novel but eventually follows in his father's footsteps by studying medicine. You can already guess where this is going, yes, this is Maeve Binchy's Romeo and Juliet. Of course the plot involving Clare and David is actually only one storyline in this vast 737-page novel which spans the entirety of the 50s and the early 60s in Castlebay. Binchy is at her absolute best when she is juggling several plots. Where many authors struggle to tie everything together, Binchy has an almost Dickensian talent of making everything connect and tie-up naturally. However, where in other novels Binchy is fully able to fill her usual 700+ page count with ease, in Echoes it seems that for every page of plot there was an accompanying page of filler. It also does not help that I found this novel to be uncharacteristically sentimental for Binchy. She always writes stories of love and marriage but she usually balances that out with some genuinely moving and, sometimes, shocking content. Who can forget the abortion in Light A Penny Candle for example? Binchy teases us in the prologue of Echoes by telling us about the body of a dead man floating in the sea off the cliffs of Castlebay, but she does not return to this ghastly scene until the very end of the novel - 700 pages later. Meanwhile you've got to deal with the just-about-bareable Clare and the posh daddy's boy David. I feel that I've talked about the length of this novel quite a lot in this  but honestly that is my biggest criticism. There is absolutely no need for this book to be as long as it is. Binchy writes big books, but this isn't a big story. I often found myself getting bored and realising that I had 400 or more pages left. It is unfortunate. Echoes is a vast and well-written novel. There are many characters in here that would be considered 'classic Binchy' and it is often very funny. However, tweeness and boredom set in after the first couple hundred pages and never really leave. Overall, it's a fine novel that displays Binchy's wit but the editor should hang their head in shame....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2018","Oct 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41957.Echoes

It was a good novel but its biggest weakness was its plot. In Surfacing, Atwood treads much of the same ground but completely jettisons any semblance of a plot and thus presents us with a far more intriguing and mature work.Our unnamed female narrator brings her lover and their two (married) friends to her childhood lakeside cabin in the woods for a brief getaway from life and for the two men to capture some footage for the amateur film they are producing. She hides her true intentions of returning to this familiar lake however. She is trying to find her father. Long missing, our narrator does not presume him dead but instead believes that he is still alive and living by the lake. The whole novel is essentially our narrator's internal monologue throughout this strange week by the lake.It becomes obvious early on that we are stuck in the mind of a mentally ill young woman. Her grasp on reality is oneiric and muddied, leading to the whole novel being written in a semi-lucid and dreamlike style. There are passages of this novel which would be better described as poetry than prose, as our narrator seemingly slips in and out of her reality and into a chimerical and other-worldly state. The novel is also almost oppressively atmospheric with dirt and grit rammed underneath its fingernails. What I'm basically saying is that if this were adapted into a movie today it would have a lot of Sufjan Stevens on the soundtrack.I found myself completely absorbed by this novel. The manner of Atwood's prose baits you into reading the whole novel in a small series of large chucks and whilst I did find the narrative to be languorous at times I could not seem to escape the narrator's mindset.

She'll be a woman again after the war.""In the West we often think of women's role in WWII as being in the factories. The Rosie the Riveter movement of helping make all the supplies for the men out on the front. However, in the Soviet Union, almost one million women enlisted in the army and fought alongside the men. Whilst most were stationed in medical units, thousands of women acted as snipers, pilots, tank drivers, and even captains between 1941 and 1945. The majority of these women were aged between 16 and 21. 40 years after the war had finished, Svetlana Alexievich recorded their stories. This book was the result.As is Alexievich's style, this book is made up of hundreds of interviews. Judging by the few times that Alexievich herself speaks, this book must be only a minuscule fraction of all the interviews that she conducted in the 1980s. Women's role in the war had effectively been erased from the official history of the war by the post-war Soviet governments so when Alexievich does meet with these women, they are more than ready to talk. And very rarely do they hold back. This is one of the most devastating and harrowing works of non-fiction that I have ever read. What these women saw, what they experienced, was truly horrific.One common phenomenon that many of the women talk about is how their hair went completely grey by the end of the war. These were women in their early 20s. Others discuss how they could possibly ever give birth after experiencing so much death. One woman talks about how a man could lose every single limb but still find the love of his life, but if a woman received so much as a single scar on her face she would be relegated to spinsterhood forever. There are many instances where women refused to talk to Alexievich, stating that they have spent their lives forgetting the war. However, other women comment that the happiest days of their lives were during the war. Every interview is incredibly personal but each woman is connected by what they went through.This book is difficult to get through, both content-wise and structure-wise. Every page is another distressing account of the war. Sometimes there may be three short passages to a single page. The sheer amount of content is overwhelming and can sometimes leave you completely drained. Which is probably how you should feel.The Unwomanly Face of War is a perfect example of why Alexievich won the Nobel Prize for Literature. The sheer amount of research that this must have taken. You feel somewhat sorry for Alexievich in hindsight, she often talks of carrying around her tape recorder and bags of tapes from interviewee to interviewee. Thousands of tapes. And having to transcribe them all. I'm sure the invention of smartphones was something of a godsend to her. This book is never an easy read but it is an eye-opening account of a somewhat forgotten part of history, as told by the women who lived it.

Naomi Alderman's The Power found its way into my hands by winning 2017's Bailey's Prize. The plot sounded so intriguing. Young girls around the world began developing 'the power', or essentially being able to shoot lightning from their palms. This discovery leads to a great event known as The Cataclysm, after which women become the dominant sex in society. It's fairly classic speculative fiction territory. However, what may have done quite well as a classic half-hour Twilight Zone episode is here stretched out into a 339-page novel.Alderman employs many different POVs to form her narrative, which caused the Minnie Effect*. My personal favourite character was Margot, a woman running for election before the Cataclysm. As great as Margot was, that did not make up for the fact that she was possibly the only character who I actually warmed to in this novel. Many of the other characters (particularly Allie and Roxy) just seemed to meld together in my mind and I had trouble trying to separate all of the threads. However, all of these reservations seem moot when one asks the question: what genre is this novel? The book seems to switch between Young Adult to international thriller to literary fiction in as little time as the turn of a page. It reads like several very different books stitched together. I will admit that since this won the Bailey's Prize I was expecting something more along the lines of Atwood's literary dystopias but instead I was given a Twister board of genres being spun by Suzanne Collins. Much like Withnail's famed exclamation that he and Marwood had gone on holidays by accident, I seemed to be reading The Hunger Games by accident. However, what do I know? My edition came with a whole second cover behind the first cover just absolutely plastered in praise. In fact, every blank space on this book is populated by a glowing  or a showy tagline. I applaud the publicity team behind it, they really went above and beyond. However, I was left feeling bored by this novel. The plot isn't very compelling, which was demonstrated by my unwillingness to pick up this novel again whenever I put it down. However I did power through - an effort which I now view as somewhat pointless. This isn't a one-star  because I didn't hate this book, it was merely just overwhelmingly second-rate.*The Minnie Effect, named for the eponymous character in Kathryn Stockett's The Help, is a phenomenon in POV novels where the best or most entertaining characters are given the least amount of attention within the overall novel whilst the least entertaining or boring characters dominate the narrative.Stray observation:This whole novel is meant to be written five-thousand years in the future, yet at one point a character makes a movement that is compared to the moves of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. So we are meant to believe that the only thing in all human history which survived the Cataclysm and the five-thousand years of life afterward was the 1977 disco movie Saturday Night Fever?...more",Notes are private!,2,284,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2017","Oct 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33871762-the-power

'One is born to life in many forms,' the father says 'as a tree, or a stone, as water, a butterfly... or as human. And one can also be born as a character.' These characters are stuck without a text. The whole play is a musing on what is real and what isn't, and to some extent the role of the author, AND begs the philosophical question of what happens to characters outside of their author's text? There's a lot going on. I feel I need a good lecture series on the whole thing. But it is enjoyable if you're into the whole Theatre of the Absurd stuff.My favourite play in the collection was the second play, Henry IV. It involves a man who receives a head injury and believes himself to be Henry IV (the German one, not the French one or the English one). So, all his family and friends dress up as characters from the era of Henry IV, decorate his house to look like a palace, and all play along with his fantasy. Doctor after doctor visits him but nobody can cure him.I found Henry IV to be a more competent musing on 'characters'. Each character in this play is playing another character for the amusement of the supposed King Henry. They're all acting a play within a play. It is also a meditation on madness and begs the question, who is really mad? Henry IV or the people who play along with his fantasy? This was a really stellar play.The final play is an odd drama. So It Is (If You Think So) involves two characters who try to claim that the other is insane, due to the particulars of a marriage. Then all the other characters spend the rest of the play trying to figure out which one is actually sane and telling the truth and which is lying and insane. It's something of a farce-cum-detective play about, once again, madness and people believing their own lies. (I've a feeling Pirandello has a thing about madness and the nature of fiction eh?)So It Is (If You Think So) is the weakest of the bunch but is still a fine play.Overall this collection is a nice little compendium of probably Pirandello's best-known works.

Why does that sound so familiar?Tom Perrotta's Election is one of those stories that has done far better as a film than it has as a novel. The film has become one of those 90s classics which has managed to seep into popular culture whilst the character of Tracy Flick has very much become a cultural icon, joining the ranks of Cher Horowitz and Nancy Downs. Tracy Flick is the name on everyone's lips in this novel, but she rarely appears to give her side of the story.The novel revolves around a high school presidential election. Tracy Flick is running unopposed and is clearly the best student for the job. That is until Mr. M interferes. Mr. M despises Tracy because she got his best friend fired and thus he plots to make sure that Tracy does not become president.He convinces Paul Warren, the most popular guy in the school, to also run for president and thus the brutal presidential race begins.Tracy Flick is honestly one of the greatest characters created in the last thirty years. Her take-no-prisoners approach to life and relentless perfection are so enjoyable to read and, on some levels, relate to. Her searing brilliance is so perfectly contrasted in the character of Mr. M, who is essentially a human skid mark. Mr. M dominates the novel as much as he dominates the election. He gets the most vignettes and we spend the most time with him, which really allows our hatred of him to slowly build up throughout this short work. As a mentioned before, Tracy, despite being the star of this novel, receives the fewest and shortest vignettes (if you discount the few vignettes from the janitor near the end of the novel). Perrotta's effective silencing of Flick's narrative mirrors Mr. M's effort to silence Flick in everything she does. The novel is masterfully constructed and Perrotta really does well working with the difficult vignette structure. Those of us familiar with how the film version of Election ends will be surprised at just how differently the novel finishes. The novel's ending is far more bleak and unrelenting. The film attempts to somewhat pardon Mr. M for his actions, whilst the novel gives a far more realistic ending for both Mr. M and Tracy.

Exit West is one of the most bitterly disappointing and downright awful novels I have read in a long while. The novel begins with Nadia and Saeed, a couple living in an unnamed Middle-Eastern city. This setting and story is what we come to expect from Hamid, who also wrote the flawed but admirable The Reluctant Fundamentalist. The city is crumbling around Nadia and Saeed, blackouts are frequent, the water supply is often cut and drones hover overhead at all times. But yet, despite these enormous setbacks and struggles, they live on. If the novel were just the couple and their fight to live in their city, then what a wonderful book it would have been. I truthfully absolutely loved these initial scenes. They are a fascinating study of a couple in wartime. But then Hamid fucks everything up.Hamid, possessed by his own ego and the spirit of Salman Rushdie, decides that this perfectly serviceable novel needs something extra. A little bit of magic needed to be injected into the story. Literally. For some unknown reason, Hamid has these magical doors pop up all around the world. Doorways that lead you to anywhere in the world. You step into a door in the Middle East and suddenly you are on Mykonos. This concept sounded familiar to me, but I couldn't pinpoint it exactly. So I read on.It is inevitable that our couple is shown to one of these doors and are whisked away from their city and their lives. The second they step foot into the magical door is when the novel goes from fairly good to absolute shit. Why did Hamid add this ridiculous conceit to this novel? Why would he sabotage himself like this? I tried to ignore all door nonsense, but then it happened again. Hamid completely abandoned his great story of a couple in wartime to focus on his stupid doors. And then it hit me. I knew where I had seen this concept before.It's Monsters Inc. This book is fucking Monsters Inc.The moment I realised this I just could not continue. I had to end it. And thus we are here. I'd like to say that I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed but I am angry and disappointed. Hamid's ridiculous urge to write magical realism is possibly one of the most ill-fated attempts at cross-genre literature ever. It could have been so great if his editor had just said, hey Mohsin, you have a great novel here but all this door shit has to go. It's a shame.

Both girls, Tracey and our unnamed narrator, grow up on the estates of North London (or, as Smith herself puts it, a North London of the mind). Our narrator lives with her black activist mother, she is something of a mix between Assata Shakur and Diane Abbott, whilst Tracey lives with her white Croydon facelift'd mother who seems to be a somewhat more mature Vicky Pollard. As with most Smith novels, class divides all. The novel follows the two girls and our narrator's eventual career in the media as an assistant to Madonna standee, Aimee.It's a road well-worn. A novel about two girls from different class backgrounds magically kindling a friendship. Just off the top of my head I can recall numerous other authors who've written books on the exact same subject; Maeve Binchy, Edna O'Brien, Toni Morrison, Elena Ferrante. However, with Smith, it didn't feel like I've been here before. The sections of the novel dealing with our narrator's relationship with Tracey are by far its saving grace. Never a chore to read (unlike other sections) everything is so naturalistic between them and Smith writes this relationship with such intimate detail that at times one forgets that this novel is fiction. The girls' love of the golden age of musicals obviously aided in my adoration of these sections, with numerous references to Gypsy, Show Boat, and Guys and Dolls, I felt right at home laughing at every joke and understanding every reference.However, this novel is not without flaws. The largest flaws for me were the West Africa sections. In the novel, the superstar Aimee (to whom our narrator is a PA) funds the building of a school in a West African nation and thus our narrator must make numerous trips there to make sure that everything is going smoothly. Whilst these sections did serve as foils for our narrator's naivety, they are also the sections in which a whole lot of nothing happens. Often slid in between sections detailing the narrator's friendship with Tracey, these sections eventually became utterly labourious. I must admit at times skimming a couple of these sections in order to get back to Tracey and her life. Another flaw of the novel is its sheer scale. There is absolutely no reason for this book to be the behemoth it is. Honestly, you want to save the trees? I've a solution. Hire better editors. This novel could have been cleaned up a lot more and could've lost maybe 150 pages. If Orwell managed to do Animal Farm in 95 pages then you have no excuse Zadie. This novel had an interesting time with the press. The Guardian called it 'her finest novel' whilst The Irish Times said it is 'lacking a consistent narrative drive, an interesting voice or a compelling point of view'. I think I fall somewhere in the middle of these s. Is it Smith's best? God no. Is it a good starting point with Smith? Dear god no. Swing Time is a minor novel in Smith's oeuvre. I'm starting to feel we'll never reach the heights of White Teeth ever again. I would align this novel more with The Autograph Man, another Smith novel which had a hard time with the public but which I found to be throughly enjoyable.

The fact that this novel was published a mere four months after the disastrous Brexit vote but yet analyses its aftermath as a central theme shows a turnaround that is nearly insane. Smith must have practically vomited this novel into her word processor, which makes its utter flawlessness almost divine. The novel begins with a man, Daniel Gluck, who seems to have washed up on a beach. Believing he has died he casts his eye along the beach and sees even more like him. The corpses of refugees line the beach, interspersed between lounging sunbathers and laughing children who seem to take no notice of the corpses around them. This opening scene demonstrates Smith's intent with Autumn, she is writing a Zeitgeist novel. Luckily for Daniel, this scene is all a dream, as he is in a coma. Most days, in the chair beside him is a woman who the nurses believe is his granddaughter. She is no relation. She is Elisabeth (with an S) Demand (from the French, Du Monde). She is the tentpole upon which this novel drapes. Autumn is a exploration of her life and of those around her. But it is also a study of every person living in Great Britain post-Brexit.

I am very much of the belief that anything can be made funny, even Alzheimer's, so this novel sounded right up my alley. I quickly discovered however that this isn't a comic novel about Alzheimer's, it's a comic novel featuring Alzheimer's. But this didn't put me off, Rachel Khong's hilarious worldview kept me going throughout this short novel.The plot revolves around Ruth, a woman who has reached her mid-life crisis at age thirty, who decides to pause her life for one year to act as carer for her father who has Alzeimher's. The novel takes the form of her day-by-day diary. The weakest aspect of this novel is by far the plot. The novel trundles along with a story that is somewhat unbelievable and, whilst the character list is relatively economic, there are no standout stars of this novel. However, what I do applaud this novel for is its random observations. Sometimes Khong will just stop the whole plot to talk about the most incidental of facts or she will point something out about a character and nearly every time this happens you can be guaranteed to chuckle or at least think 'huh that was actually a really clever joke'. Khong's comedy is the saving grace of this novel, it would be a total disaster without it. I really genuinely enjoyed how she sees things and how subtle she makes her jokes, there is no fanfare or warning, she would just drop a hilarious aside into the middle of a paragraph about the horrors of late-stage Alzheimer's. She is a master of comic relief. And the novel is the better for it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jul 15, 2017","Jul 19, 2017","Jul 05, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35378228-goodbye-vitamin

Patrick Sumner, an Irish-man who is two shillelaghs away from King Brian in Darby O’Gill and the Little People, is also on-board. He’s a surgeon who was wounded in the siege of Delhi. As the ship takes off on its voyage strange things begin happening. Someone is murdering people on the ship. I wonder who could be the cause?The North Water is a tired tale. After it gets bored with being Moby-Dick it decides to try and become The Revenant with equally disastrous results. Whilst the overall plot was weak I have to admit that I did enjoy some passages of this novel. McGuire is able to save himself from his plot by employing wholly readable but violent prose. This novel does not swiftly pan to the doorway as the ear is being cut off. I hate using this word but The North Water is gritty. McGuire effectively puts you on the Volunteer and you can taste the sour salt water in the air.However, The North Water cannot light a flare and be rescued by prose. The only thoughts I had throughout this novel were about how much I want to reread Moby-Dick. And that’s what I suggest you do as well.

Her daughter and narrator, Sofia, has brought her out to the south of Spain in order to attend the Gomez clinic. However, the clinic may be as fraudulent as Rose’s sudden paraplegia. Sofia writes about her mother’s penchant for hypochondria but yet she plays along and obeys. She has even put her PhD on hold in order to appease her mother’s ‘illness’. Hot Milk is a strange novel. The prose is dream-like but compulsive. It’s hard to put down this wandering novel.There is a moment in this novel where Sofia decides to set a dog free. Now, if this happened in any other novel it would have been an automatic one-star did-not-finish. It’s such a trite bit of narrative that’s used to portray a character as carefree and whimsical. But it works in Hot Milk. Sofia is a woman who can’t tell the difference between the words ‘beloved’ and ‘beheaded’, they look the same to her. She is constantly plagued by jellyfish (called medusas in Spanish) and she admires the welts they give her on her legs. Of course she sets a dog free. She is an aimless narrator. She weaves you along this novel in hopes that you’re taking the lead.Hot Milk is never a dull novel. I found myself liking this novel more and more as I read on. I went in reluctant and it completely took me off guard. The novel culminates in its final chapters, which are so wonderfully fitting and perfect that I struggle to even think of a more satisfying ending in any recent reads.

My friend COn the back of my disappointment with Garth Greenwell’s What Belongs to You I went to Twitter and meditated on the state of the gay novel. My friend Conrad said I should try out Edmund White. So I did.A Boy’s Own Story (1982) is a novel about a gay teen’s coming of age in 1950s America. White holds nothing back. Within the first 20 pages we are already reading about our narrator’s rendezvous with a younger boy, Kevin. Kevin is 12 and our narrator is 15 but Kevin already knows the ropes when it comes to ‘cornholing’. These first couple of pages act as an admonition to the reader, you can hear White tapping at his keys, ‘I am not going to hold back’. The unabashed portrayal of teenage sexuality is so wonderfully refreshing. This novel is far more than just sex however.Our narrator faces genuine struggles. Throughout the novel he chastises himself for being homosexual. At times he wishes he wasn’t. His father sends him to boarding school in order to straighten him out (pun intended). His life is a series of unfulfilling encounters and perpetual self-hate. The novel rejects the conventional bildungsroman narrative. We jump around the narrator’s life because that seems to be the only thing that he’s able to control, us. In her original  for the NYT, Catherine Stimpson described A Boy’s Own Life as The Catcher in the Rye meets Wilde’s De Profundis. It’s a fair comparison but White recedes into depths that Salinger could only dream about.While I will admit that the novel can get boring in some parts I overall really admired A Boy’s Own Life. It acts as a reminder to me that for every middling book you read there’s always a great one to counteract it.

I first encountered My Name is Lucy Barton (2016) on a table in my local Waterstone’s which proclaimed it to be the book of the year.

Lucy views her brief period in hospital as an important chapter in her life. She sits in her hospital bed, looking at the Chrysler Building outside her window, and ponders. This is a very short novel. My ebook edition was 99-pages long. And yet, it took me a while to read it.

We jump from story to story, some make up the overall narrative while some are just brief memories or meditations.I enjoyed My Name is Lucy Barton. I understand why some are hailing it as a ‘great’ novel because it manages to pack a lot of story and emotion into a tiny package but for me it was lacking in an overall point. Its brevity reminded me of two similar novels about women eulogising their lives, Colm Tóibín’s The Testament of Mary and Jenny Offill’s Dept. of Speculation. Strout doesn’t reach the same levels of brilliance as Tóibín or Offill but they would make an interesting unofficial trilogy.Some have found confusion and annoyance in the aforementioned fragmentation. I personally think it works quite well. It’s hard to get super short chapters to work correctly, the only other novel I can think of in which fragmentation is successful is Vonnegut’s Cat’s Cradle. I applaud Strout for taking this risky approach with Lucy Barton. A lot of the novel works because of it. I feel if this book was just a straight narrative I would have been bored out of my mind.

In my trademark style, I read it months after the hype.Our unnamed American narrator engages with a hustler, Mitko, whilst roaming a Bulgarian bathroom. The novel follows their relationship in three acts in which we delve into the erotic, the tragic, and the melodramatic. Many have been quick to talk about Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room as an inspiration but I feel that What Belongs to You owes a great deal of credit to Andre Gide’s L’immoraliste. I found Greenwell’s protagonist to be uneasy and unlikeable. He describes all of his sexual experiences with Mitko but all of them feel so empty – emotionally and novelistically. I found myself getting more and more bored as I continued with this short novel.The first part of this novel, called Mitko, was published as an award-winning novella in 2011 and that explains why it is the greatest section of the novel. The other acts, A Grave and Pox, just pale in comparison and read like lesser works. They feel stitched-on because they were literally stitched on in order to create this novel. There is a clear incoherence between the parts and it caused me to keep checking how many pages were left instead of letting me enjoy the novel.

Homegoing begins in Ghana in the late-1700s with Effia and Esi, two half-sisters with very different lives. Essia was sold to the white Englishman James and lives with him in his castle. In the dungeons below, Esi is preparing to be shipped off to America. The novel follows Effia and Esi’s descendants through a series of interchanging vignettes up to the present time. My problem with Homegoing lies within these vignettes. Each new vignette presents a new descendent, a new character. I don’t know about how you read but for me it takes a couple of pages to get used to a character, to be able to fully connect with them and their story. However, I found that whenever I finally did connect with the new character I was met with a page break and then a new story would begin.For me, the idea of presenting this novel as a collection of character-driven vignettes causes it to become a disjointed mess. Fourteen characters get their own stories in this novel and my edition is 335 pages long. That means that, on average, each character got 23.9 pages to themselves. Gyasi just is not able to create whole, believable characters in 24 pages. I wish she either cut the family tree or made the book longer, I would have prefered the former.Some parts do achieve greatness however. The stories concerning the characters in Africa are far stronger than the ones set in America, in my opinion. The story revolving around Quey and Cudjo being the standout piece of the novel that could work as an independent short story. Marjorie’s story is also the sensation of the novel’s second half. However, these glimmers of gold don’t save the rest of Homegoing from ultimately being a confused novel. I will put most of its problems down to being a debut. It’s easy to see Yaa Gyasi’s potential in Homegoing and thus I will admit that I await her next book with hope....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,Jan 2016,"Aug 03, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28683066-homegoing

Like The Sellout, I had been aware of Eileen (2015) for a while now. I’ve also been meaning to read it for equally as long. Once again, pushed by the Man Booker, I finally read it. Thank goodness.Taking place over a week at Christmas in the late 1960s, Eileen tells the story of Eileen Dunlop, a woman in her early-twenties. She works at a correctional institute for young men where she stalks a security guard and spies on the inmates in solitary confinement. At home she sleeps in a cot in the attic where she pees into mason jars and indulges in laxative binges which make her bowel movements ‘torrential’ and ‘oceanic’. Her teeth are rotting from her penchant for sweets and doesn’t shower often because she enjoys stewing in her own filth. Needless to say, Eileen is a divisive narrator. Some have criticised this book for relying on shock value whilst others have praised Moshfegh for creating such a vile but enticing protagonist. My opinion is that Eileen is near a masterpiece.Remember that scene in Trainspotting where Ewan McGregor is in the filthy toilet cubicle and proceeds in making his way into the toilet and swims around in the cistern bliss? That’s a lot like reading Eileen. You’re aware of the filth and the depravity but once you’re in there it’s actually quite beautiful. Eileen lives with her ex-cop, current-alcoholic father who she fears will kill himself eventually. At work all of her fellow employees mock and bully her for being so filthy. One cannot help but think of Eileen as an endearing character. Her life is tough, even if she brings a lot of it onto herself. You read this novel hoping thing will get better for her, hoping someone will come along and save her from herself. And someone does. From then on, Eileen wouldn’t seem out of place in Patricia Highsmith’s bibliography.The book is written by the Eileen of right now, reminiscing about the winter that changed her life. It is an incredibly engrossing novel. Eileen is one of the most memorable characters I have read in recent years. The novel just radiates intrigue and has an ending straight out of the best Hitchcock.

This is David Means’ debut novel after birthing a couple of short story collections into the world. (Note to self: never read any of those books)Hystopia began so well. Page one and we are hit with an editor’s note. I thought to myself, ‘great, a meta-novel, I already love this’. The first fifty-ish pages consist of editor’s notes, author’s note, and testimonials, all of which are fictional. We are told that the novel presented to us was written by Eugene Allen, a Vietnam vet who has since killed himself. We learn of the hours he spent in his room working on the novel and we read the opinions of the people upon whom characters in the novel are based. In the back of my mind I’m feeling the flickers of Pale Fire but that flame is quickly quenched. The novel within the novel, also called Hystopia, is a mess.I’ve read s for Hystopia that mention great names like Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy. If David Means writes like Pynchon then my s read like Dorothy Parker’s. Hystopia is set in an America where Vietnam never ended and JFK doesn’t die in Dallas. It follows a band of outsiders as they violently roam the country, wishing they were being written by Larry McMurtry. I read whole pages thinking, ‘Am I not smart enough for this novel or does it just not make any sense?’, judging by the critical reaction – it’s the latter. It reads like if Kerouac attempted to write an IKEA manuel. A mess begets a mess.I spent most of Hystopia waiting for it to end. The whole thing reminded me of a movie you’d see on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. What is so disappointing is that Means was really onto something with the meta-fictional parts that bookend the novel. How can they be so good but the novel so bad? Another thing that annoys me is the name. Hystopia. It’s hard to type and when you google it the first suggestion is ‘hysterectomy’. My disappointment in this novel is palpable.

I’d seen a couple of people on Literary Twitter talking about it but I’ve yet to actually see a physical copy of it in any bookshops. I had almost forgotten about it until the longlist came about. So I read it first.The Sellout is a satire about race in modern America. The novel begins with our nameless black narrator sitting before the Supreme Court. We soon discover (through oneiric but lucid prose) that he is being charged with owning a slave and segregating a school. Before you have a chance to do a double-take the narrator brings you back to his childhood. We discover that he grew up in the town formerly known as Dickens but the town is now disappearing, it barely even appears on maps anymore. Overwhelmed by a literal lack of place our narrator attempts to bring Dickens back from the ashes. In order to achieve this, he ’employs’ one of Dickens’ oldest residents and last remaining Little Rascal, Hominy, as his slave, a job that he is more than willing to do (he even insists on calling our narrator ‘massa’). He will stop at nothing to bring Dickens back.This is a very heavy book when you think about it. However, Beatty never lets you think about it because scattered between the paragraphs on the ethics of slavery and meditations on modern blackness are jokes. Lots of jokes. This novel about slavery and segregation is one of the funniest books I’ve read in years. However, I wouldn’t go around advertising The Sellout as a ‘comic novel’. Beatty himself has said that people are reading the jokes and forgetting what the book is actually about. I see the humour of this novel as a necessary antidote, like the porter telling dick jokes after the murder of Duncan.Beatty’s approach is brazen but brilliant. He will have you laughing and then a couple of seconds later you’ll be thinking about why you are laughing. The Sellout is one of my favourite reads of the year thus far. It’s one which plants itself into your frontal lobe and refuses to leave, like a satirical tumour. I’m scolding myself for putting this one off for a year and a half but now I’m calling shotgun on the bandwagon (if it hasn’t already left)....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jul 28, 2016","Jul 29, 2016","Jul 28, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/22892308-the-sellout

BAM. This play is fucking brilliant.Measure for Measure balances on the threshold of tragedy and comedy. One scene may have the brilliantly evil Angelo doing something brilliantly evil and the next scene may contain a barrage of Pompey’s utterly hilarious one-liners. This is just such a perfect play. I have no idea why this is one of Shakespeare’s least popular works.

One of Shakespeare’s most successful comedies, Twelfth Night concerns Viola who survives a shipwreck but thinks she has lost her twin brother. She decides to disguise herself as a man and enter the court of the Duke. Another plot follows Malvolio and the tricks played on him. Shakespeare has played with the idea of twins and cross-dressing before (in The Comedy of Errors and The Two Gentlemen of Verona respectively). Malvolio’s plot is the better plot, in my opinion, because it is just hilarious. Malvolio’s attempted wooing of Olivia is one of Shakespeare’s funniest scenes.The crossdressing of Viola seems kind of strange because there isn’t an overall explanation as to why she does it. She just arrives in Illyria and is like, ‘huh I guess I better dress as a guy!’ It’s a strange plot hole. I do think Twelfth Night is one of Shakespeare’s better comedies but, like in The Merry Wives of Windsor, there is a mean streak running through the play. Like Falstaff, Malvolio is the butt of a joke played by a large part of the cast and at the end of the play he runs off cursing the lot of them. Why is everyone so mean to Malvolio? Yes, he’s a bit slow and a bit dim but really doesn’t deserve what happens to him. Apart from these qualms, Twelfth Night is a good and funny play.

The problem with Hamlet is that it’s about Hamlet a.k.a. the most annoying character in all of English literature. I spent the majority of this play sighing whenever I read, ‘Enter Hamlet‘, or when I saw he had another navel-gazing soliloquy coming up.I’m genuinely incredibly curious as to why this is considered Shakespeare’s greatest play. To me it was just another average one for Shakespeare. Hamlet is really a play for the minor characters. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern steal every one of their scenes, the same can be said for Ophelia, the Ghost and even fucking Yorick. I did overall enjoy Hamlet, it’s one of Shakespeare’s best constructed plays.

Anyone who knows anything about English history will know that Henry V is most famous for the Battle of Agincourt in the early 1400s. It’s probably one of the most famous battles in English history and Shakespeare’s dramatisation of it is nothing if not masterful. In Henry V Shakespeare employs a ‘chorus’, literally a character who appears at the beginning of every act to tell the audience what is happening and where the action of the following act is taking place. The chorus is a genius move by Shakespeare. Previous ‘battle’ plays have been plagued by confusion as to who is who and what is what (*cough* the Henry VI trilogy) but this is completely avoided in Henry V. I’m going to make the premature judgement and state that Henry V is Shakespeare’s best history play.In Henry V everything just comes together. Some of the speeches are just brilliant and there isn’t a single character wasted. There is also a great deal of impartialism in my opinion, Shakespeare equally shows the French side and even includes scenes wholly in French.

Well, try to keep that image of Falstaff in your head because the Falstaff in The Merry Wives of Windsor is nothing but a sad shell of magnificent character. It’s obvious that Falstaff was such a popular character that Shakespeare decided to give him his own play, just like how the Minions somehow got their own movie. The Merry Wives of Windsor begins with Falstaff devising a plan to court two married women in order to get their money. However, both women quickly realise they’re both part of Falstaff’s ruse and conspire to play along. The wives tell their husbands about the plot and quickly everyone is in on playing Falstaff at his own game. That’s the basic plot: everyone playing tricks on Falstaff. Poor guy.The Merry Wives of Windsor is good if you’re looking for two-hours of slapstick and bawdiness. It’s an aggressively minor play. It closely follows to formula of Shakespeare’s ‘early funny ones’ such as The Comedy of Errors and Love’s Labour’s Lost. However, none of this makes up for the fact that Shakespeare literally shits all over one of his greatest creations. The actions and treatment of Falstaff in this play are completely out of character. Also the fact that the entire cast go completely out of their way just to play a mean-spirited joke on him leaves a real bad taste.

Bassanio has fallen for Portia and needs money to woo her. He asks Antonio for a loan but Antonio is broke so they both approach Shylock, the local moneylender. Shylock agrees to give Bassanio the loan but makes the stipulation that if it is not paid back on time then Shylock is allowed to take a pound of Antonio’s flesh. Y’know, a perfectly normal thing to ask for. Shylock is probably Shakespeare’s most controversial characters. He is portrayed as Jewish and ticks the boxes of every single Jewish stereotype. He’s greedy, curmudgeonly, power hungry, and rude.The Merchant of Venice was written as a comedy and thus we are meant to laugh at and taunt greedy old Shylock. Modern audiences (and I) really don’t see Shylock as a comic character anymore. I read Shylock as a tragic hero. His ‘if you prick us do we not bleed’ speech is one of Shakespeare’s greatest and (I think anyway) shows the reader that Shakespeare also views Shylock as a tragic hero. I could write a whole thesis on Shylock and my opinions but I must keep it short. The Merchant of Venice is, for me, one of Shakespeare’s best plays. In fact, you could get rid of every character and just have Shylock soliloquising on stage and it would still be a masterpiece.

The scene I refer to is Hal’s rejection of Falstaff. How could Shakespeare possibly write this? From their joviality in Part 1 it is to be assumed that Hal and Falstaff have known each other for quite a while so why would Hal just suddenly disown him? Even if he is now Henry V that doesn’t mean that he has to literally forget Falstaff like last week’s milk. This complete turn of character is reminiscent of the treatment of Joan of Arc in Henry VI, Part 1.

The play follows the exploits of Hal and Falstaff far more than its title character, which was quite an odd decision for Shakespeare. We see the king and country nearing turmoil as Hal gallivants around joking and getting drunk. The play is as sharp a satire today as it was in the 1590s.

Meanwhile, the French king is angry because he believes King John’s nephew, Arthur, should be the king. Then they both invade a town for some reason and they bicker and it goes on forever. There is one good scene however when one of the main characters jumps off a castle. I liked that bit.People always complain about Shakespeare being boring and I just want to slap them and shout, ‘no! You don’t know what actual boredom feels like!’. King John is Shakespeare’s most boring play. It’s as if he realised that his last play, Romeo and Juliet, was actually really good and thought he had to follow that up with something truly awful. What separates this play from Titus Andronicus however is that I do not hate King John. There’s nothing in this play to actually hate.

The central conceit is that there is a bus, a lilac-coloured bus, which drives from Dublin to the small of village of Rathdoon every weekend. Each person who takes this bus is gifted, by Binchy, with a vignette on their lives. We go from person to person, seat to seat, to discover who’s hiding what – every person has a story to tell.I read the blurb of this one and thought it sounded fascinating. I usually enjoy character studies. However, Binchy just didn’t seem able to connect everything together. After reading some people’s stories you are left questioning what exactly is the overall narrative here. The answer is that there is no narrative. The entire book is disjointed and there is no flow what-so-ever. It is also quite clear to read that Binchy had a lot more fun writing about some characters than others. I will say that there are a couple of good stories in here and they are typically Binchy so they definitely alleviate this novel of most of its downfalls. My overall feeling toward The Lilac Bus is ‘meh’. It could have been so much better....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,May 2016,"Jul 03, 2016","Jul 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41952.The_Lilac_Bus

Even after reading the play I still can’t make senseBill followed up The Comedy of Errors with the apostrophe minefield that is Love’s Labour’s Lost. Even after reading the play I still can’t make sense of the title. I found that this is the play where I could physically read Shakespeare becoming a more competent writer. Love’s Labour’s Lost is a work mostly concerned with wordplay and double entendre than it is with plot. But let me explain the plot anyway. Set in the court of Navarre, the King and three lords, Biron, Longueville, and Dumaine, decide to dedicate themselves to study for three years. During this time they will fast and, most importantly, not set eyes upon a woman. It’s never explained why not seeing women is such an important aspect of the King’s study but I’m going to assume that the King was hoping for an all out Fire Island Extravaganza! The Princess of France and her convenient grouping of three ladies turn up at Navarre to speak to the King and the lords’ vow of chastity is thrown out the window with Concorde speed.The structure of this play is very strange. It begins with three short acts and then proceeds with two of the longest acts of all time. More than half of the play is taken up by these two acts and they are incessantly exhausting. It doesn’t help that Love’s Labour’s Lost is basically just a series of sex jokes followed by a love poem followed by sex jokes followed by love poem. Shakspeare usually doesn’t create annoying characters (in my opinion anyway) but he really outdoes himself here. Holofernes is a schoolmaster who insists on speaking a strange combination of English and Latin and Shakespeare gives him whole paragraphs of dialogue. Every time I saw Holofernes enter the stage I temporarily died. He’s a real blot on this otherwise well-rounded comic cast.Like The Comedy of Errors, there’s not much to say about Love’s Labour’s Lost critically. It has fallen out of popularity as it has aged because much of the wordplay and reference are lost on modern audiences. Whilst my thoughts of this play are much similar to those of The Comedy of Errors, I will say that this play is wittier. It’s a grand leap ahead of Errors linguistically but plot-wise it is stranded in the comedic doldrums....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 23, 2016","Apr 24, 2016","Apr 24, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/187450.Love_s_Labor_s_Lost

Shakespeare wasn’t messing around with that title because it literally is a comedy of errors. The story goes that there was once two sets of twins born of two separate families. One family buys the other twins from the other family so the first family now have two sets of twins… actually, no. I can’t explain this. Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse decide to go to Ephesus in order to find their lost long twin brothers who just happen to also be called Antipholus and Dromio. Anyway, you can kind of guess the rest, there’s now two sets of identical twins in Ephesus so there are loads of mistaken identity gags e.g. Antipholus of Syracuse tells Dromio of Syracuse to do something, Antipholus then meets Dromio of Ephesus (thinking he’s Dromio of Syracuse) and asks him if he did the thing and Dromio of Ephesus has no idea what he’s talking about and (truthfully) asserts that Antipholus didn’t tell him to do anything.Whilst this slapstick comedy may sound like a joyous romp, it gets boring very fast. The joke is that people keep on getting the twins mixed up, that’s it. That joke runs dry by the end of the first act and then you realise that you have four more acts of the same joke being played out over and over again. Not even Sisyphus had it that bad. One can assume that even Shakespeare got bored with the joke because Errors is his shortest play. In my Norton anthology, the play is only 47 pages long (compared to Hamlet or Richard III, both of which pass the 80 page mark). We can be thankful for something however because Errors is the basis for 1988’s Big Business which starred Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler, a movie which Roger Ebert called ‘never funny’.Critically The Comedy of Errors has been pushed aside for having little or no academic value. Whereas Titus felt the wrath of critics for being so blase about violence, Errors has felt the wrath of nobody because there is simply no depth to anything in it. I don’t know which is worse. I do think Errors is a more enjoyable play than Titus but it would be foolish to compare them because their themes and settings are diametric opposites. With Titus I was disgusted, with Errors I was disappointed. Shakespeare had done a better comedy before with The Two Gentlemen of Verona and that was his first ever play!

Yukio Mishima’s The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (1963, trans. 1965) is a hugely popular work by one of Japan’s best-known writers. The novel concerns Noburu, a young boy who is the member of a pseudo-gang of other youths who like to precociously discuss philosophy and morality. Things quickly turn however when Noburu’s mother starts going out with a sailor named Ryuji. This greatly upsets Noburu who plots to terrorise Ryuji with seemingly no mercy. I thoroughly enjoyed this short book. Like with Yoshimoto, I admire Mishima’s minimalism, the sparseness of his prose. I like to think of Japanese literature as an attempt to see who can create the most beauty with the least amount of words. I suppose the emoji is the endgame then. The novel is unrelenting and disturbing at times, its overall atmosphere is one of unease and dread. When reading the novel you can sense that it is building toward something uneasy and the final couple of pages stick around in your head for hours after you’ve finished.

I didn't know at the time that Sidney Sheldon was the 7th bestselling writer of all time. I bought three of his books, which coincidentally were his first three, all for the reasonable price of 50c, or, about 16c each.The Naked Face was Sheldon's first novel and it is awful. I mean, it is spectacularly terrible. The book is about a psychoanalyst named Judd who, after the murder of one of his patients and his receptionist, is next on the hit list of some crazed murderer. The first two victims of this killer are a gay guy and a black woman, I think that explains the territory we are in here with Sheldon's fantasy. In fact, I will happily call this entire novel racist and astoundingly homophobic, but that doesn't even begin to describe this mess of a novel.So, I guess you're wondering why this is a two-star  then? Why am I not absolutely tearing into this obviously horrendous novel? Well, it's because I had so much fun with this bad book. The Naked Face seeps so far down into the chasm of abhorrence that you just cannot look away. It's like the movies they watch on Mystery Science Theatre 3000, they're so bad that they're good.I found myself guffawing at the sheer ridiculousness of the plot and eventually rooting for our protagonist to finally get what he deserves and meet his death. At certain points of this novel it was like I was attending a pantomime and booing and hissing every time a baddie entered stage left. One major plot point is that a gay man was seeing Judd in order to 'cure' his homosexuality. How could anyone take this novel seriously after that? The novel's one black character is only present for a few pages but her impact is immense. She speaks in such heightened ebonics that you wonder if Sheldon ever actually met a black person and at one point she speak my favourite line in the whole novel, ""If you don't ball me quick, I'll go out of my cotton-pickin' mind."" YIKES. What was Sheldon thinking!? In the end I didn't really want this novel to finish. I was having so much fun with it.

Titus was Shakespeare’s first attempt at staging a classical tragedy – something which he will eventually go on to get so right in works such as Julius Caesar. The basic plot follows a Roman general (our Titus) who is victorious in a battle against the Goths. As a reward Titus brings the queen of the Goths and her sons back to Rome. Titus is a silly billy however because he kills one of the queen’s sons and then the queen plots revenge on Titus. Nobody cares about the plot of Titus however. Any piece of criticism you read about this play will mention the same thing; its bloodiness and its violence. Titus is such a violent play that during the Victorian era it was practically banished Shakespeare’s oeuvre because the Victorians couldn’t handle the play’s unrelenting gore. This might sound enticing to some but believe me, it isn’t as fun as it sounds.Titus Andronicus reads like Charlie Manson’s rejected screenplays. The word “gratuitous” doesn’t even begin to describe utter violence of this play. Macbeth is bloody and violent but it is also a perfectly constructed narrative in which every drop of blood has a clear motive and consequence. There’s a character in Titus who is raped and then her hands and tongue are cut off. She doesn’t die however, she sticks around for two more acts just fumbling and making garbled noises like Brendan Behan at an open bar. I lost count of how many amputations take place in Titus by Act 3.Poet and cat enthusiast, T.S. Eliot, once wrote that Titus was ‘one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written’. Whilst Eliot might have been fond of the odd hyperbole I cannot help but agree with his sentiment. Titus, as far as I can see, has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It’s the Elizabethan equivalent of Viva Forever!: The Spice Girls Musical. In fact, the history of criticism on Titus seems to just be a duel of insults as each critic attempts to formulate the ultimate put-down or the sickest burn. One of my favourites is from token white critic Harold Bloom who suggests that the violence and tragedy of Titus is so comically absurd that the best director to tackle the play would be Mel Brooks. (I am biased toward loving anything Harold Bloom writes because he once called slam poetry ‘the death of art’.)At least I now have an answer for when someone asks me what Shakespeare’s worst play is.

Her sentences are a bare number of words and she isn’t afraid of that dreaded full stop. She captures the zeitgeist of 1990s Tokyo in a way that almost felt homely and inviting.

I’ve read Dickens, Hardy, Collins, Gaskell and Eliot but I’d never read Trollope. I don’t know how I missed him but that’s just how it was. So I read Trollope. I read the first in his famed “Chronicles of Barsetshire”, The Warden (1855). The short novel tells the tale of a warden of a hospital who is accused of earning too much money due to a loophole that he found in the will of the hospital’s founder. Riveting stuff, I know. While the plot (especially in the first half) is genuinely quite boring, the novel does pick itself up in the final third which is really its saving grace. I’m thankful Trollope didn’t follow Dickens’ example by making this 1000 pages, instead he rounds this story off (in my edition anyway) at well below 150 pages. It is a welcome lenght in Victorian fiction. Since I’ve began the Chronicles I may as well continue on with them so I’m guessing I’ll be reading Barchester Towers some time in the future.

I scarcely recall any other book in the five years since The Goldfinch came out that has had anywhere near the same amount of complete domination. I mean, it was all, of course, deserved. No other writer has written anything like this since, nor has anyone even tried. It must have been like when Michelangelo did the Pietà and every other artist in Renaissance-era Italy was like ‘well fuck me right!? fuck MY still lives’.I didn’t read it at the time. I was still disillusioned by how much I did not enjoy The Secret History. I know, I know, I didn’t like The Secret History. I think it was because I actually saw too much of myself in the characters, and they’re all detestable. A similar thing happened with Eugenides’ The Marriage Plot, a fucking awful novel full of characters just like me. People often complain about never seeing themselves in books, my problem is I can’t seem to escape myself.And I found myself again in The Goldfinch. In Theo. This time it didn’t cause me to throw the book across the room however. I mean, Theo is insufferable. Everything about him just reeks, really. But god is he loveable. The broken male teen. Holden Caulfield wishes. Then there’s also Hobie. Ah Hobie. Sweet, clueless Hobie. I will do everything in my power to protect you.Plot-wise we’re a bit fast and loose here aren’t we?

Her strive for education acts as the main incentive for the novel and is the crux of tension throughout the work.

How could I ever suspend my disbelief with this work? How could I ever believe such a ridiculous tale about Vermeer and one of his most revered paintings? I must admit that I opened this novel expecting to utterly detest the lies it weaves. By page two I realised that I was an idiot who should never be listened to. Griet is hired as a maid to the Vermeer family in Delft. This novel supposes that Griet the maid was the sitter for Vermeer's great work Girl with a Pearl Earring. However that is not the story, or at least it is only a small part of it. The novel mainly concerns the inner workings of the Vermeer household and Griet's attempts to keep everything in control. It is a fantastic character study and I do admire Chevalier's bravery in using the first-person narrative. Whilst I will admit that at times Griet's dialogue is somewhat stilted and some lines are just downright odd ('His smile made me grip my broom tightly' was one line that made me chuckle due to its utter ridiculousness), she is never an annoying or tiring character. I really enjoyed the subtlety and delicacy of the novel. The plot flows along nicely which causes you to really fly through the narrative. It is not a criticism that I often voice but I would have almost liked for this novel to be longer. I feel I will truly miss Griet. I must say that I am somewhat smitten with this novel.

I know this, having spent three years powering through them at university. The artist is born, usually into a wealthy family, and they then go to an art college or an academy where they learn nothing and develop their own style as a rejection to everything they have been taught. Then they become famous and die. There it is - every artists' biography ever.Jennifer Clement rejects this formula. Instead of writing a straightforward biography of her friend Jean-Michel Basquiat, she writes about the woman who was constantly at his side - Suzanne Mallouk. Widow Basquiat is a fiery journey through the 1980s New York art scene. It is the story of Suzanne's life, but also, of course, the life of Basquiat. It moves along at a blistering pace as we switch between Clement's narrative and Mallouk's first-hand accounts.The most refreshing aspect of Widow Basquiat was its effort to not become hagiographic. Clement and Mallouk never once place Basquiat on a high pedestal. He was a controlling and unstable drug addict. He treated his closest friends awfully. He gave Mallouk P.I.D. which caused her to become sterile for life. But he was also a genius who had the art market in his hands. He was insecure and always thought about his image. The flamboyant Basquiat is also shown, how he would wear Armani suits when he painted and then would throw them away and his insistence, in his final years, to travel everywhere by limousine. Mallouk puts up with all of these quirks and in the end Widow Basquiat becomes an intimate but riotous portrayal of a turbulent relationship. It is one of the most well-constructed and enjoyable artists' biographies that I have ever read.

Most Irish people are aware of it. Ask anyone about John Lennon's islandIn the late 1960s John Lennon bought an island off the west coast of Ireland. Most Irish people are aware of it. Ask anyone about John Lennon's island or 'Beatle Island' and they'll know what you're talking about. Beatlebone is a fictionalised tale of John Lennon's attempt to visit his island in 1978 in order to combat his writer's block and to finally have a place to Scream. And it is a masterpiece.The novel is far from conventional. In fact, it won the Goldsmith's Prize, which is an award specifically granted to novels which challenge the conventional novel form. The whole book is heavily influenced by that spectre who sits on the shoulder of every Irish writer, James Joyce. There are some chapters in which Beatlebone turns into a play script, exactly as in Ulysses. However, where most writers would just end up with a poor pastiche of Joyce's great novel (as Orwell did with his modernist mishap A Clergyman's Daughter), Kevin Barry takes on the great Dubliner and triumphs in every aspect. The whole novel reads like a Surrealist jaunt in the West of Ireland. Hints of Du Maurier come through when the novel decides to tread along recesses of the paranormal, whilst many of the characters themselves seem to be close relatives of the persons who inhabit the scripts of Martin McDonagh. John Lennon himself doesn't really 'star' in this novel. In fact, it would be wholly possible for you to read this novel and never once realise that you are reading about John Lennon. He is only ever referred to as John and mentions of his superstardom are fleeting. In a typically postmodern move, there is one chapter about two-thirds of the way through Beatlebone in which the whole narrative is paused and Barry decides to tell us about how he went about writing the novel. He writes about his own visit to Beatle Island and his adventures around Clew Bay, where all of the novel takes place. After this chapter, the narrative continues on exactly as before. It is this chapter which pushed this novel from a great book to a fucking great book. I absolutely adored this book. Kevin Barry has been a big name in Irish writing for a while now and I finally understand why. Every Irish writer must write with the burden of those great names behind them; Joyce, Beckett, Bernard Shaw, Wilde, Yeats. Instead of cowering away from these names, Barry challenges them.

Having written this novel in his teens he finally One of the greatest tragedies of 20th century literature was the death of Raymond Radiguet in 1923. Having written this novel in his teens he finally succumbed to typhoid at the age of 20. In his short life he dazzled France's artistic community, becoming friends with Picasso and Jean Cocteau, even Coco Chanel arranged his funeral. When we discuss him we can only make assumptions and question what he would have become if he hadn't died so young. However, we can keep him alive by reading what little work he left us in his wake. The Devil in the Flesh concerns the love affair between a 16y/o boy and a 19y/o married woman whose husband is away fighting in WWI. Like in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man we are presented with a highly precocious youth who seems to know the true meaning of life and love whilst in his mid-teens. The torrid love affair is depicted with all the difficulties and foibles that we find in many of these ""forbidden love"" novels that saturated 19th-century France. However this one differs because it feels fresh. One must remember that this was written by a teenager so the teenage voice of our main character is truly a teenage voice. This isn't some white guy in his mid-30s trying to depict teenagers having sex, this is an actual teenager writing about what he knows and through that we discover one of the most believable and relatable teenage voices in fiction. Anyone who knows anything about Radiguet will realise that this is clearly a highly autobiographical work. Not only was he famous for his writing, he was also known for being quite... amorous. I mean, if Hemingway makes jokes about how much sex you have then you know you lead a pretty busy life. Thus the depiction of the affair is told through a highly eroticised eye. However, we're used to that, this is a French novel of course. Overall this is a wonderful little novel of romance, secrecy and the erotic. I mean, the fact that this book written by a 19-year-old is published by Penguin Modern Classics kind of explains everything. It's a true French classic. I was shocked when I logged on here to write my  and I noticed that this hasn't even received 2,000 ratings. Ugh, the best ones are never read are they? So I will hold this book aloft and hope the world sees it. Radiguet isn't dead, every page keeps him alive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,90,1,not set,"Nov 05, 2015","Nov 06, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10583000-the-devil-in-the-flesh

In The Blackwater Lightship, he transposes this storyline to Ireland in the late 90s, a vastly different setting. Helen, a school principal, discovers that her brother Declan is in hospital with AIDS. She has to work out how to tell their mother and grandmother about his diagnoses which he's apparently had ""for years"". Published just six years after Ireland's decision to decriminalise homosexuality, I feel that its effect was more profound and radical in the late 90s than it is now in 2015.The Blackwater Lightship is somewhat of a companion to The Heather Blazing. They are both set in the same area with the Redmond's from Blazing turning up again here. Both novels perfectly encapsulate 90s Ireland, the sensibilities and the lavishness. Characters are school principals and lawyers, they live in noisy cities while their parents are held up in crumbing houses in the countryside. The clash of the nouveau riche with old Catholic Ireland play central parts in both novels. The character of the grandmother in The Blackwater Lightship is just fantastic, she binds these two generations together with flawless comical insights. She is the typical Irish grandmother, an embracer, a voice of solace.I do think this is the superior novel to The Heather Blazing, it is a novel about family, whether they be nuclear or non-traditional.

The irony is that while he helps thousands of people keep their lives together as they travel, he cannot help his own life from falling apart before his eyes.This is my first Anne Tyler, a writer who I've always relegated to someone that my mother might enjoy. To give context, my mother's reading habits consist of whatever was 3 for 2 in Tesco. However, since many people who I respect have given very positive s to Tyler in the past I thought I'd give her a go. Sadly, this didn't really do anything for me. I did enjoy the overall plot but the characters, especially Macon, were just such boring people. The type that you'd cross the road for if you saw them walking towards you. I found myself putting this novel down more than I picked it up. Its slice-of-life monotony is usually something that I look for in a novel but The Accidental Tourist just gave me... monotonous monotony. Oh well. I haven't given up all hope though. I'll definitely be visiting Anne Tyler again soon. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,"Oct 27, 2015","Oct 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1083372.Accidental_Tourist

I doubt there is a woman alive who lived through the 1980s without reading or watching Lace. The novel opens with one of its most famous scenes, the young actress, Lili, has gathered four women to a hotel room in New York. The four women were childhood friends and have all made waves in their respective careers. Lili stands above them and delivers her killer line, ‘Which one of you bitches is my mother!?’. A classic is born.I went into Lace well-aware of its infamy. The numerous sex scenes present in this novel gave way to a new genre, the bonkbuster. However, Lace is far more than just 750-pages of erotica. I would genuinely call it a feminist classic. After the Lili’s confrontation in the first chapter the novel jumps back to our four ‘mothers’, Maxine, Kate, Judy, and Pagan, in their teens in a boarding school in Switzerland. We then follow their lives as they all become highly successful and influential women. This is where the underlying feminism becomes present. This is a novel about women owning their own lives. There is literally one prominent male character and he is an actual barbarian. Lace is The Women’s Room meets Deep Throat.I think it is obvious that I adored this novel. It has sold three million copies for a reason. However it is quite of its time. I doubt we’ll never have another Lace. New editions of Shirley Conran’s bibliography were re-published after the phenomenon of 50 Shades in order to show the world exactly how erotic bestsellers are done.

I often think this is a bit of a copMany of the s of Nightwood on this website seem to reflect the same sentiment, 'how do I even  this?' I often think this is a bit of a cop-out  but in the case of Djuna Barnes' Modernist novel from 1936, utter disorientation seems to be the most fitting response.A novel generally follows a basic plot with some semblance of a structure and often has one main character. Nightwood begins the birth of Baron Felix. We learn about his false patronage and we follow him in his attempt to produce an heir. Then we move on. The book forgets about him and Robin Vote becomes the main character. Then Doctor Matthew becomes the main character. Then Nora becomes the main character. Then it ends. Also over half of this book isn't even narrative. It's just the transsexual Irish gynaecologist Doctor Matthew O'Connor talking about essentially nothing. There is no plot. There is no structure. There is no one main character. And yet, Nightwood is totally immersive and highly readable.Within the genre of Modernist literature, Nightwood is a relatively easy read. Barnes doesn't resort to the stream-of-conciousness style that many of her fellow Modernists adopted. Instead she relies on transgression. This novel was one of the first in Western literature to portray a lesbian relationship. Also our pseudo-narrator Dr. Matthew is openly transsexual. But these were the days before WWII, when the Weimar era was flourishing in Germany and the rest of Europe was following suit. This novel is set in bohemian Paris during the rein of Gertrude Stein. It presents an almost unbelievable oasis of decadence and liberality that genuinely did exist before Nazism ended it all. That is the bittersweetness of reading the flamboyant novels of this era, we have the foresight of history and we know how it's all going to end eventually.Nightwood is a fabulous little novel. It is not hard to believe why Dylan Thomas, T.S. Eliot and William S. Burroughs all believed it to be one of the greatest novels ever written. It also recently appeared on the list of Greta Gerwig's ten favourite books, which was the catalyst for my reading it as I bow down at the heels of Gerwig. I would also suggest that this book would be a good starting place for those of you who want to dip your toes into the world of Modernist literature.

Since then it has sat on my bookshWhen Doris Lessing died in 2013 I decided to go out and buy a copy of her first novel, The Grass is Singing (1950). Since then it has sat on my bookshelf, almost forgotten. It wasn’t until last night, when I was just casually looking at my shelves that I spotted it and decided to give it a go.Mary has been murdered by her house servant Moses. He has been found at the scene of the crime and just hands himself over to the police. The Grass is Singing is the story of how Mary got herself murdered. Mary seems like a normal white woman living in the postcolonial pressure cooker that is 1940s Southern Rhodesia. She marries Dick in her 30s because she thinks it’s time to settle. The Grass is Singing is the story of a marriage doomed before it even begins. Dick and Mary live on a farm which is toiled over by the native black Rhodesians who Mary thinks are utterly disgusting. She is tetchy around the natives who work as servants in their house. When one labourer on her farm stops for a drink of water she whips him in the face. The Grass is Singing is a novel about racism.Lessing was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2007 for her ‘scepticism, fire and visionary power [that] has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny’. Her writing is scrutinous. Lessing was living and working in Southern Rhodesia when she wrote this novel and it reads like a damning dismissal of the society in which she lives and aftermath of Cecil Rhodes in southern Africa. She plays on the irony of hating the native even though you are intruding on his land. Mary is utterly mystified when she discovers that her native labourers might hate her. At one point she complains about the smell of them, to which her husband retorts that they think she smells too. She dismisses his utter ridiculousness.The Grass is Singing is a wonderful and incriminating insight into whiteness versus blackness in mid-20th century Africa. However it also works as a domestic drama and a whydunnit. I will say that it slightly loses its way in the final 50-pages but not enough to seriously affect the overall tone and aim of this novel. It’s astounding to think this is Lessing’s debut novel. I can’t wait to see what else she has in store....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 08, 2016","Aug 09, 2016","Oct 23, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1035030.The_Grass_is_Singing

In fact, that one tagline is what almost put me off reading this epic novel from Russian master-poet Boris Pasternak. This is a hefty book. I didn't want to dedicate all my time to a soppy love story. Thankfully, calling Doctor Zhivago a 'love story' is like saying Crime and Punishment is about the perils of being a pawnbroker.Doctor Zhivago is a vast novel. Like most great Russian novels, there is a large cast of characters (all of whom go by at least three different names) and many chapters in which a whole lot of nothing happens. Therefore, being a masochist at heart, I just adored it. There is nothing I love more in a book than pages and pages of nothing, and Doctor Zhivago delivers nothingness in abundance. For example there is a whole chapter just set in a train carriage. Over fifty pages we spend in that carriage. Nothing happens. And it's brilliant. If one insists of a plot synopsis then it is a story of Doctor Yuri Zhivago and his attempt to keep his life together as his country crumbles around him.Pasternak's politics are very much at play throughout the novel. The book was famously banned from publication in the Soviet Union and it is no surprise why. Overall I read this work as a searing critique of the modern Soviet state and the bloodshed from which it grew. Pasternak does not side with either the Whites or the Red, both destroyed Zhivago's beloved country. At times Zhivago does become somewhat of a mouthpiece for Pasternak, especially near the end of the novel where it becomes a brutal critique of everything from War Communism to the NEP to Collectivisation. I would suggest a somewhat sound knowledge of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath is needed for this novel, as the entire plot is based around the formation of the Soviet state. I really enjoyed my time with Doctor Zhivago. It is an epic tale of an epic time in modern history. It is throughly readable and wholly enjoyable (something which you can't often vouch for with Russian literature). I would recommend this for Russian lit beginners as it gets the balance of plot and philosophy just right (something which Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy often fail to do)....more",Notes are private!,0,128,1,"Jul 03, 2017","Jul 11, 2017","Oct 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15778759-doctor-zhivago

The narrative take place from the point of view of Fernande Olivier, Picasso's lover and muse and the subject of over 60 of his early works. Being a student of Art History, this really piqued my interest when I spotted it as I was walking out of my city's library. ""A graphic novel biography!?"", I thought. ""Might as well give it a go.""The novel begins with Picasso's arrival in Paris and leads us through his transformation from a conventional painter to the great pioneer of Cubism. This novel ends with the completion of his first great masterpiece, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. However, if you know anything about Picasso then you'll know that he died in 1973, yet we end here in 1907, so this is very much a hagiography of his Blue, Rose, and African periods. The art style of this work is highly admirable. In my opinion, it is drawn in a somewhat rushed, simplistic style but with a highly ambient palette. Some may have some reservations about the artwork, especially those who are used to highly polished American comic books, but I feel the art lends itself to the narrative. However, as I mentioned earlier, Art History is kinda my thing. I know quite a bit about Picasso and his works so this novel was a mere flight of fancy to me. The authors have clearly taken a lot of artistic license with Picasso's real story and idolise him to near God-like levels. Not in a million years would this ever be acknowledged by any art historical institute. However, if you know literally nothing about Picasso then I would recommend this because it does cover the major events of his early life even if they are highly idealised. For me however, I cannot say that I derived anything from this work. It is entirely surface level stuff. If one were to dig any deeper into the narrative they would hit a brick wall. It is very well executed though and I do highly admire the authors for envisaging Picasso's life in such a new and unique way. Just, don't quote this in your assignments. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Oct 11, 2015","Oct 11, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23167772-pablo

There is no easy way into Pinter so it's best to just crash-land into his work. This play contains everything that one may describe as ""Pinteresque"". Long pauses. Overwhelming dread. Near deathly tension. And, of course, humour. Dark, dark humour. Stanley is a lodger in a house in a seaside town. He lives with the owners of the house. They are simply folk.

If you are in any way familiar with my humour then you've probably already guessed that I adore this play. Pinter is one of those writers who I feel would be hilarious at funerals. In that his work is so out-there that it almost transcends life and death and everything takes place in a near purgatorial setting. The drum beat, the fricative verbal tennis matches, everything in this play feels like it's counting down to something. Tick follows tock follows tick.

It's fairly tough to try to ignore this book, especially in Ireland. It's being lauded as one of the greatest Irish novels in recent memory and all I will say to that is, ""hmm"". While the message of this novel is very important I cannot say that the hype is deserved. To be perfectly honest I would have preferred if O'Neill had just penned an essay, an essay stating her views and the point she's trying to get across. I feel she couldn't wrap a successful narrative or plot around her views and thus this novel ultimately fails, it doesn't work. The novel starts off slow and doesn't pick up any pace until the party scene. I feel that the party scene, being the most important scene, is actually better written than the rest of the novel. I can only presume that O'Neill paid special attention to this scene and spent a lot of time with it and that explains its triumph. It is a harrowing scene, and does capture the reader. After that, however, we fall into middling territory. I honestly feel I could have skipped 100-pages and wouldn't have missed anything. I headed a book club discussion of this book in my university and a point that was made by everyone was that it does fall apart in the second half. There is a lot of repetition and it does get boring. However the majority of the group appreciated the book far more than I did, I was very much the outlier. If there is one positive in this book it's O'Neill's wonderful ability to capture the essence of Irish teenhood. The book is set in Cork and I am a fellow Corkonian, still living in the county. It really is wonderful how O'Neill conveys the patois of Irish teenage girls. However, in the end, it's a mess. The plot comes and goes and leaves the reader bored.

I just saw the little paperbacks sitting on the bookshop shelf and I immediately assured them that they were getting a new home. Jump to a year later and I’ve finally decided to read them. Gide is a name that has become slightly lost in the 21st century. He has been overtaken by his contemporaries; Apollinaire, Cocteau, Celine, and of course Proust. Gide however trumped all of these names by being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1947, an award seen by many as the ultimate achievement for any writer. His most popular novel is The Immoralist (1902, trans. 1930) which tells the story of Michel, one of the most insufferable protagonists you’ll ever have the pleasure of reading.In his preface to The Immoralist, Gide calls his novel ‘a fruit filled with bitter ashes’. The bitter ashes are the actions of our dear protagonist Michel. You see, Michel is self-centred, arrogant, nonchalant, and annoyingly approachable. This isn’t a personal criticism, he’s meant to be that way. Gide takes a very brave step by writing a purposefully loathsome protagonist, think of him as a grandfather to Salinger’s Holden or Bellow’s Henderson. On a trip around the Maghreb, Michel is diagnosed with tuberculosis and it is frankly the greatest thing that has ever happened to him. His illness triggers an epiphany which sees his reject conformity. In short, he becomes an awful person. His poor wife, Marceline, nurses him back to good health yet she is always a peripheral character in his life. Michel is far more interested in the young Arab boys he sees on his travels. The entire narrative is presented as a sort of written confession by Michel. The novel is sandwiched by letters written by Michel’s friends. ‘In what way can Michel serve society?’, one letter states, ‘I admit I cannot guess’.What I really enjoy about this novel is its unabashed iconoclasm. One must remember that this was published in 1902. Modern-day literature is saturated with unlikable protagonists who are just vessels for authors to write autobiographically but without the consequences. Characters like Michel were usually expected to meet their comeuppance but Michel refuses to fit that trope. However, this novel isn’t a celebration of Michel either. Gide’s opinion of Michel is quite scattered. He calls the novel The Immoralist but yet in his preface he states that the novel is not an indictment of Michel’s actions. I like Michel. I think Gide wanted us to like Michel. No matter how ‘immoral ‘ he is.

However Marlon James' A Brief History of Seven Killings is more than just a wild ride, it's a brutal masterpiece that deserves its place as one of the best books of this decade so far. James weaves a Dickensian plot around Jamaican history and culture. The entire plot is based on the events surrounding the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in 1976. It's a fictionalised history of Jamaica from the 1970s through to the 1990s. I must admit that my knowledge of Jamaican history and politics and culture is laughably sparse. I'd tried ackee and saltfish once and didn't really like it so I don't think Marlon James could have found a whiter canvas to paint his story upon. I mentioned Dickens earlier because he's the only author whose work I can compare this to. A massive cast of characters, a hefty page count, numerous interweaving storylines but in the end it always comes together. This novel displays such mastery of plot and prose that I have not read since The Old Curiosity Shop or The Pickwick Papers. While this is essentially a very different novel it still harks back to and is possibly in the same league as these literary greats.A Brief History of Seven Killings is never an easy read. From whole chapters written in Jamaican dialect to brutal murders and mutilations being described in minute detail. When Steinbeck discussed The Grapes of Wrath he said, ""I've done my damndest to rip reader's nerves to rags; I don't want him satisfied"". I feel this quote also applies to James and this novel. He is a brutal writer, the dots above the Is are bullet holes and stems of his Ts are sharpened and ready to kill. Blood imbrues the pages of this novel and you are always caught off guard. As with many great novels such as this one there is always talk of literary awards and prizes wafting through the air. The most prominent to me is the Man Booker. At the time of writing, this novel is longlisted for the 2015 prize and I can say without hesitation that this is by far the runaway winner. I cannot conceive of any reason why this novel should not snatch the prize. If it does lose however it will go down in history as ""do you know what actually won the year A Brief History of Seven Killings was longlisted?""While some may be apprehensive and intimidated by its size, subject matter, and prose, I cannot urge everyone enough to pick up this book. A good novel holds your attention for a couple of hours, a great novel teaches you something. New cultures, new languages, new people.

He's the master of magical realism and in In Evil Hour he's written an unusually average and middling novel. It doesn't work.

A colonel decides to give the doctor this funeral even though the entire village believes the doctor should be left to rot. The novel is narrated by the colonel, his daughter, and her son.The atmosphere of this novel teeters on the edge of magical realism. While nothing overly magical happens, all the events have a somewhat mystical air about them (it’s the same kind of atmosphere that you find in Toni Morrison’s novels). Garcia Marquez’s highly unique and simplistic prose aids in the creation of this world.I do have some qualms with the structure of this book however. Garcia Marquez employs a strange multiple stream-of-consciousness narrative between the three narrators which honestly causes nothing but confusion. You can be a couple of pages into a chapter before you know who’s actually telling the story. There were a couple of chapters where I actually had no idea whose POV I was reading. This is a very early work by Garcia Marquez so I’ll forgive him for this strange narrative; he hasn't become our beloved Gabo yet. Overall I really did enjoy this book. It’s clear that it is somewhat of a flawed work but its flaws can simply be put down to youth and inexperience (this was written when Gabo was only 21). I'm excited to see what Garcia Marquez holds for me in the future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,not set,"Jul 22, 2015","Jul 22, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24695317-leaf-storm

Set in the fictional Seabrook College, the novel follows the lives of Daniel 'Skippy' Juster and his overweight, genius friend Ruprecht van Doren. However, as the title suggests, Skippy dies. He dies on the very first page. The novel then rewinds back (à la The Secret History) and the story begins. Over the next 600-pages Murray writes one of the greatest Irish novels of the century thus far. At points in this novel it was like reading dispatches of my life in secondary school. Murray perfectly encapsulates life in an all-boys Irish Catholic secondary school (I went to an all-boys Irish Catholic secondary school). The antics in the classroom, the attitude towards teachers, the banter between classmates, it was all so wonderful that it made me long for my school days. God I miss them. In Ireland there is nothing funnier than a funeral. We're an incredibly morbid nation and our literature reflects that. The humour in Skippy Dies is subtle but biting, highly offensive, and undeniably Irish. This is without a doubt Paul Murray's masterpiece. He joins the ranks of Laurence Sterne, Samuel Beckett, and Flann O'Brien.

The whole cast of some old sitcom get together and you just spend the whole time thinking about how old everybody looks. The basic plot of this new sequel/prequel/first draft of To Kill A Mockingbird is that our beloved narrator, Scout (now Jean Louise), is now in her twenties and returns from New York to visit her father, Atticus, in Maycomb. However, Atticus has changed in these years and now hold views and opinions that greatly upset Jean Louise. That's basically it.Reading the first page of this novel you are immediately dropped into the familiar prose and voice of Lee's masterwork. Maycomb is alive again in your hands. The novel simmers along at a steady pace as Jean Louise reminisces about her childhood in the town and about her life now. Then about half-way through the plot turns as we discover about what Atticus has been up to. Unless you have been living under a rock then you already know what I'm talking about but if you don't know then I'll tell you, (view spoiler)[HE'S A BIG OLE RACIST (hide spoiler)]. The rest of the book is spent with Jean Louise trying to comprehend her father's new views and it fizzles out after that. The ending of this was far too saccharine for my liking. TKAM was brutal at parts but there is no brutality in this book. It takes a fairly safe and maudlin approach to telling its story. I wouldn't call it bland but it is certainly quite vanilla.However, if we look past these minor qualms we still have a thoroughly enjoyable novel by one of the 20th century's most celebrated writers. Celebrate that. TKAM purists might hiss and groan at the mere existence of this book, but don't listen to them.

Take note of that order.Picasso once said of Cézanne that he was 'the father of us all'. Well, in similar terms, Dorothy Parker is my biological mother. Which makes me Picasso I guess, which I'll take.Parker's book s are the finest of the form. She was truly the queen of mean. As 'The Constant Reader' she praised and demolished the latest novels with such wit and grace that oftentimes the  was better than the work is discussed. She often filled her s with stories of her personal life or stray observations on society. Despite dying in 1967, her vicious tongue has never been equalled. I view Dorothy Parker as my greatest influence. As many people light candles in front of the Sacred Heart, I follow a similar regime with Parker, muttering incantations in front of her image and never gazing too long into her eyes.Thus The Portable Dorothy Parker is a volume which I believed would be a fitting replacement for the Holy Book. Which it somewhat is. In that it only gets really good near the end and you spend most of your time skipping over the bad bits.You see The Portable Dorothy Parker would be better titled The Short Stories of Dorothy Parker, interspersed by her Poetry with a paltry sampling of her Criticism, Reviews, Letters and Interviews. I am first to admit that I am not a huge fan of Parker's short stories. Don't get me wrong, she had many wonderful stories: Big Blonde, Arrangement in Black and White, The Waltz, From the Diary of a New York Lady and The Game are some shining examples. But almost five-hundred pages of this six-hundred page volume are dedicated to her stories, many of which are just not good. There's a reason why we don't immediately think 'short story writer' when we hear Parker's name. I feel the term 'hit and miss' was coined specifically for her short fiction. Those that hit are blinding critiques of early-20th century society, full of one-liners and characters which are equally as devastating. The misses are unreadable. Nothing much being written about nothing much. Therefore at time this volume is an absolute pain to get through, whilst at other times you want to rip each page out and frame them along a staircase.Most of my praise for this volume comes from the measly hundred pages dedicated to her non-fiction. This is where Parker Comes Alive! Such glittering meanness from the mouth of the poison Madonna. It depresses me so much. I'll never be her. The best I can do is plagiarise, which has served me quite well for many years. Sometime during my twenties I'll probably get a Dorothy Parker quote tattooed onto my skin, right next to my stigmata.Overall The Portable Dorothy Parker is a somewhat skewed collection of her finest writings. There is absolute gold in here, but one must sift through the mud first. Perhaps it is one for the fans....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,not set,"Feb 13, 2018","Jul 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44450.The_Portable_Dorothy_Parker

She didn't ask to be the most hyped name in contemporary British fiction. Yes, we all loved White Teeth, but that novel is coming up on its twentieth anniversary in a couple years and Smith has still yet to match it. NW is typical Smith fodder. A load of Londoners all grow up together, their lives take separate paths and we follow them as they sit around and talk about how things can never be like they were. Actually, now that I think of it, that describes all of her novels.One of the criticisms oft thrown at this novel is Smith's decision to go Vonnegut and present the book as a series of disjointed fragments. It doesn't work. I sound very formalist when I say this but a book should flow. Even in Vonnegut's most fragmented work, Cat's Cradle, which is a novel essentially told through paragraphs, he manages to make the whole thing flow as a steady narrative. Smith's attempt is just jarring and acts as a guard against the reader ever getting invested. It is like she was trying to keep us out of her novel.Things rarely ever happen in Smith's novels. That is not a criticism. I love a good book in which nothing happens. Beckett managed to make nothing happen twice in Godot. But in NW literally nothing happens. Most of the pages are populated by people just conversing. It's quite a dialogue-heavy novel and not much room is made for plot. Some of the few instances of plot which do occur are actually fine. I have no complaints there. Felix' chapter is the most plot-heavy and that is why it is the best part of the book. That whole section in itself could have been a fine short story.If there is one thing that Smith is actually good at it is portraying female friendship. Call me an utterly sappy bag of feathers but I found Leah and Natalie's friendship to be the backbone of the novel. I feel Smith herself also saw this in her novel and that is the reason why her next novel, Swing Time, was entirely based around two girls and their friendship (that's also the reason why Swing Time is a much better novel than NW). I found the very final pages to be really fantastic and I wish the whole novel could have lived up to them.I feel my relationship with Zadie Smith is the same relationship many men have with their favourite football teams. The follow them through thick and thin, even if they lose every game. There's always a sense that some day, maybe next season, they'll finish on top. We all live in hope. Over the years Smith has fallen deeper and deeper down the league table but I am not giving up on her. I know she has something great in her. I'm still placing my bets....more",Notes are private!,0,78,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2018","Jul 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18040714-nw

This reminded me of an aborted project that I planned some while back in which I was going to read the Rougon-Macquart novels but I never began.

The novel follows the story of Silvère and Miette – young lovers who are caught in the midst of violent coup d’état. However, this being Zola and the beginning of a twenty book cycle, the plot takes the back seat about fifty pages in and you must very slowly and meticulously read on as Zola attempts to explain the family tree of the Rougon-Macquart family. I know that sounds horrible but… it isn’t. Zola somehow makes genealogy interesting. It is a joy to learn about the origins of the Rougons and the dastardly Pierre and his siblings. Whilst the lineage actually takes up most of this novel, the plot is really wonderful despite its brevity. There are some passages that make you want to just die with their utter beauty.

More straight-forward than some of his previous novels, Dickens instead relies on verisimilitude rather than ridiculousness in order to tell this story. It is a pity as the more outrageous Dickens is, the more I enjoy him. However, despite this novel only receiving three-stars from me, it is still better than most novels ever written. It is only 'three-stars' within Dickens' own bibliography and not the greater Western canon. It probably would have been four-stars if he had included more chapters with Miss Mowcher....more",Notes are private!,1,159,1,not set,"Jan 18, 2018","Jul 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14800727-david-copperfield

Wodehouse was one of the most prolific authors of the 20th century. The jacket of my copy of Joy in the Morning (1946) states that he wrote ‘more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories’. Joy in the Morning features Wodehouse’s most popular creations, Jeeves and Wooster. I’m always apprehensive about comic novels. Many of them have dated horribly and some lampoon tropes that haven’t existed for decades. Jeeves and Wooster seems to have a timeless quality to them however. This is one of the reasons why Wodehouse is as popular today as he was during his heyday. Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed the word-play, the farce, and the utter ridiculousness of it all, I did have some reservations about Joy in the Morning.Here I present my opinion on Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is an intense character to read. I can only stay with him for a couple pages at a time before I wander off. For me, the Holmes novels don’t work. There’s too many pages and not enough content to keep me entertained. This is why I think the Holmes short stories are far superior, there’s no room for unnecessities or exposition. Jeeves and Wooster fell into this as well. Whilst the novel is a comic romp, it also hits the three-hundred page mark. Some people may never want Wodehouse novels to end but for me it ran out of stream in the middle. I felt that things were happening purely to aid a joke and not the plot. This may have only been a problem with Joy in the Morning however. All the other Wodehouses (Wodehomes?) may be perfectly balanced comic masterpieces. I don’t know. But I will try more because I’ve got a veritable lake of novels to choose from. And of course there isn’t just Jeeves and Wooster.

It is a narrative of man’s life, nothing else. The novel is also an insight into the mind of young Nabokov at a time before he became one of the greatest literary minds of the 20th century. It shows a writer who is concerned with telling a good story.

Beginning In this expansive anthology, Robert Chandler summarises the past three-hundred years of Russian poetry into a surprisingly tight 528 pages. Beginning with Gavrila Derzhavin and ending with Marina Boroditskaya, sixty-six Russian poets grace the pages of this book, all of whom sit around a rotunda at the centre of which Pushkin sits proudly.Prior to reading this collection my knowledge of Russian poetry was nil. Thankfully this book was written exactly for me: the absolute beginner. Chandler holds your hand as he weaves you through history, poet by poet, providing a small biography of each person as well as a handful of their work. Treat this book like a fan of paint swatches, investigating which shades you love, which shades you hate, and which ones clash horribly. Great emphasis is placed on Pushkin, as Pushkin is to Russian literature what Shakespeare is to English. Early sections are even titled for him. You begin 'Around Pushkin', you then move onto Pushkin himself, and you exit 'After Pushkin'. One may question the emphasis placed on Pushkin within this anthology, just as many are now questioning the centrality of Shakespeare within the English canon. But just by reading most of the poems presented to you by Chandler you will notice that Pushkin is the spectre which haunts nearly every single one of them. Any Russian poet worth their salt in the 19th and 20th centuries has a poem, or a series of poems, dedicated to Pushkin, such is his almost Christ-like status within Russian literature. Reading many of the poets' biographies one is also made aware of the sheer danger associated with calling oneself a poet in 20th century Russia. Apart from Pasternak, who died of lung cancer, practically every biography ends with, and I am greatly paraphrasing here, 'they died in a gulag'. It is somewhat miraculous that so much poetry even survives, given the dire condition in which much of it was created. As Lev Ozerov wrote of Shmuel Halkin 'poems piled up / a terrible burden / more dangerous, perhaps, than gunpowder'.This collection has introduced me to so many wonderful new names. In many ways it is a burden, as I now have to go out and buy collections by all of these new writers and my bookshelf will bow under the weight but at least the shelves will look like they're smiling....more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2018","Apr 05, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23215762-the-penguin-book-of-russian-poetry

Oh bAs someone who has read all of Ishiguro's previous works I was of course more than excited to finally get my hands on a copy of The Buried Giant. Oh boy, if only that excitement hadn't been sourly crushed by the actual contents of this novel. The Buried Giant is very different from all of Ishiguro's other novels. In fact it's so different that I can't even compare it to any of his previous novels. The main difference is of course that this is essentially a fantasy novel. Now I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit that I'm not a massive fan of the fantasy genre. I enjoy the occasional Terry Pratchett novel and I've dipped in and out of the Narnia universe but that's where my fantasy education ends. If there was any author who could get me excited about a fantasy novel, it was Kazuo Ishiguro. This novel is set in the 6th Century, contains references to ogres on the very first page and there's a Beowulfian quest involving a dragon. I'm very much out of my literary comfort zone. The novel begins with two characters, an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice. At first I really enjoyed these two. In fact I really enjoyed this novel. For, like, the first fifty pages. I really wished Ishiguro just stayed with these two. I enjoyed their company as they set off on a quest to find their son in another village. However, it's when a certain character from Arthurian legend turns up that this novel fell apart in my hands like wet cake. For the remaining 300ish pages this novel stops being Tolkien and turns into Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In fact, when this figure from folklore appears, this novel stops reading like literary fiction and starts reading like, well, fanfiction. At least that's how I felt. And I'm pretty sure Ishiguro didn't intend spending ten years writing Merlin fanfiction but here we are. Nobody was expecting this to be The Remains of the Day (ah, The Remains of the Day, where has the author who wrote you gone?) but since this is Ishiguro's first novel in ten years (with the exception of his rather enjoyable short story collection Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall from 2009) we deserve more from this. I want to burst into Ishiguro's study and shout, ""You wrote The Unconsoled and now you think you can pass off this sub-par fantasy novel as part of your oeuvre?!"". Listen Ishiguro, if you're reading this, I'm not as angry as I am after reading Never Let Me Go (that terrible, terrible novel that I'm still trying to forget) but ugh, you had ten years. Joyce wrote Ulysses in seven. Look Kaz, I just don't know anymore. Three stinkers in a row? (Don't think I've forgotten about When We Were Orphans) I just don't know what to do with you anymore.

Literally every single of those ""Reads to Look Out For in 2015"" lists has had this one near the top. I must admit that this is my first experience with July's writing. I know she has some short stories floating around somewhere so I'll catch them eventually. So, is The First Bad Man deserving of the hype? Yes. Or no actually. No, yes. Hmm. Maybe? Let's see. We are presented with Cheryl Glickman, our protaginist. A woman who Dave Eggers called, 'one of the most original, most confounding and strangely sympathetic characters in recent fiction.' I have a feeling that Eggers has been diagnosed with a severe case of hyperbole here. In many ways, Cheryl reminded me of a highly neurotic version of the protaginist of Jenny Offill's brilliant short novel Dept. of Speculation, one of the best novels of last year. I've seen many  of this novel describing Cheryl as ""quirky"". God I hate that word. I refuse to ever use it. Cheryl is highly individual, eccentric, and idiosyncratic. She's Frances Ha and Annie Hall. She gets dumped with her boss' daughter, ninteen-year-old Clee, and this is where the novel tries to begin. Not only does Cheryl, a woman in her early forties, have to deal with a teenager claiming squatter's rights on her sofa, she is also kind of obsessed with Phillip, a man who is twenty years her senior. However, Phillip has other, Nabokovian, plans. The first half of this novel middles along. It mainly concerns Cheryl's life and those around her. Nothing much happens. I might even go so far as to say the first half is boring. Well it isn't boring per se. To use Art Historical terms, the first half is Northern Renaissance and the second half is Rococo. The novel comes alive in the second half due to an event which inverts everything on its head. Suddenly you begin caring about the characters. You see their human side. It was in the second half that I really began enjoying this odd, odd novel. The plot is like that of the seminal classic Weird Science. At first it's great, partying with mid-1980s Kelly LeBrock but then you've got to deal with real issues. Like Bill Paxton being turned into a gigantic talking pile of shit.This novel is definitely weird. It's different. There isn't a single sane character in there. It's like an episode of Kath & Kim but also not like that at all. Margaret Atwood meets Woody Allen in this novel but not in the way you want. So, can we answer the question now? Is The First Bad Man worth the hype? I say, yes. Yes because it is unlike any other novel I've read. Yes because it makes you laugh at the most inappropriate of things. Yes because of the phrase ""mutual soaping"". Yes because it is a realistic portrayal of life, no matter how zany. Yes. It is worth the hype. ...more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,not set,"Feb 19, 2015","Feb 20, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24980019-the-first-bad-man

However, eventually the story does actually being at some point near the end and we are presented with an enjoyable and classic love story, Russian style (which is shorthand for death). Why would you read this? Well because it's basically Russian literature's equivalent of David Copperfield and the main character, Pechorin, is a whiny cunt. I mean he hates everything and is constantly complaining about women and life and life and women, he's basically the Russian Holden Caulfield but without the brother issues. I saw a lot of myself in Pechorin. Which worried me slightly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,not set,"Feb 16, 2015","Feb 20, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5986287-a-hero-of-our-time

Walsh is probably best-known for his play Disco Pigs, a frenetic two-hander written in a thick Cork dialect which on its opening night introduced Cillian Murphy to the world. It is the best play in this collection. It's a dazzling cacophony of Cork slang and nonsense slung at the audience at high speed. It's success is astounding, given the fact that much of it must be indecipherable to non-native ears. We follow Pig and Runt around Cork city as they grow apart. It's a love story for degenerates.Another highlight of this collection is Misterman which is a terrifying 90-minutes with a preacher and his tape recorders that makes Krapp's Last Tape look like Spike Jonze's Her.I found bedbound and The Small Things to be somewhat similar and flawed works. Both were struggles to finish I must admit, but I am sure they are far more engaging on stage.Chatroom is the final major play in here which I throughly enjoyed. However, despite only being written in 2005, it has aged very badly. The references to McFly and pre-breakdown Britney are unfortunate. Also the fact that the whole play is based on dialogue from an online chatroom, the kind of which just does not exist today ever since the boom of social media, makes it seem like something of a relic.Overall it is a fine collection of plays.

His comedic style is pretty much unrivalled on television today. So how well does his unique branch of humour translate to the page? Quite well actually, well, at least I thought so. Ayoade on Ayoade can be seen as a spoof, a mockery, a satire on those pretentious novel length interviews given by directors who only a handful of intellectuals have heard of and even fewer have actually witnessed their works. One that comes to mind is probably the most famous, Hitchcock by François Truffaut, although I greatly admire both Hitchcock and Trauffaut so I am clearly disgustingly hypocritical and I should be shot. This book is presented as a series of interviews given by Richard Ayoade to Richard Ayoade (hence the name stupid!). His quick-witted and subtle humour flows wonderfully throughout these interviews. However it's more than just that. It is entirely held together by a series of footnotes, in fact nearly half of the book is just footnotes. It would make David Foster Wallace proud but made navigating this book on my Kindle a task akin to Dante's journey through the Inferno. The footnotes are full anecdotes within themselves, made up of letters and diary entries and strange Pinteresque short film scripts.

See I read it maybe four years ago, I want to say, and I wasn’t the biggest fan. And ever since then I’ve had people constantly telling me just how wrong I was about The Secret History. ‘No, no, it’s a modern classic!’ they’d say to me. Or, ‘wow it seems exactly like the type of book you’d adore.’ And they’re right, it is exactly the type of book I’d adore. So why can I not bring myself around to loving it?The Secret History is very much a tale of two novels, the split between them coming when Bunny dies. And that isn’t a spoiler, we’re told in the first line that Bunny dies. The first book being the lead up and the second book being the aftermath, with the group just trying to deal with the fact that they actually killed Bunny. Once again, not a spoiler, we’re told on the first page that the group kill Bunny. And if you don’t like even the first pages of novels being spoiled then I suggest you should go outside more often.Side note: it’s rather depressing to read this novel when you’re the same age as the characters. I felt so under-read. But then I remembered they’re all fictional, so fuck them.The first book is actually quite good. It’s all wonderfully tense as the reader is just waiting for the murder to happen. The inverted murder mystery, which oftentimes does not work, works fantastically here and you wouldn’t be talked over if you referred to The Secret History as perhaps the best example of the whydunit genre. Then my biggest problem with the novel happens: the entire second half. What a fucking slog. Like, jesus. Okay Donna just because you’re writing about a funeral doesn’t mean that the novel itself has to become funereal. The whole book just becomes ‘oh aren’t we really sad!’ and ‘ugh it’s tough being murderers!’ And I think, tell me if I’m wrong here, I think Tartt expects us to sympathise with these fucking monsters. I mean, I’ve sympathised with murderers before. I think Aileen Wuornos had a fairly sound motive. The Unabomber made some good points. But this ragtag group of Enid Blyton rejects? Nah. Not a chance.So what do I think of The Secret History the second time around? Much the same as the first time really. I did enjoy some parts more, especially the first half. I’ll be kind, I’ll bump my star rating up one. Congrats Donna, I now think your first novel is perfectly average! I’m happy for us both.Oh, and isn’t Judy Poovey just the greatest name of a fictional character in the history of Western literature? Judy Poovey.

Well you begin on page one and you read all the words until it's finished.Or, you can just be Irish.I think that's the secretHow do you read Ulysses? Well you begin on page one and you read all the words until it's finished.Or, you can just be Irish.I think that's the secret. I've just finished Ulysses for the second time and I cannot recall any other book that's just as fun as Ulysses is. People will often call the novel difficult and challenging but that's a reading I just cannot abide by. I don't find Ulysses to be a particularly difficult novel to read. I actually struggle a lot more with other modernist writers, specifically Woolf and Lawrence. The two times I've read Ulysses I've done it quicker than it took me to get through Lady Chatterley's Lover.So I began questioning myself as to why this is. And I think the answers lays within who I actually am. I'm Irish.Joyce once said that if Dublin were to one day suddenly disappear from the Earth it could be entirely reconstructed from his book. And it is true that Joyce takes great pleasure in describing almost every step that Bloom takes. But then I think how, if you don't have a fairly solid familiarity with the streets of Dublin, not many of Bloom's journeys make sense. So, say that Bloom walks along Grafton Street from the Trinity side and goes left along Duke St., onto Dawson St., goes up to Molesworth St. and finds himself outside the Dail on Kildare St. To Joyce, and myself, that journey makes perfect sense in our heads and we can easily follow it because we both have walked that exact route many times. However, to someone who doesn't know Dublin, literally none of that made any sense. All of Ulysses is like this.Another example would be one of the many moments in the novel that made me audibly laugh. It's during the Circe episode which is this massive hallucination sequence that's written in play form. At one point the sound of a waterfall is heard and Joyce records its noise like this:The waterfall: Poulaphouca Poulaphouca Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.Get it? What? You mean you don't have a knowledge of the waterfalls of Ireland? Once again, all of Ulysses is like this.So why do I get all the references? Why do I find this novel so funny? Why didn't I want it to end and will likely read it again and again for my whole life? Am I so intellectually above all of you that only I, the great Barry, could understand all of Ulysses? No. It's cos I'm Irish.If you flick through an annotated edition of Ulysses you'll notice all the footnotes are simply just explaining the references. They're full of little explainers of who Michael Davitt was or Arthur Griffith or Charles Stewart Parnell. What a crubeen is and what's double X. What the Phoenix Park murders were and who the croppy boy is. Notes of which I need none, because I know all this, because I'm Irish. Ulysses is an Irish novel written by an Irish man for Irish people. Joyce steeped the whole thing in such Irishness that many of the dialects, the turns of phrase, the references, and the places make little sense to non-Irish people. The non-Irish in turn have to purchase massive annotated editions and reference guides in order to slowly trudge their way through the pages that Irish people wouldn't even have to pause on. It's from these non-Irish that we always hear that Ulysses is the most difficult novel.So if you aren't Irish and you tried to conquer Ulysses and you couldn't, don't feel bad, the book wasn't written for you. However, for us Irish, for whom Ulysses is our plaything, we'll keep holding it to our hearts forever....more",Notes are private!,0,322,2,"Aug 10, 2019not set","Aug 14, 2019Dec 2014","Dec 27, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10545.Ulysses

The Member of the Wedding is a subtle but loud novel.

It's right in the middle of what I like to call his forgotten period which is made up of three books, written consecutively, which I think are commonly ignored; Barnaby Rudge, Martin Chuzzlewit, and Dombey and Son. This novel is interesting because a lot of it actually takes place in America, as opposed to England. It's written from Dickens' personal voyage to the States in the months prior to writing this novel. And guys, oh my god, Dickens rips the shit out of America. He says he gave a ""satirical"" view of the US but guys, Dickens basically mocks America and Americans and it's honestly the best thing. There's also a great perspective on slavery and the deep South in this novel (spoilers: Dickens' doesn't tolerate either).Why the average rating then Barry? Well, because the second-half of this novel exists. They come back from America and then it turns into a murder mystery. It's honestly as if Dickens' just stitched on a completely different novel to the end of this book. Eh, it's kinda disappointing but this is what you get with serialised novels. Overall, I liked this novel though. The America bits and the scathing social commentary make up for the saggy second half.

The Double was written when Dostoyevsky was only 25 while Notes from Underground and his other major works were written when he was in his 40s and 50s. He was clearly not a wunderkind. Even at the beginning of this Penguin edition it even notes that The Double was not successful when it was first published. I can hardly wonder why. It's so boring that it gives solitary confinement a run for its money.

Dickens has decided to do a historical novel, meaning that some of the events of this novel actually happened in real life. The only problem is that the events that are covered in ""Barnaby Rudge"" really aren't that well known anymore. The novel takes place during the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots of 1780 (I mean everyone's heard of them right? Right? *crickets chirp*). There's basically a series of riots because the Protestants aren't happy (as always). The plot is very dry and historical and really does feel like you're reading a history book at some points. The characters are classic Dickensian characters. Just like in ""Oliver Twist"", Barnaby Rudge is very much a secondary character despite his name being eponymous with the title.

Actually, no. A true tangent has to touch the circle at one point. Tristram completely bypasses the circle. This is a novel about a man trying to write a novel. However, he is quite easily distracted. Just when there's a bare semblance of a plot, Tristram goes off on a reel about something else. For example: Tristram tries to write about his birth, he goes slightly off-topic, we finally witness his birth around page 150.For some, this novel would be absolute hell. And at points, I was of that mindset. But then Sterne would come through with some of the most ridiculous and hilarious scenes that all is eventually forgiven. There are chapters in here that are some of the funniest I've ever read (Tristram's accidental circumcision for example). And these parts really prop up the entire novel. It is first and foremost a farce and a social satire, or a cock and bull story.If you are thinking of tackling Tristram Shandy then in the words of the Scouts: be prepared.

What I didn't know was that there was a very small, sharp root sticking out of the ground at the base of the tree. It went through my cheek. I went to the ER but had to wait until 2am because it was a busy night. I sat there for hours in that ER with a hole in my cheek. When the doctor finally saw me he thought that since it was a busy night and there were so many people in the ER that he would just sew up my cheek without having to wait for an anesthetic. And he did. He sewed my cheek back together with no pain relief. I have never experienced pain like that again in my life. Until now. Anna and the French Kiss was more painful than that night in hospital. It is a lifeless, desolate, lump of a novel. Its only purpose in this world is as a gauge by which we measure bad novels. This is the bottom of the gauge and Twilight is at the top. Anna is the stupidest person I've ever come across in fiction. She is a self confessed film buff and hopes to one day become America's leading film critic. She obviously must know A LOT about film then eh? *sigh* She's a supposed film buff but yet knows nothing of Paris. PARIS. The home of fucking film. At one point in the novel she is genuinely SURPRISED that Paris has cinemas. FUCKING CINEMAS. How can she be so incredibly ignorant of the place where film was fucking invented and know literally nothing of French cinema BUT YET call herself a fan of film? Ridiculous. She eventually actually goes to the cinema a couple of times but lo and behold what does she watch? American films. She in the home of film and she watches American films.

He's American BUT has a British accent, he has messy hair BUT his room is meticulously clean, he's book smart, smells nice and is probably the Second Coming of Christ. He is UNBEARABLE. He's like Augustus Water but this guy doesn't have the common courtesy to die at the end. How rude.I hated everything about this novel. It felt unresearched, rushed, and in places, dumbed-down. It is written in a style that I can only describe as ""unemployed Sex and the City screen writer"". I wish this novel came with a warning, ""Keep out of reach of children, and teenagers, and adults, dogs, garden gnomes, your grandmother, school janitors, priests, gibbons, and especially anybody who lives in Paris because this novel is an insult to their city"".I'll finish with a quote from one of my favourite film critics Roger Ebert (who gets a mention in this novel and I'm pretty sure he's turning in his grave because of it). I'll manipulate the quote a bit but the sentiment still prevails. ""This book doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This book isn't the bottom of the barrel.

I first read Where Angels Fear to Tread about four years ago and my original  is presented below (god I was so shit at 's' back then why did none of you tell me!?)What I can glean from my second reading of Where Angels Fear to Tread is that I enjoyed it more this time. I recall being quite bored with it the first time around but this time my boredom was replaced by amusement. I also appreciated the more farcical nature of the novel too. It brilliantly captures the fin de siècle folly of going on the Grand Tour and the type of people who took such a journey. However while I think that Where Angels Fear to Tread is a fun send-up of the upper-classes and their strive to keep up appearances, I do not think it is anything more than that.What confuses me about the novel is its tone. What exactly was Forster going for? There are many moments of light comedy and it could also be called something of a comedy of manners but there are also some truly horrific moments of tragedy. To call the book comic would be crass but to call it tragic would be disingenuous. There is also the problem of Forster introducing a cast of interesting characters in the first chapter, only to slowly shed them all as the narrative progresses.I don't think I'm going to change my rating on this one. Last time I gave it two stars because I was bored, this time I am giving it two stars because it just isn't that great of a novel. I get what Forster was doing here. It's a valiant first attempt. But there's a reason why we still discuss Howards End and A Room With A View but not Where Angels Fear to Tread.Original  from July 2014I expected more from Forster. Well, to be honest, this was his first novel and isn't one that is talked about all that much. There's obviously a reason for that.

O_O This novel is Joycean in its prose and sad/tragic/melancholy/pessimistic/nihilistic/lachrymose in its plot. However, the one thing that everybody's talking about with this novel is how it's written. The only novel I can possibly compare this to is Finnegan's Wake. At first the prose is an enigma and that may put some people off immediately but eventually you get used to the frenetic, stream of conciousness style. I'd like to say that the prose is a revelation in modern writing BUT the problem with it is that it does, at points, effect the narrative. If the prose ever gets in the way of conveying the plot then that's a big no-no. Sadly that happens way too often in this novel. There are part of this where you're just thinking, ""I have no idea what's going on here"". However, that's fine I think. Nobody's ever going to fully understand what's going on in this novel, just like how people are still finding new things in ""Ulysses"" almost 100 years after its publication.

I do feel that Zooey went on for a bit too long however. Spending that much time with Salinger's characters can be a bit trying (hence the universal hate of Holden Caulfield). I feel that this is the weakest of his work that I've read thus far though. I still think Catcher is his greatest work, followed by Nine Stories. However I would still recommend this collection. It contains some of Salinger's best writing and furthers the melancholic chronicle of the Glass family.

I mean, did you honestly think I wasn't going to like The Picture of Dorian Gray? It's by Oscar Wilde for fuck's sake. His prose is like spilled honey flowing across a wooden table and waterfalling onto the floor beneath. The viscous liquid flowing slowly over the edge. His plot, perfectly paced, moves slowly as we wade deeper and deeper into Dorian Gray's maniacal life. Over the edge we go as everything goes wrong, there's death, there's pain, there's long conversations about art. We hit the floor as we finish and we see nothing but sweetness amassing around us as we escape from Wilde's prose. Putting the book down you see the light has hit the stream and it glows and it shines and it sparkles and you stand there mesmorised by what you're witnessing and you put the book back on your shelf and feel sorry for the book you read next.

My  from two and a haI decided to re-read this because its white spine always calls my attention next to the black spines of Austen and Brontë. My  from two and a half years ago, to paraphrase Talking Heads, seems to talk a lot but not say anything. The Edible Woman was Atwood's first novel, and thus I must treat it like a first novel. Atwood was twenty-six when she wrote this, and it reads like it. The novel presents itself as a tale of a women who is faced with the awful prospect of marriage. The thought of her imminent nuptials causes Marian, our protagonist, to start viewing foods as living entities. It first starts with meat, Marian can only see the animal it once was on her plate. Then it becomes far worse. She cannot eat carrots because she can only imagine the great pain it must have caused them to be ripped from the ground. She peers into a boiled egg and all she sees is a yellow eye staring back at her (very Bataille!). For Marian, eating any food at all becomes a sort of cannibalism.However, I wish that this is what the novel actually is. The actual 'edible woman' part of The Edible Woman does not happen until roughly two-thirds into the novel. Instead, most of this novel is just us following Marian as she goes to work, or visits to the launderette, or goes from door to door asking people to fill out surveys. It can get boring and it puts you in the strange position of actually wanting Marian to hurry up and have her mental breakdown already. Thankfully Atwood created the character of Ainsley, Marian's flatmate, who decides that she wants to have a baby but only so she can raise it herself away from the damaging influence of a father figure. Due to these kind of themes throughout the novel, Atwood has referred to the book as a proto-feminist work. I suppose Ainsley could be seen as a precursor to Val from Marilyn French's The Women's Room. The most disappointing aspect of this novel however is where it ends up going. I cannot discuss this part in detail as it would be a spoiler but, for those who have read it, I detest Duncan.So, after my re-read I've decided to take a star away from my original . It is now a two-star novel, meaning it's alright but I don't recommend unless you're an Atwood completest.Original  from 3/1/15Well this is a novel that is fecund with originality. I really enjoyed this. Basically imagine if The Bell Jar was actually good and readable, then you'd have this. I really admire Atwood's decision to switch between third- and first-person narration. It's very clever and works marvellously. In fact this whole novel is very clever and marvellous.

There is no mind-bending science fiction or metafictional madness. Instead we have the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American accused of being a Nazi due to his radio broadcasts from Germany during the war. He was actually a US counter-spy leaking Nazi secrets to the US but that little caveat is not well-known, so he is now sitting writing his memoirs in a jail cell in Israel awaiting his trail for war crimes.Oh and this book is comic. Even Eichmann is in here cracking jokes. The overall tone of the novel is typically Vonnegutian but it is a departure. Campbell is an odd character to be stuck with for 176 pages. I found him somewhat uncomfortable to be around. Then of course there is the chance that since this novel was written essentially as a confession before Mossad that everything in it could be a lie. Maybe Campbell was a Nazi. We'll never know.I've been somewhat critical of Vonnegut's penchant for fractures narratives before. This short novel is split into 45 sections, most not lasting more than two pages. Vonnegut loved doing this. But whereas I felt that it somewhat ruined the experience of reading Cat's Cradle, here it works quite well. Don't ask me how. I just feel this book flows better.As you can see I am struggling to write about this book. Something which happens with every Vonnegut novel (oh I've just had a sudden flashback to trying to discuss Vonnegut's uses of metafiction in Breakfast of Champions in one of my final exams of university).

I find solace in the Russians, they make death seem like a mild disturbance in the beauty of life. Also their difficult is mere codswallop, the only difficult thing about Russian lit is the names. That's it. Crime and Punishment is the story of a crime and its eventual punishment. That's it. End of . Or not. It's really the story of a crime, followed by more crime, with a sprinkling of just a bit more crime, and then finished off with a tad of punishment. The main character (I'm literally too lazy to try to type out his name) is a really fascinating character to study. I mean, yeah he's psychologically warped and is a bit ""Oh I murdered someone but you should feel sorry for me anyway"", however I always seem to find likable traits in even the most monstrous of characters (I still to this day stand up for Humbert Humbert). I just feel that I want to find someone else who's read this and sit down and talk for hours about the main character. To use a Russian motif, he's a matryoshka doll of a character. Like I felt with Emma Bovary in Madame Bovary, Raskolnikov (there I actually typed out his name) is kind of more interesting than the novel itself. Don't get me wrong, this novel is great and all but I just loved Raskolnikov. I could harp on about all the themes and plots in this vast novel but I like keeping my Goodreads s brief. Basically, I thought this was hella good and I totally need to read more Dostoyevsky. I highly recommend this novel as well, so read it guys! Don't be scared.

It is a book made up entirely of footnotes. In the beginning, we are presented with a poem, a 999-line poem called Pale Fire. The ""novel"" part of this ""novel"" resides in the commentary and footnotes on this poem. Nabokov constructs an entire narrative, complete with rounded characters and locations, within the line-by-line commentary of the poem. It is wonderful. I cannot sing its praises any higher. Like in Lolita we are introduced to a less than admirable, unreliable narrator Charles Kinbote. Slowly he begins his commentary on his friend's poem, Pale Fire. However, as the footnotes pile up, we stray further and further away from academic citation and we are plunged into Kinbote's megalomaniacal and deranged mind. Like Alice down the rabbit hole, we have nothing to grab and the darkness evades every word. Pale Fire is a true masterpiece. The quintessential anti-novel. Its utter subversion of what we know as literature can only be comparable to Joyce's Ulysses.

Good old Agatha. This is a Miss Marple story... well... I think it is, because our beloved Miss Jane Marple is in fact missing from quite a lot of this novel. Thankfully the crime is exciting enough for us to overlook that minor setback. It's a classic Christie, foolproof and sturdy plot with a cast of both memorable and useless characters. However there are scenes in this that I did find rather... graphic... for your typical Christie novel. I won't spoil it but there is a scene set in a quarry and it is quite out there for Agatha.

I love ""The Vicar of Dibley"", ""French & Saunders"" and her little watched gem ""Roger and Val Have Just Got In"". The cover of his book promises a ""side-splitting, darkly humourous"" experience but, I didn't get that (maybe because that  is from Heat magazine...). Oh Dear Silvia started off promisingly with a unique characterisation (the main character being in a coma for the whole novel) and a unique narrative structure (each chapter is from the perspective of a different character)and that was great fun, for about 100 pages. Sadly, this book is 400 pages long. This unique style of story would be a fantastic novella but I really think French couldn't handle the length (that's what she said). If I was the editor I would have said, ""Dawn, I want it to be 250 pages max and cut half of the characters, there's NINE different characters each of which have their own perspective, too many"". (Although my most common complaint about most books is that their too long...) I really expected it to be much funnier, as I said, I LOVE her TV work, but I don't feel that she conveyed her natural hilarity on paper (literally, Dawn French writes all of her novels BY HAND with a pencil!). Who would I recommend this to? Well, it's aimed at women aged between 35-60 so probably them. I mean, French went on to Loose Women to advertise this book, Loose Women. All in all, it was a nice palate cleanser after my month of classics and I only really picked it up because of the author but it's alright, it's not brilliant but it's definitely not terrible either.

Orwell's stance on the English language is the same as mine, the language is fine the way it is, stop changing it! However, I do disagree with Orwell on one thing. Orwell states that one should should never use complicated words. He says that if you think if writing a big, complicated word but there is a plain simple English version of the word, you should use the simple version, e.g. if I were to use the word ""perambulate"" (which means walking back and forwards) in a composition, I should just use ""walk back and forwards"" as ""perambulate"", is to Orwell, pretentious and unnecessary. However, I find that if we stopped using all of the big, unusual, complicated, words and used plain, simple prose instead, we would lose such a beautiful and interesting part of the language. That's my only criticism of the essay. I agree with Orwell on all other points. The  of Mein Kampf at the end is just brilliant, it's really quite reminiscent of Chaplin's put-down of Hitler in The Great Dictator. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jul 14, 2013","Jul 14, 2013","Jul 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17118901-politics-and-the-english-language

I'll buy a book tomorrow but I probably won't read it for at least a year. I don't know why I do this because, as is the case with this novel, I seem to be putting off reading books that I quite enjoy.This is the first book I've read this year which teeters on the edge between the three and four star rating. I enjoyed all the characters in here. Of course I loved Renée. I saw a lot of myself in her. Which is odd because she is a French woman in her fifties. I also liked little Paloma even if her knowledge is quite unrealistically beyond her years. But what do I know? Maybe all twelve-year-old French girls have a throughout understanding of the psychoanalytical studies of Freud, the works of Tolstoy, and Cartesian phenomenology. It's a great cast, in fact every character in this novel is ostentatiously pretentious and it is WONDERFUL. Reading through s on here I see that a lot of people are complaining that this novel is full of baffling philosophical musings. I perhaps have an advantage here because I have literally just finished a year of studying philosophy in university so I was somewhat familiar with the concepts and names that Renée was dropping. However I do wish that in her accounts of William of Ockham that Barbery would have used his famous razor to cut down some of her dry and overlong ramblings.So yeah, this has been one of the most enjoyable books I've read thus far this year. The level of pretentiousness was right up my alley (*winky emoji*). It definitely has one of the most perfect endings to a novel that I've read in recent months and for that I applaud it. However I did feel that it lacked depth and heart, I blame this on the stilted half-epistolary/half-first-person narrative style that Barbery employs. Overall, I would recommend it to people. Well... people who'd understand the allusions and references peppered throughout the novel.

I found it kind of boring, not Hemingway boring, but just dragged out. Mr. Darcy has become such a famous character over the years and I was surprised to see how little he was in the novel! It was odd. Some criticisms:1. I found that this had too many characters for a 350 page novel. First you have to remember the names of the five sisters, then all of the Lords and Ladies from around the area, then the men of the novel, all of the houses and estates around the area, it was too much! 2. I couldn't believe any of the male characters. It's as if Austen had set out to make the most unrealistic men in fiction. Yes, I do know that this novel is very cliche, but that's because this novel invented the cliche of ""men you'd love to hate but can't"". I think this criticism is mainly because I'm reading this from a male point of view. Maybe women like those characters, I don't know, but I just couldn't believe them. I still liked this novel though. I definitely don't hate it. It's a perfectly fine book to read and enjoy. I must say I loved Mr. and Mrs. Bennet the most. They were the comic relief this novel needed! This is lots of people's favourite book (including my English teacher) and I get why that is.

This novel takes so many disturbing leaps that I can only applaud the fact that this thing got published in its current form.

Eustace is back again but this time a girl named Jill joins him. Thankfully none of the Pevensie are in this one so that’s probably why I enjoyed it so much. Eustace and Jill meet Aslan who says “Uh about 80 years have passed and Caspian’s really old now and his son’s been kidnapped so go find him BYE! oh and btw I’m Jesus”. This book has everything that makes Narnia great. After a series of middling-to-boring novels (The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) The Silver Chair is such a breath of fresh air. Puddleglum is a wonderful character who nearly carries this novel on his spindly shoulders and Jill is a welcome female voice in this less than feminist series. At the current rate this is the second best book of the series, I just wonder why Lewis took so long to get here....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 27, 2016","Feb 28, 2016","Feb 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/65648.The_Silver_Chair

I read the first one (The Magician’s Nephew) over Christmas of 2013 and I’ve been working through the seven books on-and-off since. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the fifth book in the series but not one of the best. The introduction of Eustace as a character is one of the the series’ highlights because he is possibly the only child character who isn’t punchably irritating. Lewis ditches Peter and Susan in this book because they’re probably too busy shagging and buying lipstick and leaves us with Lucy and Edmund, the shit ones. Anyway they all get into Narnia via a painting and they find themselves on the Dawn Treader with a giant mouse and yer man from the last book. It follows the same formula as all the others, something bad has happened, Aslan is like “I’m Jesus” and the children must save Narnia once again. I got bored of this one quite quickly. I think it’s because Prince Caspian is such a boring character and he’s on nearly every page of this. I was utterly disappointed with it.

Frank McCourt’s story of growing up in the slums of Limerick received nothing but astonishing praise upon its publication, even Michiko Kakutani raved about it. Exploiting the fact that McCourt was born in the US, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Memoir in 1997. My copy once belonged to my grandmother who apparently received it for “Xmas 1999” according to my aunt’s inscription on the title page. The story is an extraordinarily bleak one. If abusive fathers and cot death aren’t your thing then I doubt you’ll get much out of this. McCourt’s genius however lies in his ability to write about the most heartbreaking of subjects and then make you cry with laughter on the very next page. It’s very Irish of him to be able to bring humour to poverty and death. I’m not sure if I can say I “enjoyed” this novel, it is aggressively melancholy, but I appreciate and applaud it.
