I am in love with family sagas and with tracing back our families' experiences that ripple back to us. Acevedo takes her poetry genius and puts into amazing prose that you bite into and is delicious! The book drips with words and sentences that leave you breathless. This book begins with Flor watching a documentary and getting inspired to have a living wake. This sends the whole family of four sisters and daughters into a tizzy because Flor has a gift! She's able to predict when someone will die! Does this mean that Flor has seen her own death or is this just a celebration of her life as she's said? This living wake pulls the rug under her sisters, Pastora, Matilde, and Camila who must now confront their own past and current journeys. Matilde with a philandering husband who has shown his true colors since their wedding night, Pastora who had a difficult relationship with her mother (to say the least) and was punished for things beyond her control, and Camila, the baby of the family, who was spared the cruelty of her mother and lives an affluent life unknown to the other sisters but deals with feeling like an outsider to their circle. Each of the sisters and the next generation has gifts that are weaved into this story of a Dominican-American family who survives and thrives a myriad of experiences, all while showcasing a sisterly love that I hadn't read quite like this before. A MUST READ! We are so blessed to live in the time of Acevedo....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jun 19, 2023","Jun 27, 2023","Dec 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62949033-family-lore

My literary voyeur heart loved being a fly in the wall as Cara Romero se desahogaba in her sessions and how she uncovered her story, her flaws, her traumas, and her revelations as each session progressed.

I will greatly miss her charla, how she views the world, and how she's so wiling to make mistakes and grow.
