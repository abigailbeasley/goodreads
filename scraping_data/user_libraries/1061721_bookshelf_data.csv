No matter the outcome: Kill us…kill us all.” In Northern California a military research facility is blown up along with its staff in order to contain the experiments within. The precautions fail however, unleashing a deadly cloud that destroys everything it touches. Bad weather coupled with a lack of information has bureaucrats looking at a possible nuclear option. Sigma Force must now find a cure, traveling as far afield as the Amazon rainforest and Antarctica for answers and a cure. The book is part of a series but can be read as a stand-alone. There will be references to past exploits and characters that can be confusing if you haven’t read the previous books but it doesn’t detract from the plot.As well I appreciated how much the book leaned on real science for the foundation of the plot, addressing the ethical issues that can arise in the face of new technology as well as showing what happens when morality isn’t a consideration. For readers looking for an explanation of terms there is an entire section in the Author’s Note dedicated to expanding on the locations, history and science cited.The main problem I had with the book was balance. While the book doesn’t drag in terms of plot, which is appreciated, it’s so long and unrelenting in terms of action that it gives readers no room to breathe. Rollins weaves multiple storylines together to create a complex plot but at times we jump around too much to stay grounded with one chapter being only five pages long. Also almost every chapter ended on a cliff-hanger which while exciting, also became predictable and exhausting. The pace of action never lagged but at over 500 pages it was a slog to reach the end.It was an entertaining read that immediately grabs the reader and doesn’t let go. With a story and secrets that span centuries, this book will keep you on your toes until the very end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Dec 2017,"Jan 14, 2018","Jan 14, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/18655866-the-6th-extinction

We begin with the creation of Constantinople, designated as the new capital of the Roman Empire. This decision would echo down through the centuries, dividing the Empire into East and West along religious and economic lines. Throughout this timeline Norwich provided an account of Byzantine Emperors who inherited the tradition of their Roman counterparts with marriage and the ever-present problems of heirs as a central concern of their lives.It was interesting to see how people or events decades or even hundreds of years in the past could influence people, places and the decisions in the present. One issue was that at times the book seemed at times to be overly detailed. This may be because this is a condensed version of an original trilogy. Instead of allowing the reader room to breathe or elaborating on events and their effects, the story just plows on with its unending list of dates and people. This invariably leads to confusion as in numerous family names are passed down through the generations, causing the reader to be unsure as to who did what when. Ultimately though, the book is the story of the slow and sad decline of the Roman Empire. The transition of the capital gave the empire a new name but instead of expanding on the traditions and imperial ambitions of Rome, land, respect and wealth is slowly lost. Through mismanagement and poor-decision making by incompetent rulers who obtained power through inheritance or usurpation rather than by merit, the Byzantine Empire is only a frail shadow when Constantinople is finally overrun in 1453....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,Jan 2017not set,Jan 2017not set,"Aug 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6106.A_Short_History_of_Byzantium

In 1916 World War I, while raging, had devolved to attrition in the trenches. Any news received from the front for public consumption was censored, sanitized and reframed in such a way that most people on the home front had no idea what conditions were really like. Fortunately soldiers kept diaries, providing first-hand accounts of their own experiences. RH Rabjohn was one such soldier, signing up at 18 with the Canadian Expeditionary Force. In possession of an arts background he put his skills to use, illustrating what he saw, seeing action in such battles as Vimy Ridge, Arras and Passchendaele. His drawings have a kinetic feel to them, most with figures in motion whether on the clock or on leave. But he doesn’t shy away from death or the aftermath of battle. These scenes provide a real sense of the horror he and others must have experienced, a true telling of the cost of war. The book is divided up chronologically in terms of battles and locations, allowing the reader to see what Rabjohn did and where he was. This is further divided into categories such as “mud” and “POWs”. The book is clearly an abridged version of the diary but it’s unclear if only sections with accompanying illustrations were included or if the choice was random. One confusing aspect was the font choice. Alongside the diary entries are additional notes written by the book’s author. The entries though use a more modern font while the author’s contributions look more archaic. Normally I would have expected this to be reversed to reflect and reinforce the differing time periods in which Rabjohn and Wilson wrote. The fact that this isn’t the case, sometimes led me to start reading Wilson’s portions as if they were Rabjohn’s. Overall an enjoyable read that provided a personal look into one soldier’s experiences, peeling back the layers of time on events quickly receding into history....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 11, 2017","Aug 12, 2017","Aug 13, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30724758-a-soldier-s-sketchbook

Christopher McCandless was looking for something akin to this when he left home in 1991, to follow in the footsteps of his heroes who had done the same. He was a man in search of purpose, leaving behind his family, law school and $25 000 in savings. McCandless’ wandered through towns and jobs, drifting wherever his whims took him, making friends under his pseudonym Alexander Supertramp, seemingly having left behind even his own name to this new endeavour. Krakauer pieces his journey together through fragments where intent and purpose are obscured by interviews and guesswork, eventually landing us in Alaska. Urgent to see the world and experience its truth as he never had in his sheltered life, he set off without proper equipment or training, both of which would likely have saved his life but a combination of arrogance and naiveté put him at a disadvantage. As well he never learned the most important fact for those leaving the big city for the wilderness. Nature bats last. While a fascinating read the book felt padded. In comparison to Into Thin Air which didn’t lack for details, Kraukauer tells this story years later and from the outside. The personal touch is lacking here and thus doesn’t have the same impact, leaving the reader wanting. Ultimately the end of McCandless’ journey and the end of the book coincide, leaving the reader reflecting on the fragility of life and the random events that, while alone would have been minor inconveniences but together, culminated in his tragic death....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 06, 2017","Apr 09, 2017","Aug 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1845.Into_the_Wild

There is a softness to Lee’s writing and a melancholy that hangs over the book. The stories themselves give the impression that there is a before and after to each world, with the text nestled in between. It speaks to the skill of the author that Lee was able to populate worlds that are larger on the inside. The reader only dips in for a short moment in the lives of the characters but details in description and dialogue create the idea that events will continue to unfold long after the story is over. The endings however all have a truncated feel to them and rather than creating a desire for more content, it left me with the idea that they were incomplete or rushed.Also the unity of voice throughout the stories was appreciated because they helped to create a cohesiveness to the book overall. But this also meant there was a tedious repetition to the protagonists in each story to the point where it was difficult to distinguish between them. It created the question of whether the stories were in some way connected as each was told through a first person perspective with themes of deception, academia, familial discord and writing. It appeared to be too much of a coincidence to keep finding similar ideas throughout each story but perhaps that was the reason for them to be collected together in this manner. Instead the only variance appeared to be in length of story. A wide array of characters and plots would have done more to showcase Lee’s range and abilities.

This is interspliced with the story of a modern day family with each section relating to a parable within the Peregrine sections.Wilcock has a soft way of writing, with diction that gives a warm, comfortable feel to the story. This, coupled with a variety of rounded characters that aren’t all likeable, creates a richness in each vignette. Thankfully this book can serve as a standalone, allowing readers to jump in at any point in the series. Thanks to Wilcock’s references to earlier events, it’s not necessary to have read the first book in the Hawk and Dove series to understand characters or setting.One concern was the form. This book would have been better served if it had only focused on Father Peregrine. Every time the story switches back to present day, it loses tension being less interesting than the adventures of Peregrine. Currently they interrupt the narrative flow and pull the reader out of the story. The message of the vignettes are obvious enough that nothing would have been lost if these sections were eliminated. Ultimately the best parts of the book are the scenes with Father Peregrine. While the world is populated with unique characters and personalities, it’s Peregrine that we identify with the most. He is the most interesting of all the monks with his struggle with his own body and how he interacts with the world and the people around him. Again and again he must use his sharp mind rather than a strong body to defend himself and navigate the world. If you’re interested in watching a man outsmart others on brainpower alone and spread compassion wherever he can, check out this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Mar 2017,Mar 2017,"Mar 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23229109-the-wounds-of-god

Herein lies the Sword of Shannara.Shea Ohmsford doesn’t know it yet but he’s the most important person in the world. As the last descendant of Jerle Shannara he’s the only person capable of wielding the Sword of Shannara, an ancient weapon that can destroy the Warlock Lord. Unfortunately this makes him a target, forcing him to flee home and confront his destiny. It will be obvious to anyone who has read The Lord of the Rings that this is close to a carbon copy for the first few hundred pages. Shea is joined by a disparate group of heroes consisting of humans, elves, a wizard and a dwarf and it’s easy to recognize their parallel counterparts in LOTR. Allanon is clearly a Gandalf remix as Balinor is for Aragorn. Palance is a mix of Denethor and Theoden, Stenmin is Wormtongue, Orl Fane is Gollum. Shea and Flick Ohmsford are Frodo and Sam, Menion is Legolas, Hendel is Gimli, etc. As well there are various plot points that are similar as well. There’s a chosen one, a reluctant hero, a fake death, a dangerous lair and a magical device capable of defeating pure evil.But while Tolkien clearly inspired aspects of plot and character, Brooks does put his own personal spin on the story. There are a variety of settings accompanied by good description that creates solid imagery for the reader. As well, the backstory for this world is only hinted at but is enough to understand a cataclysm befell Earth thousands of years ago and shows that previous decisions are responsible for current events.The story is fast-paced and keeps the reader on their toes as circumstances can change within the space of a paragraph. That said at times it’s at the expense of character growth. Menion seemingly falls in love in the space of several days and there’s no reunion scene with Flick, Allanon and Eventine after the elf king’s rescue which could possibly have been a great scene. Several times throughout the story the plot will leapfrog over what appear to be great setups for dialogue or exposition that could further the plot. These missed opportunities are a shame considering how many characters Brooks has that require good progression and development....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,Dec 2016not set,"Jan 20, 2017not set","Mar 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15575.The_Sword_of_Shannara

Having departed along with his eldest son in search of the fabled city of “Z” in 1925 he was never heard from again. His absence resulted in various rescue expeditions with most invariably vanishing into the jungle, possibly leading to the deaths of up to 100 people with no one any closer to discovering the fate of Percy’s last expedition. Cut to 2009 when journalist David Grann also falls under the spell of Fawcett and the Amazon. He too lands in the jungle, determined to find out truth. Much like “Into Thin Air”, author David Grann divides the book up into his own adventures and a history of Fawcett’s. This helps provide a background on the explorer as well as the challenges and perils of the Amazon.Fawcett is a surprising character and largest than life. He was apparently the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s character Professor Challenger in “The Lost World”. On expeditions he appeared practically immune to the diseases and illnesses that plagued his companions. Luck and speed helped bolster his reputation, earning him a Founder’s medal and a well-respected name among the Royal Geographical Society as an Amazonian expert.His travels though were interrupted by World War I and he spent years planning and dreaming of finding traces of a lost civilization in the jungle on the same scale as Machu Picchu. All the while he’s getting older, technology is shrinking the world and he’s being slowly but inexorably pushed out of his field by men with degrees in the emerging field of modern anthropology.The book was engaging despite the interruption in narrative to switch between Fawcett and Grann’s stories. It was also interesting to see how expeditions and the jungle changed over time due to the evolution of technology and modernization.

Any person who would seriously consider it is almost by definition beyond the sway of reasoned argument.”Jon Krakauer, journalist for the adventure magazine Outside, was hired to document an expedition to Mt. Everest in 1996. What he couldn’t know was that by the end of the expedition, eight people would be dead and he would be left with a very different story than what he originally planned. We begin with the victory of Krakauer summiting the mountain, quickly followed by ominous words that presage what’s to come. But instead of heading straight into the disaster we know is coming, we’re given a history lesson on Mt. Everest instead. The book provides a mass of information on the dangerous of climbing and what summiting Everest requires in terms of equipment and fortitude. It also touches on Mallory and Irvine and Hillary and Norgay, building a solid foundation on the history of the mountain and how climbing has evolved over the years. Today it’s a commercial operation where inexperienced clients can add to the risk of climbing, endangering not only themselves but also guides and Sherpas.In stories where the outcome is already known the ‘what’ becomes less important than the ‘why’ and ‘how’. Before reading this book I already knew it involved death and that things were going to go very wrong for a large number of people trying to ascend the mountain. This left me to discover the details around the larger story. Told in hindsight, it creates a growing anxiety as an accumulation of small problems and mistakes leads our climbers towards a slow but inevitable plod towards doom. It was unnerving, knowing some of the people I was reading about would never go home, that I was essentially reading about ghosts. Finishing this book I was left with one question. What is a human life worth? I already knew the story was a tragedy but I had no idea how the actions of some climbers would horrify and depress me. The actions and mistakes made along the way were one thing but to discover that climbers were left for dead, that others passed them by on the way to the summit or believed they were beyond help was sickening. It seemed callous and possibly criminal to make no attempt at saving a fellow climber and human being. The excuses made in the book were myriad. “We didn’t know them.” “It’s dangerous to help others at this altitude.” “I was worried for my own life.” But at what point does someone become culpable? They may not have had an active hand in their deaths but what if they could have been saved? Krakauer on other dwell on this, second-guessing themselves, wondering what might have been.“The plain truth is that I knew better but went to Everest anyway. And in doing so I was a party to the death of good people, which is something that is apt to remain on my conscience for a very long time.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 17, 2016","Nov 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air

The book encompasses a wide variety of people from all walks of life with the one thread tying them together the fact that they’ve decided to stay in London despite the danger. We learn of the bravery of ordinary citizens and how important landmarks were to morale, including St. Pauls’ Cathedral, a symbol of London which is threatened during the firebombing.We begin before the bombing with all of the volunteers who have chosen to stay behind, going about their everyday jobs. Most of these Londoners were civilians so it’s interesting to see how they adjusted to their new jobs, whether it was a member of the Home Guard, the ARP (Air Raid Precautions Service) or the Auxiliary Fire Service. I loved how the book chronologically progressed through December 29 with each chapter beginning with a radio program schedule for that portion of the day. Not only is this a refreshing way to inform the reader about which part of the day the events in the chapter unfold, it also creates a growing sense of apprehension as day turns to night because the reader knows what’s coming.“The high wind which accompanies conflagrations is now stronger than ever, and the air is filled with a fierce driving rain of red-hot sparks and burning brands. The clouds overhead are a rose-pink from the reflected glow of the fires.”The great descriptions and visual imagery create an atmosphere of danger and fear that puts you right in the midst of the chaos and heat. “It was as light as day, with huge fires all around, flames rising far above the houses, the place full of smoke and sparks and great blobs of burning stuff floating about and every now and then a bomb.” Throughout the night we follow a variety of people in different situations across the city. All of these great little stories interspersed throughout really showed how all-encompassing the threat was. It wasn’t unlikely for children to slip out of their bomb shelters during raids to help fire crews. I especially liked reading about the roof crew looking after St. Paul’s Cathedral. During the bombing it’s described as “some miraculous figure that appears before peace-hungry soldiers on a battlefield.” The best story though has to be about St. Lawrence Jewry. During the raid, an otherworldly shriek came from inside as a bomb had hit the synagogue, lighting the organ on fire. As the hot air from the fire blew through the organ pipes it made a sound like an alien in the throes of death. This was an awesome image and I could easily imagine what the pipes must have sounded like.One paragraph that really made me think described the fire as ‘burning away time’ as it destroyed modern London. It was such an evocative image and really cemented the destructive power of these bombs and how it wasn’t just destroying the city it was destroying London’s past, obliterating all memory of what came before.I loved reading this book, not only because I’m interested in WW2 but also because I didn’t know much about the London Blitz other than that it happened. If you’re interested in learning about what the London Blitz was like, this book will put you right in the middle of the action. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 28, 2013","Nov 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1062368.Blitz

He was mesmerized by the challenge of making soft, round shapes of hard rock. The stone had a will of its own, and if he tried to make it do something it did not want to do, it would fight him, and his chisel would slip, or dig in too deeply, spoiling the shapes. But once he had got to know the lump of rock in front of him he could transform it. The more difficult the task, the more fascinated he was. He was beginning to feel that the decorative carving demanded by Tom was too easy. Zigzags, lozenges, dogtooth, spirals and plain roll moldings bored him, and even these leaves were rather stiff and repetitive. He wanted to curve natural-looking foliage, pliable and irregular, and copy the different shapes of real leaves, oak and ash and birch.”This is the story of a cathedral and the people who fight for its birth and for its destruction, all encompassed by a succession crisis in 12th century England, complicated by secrets, lies and betrayals. Throughout the book, reader’s switch between several protagonists important in the life of the cathedral, experiencing the medieval period from down in the dirt, just struggling to survive. I appreciated how much background was given to most of the characters, including our point of view characters. Readers come to understand how much Prior Philip cares for his makeshift family after his own had been killed when he was young; they root for Aliena to win the day after everything is taken from her over and over again; they cheer Jack on in his pursuit of becoming a Master Builder even when obstacles like family and his social economic status work against him. Follett makes you care about the fate of these characters and wonder about how they’re going to extricate themselves from certain situations. I also heartily enjoyed the moment when people pulled together to try and thwart the antagonists who seemed to have entirely too many opportunities for mischief.The story did have a few glaring problems though. The pacing is poor, creating a lack of tension for the first half of the book. While the story does a good job of setting up the plot and introducing the characters, the action didn’t pick up until the end of the book. It felt like the majority of the conflict was held in reserve for the last half while the beginning was taken up with dialogue and description. The problem is likely in the switching between protagonists which creates a stop and start effect in the narrative, interrupting the fluidity of the story.Follett does a good job of grounding the reader in the scene, giving you a taste of the period and all its myriad smells and sights. But there is entirely too much time spent on describing the architecture within the story. It’s understandable that some time would be devoted to this as the book centers around the building of a cathedral but it took too much time away from the story. Also, it seems unlikely that the majority of readers would be familiar with the features described so it would have helped if there had been diagrams at the front of the book. It was difficult to visualize some of the descriptions which brought me right out of the story. Overall it was an interesting story but if a thousand page story is overlong for you I would recommend the miniseries produced several years ago. Keep in mind though that they do make changes to the story. New characters and plotlines are added to flesh out the story and add tension.

All that remains is a concealed gravestone dedicated to a unit of Germans paratroopers in a British churchyard. The truth is a closely guarded secret by the citizens of Studley Constable, a village that was the epicentre of the most daring raid of the entire war. Having never read Higgins before, I had no expectations in reading this book. But I can honestly say this was a poignant, entertaining and exciting read. As a result I can't wait to read more of his works.There's a variety of characters, all with depth, personality and a derth of needs and wants. Surprisingly enough, the majority of the story is told from the perspective of the antagonists. This is counter to what you would normally expect. Much like ""Bel Canto"" and ""House of Cards"", the writing convinces the reader to essentially sympathize with the villain(s) of the story.Also, in most stories the tension is derived from not knowing how it all ends. This has all been avoided here as the book was written as frame story, meaning we already know how it ends. This can often be a risky idea as it often deflates interest but if done well, it draws readers in by focusing on how and why events end the way they do. Instead of concerning themselves with the end of the story, readers are more interested in the journey/middle. Truthfully the majority of the action takes place in the last 50-100 pages but I was never bored or frustrated by this. Higgins slowly moves the playing pieces into place. He slowly builds the plot, interweaving plotlines until you can see the inexorable disaster looming in the distance, forcing the reader to continue, already knowing the outcome.If you enjoy WWII stories filled with intrigue and like a bit of a twist on the traditional 'hero' story, check out this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 02, 2016","Jul 14, 2016","Nov 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/295961.The_Eagle_Has_Landed

Riding off into the unknown with his friend Rawlins, Cole is faced with sex, prison, murder, corrupt officials, familial obligations and an indifferent wilderness. If he survives his adventure across the border it’s unlikely he will ever be the same.Let me be the first to admit that I’ve never read Cormac McCarthy. In fact, I’ve actively avoided him as I heard he was a gruesome writer and I don’t do well with gore. The rumour about “Blood Meridian” is that most people don’t get past page 30. As for ”All the Pretty Horses”, I found it a slog to read. The time in which the story was set and the age of the protagonist should have been obvious but they weren’t. At first it seemed to be set in the old west but modern diction like “satellite” and “comic book” proved me wrong. Also, Cole is supposed to be 16, I never thought of him as that young. Teenagers are usually awkward, insecure and frustrated but Cole didn’t appear to suffer from any of these things. In fact, he seemed sure of himself and of his position in the world. His attitude, dialogue and actions felt more in line with that of a man in his 20s.There was also a complete lack of quotations for any dialogue and out of everything else this was the most frustrating aspect of the book. It made for difficult reading as it was difficult at times to distinguish dialogue from description until the end of a sentence or paragraph and was the cause of much re-reading. It also complicated who was speaking when. I’m unclear as to why McCarthy did this but he seemed to think quotations cluttered up the page and that they were unnecessary, reasoning that “if a book is written well enough, you’ll know when you’re reading dialogue without the extra quotation marks to tell you.” In this instance McCarthy is wrong.This leaves the strongest writing in the story McCarthy’s description of the landscape. It’s feels like an individual character as the author spends so much time and ink illustrating the surroundings.“When they wound back up out of the glade it was already evening and the sun lay long in the grass and across the shallow swales where the land dipped in pockets of darkness. Small birds come to feed in the evening cool of the open country flushed and flared away over the grasstops and the hawks in silhouette against the sunset waited in the upper limb s of a dead tree for them to pass.”“Days to come they rode through the mountains and they crossed at a barren windgap and sat the horses among the rocks and looked out over the country to the south where the last shadows were running over the land before the wind and the sun to the west lay blood red among the shelving clouds and the distant cordilleras ranged down the terminals of the sky to fade from pale to pale of blue and then to nothing at all.”These spectacularly gorgeous paragraphs are space throughout but are countered with clipped, blunt dialogue. I almost wish that McCarthy had stuck with this blunted style for every aspect of the book, to fully communicate the harsh landscape through which they traveled and Cole’s hand to mouth lifestyle. I don’t think it would have detracted from the book as stark can be beautiful too. I ended up appreciating the scenery more than the characters which didn’t bode well for the story. In fact, it was only near the end of the book that I began to care about what happened to Cole. Before then, the book had felt stale and Cole was boring.After this I don’t know that I would pick up another McCarthy book as this one felt like a waste of time. There are more enjoyable books out there so unless you’re interested in this period of history or McCarthy, I would give this one a pass....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2013,"Feb 16, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/469571.All_the_Pretty_Horses

His leg still hurt, it was still dark, he was still alone and the self-pity had accomplished nothing.”My first encounter with this book was in grade five when it was read to our class. At the time I found it rather long, boring and too descriptive. This summer though, I happened upon a free copy and decided to see if I still felt the same way. I loved revisiting this story, especially since I had forgotten so much that had happened.I don’t know why I love survival stories. Perhaps it’s because it allows for man to be stripped down to his base instincts, to do without. I’m always fascinated by what people can do with less. And there’s always the ever dependable basic conflict of man versus nature and the more interesting, man versus himself. In ”Hatchet”, Brian Robeson, a thirteen year old travelling by bush plane to visit his father, survives a plane crash, leaving him alone in a forest. Faced with starvation and threats from weather and wild animals, Brian must look inward and find the strength to survive and escape the forest.“You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”As a child listening to the story, I couldn’t fully comprehend what it would be like to face survival in the forest alone but as an adult Brian’s situation seems far more tenuous. He has limited supplies and more importantly, limited knowledge about wilderness survival. His most important ally though is his hatchet, a gift from his mother before his flight. The hatchet plays a key role in Brian’s survival and helps supply everything from a shelter to a fire to food prep, satisfying the most basic of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. I’ve often wondered if I would be able to survive in the wilderness, alone and with no access to civilization. As a child I was enrolled in Junior Forest Wardens which is basically a Canadian version of Scouts and while we received wilderness training that was many years ago and only basic training at that. What Brian accomplishes is far more impressive. Not only does he manage to keep a level head he makes good use of his time and faces challenges with an open mind. Not only is Brian confronted with the self-doubt of rescue, he also literally faces death in the guise of the dead pilot still trapped in the plane. He is a physical obstacle in the way of precious supplies and the tracking beacon but is also a psychological a fear Brian must confront if he wishes to escape.Approaching this as an adult of course I have a different view of the story. I appreciated how Paulsen didn’t shy away from the possibly scarier and more gruesome aspects of a plane crash. It didn’t treat its audience like a child, instead, allowing the reader to experience a full range of emotions when it came to Brian’s situation. As well, I liked that nature’s indifference is on full display here. People are used to being surrounded and comforted by fellow human beings/society/cities. In the forest there are no safety nets; if you fail you die.“Patience, he thought. So much of this was patience - waiting, and thinking and doing things right. So much of all this, so much of all living was patience and thinking.”If you like survival stories then this is one you might want to look at. Written for young adults, I enjoyed revisiting this book and would recommend this book as a library loan. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2011,"Jan 25, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50.Hatchet

The ferment of the heart, within these walls, was mocked by every length of sleeping shadow. The passions, no greater than candle flames, flickered in Time’s yawn, for Gormenghast, huge and adumbrate, out-crumbles all.""Gormenghast is the seat of the Earl of Groan, Lord Sepulchrave, who has finally been blessed with a son and heir. Unfortunately for him, one man seeks to worm his way into the family’s good graces and seize power for his own ends. Steerpike, the kitchen boy, uses his smarts to get out of the kitchen and into the royal household, manipulating and lying to get what he wants. He is the fulcrum upon which the story turns as it’s his actions and inactions that drive the plot and force the other characters to react to his machinations. Only time will tell if his scheming bears fruit. It’s a strange world to be sure. One that is waning rather than waxing. His strength lies in his description, which has a gothic lean to it, showing Castle Groan as a decaying mass of stone and squalor. There were evocative lines of terrifying beauty that read more like prose strewn throughout, like so much seed over tilled ground. ""The darkness in the great hall has deepened in defiance of the climbing of the sun. It can afford to be defiant with such a pall of inky cloud lying over the castle, over the cracked tooth mountain, over the entire and drenching regions of Gormenghast from horizon to horizon."" Both the setting and the characters benefit from his command of internal monologue and ability to paint an image for the reader in a fresh way. This is bolstered by the fact that the book contains some drawings. His manuscript contained sketches of his characters and have an Edward Gorey feel to them, giving the reader a sense of the what this world looks like and the characters who people it.The characters were all interesting but strangely, almost all unlikeable. Here though, Peake seems willing to show his characters in a grey light, rather than force everyone into stereotypical roles. Everyone has a dark side that is evident either through thought or deed and made it somewhat difficult to identify with characters. Titus, may have been the one character we’re supposed to root for but this felt manipulative as he’s an infant. I did appreciate being able to see so many different character POV’s as it provided a multiplicity of opinions on the events taking place. The one section I thought was out of place was Keda’s. It was nice to see the viewpoint of someone outside of Gormenghast but she travels far away and has adventures that are mostly glossed over. This didn’t seem to fit with the rest of the characters or the story as everyone else’s lives seemed to center around Gormenghast. My one major complaint is that while the story is interesting, as are the characters, it takes Peake a long time to actually say anything. In the context of plot, major events do happen but in between those events, very little appears to happen. The pace is very slow because so much ink is taken up with description. To be fair the description, especially for the characters is excellent but at times I found myself frustrated with the lack of plot development. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Aug 2012,"Aug 15, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39063.Titus_Groan

It encompasses the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions as well as the various men involved in the program from the astronauts to the engineers and includes drawings and diagrams of various vehicles, spacecraft and characters. It was fascinating to learn about the inner workings of the agency, from the original module designs to the disagreements over policy to all of the complexities of such an ambitious undertaking as going to the moon.The idealism and passion behind the program was palpable in the writing. It didn’t hurt that the book was peppered with quotes from various people of the period, including employees which created atmosphere and a sense of urgency. They make the story of the space program come alive and show that the agency was the optimistic hope of a younger nation with hopes that stretched out beyond the boundaries of the Earth. As time wore on you could see and feel how NASA changed, adapting to a changing world and ever evolving technology. I liked how we got to see how NASA matured as an agency and how the original aspirations and plans changed over time due to budget constraints and political opinion. I also found the section concerning Apollo 1 very educational. I was aware of the troubles that Apollo 13 had faced thanks to the movie but was unaware of the tragic ending of the first Apollo mission. It was interesting to see how NASA handled the situation and how the world reacted.Collins is very good at detail. The problem is he’s too good. While I was trying to work my way through the book I was constantly bogged down by all of the numbers and figures Collins peppers throughout the book. At one point I was so frustrated I didn’t want to finish the book. I understand the book was written by an analytical mind about a real time in history but the main point to take into consideration is that it’s a book first. If it’s not readable, people won’t read it and then instead of being a book it’s just tree pulp sitting on a shelf somewhere. My other complaint is that there isn’t an addendum to this book with an update of NASA over the past twenty years. So much has changed in that span of time that the space shuttle program isn’t even running anymore.I will say that there were some dramatic moments that made for some good reading. I wasn’t even aware that SkyLab existed until reading this book. Overall it was a fascinating read.Whether prescient or not, Collins does have a section where he says that Mars is the next frontier, which appears to be where some think we should be heading next. Others want to head back to the moon, whether to mine it for materials such as helium or water or whether to set up a permanent base. Whatever we decide to do, we’re still fascinated by space and I hope we continue to look up and wonder about what might be out there, just waiting to be discovered.If you are interested in the history of NASA’s space program and don’t mind extra detail included with the narrative, pick up this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2012,"Jun 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/536152.Liftoff

Through them readers get to know Socrates, his friends and the people who condemned him. The philosophical arguments presented are both straightforward and complex. They address issues of death, the immortality of the soul and the purpose of being a philosopher. This was one of my first major forays into Ancient Greek literature and I was very excited to delve into Plato.The first dialogue is called “Euthyphro” and I found it a challenge. Socrates debates the nature of holiness with Euthyphro and some of the abstractions used in his argument were difficult to picture. I had to turn them into examples just to try and visualize what Socrates was talking about. For example, one question asked whether something was holy because it was loved or was it loved because it was holy? I pictured Zeus and the oak tree. Is it holy because Zeus loves it or does he love it because it’s holy? This boggled my mind and gave me a lot to think about. It's here we learn that Socrates is accused of impiety and corrupting the young. He continually praises Euthyphro's wisdom and flatters his knowledge of religion, seemingly to the detriment of his own argument. I re-read sections several times to grasp their meaning and of all four dialogues it took the longest to finish.In “The Apology”, Socrates defends himself against his accusers. This is essentially the dialogue that takes place inside the ‘court room’. Here we witness Socrates' arrogance. Time and again he says he is a better man than everyone else yet, in the previous dialogue he spent so much time downplaying his intelligence and supposed superiority. This multi-dimensionality of character makes him real in my eyes. His memory only lives on in books and he isn't always likeable but that's what makes me like him so much. Real people are complex, layered individuals and Plato makes Socrates come alive on the page.It ""Crito"", Socrates is in prison with his friend Crito trying to convince him to escape. There are many people willing to help Socrates who could then live out the rest of his life in another city. Socrates resists, saying that fighting the will of the Athenian people would be wrong. He would rather accept death than exile. His argument seems backwards and contrary until you read the next dialogue.“Phaedo” is the longest and most convoluted of the dialogues. In it Plato summarily deconstructs his friends' arguments against his surrender to death and logically convinces them of the immortality of the soul and life after death despite the lack of hard proof. He asks mind-blowing questions such as ""when does the soul attain truth?"" This is also where we get the quote ""the life which is unexamined is not worth living."" It’s actually very impressive to read how Socrates sets up his argument and then manipulates the conversation for his own ends. He was clearly a master with words.The difficulty in reading these works is that they are conveying dialogue from a second-hand source. We aren’t hearing these words from Socrates himself. Instead they’re filtered through Plato to us. As such, there’s no real way to tell how much of the writing is truth, how much is embellishment or if it’s a full out lie. This is compounded by the fact that Socrates left no written record of his work. This may speak to his innocence of 'corrupting the youth of Athens' as he didn't seem interested in getting his works out into the public. 'I had a great time reading this book and despite its shortness, was challenged by the arguments within. I found it interesting that while the book was by Plato, it concerned itself with Socrates and his words. We learn more about him than we ever do about Plato and Socrates didn't seem like the nicest guy. He was arrogant and lorded it over people when it suited his argument and hid feelings of superiority when it didn't. Part of me felt that Socrates just seemed to give up and succumb to his sentence. In fact, by the time he was put on trial he was an old man and had lived a full life with a family. He even argues that no one, least of all he, should be upset at his passing. He convincingly argued and believed in life after death. Free from its earthly body, his soul would dwell amongst other true philosophers. I disagreed with his belief that a philosopher's main goal was the study of death though. I've always felt that philosophy was a study of learning how to live and why things are they way they are. The writer Xenophon also has an account of Socrates' trial. It would be interesting to see how the two contrast. It would serve to illustrate what I said about second-hand information. Truth gets obscured the further you are from the source. I would recommend this book but not for anyone looking for a quick read. This is not a work to skim. I would say it requires contemplation and introspection. If you're in for a challenge and want to understand the roots of philosophy, pick this up. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 11, 2012","Jun 12, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22632.The_Trial_and_Death_of_Socrates

On his return he encounters three witches who prophesize that he will be King of Scotland. He demands an explanation as Scotland still has a king in Duncan who is still living but the witches vanish. Macbeth informs his wife of this strange encounter and things quickly spiral out of control. The result is madness, murder and civil war.""Macbeth"" is one of Shakespeare's more well known tragedies. The plot is fast moving and propelled by ambition while characters are trapped by guilt and destiny. The initial catalyst that propels Macbeth on his headlong course isn’t fleshed out as much as I would like as we really only get the description that he’s despatched one of the rebels, Macdonald, in a most gruesome manner to hint at the reasoning for his future decisions. In defeating the rebels, Duncan makes him Thane of Glamis though it should be noted the last Thane was stripped of his title and executed for committing treason. Foreshadowing much? My only real issue with the beginning was I felt I was dumped into the story in medias res. At this point I didn’t know if Duncan was a good king or if Macbeth was a loyal subject and I thought it was strange how quickly and easily Macbeth accepted the idea that he would be king even though the witches offered no explanation to him. What is interesting is the course Macbeth chooses because he decides to make his prophecy come true by going after Duncan. He makes his own destiny while also falling in line with the fate set out for him by the witches. Imagine what would have happened if he hadn’t listened to them? And come to think of it, why did they decide to appear to him in the first place and mess with his head? Was this their idea of joyriding, running roughshod over someone else’s future?The characters of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth I found to be the most interesting because they were more evil than everyone else. I always find villains more intriguing than heroes because their motivations are always so widespread and varied. I liked that once reality set in, Macbeth had a crises of conscience about his decision and we saw that Lady Macbeth was the cold fish of the duo. She calls him a coward and she is the one that thinks clearly to keep them from being discovered. I loved that she was the instigator for action against Duncan! She said Macbeth was ”too full o' the milk of human kindness” to commit the act and had to urge him towards it. Even though he told her about the prophecy she is the one that has to drive him to it. It’s not often that we see a strong female villain taking such a central role in a story, especially over a male villain. Some might call the duo tragic anti-heroes but for me, their original actions colour their characters for the rest of the play.The language as always was gorgeous. My favourite parts were definitely the soliloquies.Here's one of my favourites from the play:""Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,Till thou applaud the deed - Come, seeling night,Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,And with thy bloody and invisible handCancel and tear to pieces that great bondWhich keeps me pale. Light thickens,And the crow makes wing to th' rooky wood;Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.- Thou marvell'st at my words; but hold thee still,Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill -So prithee go with me.""It did take forever to actually read the play though because I was so far removed from when the source material was written that the archaic diction and phrases interrupted the flow of the story. I had to keep referring to footnotes and the introduction to understand everything that was going on. This was my first time reading the play in more than ten years now I feel that I understand the plot, who the characters are and the general gist of the language. If you haven’t read Shakespeare before or not in a long time I would suggest reading a version with annotations and then watch one of the many movie versions of the plays. I felt this really helped as I had a good idea of the plot going into the film and then listening to the dialogue and watching the action made everything far more understandable.I was hoping to see Banquo’s story play out. I liked the parallel prophecies for him and Macbeth but we never get to see his fulfilled it’s never addressed again after Macbeth goes after him. The play ends abruptly and I wondered if this was deliberate or not. In any case, it’s one of Shakespeare’s best and I highly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 23, 2012","May 25, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8852.Macbeth

Bertie Wooster has become enamoured of the banjolele but is getting nothing but grief from his neighbours and his valet Jeeves. After a severe disagreement about the instrument causes Jeeves to leave his service, Bertie departs for the country to practice in peace. He gets caught up in the affairs of his good friend “Chuffy”, current employer of Jeeves, and manages to accidentally get himself engaged to the woman “Chuffy” loves. Madcap hijinks ensue, leaving Bertie to fend for himself without the stalwart advice of his gentleman’s gentleman.This is the second Wodehouse book I’ve read and the first full-length novel. I had high expectations and to my disappointment found that it didn’t measure up to ”The Inimitable Jeeves”. I don’t know whether it was the fact it was written more than ten years later or that it was a full length story rather than many short stories but I actually found myself getting bored with the story. It wasn’t bad per se, it just wasn’t very good. There were long stretches where I thought the diction and dialogue could have used punching up and the whimsy that I had so enjoyed before was missing. There were several things I found offputting, not least of which was the continued reference to blackface and racist terms that not only severely date the book but also leave a sour taste after I’d finished the book. That’s not to say there weren’t enjoyable parts in the book. There were some great lines Bertie spouted off at random, echoing Wodehouse’s genius. ”He uttered a coarse expression which I wouldn't have thought he would have known. It just shows that you can bury yourself in the country and still somehow acquire a vocabulary. No doubt one picks up things from the neighbours -- the vicar, the local doctor, the man who brings the milk, and so on.”""I hadn't heard the door open, but the man was on the spot once more. My private belief, as I think I have mentioned before, is that Jeeves doesn't have to open doors. He's like one of those birds in India who bung their astral bodies about--the chaps, I mean, who having gone into thin air in Bombay, reassemble the parts and appear two minutes later in Calcutta. Only some such theory will account for the fact that he's not there one moment and is there the next. He just seems to float from Spot A to Spot B like some form of gas.”I think the main complaint and problem is the Jeeves-Wooster balance is missing. The best part of these books is the back and forth between Bertie and his valet. Usually Bertie’s done something foolish and Jeeves must reel him in to point out the error of his ways. For a large part of this book the two are separated. Granted Bertie sneaks over to ask Jeeves’ opinion on occasion but Bertie is mostly left to fend for himself, therefore creating a very bland story. It’s fries without ketchup, cake without icing, toast without jam, etc. The two of them work best together. I also found the fact that the entire plot hinged on the bajolele being a hated instrument very annoying. Surely there was another way to get Bertie out to the country without ditching Jeeves. Perhaps they could have disagreed with something after reaching the cottage?Ultimately I think I was spoiled by ”The Inimitable Jeeves” which I previously ed.

Luckily for him, his valet, Jeeves, is tactful, brilliant and possessed of a wit that usually flies over Bertie's head. Together they form an odd partnership that carries them through a variety of events, encapsulated in 18 short stories. I had never read Wodehouse before and had only vaguely heard of 'Jeeves & Wooster' the tv show starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Boy was I surprised. All the stories link together to form a cohesive whole; there's a variety of situations that involve different characters and there's a light tone to the book that keeps the reader from getting bogged down in detail or exposition. I was also very impressed with the slang and diction used in the book. It felt modern and fresh, echoing the feel of the twenties yet I could still understand it. For example: ""The good old persp. was bedewing my forehead by this time in a pretty lavish manner. I don't know when I've been so rattled.""Another aspect of the book I loved was the humour and Wodehouse isn't just funny, he's laugh out loud hilarious! Also, it wasn't just slapstick run of the mill humour, it was intelligent and visual. Here are just a few choice snippets of what you'll find in the book. ""She had a penetrating sort of laugh. Rather like a train going into a tunnel.""""He chuckled like the last bit of water going down the waste-pipe in a bath."" ""Jeeves lugged my purple socks out of the drawer as if he were a vegetarian fishing a caterpillar out of his salad.""The fact that this book was published in 1923 yet is still funny today and uses slang familiar to a 21st century reader, is extremely impressive. It's rare to find a book almost 100 years old that is stil so accessible. It is also very intelligently written and the fact that it does so many things right makes for an amazing story.

I find it difficult to believe that a man in the business of salvaging ancient antiquities would get involved in such zaniness. To be fair Indiana Jones did the same thing but for some reason it feels more believable taking place in the late 30s with Nazis coming out of the woodwork and fewer regulations on ancient sites and artifacts. Having the book take place in present day (1989) I expect more. Overall I would classify the book as a beach read, something to take on vacation if you don’t want to think too hard. Dirk Pitt is super annoying as a protagonist because he's described as 'practically perfect in every way'. He's tall, handsome, smart, athletic and gets all the ladies. There were so many instances when the way he was described made him seem cartoonish because of how unbelievable it was. For example his eyes are described in a ridiculous manner. ""They seemed to reflect hardness, gentleness and sincere concern in one glinting montage."" How can eyes both reflect hardness and gentleness? It’s an impossibility! We are also led to believe that his piercing gaze makes women weak in the knees. The book is a harlequin romance written by a man with a protagonist so unrealistic it ruined the book and every other Dirk Pitt story for me. On that note I do have one more Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt book in my library called ”Inca Gold” that I am very tempted to read and then dispose of. I don’t think it’s too much to ask that readers are treated with a degree of intelligence by the author and I felt that while the story contained political intrigue, the story itself was dumbed down.The sad part is I only picked up this book because it mentioned discovering the lost Library of Alexandria on the dust jacket. The problem is the Library is in fact, a Macguffin. The reader is lulled into thinking the story will be about bringing back the literary treasures of the past but the library storyline soon fades into the background only to reemerge at the very end of the book. It felt as if Cussler smushed together two different books. We start with the Library but a large portion of the book is taken up with international terrorists. The strange thing is I own ”Sahara”, a Dirk Pitt movie based on a book of the same name. It’s actually pretty decent. Good action, characters and plot. I’ll have to revisit it and  it on here to contrast how Dirk Pitt can be handled well as a character. If you’re looking for something to read on the plane that’s action oriented but not too deep, pick up this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Apr 16, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/85737.Treasure

In the tight circle of grave old faces, not a one flickered. At last the oldest and the gravest there laid down the document, shook his head, and spoke. 'You have her, madam - there can be no doubt.' I turned my head. Behind the ranks of gray-wigged, black-robed figures, beyond the little window of the Temple, fresh white clouds scudding like rabbits' bobtails chased each other across a shining sky. On such a day of any other summer, Robin and I would have been ahorse, afield, chasing and racing too. But he was far away, and here I sat, a prisoner like Mary, who at last had brought me here.”Elizabeth Tudor, daughter of Henry VIII, lived through and ruled over one of the most interesting periods in England’s history. She lent her name to the era, the Elizabethan period and lived to see her country’s religion turned on its head for lust of her mother, the death of her father, his other four wives and her two siblings as well as birth of the English Renaissance and the Spanish Armada defeated. She had to defend herself not only from threats abroad from the Church of Rome and other foreign powers but from her own subjects and council who wished she were Catholic or a man or that she would marry and produce a male heir. I’ve always been a fan of this period in history. It was the time of Shakespeare and global exploration. The monarch was almost absolute and the Tudor family are the closest you can get to a Renaissance soap opera. In fact, Elizabeth only exists due to a random set of circumstances where Prince Arthur died and his brother Henry married his widow Katherine of Aragon, became Henry VIII and turned out to be totally cuckoo-bananas. That’s why I was excited to see that this is a book written in the voice of Elizabeth. Of course, we can’t truly know what she thought about many things but Miles incorporates words from speeches and letters to inform us of her opinion about people and events, lending authenticity to the voice and diction of the story.I enjoyed reading about her life from under her father to after the Spanish Armada. This long stretch of time allows readers to see her opinions as a person and monarch evolve over time, how she was always on guard against dangers to her person. Readers continuously see how her father, even long after his death influences her life and how political intrigue shaped her actions as queen. The POV is interesting because the author writes as Elizabeth writing the story of her life and covers the various stages of her existence. My main problem with this POV is that Miles has Elizabeth interrupt her own story with input from the present. Her reflections are not only spoilery but they disrupt the flow of the book. As a reader familiar with Elizabeth’s story it wasn’t as bothersome as it could have been but what if I knew nothing about her? Foreshadowing can create suspense but the way it’s done here it undercuts the tension. I don’t want commentary from present Elizabeth commenting on past Elizabeth’s decisions and feelings about Robert Deveraux, Earl of Essex. It makes their relationship less interesting when I have an idea of what happens in the end. If anything I think the story might have been more effective to keep the POV as Elizabeth but keep it in present tense. Let the reader and Elizabeth experience events at the same time to create suspense and conflict. Let everything be a surprise, whether it be a delight or a terror.If you're a fan of books about the Tudors and Elizabeth I I would recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 07, 2012","Apr 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56353.I_Elizabeth

Three days later there was an explosion that ended the mission and almost ended their lives. For four days they barely slept and did their best to limp home on limited power and oxygen. This story describes in detail the actions of the crew and Mission Control to save Apollo 13 from an uncertain fate.I liked the various perspectives presented from the Apollo 13 crew to Mission Control to the Lovell household. It was interesting to see how everyone involved reacted to the situation and especially how the team in Houston handled the various problems with the compromised mission. Reading the story from a 2012 perspective I felt somewhat removed from the issues. The idea that that one problem could cause an almost complete meltdown of the spacecraft seems foreign. Today it seems as if there are redundancies for any complex piece of machinery and any issues have long been worked out. But you have to remember that space program was still fairly young in 1970. Man had only landed on the moon one year prior this mission.As well, the authors did a good job of creating empathy towards the characters. Despite knowing the ultimate outcome of this mission due to its historical nature, I worried about the Apollo 13 crew. I wanted them to be safe. I especially appreciated the attention to detail within Mission control and the spacecraft. The reader experiences the flight just as the crew did and I found the tecnobabble tired me out. Far from being annoyed at this, it let me identify with crew and the tireless Mission Control employees who even slept at work during the crises. It was jarring to have Lovell as a co-author and yet the book wasn't in first person from his perspective. I do understand that it wouldn’t have made sense to write the story that way due to the various perspectives presented. It did make the book seem colder and less personable, creating distance between the reader and the story.One thing I didn’t like was the chronological jumping around in Lovell's and NASA's timeline. I got used to it though, jumping from before Lovell was in the space program to his other space missions to Apollo 13. The problem was everytime we cut away from what was happening on Apollo 13 to a different time, it undercut the tension. If the reader is in the midst of worrying about this three man crew and then they're given a chance to relax by switching to an earlier point in history, it diminishes the excitement the story creates. While I believe that a book told chronologically can be somewhat old hat these days, in this case it would have kept my attention for the entirety of the story. As well, the book was filled with dates and technical details and procedures so it was difficult to separate out and remember all that was going on with Apollo 13 when I came back to chapters regarding their missions.Overall I had a blast reading this book.

The identity""The reconstruction of Europe after World War II was one of the most complicated and comprehensive international efforts of modern times. The identity and infrastructure of the nations of Europe had to be rebuilt and the restitution of artwork was a vital component. To say the war was the greatest upheaval of cultural items in history would be a grave understatement. In the end, the Western Allies discovered more than one thousand repositories in southern Germany alone, containing millions of works of art and other cultural treasures, including church bells, stained glass, religious items, municipal records, manuscripts, books, libraries, wine, gold, diamonds, and even insect collections.""This book tells the little known story of the Monuments Men, experts in the art field tasked with locating, recovering, preserving and repatriating art looted by the Nazis. This small band of men faced an almost insurmountable task. The amount of irreplaceable art and artifacts taken by the Nazis was staggering and whole of the Monuments Men consisted of less than 400 people to look after the entire western half of Europe.What I loved about this book was how these men came from ordinary backgrounds and accomplished extraordinary things. They were architects and scholars, working in museums and universities; some had little to no training in the preservation and transportation of precious artwork. The odds were against them from the start but it's their dedication and the fact that they were willing to put their lives at risk to save mankind's art history that make you root for them. They are the ultimate underdogs where they not only fought against the Nazis but against the clock. ""What if we win the war, but lose the last five hundred years of our cultural history on our watch?"" Much of the art was stored in mines to protect them from bombing but these places were not always suitable for storing fragile works of art for years at a time. They were prone to cave ins and flooding while the art was also susceptible to moisture and looters.I really liked the chronological nature of the book. As the war unfolded, so did the search for the art. I was caught up as much as the Monuments Men were and I found myself filled with anxiety over certain works that were missing. I also got to follow various members of the group as they tramped around Europe, following troops, striking out on their own, stealing supplies, commandeering vehicles, men and the help of local civilians if needed.There are also some great photos and maps to illustrate what Edsel is talking about. A main character crew list with photos and short bios is included in the beginning which puts faces to the men the reader follows. I wish the art photos hadn't been clustered together though but rather interspersed throughout. For example, whenever the Ghent Altarpiece was mentioned I had to keep flipping back to the photo to remind myself what it looked like as there's a wide variety of works mentioned and it's tough to keep everything straight.Learning about these men and everything they went through, I shared in their triumphs and failures. I worried about them and feared for their safety. Edsel made me feel like I was there. It was exciting and nerve-wracking and hearbreaking, a great read!

Things go awry when Oberon plays matchmaker and messes in the love lives of his wife and the quartet of mortals running around the woods.Oberon and Titania are married gods who need to attend couples therapy. It is their argument that leads to all the strife in the story. If not for Oberon, Bottom wouldn't have been transformed and the lovebirds would most likely have sorted out their own issues without the confusion caused by a love potion. I saw Oberon as a selfish and cruel manipulator, despite directing Puck to help the mortals out. His meddling caused more problems than it solved and what he does to his own wife to ""teach her a lesson"" felt like a form of abuse. What I didn't understand was why he wasn't omnipotent. Yes Puck makes a honest mistake, using love potion on the wrong people but why does Oberon allow him to make the mistake in the first place?I liked the idea of the play being set in Greece but combining Celtic and Greek mythology with Brits playing was a weird mashup.I also wondered why Bill chose to have two Robins in the play. Usually stories don't contain characters with the same or similar sounding names to avoid confusing the reader but here Bill doesn't seem concerned. We have Robin Starveling and Robin Goodfellow, names which may reference Robert Dudley and Robert Deveraux, both favourites of Queen Elizabeth I, monarch at the time of Shakespeare.When I read this play I enjoyed it but wasn't blown away with what I consider to be seond-tier Shakespeare. Looking closer though, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye. Bill manages to juggle four different storylines within a small space and all blend together seamlessly. Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding, the play within a play, Oberon and Titania and Bottom and the four lovers in the forest. And as always, Bill is a master wordsmith and plays the funnyman. Look at what he does with alliteration.""Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.""Talk about a tongue twister!My major complaint was I found it tough to keep track of who was enchanted and who was in love with who, a major plot problem. But as with all of Bill's plays, I suspect it works better on stage than on paper. There's something about the spoken word that glosses over all the archaic language and long-forgotten references.

Over on the right no horse, Kemper was down, impossible to live up there. Armistead moved on, expecting to die, but was not hit. He moved closer to the wall up there, past mounds of bodies, no line any more, just men moving forward at different speeds, stopping to fire, stopping to die, drifting back like leaves blown from the fire ahead. Armistead though: we won’t make it. He lifted the sword again screaming, and moved on, closer, closer, but it was all coming apart; the whole world was dying.”The Civil War has dragged on for three long years. General Stonewall Jackson is dead and there is no end in sight for the conflict that has ripped apart families and destroyed friendships. The Confederate Army has crossed into Pennsylvania and is on the brink of exhaustion. A chance encounter of Confederate scouts and Union cavalry bring the two armies rushing towards one another, to converge upon a little town called Gettysburg. The next three days bring fire and flesh together in what some call the decisive battle of the war, vanquishing the might of one side and raising up the other.Growing up in Canada I knew only the very basics of the American Civil War and had only heard of Gettysburg and the blood that was spilled there. I always imagined it was on a promontory and that the Confederates were massacred to a man. I had assumed the issue of slavery was the entire cause of the war. I could not have been more wrong. What I didn’t know was many states had already seceded from the Union and that the Emancipation Proclamation was signed after the war started. I assumed the victory of the Union was an open and shut case. Instead I was surprised to see how close the South came to winning. And I was fascinated to see how one tiny detail could change so much about an event: If only Ewell had taken that hill; if only Stuart had showed up; if only Lee had listened to Longstreet.Each chapter is from the pov of a character from the war. Shaara provides their thoughts and fears, their strong sense of duty and their opinion of others. He gives us both sides of the war and by allowing us into the minds of these men, we learn to identify and sympathize with both the Union and the Confederacy soldiers as we’re meant to. After all, they were simply men following orders. In fact, Shaara manages to increase the tension by alternating chapters between the North and South. The reader may know everything but the two armies only have half the information. While reading I even started to have favourites on both the North and South side: Lee, the Chamberlain brothers, Armistead, Burton, Longstreet; I willed them to live, worried about them and felt rather motherly towards these men whom I’d never met and who had lived and died in another century, far separated from my own.You also really sense the passage of time throughout the book. The story only takes place over four days but you feel every hour, you experience the slow inevitable drawing together of these two armies, you wait for the battle just as they do. The world was more patient and slow moving in those days but Shaara has made the action immediate. You feel as if you’re right there with them, holding a rifle, hunkered down against a rock, trying not to get shot. And the language! This book is a feast. The lyric lines, the description, the images he creates and the profound thoughts and words by these men are sumptuous and a joy to read. I once claimed ”The Red Badge of Courage” was the most poetic book I’d read about war but ”Killer Angels” has taken its place. Shaara manages to keep the words from getting in the way of the story and what words they are!Prior to this I’d never read anything about the Civil War and I’m not sure anything else will ever measure up. The book won a rightly-deserve Pulitzer Prize in 1975 and if you looking for a book about Gettysburg that focuses more on the people than the schematics, this is story is for you....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Dec 2011,"Jan 28, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/682804.The_Killer_Angels

I think it's watching how people pick up the pieces that fascinate me, the choices they make, for the good or the bad and choices are extrememly important in this book.I was interested in this book purely on the merit of one of Shaara’s other books, ”The Killer Angels” about the Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War. This book proves how versatile a writer he is, moving from historical to apocalyptic fiction. If you love books about the US Civil War or even if you know nothing about it, I would highly recommend this book. Look for my  on this book soon.Shaara slowly builds the tension because we only get the story in pieces; we learn as the characters learn what’s going on. I had so many theories apart from what I had read on the dust jacket. And the way he writes to create an atmosphere of cold terror is exquisite.”At that moment Ring saw a man break from the side of the radio truck and come running back down through the field, running away. But no one else ran. They all stood there like dark wet statues, in dead silence, looking toward the Wall, and for a long moment Ring had no idea, then it began to come, and he broke forward toward the gate. Faces turned toward him. Black faces: a nightmare of wet man with death in their eyes. He felt his skin prickle.”I did not like the tongue-in-cheek joke about our protagonist’s name. Nikola Tesla was an amazing man with a brilliant but damaged mind. His scientific genius doesn’t translate to Nick’s character. If Nick had been a closet engineer or did science experiments in his basement I would have seen the connection. As it was, I saw no connection and felt the character was sloppily named.As well, the scope of the book expanded exponentially when Rome and several other cities were brought into the plot. This felt unimportant. Our main focus is not the team trying to stop the “circle of death” from expanding. If it had been, these other cities would hold more importance on an apocalyptic remaking-the-world scale. But our focus is Nick, a man concerned more with Jefferson than Rome and who wouldn’t be? He has problems surrounding him with Ruth and Sheperd, wild animals, the machine that keeps the circle expanding, other survivors, etc. I think it would have been more effective to focus just on Jefferson.I don’t know that I agree with the title either. ”The Herald” refers to Sheperd but the story is really about Nick and his experiences, his choice. We follow him through the book. Sheperd is a mysterious scientist until near the end of the book. The title fits in the sense that Sheperd’s machine will usher in a new era but I still feel that Nick’s journey is far more interesting. He’s an ordinary man who has to make an extraordinary choice...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 21, 2011","Dec 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1058144.The_Herald

She was, at most, a side character, despite the fact that it was only with her help that Jason attained the Golden Fleece. He then marries her and brings her back to Corinth, has two children and this is where our story picks up.Jason has essentially thrown Medea over for another woman from Corinth and marries her, despite remaining married to Medea. As you can understand Medea doesn't take this news well and sees this ""other woman"" as usurping her rightful place. She still loves Jason but is bitterly resentful towards him. He even recommends she go into exile with his children and would be smart to take his advice. That's enough to make anyone angry.Medea then commits a horrible crime to avenge herself against Jason and his actions. And the strange thing about the entire reading experience was I did feel some small measure of sympathy for her. I didn't see her actions at all justifiable but I can understand why she would be angry. She's the one who left her home and her family to come to a foreign land only to have the only person she knows well desert her for another woman.As well, it only serves to show just how much of an idiot Jason is. Not only is he bigamous, he also shouldn't be considered among the great heroes of Greek myth like Odysseus or Perseus. He's always been at best, a B level hero but his lack of heroic deeds in the Argosy and his philandering ways make him less than worthy of the hero canon.I found the play powerful but also maddening. Both Jason and Medea are acting only for their own self interest, to the detriment of each other and those around them.From my Greek and Roman studies classes I understand the story to highlight Medea's position as a foreigner and as such, a barbarian with barbarian ways in sharp contrast to the civilized Greeks. She does not act as a dutiful wife, she has violent thoughts and doesn't accept the position Jason has put her in. Those watching the play are supposed to view foreigners as ""other"" and uncivilized, a group that must be civilized to avoid what happens in this play....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 30, 2011",,Nook,view (with text),/book/show/11434588-medea-of-euripedes

They lived in constant fear and took extreme precautions to avoid being discovered. Anne Frank was all of 13 and a precocious child before going into hiding. Once secluded with her family, the van Daans and Mr. Dussel, she decided to document daily life within the secret annex in a diary. Her writing betrays a maturity beyond her years as she develops a meditative internal life, an inner monologue that is strong, stubborn and independent. I found this book difficult to finish. It might sound weird but right when Anne starts to spend time with Peter I just wanted to put it down. I knew the ending before I started and in my head I wanted her to remain happy. Sounds silly right? But I’ve never been one to not finish a good book. The closer I got to the end the more nervous I became. It reminded me of something I read when I was a kid. It was called “The Monster at the End of this Book”. It was a Sesame Street book starring Grover. It broke the fourth wall because he spoke to the reader and was scared to reach the end and find the monster. He would construct all sorts of elaborate walls of brick, cement and wood to keep the reader from turning the page, all the while begging them not to finish the book. I loved seeing Anne's opinions develop over time and how confident she became with her own voice. She can be quite cruel at times towards the other occupants of the attic, revealing an articulate mean streak that pokes at others flaws. I didn’t like to read how she tore other people down but it showed me she’s not a character, she’s a real person with real feelings. We see her voracious appetite for books, the emergence of young love and a penchant to examine issues you wouldn’t expect to hear from teenagers, like the hatred of Jewish peoples within German occupied territory. She writes truth and never holds back, revealing a complex young woman with dreams beyond the attic. It is this honesty that makes the writing fresh and new, despite the diary being almost 70 years old. If you want to know how a regular Jewish family lived and suffered through the war or if you want to read about life from the prospective of a strong young woman, read this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 30, 2011",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48855.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl

In fact, it was also the first story where Dr. Watson and Sherlock meet. Watson was injured and has had to retire from military life. Fortunately Sherlock Holmes is looking for someone to share the rent in his flat. Thrown together Sherlock and Watson make an effective team when called to the scene of a murder in a deserted house where a mysterious message “RACHE” is drawn in blood on the wall. This is a case that spans the globe and introduces us to one of the greatest fictional detectives ever created.I was excited but apprehensive to start this book as it was published so long ago (1887) and my experience with older books has been dry dialogue accompanied by a dry plot. They end up making me want to tear my hair out and I didn’t want the book to ruin my appreciation for Sherlock Holmes. But I actually found the book interesting. I liked seeing his process, how he deduced solutions and then had to explain himself. Some of the references were archaic, interrupting the flow of the plot but this wasn’t a major concern.My main problem with this story is Part II. Right before Sherlock explains how deduced who the murder was, Part I ends. Part II starts in the desert in Utah with an entirely different cast of characters and there’s Mormons. This completely jarring break brought me right out of the story. I assumed it was a misprint the first time I read it. In fact, I read the opening four times to try and see how the parts connected but alas. This frustration I think would be enough to turn some readers off the book. I don’t think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had settled into a rhythm yet as Sherlock only appears again near the end to explain how he deduced the identity of the murderer.This is a difficult introduction to Sherlock Holmes but it lays the groundwork for the friendship and partnership between him and Watson. If you want to start at the beginning of the series I suggest you start here....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 30, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/102868.A_Study_in_Scarlet

You don't stay for nothing.”Guy Montag is a fireman. He burns books for a living, protecting society from the evils of the written page. The only problem is Guy isn’t sure what exactly he’s protecting everyone from. You see, he’s never read any of the books he burns. That is until one night when raids a house he expects to be empty. Instead he finds a woman who refuses to leave despite the threat of fire as Montag prepares to burn the house with its illegal material. As he lights the kerosene he spots a book that’s fallen open to the passage “time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine”. The incident disturbs him. What follows opens his eyes to a world under constant threat of destruction.This book has become one of my favourites as Bradbury provides an example of what a dystopian world without books would look like. While fast and flashy it lacks inspiration and fragility. There is a lifeless numb feeling to everyone’s lives except those who secret books within their homes. And Bradbury communicates this as only a poet could. His diction is lyrical and though provoking. I actually checked to see if he’d published any poetry and he’s done everything but.The story itself is somewhat like the Matrix movies in that what Montag has been told to believe is not the truth. We also encounter several other characters such as his wife, Mildred who wants bigger and better gadgets to cement their social status; Clarisse who is a mysterious neighbour who questions the authorities and Captain Beatty, the fire chief and Montag’s boss who eventually grows suspicious of Montag.My one complaint would be that the book wasn’t longer and closer to the end began to lose the lyrical quality that had drawn me in at the beginning. Despite these issues though it’s still an amazing book and made me want to read more of Bradbury’s work.

Out there, somebody knows.”In an alternate world superheroes are real and helped to win the Vietnam War, becoming trusted caretakers of the nation. Soon enough though, the public turned on them, forcing the passage of legislation in 1977, essentially banning the existence of superheroes and raising the questions, “Who watches the watchmen?” In this world it’s 1985 and Edward Blake, otherwise known as The Comedian, is dead. Authorities have no leads but an old friend named Rorshach has taken it upon himself to discover the truth. Instead he finds Blake wasn’t the first to die under mysterious circumstances. Someone is killing superheroes and Rorshach wants to know why. He contacts former colleagues to warn them and they in turn become involved, lead on a merry chase filled with red herrings, all with the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union looming large on the horizon. I think I was rather spoiled with this book as it was the first graphic novel I’d ever read and I doubt anything else I read in the genre will measure up. The attention to detail is amazing. I really liked how there were things going on in the background that informed the reader on the story. Whether it was graffiti or newspapers, it was an economical way of communicating, to fill in the gaps without taking up space on the page. As well, throughout the book there are documents and reports interspersed, with coffee mug stains and words purposely spelled wrong to create authenticity. This makes the world feel more real. As well, the characters are an interesting study in human nature. We see a broad cross-section of all types, from the regular Joe of Night Owl, to the brilliant and successful Ozymandias, to the unfeeling and logical Jon. The dialogue is realistic, covered in a thin film of grit. The reader is surrounded by amoral characters and good guys who commit atrocities, painting the world a dark grey. But the story I believe is the strongest aspect of the novel. Alan Moore did a fantastic job. It may have slowed down in parts, ie plot interruptions in the form of a comic book but I found overall that it was really strong. He showcases the anti hero that was popular during the 80s highlighting the fact that not every superhero was sunshine and rainbows. At their core the majority were regular human beings with a unique set of skills they put to use.One thing I didn’t like was the comic book story wedged into the plot. While I understand the tie-in to the main story, it felt more like filler than anything and I don’t think the novel would have been the lesser if it had been removed. I was also not a fan of the explicit violence splayed across the page. I’ve never been a fan of guts and blood so this was somewhat of a turn off. Fortunately Moore’s story was compelling enough to hold my interest. If you enjoy a good story with realistic characters then read this graphic novel. I highly recommend it.Rating: 5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2009,"Jan 31, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/472331.Watchmen

His goal may seem strange but Miles is far from ordinary. His main hobby is memorizing the last words of famous people. He’s fortunate enough to room with Chip Martin, otherwise known as “The Colonel” who likewise gifts Miles with the nickname “Pudge” on account that he’s skinny as a rail. Through “The Colonel” he’s soon introduced to Alaska Young, a wild, mysterious, energetic and independent young woman. Miles is instantly hooked but Alaska isn’t interested. She’s dating a college man but intentionally flirts with Miles, driving him to distraction.While trying to survive the trials of high school, a strict headmaster, an existential theology class and a killer swan, Miles finds himself on the receiving end of hazing. The “Weekend Warriors” are a group of rich preps that go home for the weekend and end up duct taping Miles and throwing him into a lake. An act of revenge by “The Colonel” and his band of misfits elicits an all out prank-war. Their humourous machinations are soon overshadowed by loss though, as the events of one night lead to a tragic end. Need and desperation drive both Miles and “The Colonel” towards the truth, only to realize that there are things in life that can never be fully explained. In this debut novel by John Green we are introduced to a bevy of unique characters. Their realistic interactions, mistakes and dialogue makes for a believable read and bring to light the dark undertones present in the life of every teenager. The detail inherent in the characters as well is well though out. Miles is quirky and constantly quoting last words; “The Colonel” has a stash of vodka hidden in his milk, making for a pretty disgusting combination; Alaska is concerned with labyrinths and has a thing for white flowers.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a coming of age book containing a well-rounded group of teenagers.Rating:4/5...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Nov 2010,"Jan 24, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99561.Looking_for_Alaska

She was dressed in a tam-o'-shanter and a sporran, and held a cutlass and a round shield on which a flowering thistle was carved. A sash hung from her left shoulder, and beneath it was a glimpse of chain like mermaid scales. Painted white she was almost life-size.""On a trip to Morwenstow, England, Jeremy Seal finds a wooden ship figurehead propped up as a gravemarker and wonders how she came to be on dry land. His investigation leads him to the Caledonia, a ship wrecked off the coast in 1842. After searching through local records, he begins to suspect the locals were 'wreckers' who purposely ran the ship aground, looted it and possibly killed its crew. But he needs evidence and while the coast has a history of shipwrecks, it's difficult to prove his theory. While searching through Morwenstow, Seal recreates what life might have been like on board the Caledonia and how they might have met their tragic end.Seal has a way with words, as evidenced by the quote above. His writing has a lyrical, haunting quality to it that adds to the recreation of the shipwreck. As well, Seal gives the reader a taste of shipboard life in the 19th century. We follow his search through church records, microfiche and local legends. Piece by piece he constructs a narrative of what might have happened but the amount of time that's passed leaves large holes in his body of evidence. The problem with this book was, it could have been great. But Seal has so little real information to go on that he ends up padding the book. This includes the recreation, which at most is general and best guess as to what really happened during the shipwreck. But the recreation takes up the majority of the book, with the Seal's search for evidence a poor runner-up. Ultimately the ending was unsatisfactory with no real payoff. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2009,Jan 2009,"Oct 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1383694.Treachery_at_Sharpnose_Point

No one was likeable. Every teenager is drinking or doing drugs and Elizabeth and James' marriage is strained. Add to that Rosie and Elizabeth seem to have interchangeable voices.

The Hunger Games, a futuristic reality show for children involving fights to the death for fame, fortune and most importantly food, were born out of a failed coup against the government of the day. The Capitol now uses the Games as a twisted means of controlling the population, where one male and one female teenager from every District is chosen at “The Reaping” to participate in the games. This year Katniss Everdeen’s little sister Prim is chosen as a Tribute. Desperate to save her sister from certain death, Everdeen volunteers to take her place and along with Peeta, the baker’s son, she must navigate the politics and machinations of the Capitol and somehow outlast the other District Tributes.Everdeen is an interesting character as a female protagonist. She’s strong, stubborn, frustrated by her emotions when it comes to boys and conflicted by her actions in the Hunger Games. She felt like a realistic character and her internal monologue revealed her humanity and inner turmoil to readers. Collins absolutely nailed the actions and emotions of a teenager. I also liked how Everdeen didn’t always know what to do or have an answer for every problem as I feel some books portray young protagonists as encyclopaedic geniuses and it makes it difficult for me to sympathize and identify with the character. I feel as if the world doesn’t have enough books with physically active female protagonists with strong personalities so this was a breath of fresh air. I liked that she went out into the woods and wasn’t a girly girl. I also really liked the setting as I’m a sucker for post-apocalyptic fiction and this is one of the best I’ve read in the young adult genre. I liked the idea that some terrible event happened in the past to create the world Everdeen currently inhabits but that we weren’t given any explicit details of how it happened. The ambiguity feels right as I imagine that a lot of information would have been lost when the ‘event’ occurred. I also felt that the division of regions into districts focussed solely on one resource was a bit simplistic but this is understandable as it’s a young adult book and Collins is merely setting the stage, not writing a textbook. As well, I also liked the concentration of wealth and power in the Capitol as it felt like a throwback to the feudal system, another example of society crumbling and falling back onto older models of governance.Collins creates great tension throughout the story as she ends each chapter on a cliffhanger. I also liked the fast pace, as it gives readers an insight into how Everdeen is feeling, breathless and rushed. The story never lets up, pulling you along for the ride. I also thought it was interesting how Collins draws inspiration from both the story of Theseus and the Minotaur and today’s obsession with reality television. It’s interesting to see that despite the starvation and poverty of Panem, that people are still interested in being entertained. Again, the violence and destruction inherent in The Hunger Games is a throwback to the games at the Coliseum in Ancient Rome, speaking to the breakdown of societal rules and conventions. I mean, where else are you going to get people interested in watching children kill one another?If you like books about dystopian futures and strong female protagonists who kick butt, I would highly recommend this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Sep 22, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games

She views the world through the prism of the books she reads and when she is invited to Bath by family friends the Allens, she jumps at the chance for adventure. While there she is introduced to the Thorpes who use her innocence to their adavantage. Fortunately she has the worldly Mr. Henry Tilney, who knows something about muslin, to guide her through the the murky waters of society. After getting to know Henry better, she is invited to his childhood home, Northanger Abbey, where she suspects something sinister has happened to his mother. The novel is an excellent parody of gothic novels that were popular at the beginning of the 19th century, such as ""The Mysteries of Udolpho"" by Ann Radcliffe. In fact, apparently The problem was that Austen had trouble getting the novel published and it wasn't until after her death in 1817 that it was put into print. By then the references to various popular gothic novels were out of date and the book lost a little of its punch. Regardless though, Bath plays a major role in this book as it does with other Austen novels and the reader follows themes of maturation and life vs fiction. This was Austen's first completed novel and it shows. As a character, Catherine doesn't feel fully realized. She's one of Austen's youngest heroines and is very much naive of the larger world and society. She has a very sweet personality but was maddeningly frustrating in her innocence. She has lived a very sheltered life but from a modern standpoint she seems ridiculous to forgive and believe some of John and Isabella's explanations for their behaviour and actions. By the end of the novel though, while Catherine has matured, she is still less independant and self-assured than some of Jane's other heroines such as Anne Elliot or Lizzy Bennett. This is understandable as ""Northanger Abbey"" is an earlier work and while Catherine's character may be less than satisfying to those who've read other Austen works, Henry Tilney makes up for this with his witty banter.I found the scenes in Bath concering Isabella and John to be far more interesting than Catherine's investigations at Northanger concerning General Tilney. While Catherine sees Isabella's comments as only sincere and heartfelt due to her naivety, the reader can see behind the facade that she constructs. The story seemed to drag as soon as Catherine reached the abbey and with the slower pace I lost interest. There was also no secondary storyline which is something I always look forward to in an Austen novel. I'm finding that I have to ration my Austen novels. I only have three more to go and I want to savour them, almost like a last meal. Overall I enjoyed the book but Northanger would definitely go to the bottom of the pile behind ""Persuasion"" and ""Pride and Prejudice""....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Aug 2010,Aug 2010,"Sep 12, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey

Disoriented and afraid, he travels the forests of Poland at night until he comes upon Athos Ruossos at Biskupin, an archaeological site. Athos takes the boy in and brings him to the Greek island of Zakynthos where they endure the war together. Soon after, Athos decides the best thing for Jakob is to emigrate, to Canada specifically. There Jakob grows up, following in Athos' footsteps and falls in love with a woman quite unlike himself. But in the back of his mind he knows he still has to confront the traumatic memories of his past, lest they consume him.Anne Michaels is primarily known as a poet and this is reflected in the book. Her diction and sentence structure flow like water and there are some choice quotes that will give you pause. It was a pleasure to devour her words as they created wonderfully vivid imagery, evoking joy and sadness. Some of her paragraphs contain an element of violence and gore but are written so beautifully that you can't help but admire them.""When the prisoners were forced to dig up the mass graves, the dead entered them though their pores and were carried through their bloodstreams to their brains and hearts. And though their blood into another generation. Their arms were into death up to the elbows, but not only into death – into music, into a memory of the way a husband or son leaned over his dinner, a wife’s expression as she watched her child in the bath; into beliefs, mathematical formulas, dreams. As they felt another man’s and another’s blood-soaked hair though their fingers, the diggers begged forgiveness. And those lost lives made molecular passage into their hands.""While I appreciated Michaels' mastery of words, I felt somewhat lost in the story. The plot feels subservient to the diction and I think this is where Michaels' expertise as a poet does her a disservice. I never felt grounded as the story had a fragmented quality to it and at times I wasn't sure what was happening, a dealbreaker in my mind. There's also a second narrative introduced quite late in the book, in a voice other than Jakob's. I didn't want to abandon him and pick up with another character only 100 pages from the end of the story. It was unnecessary, distracting and this second voice was too similar to Jakob's to have any impact on the reader in terms of seeing the book from a different perspective.In the end, this book is about memory and loss and how we have to learn to let people go, how we can never go home again but learn to make a home for ourselves, to make other people our home. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Feb 2010,Feb 2010,"Jul 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15836.Fugitive_Pieces

This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a time it will. It will become ordinary.""Offred is a handmaid, one of the most important jobs in the Republic of Gilead. She's recently been assigned to a Commander and his wife to provide a child. In this distopian future, very few women are able to conceive and bear children and so, after a military coup and restructering of society, fertile women are enslaved and passed around to continue the new heirarchy. Offred is only one of these women, caught in the middle of a regime change, still able to remember her old life, unsure of her future.The story is told as a recollection of Offred's, leaving much of her backstory to the imagination of the reader. We don't get a detailed description of Offred but this lends itself to the story. Handmaids have their individuality trained out of them but Offred spends the whole book trying to hang onto hers. I think if anyone either than Atwood had written the book it would have collapsed on itself or gotten lost in the plot. This isn't an action-filled book. Much of the conflict comes from internal paranoia on Offred's part, wondering if or when she's going to be caught. The suspense comes from the slow but taut reveal of the history of Gilead, without a glut of exposition to bog down the book.The ending is abrupt and ambiguous, leaving Offred's fate in the hands of the readers but it only feels right that Atwood should leave us unsure of the end. After all, the most disturbing part of this book is how unbelievable it is and yet she describes, step by step how entirely plausible the creation Gilead and handmaid's are. Why shouldn't the reader be left feeling uncomfortable about the circumstances of the book?

City-state kingdoms have sprung up since the fall of the Khalifate. Life continues, along with murders, poisonings and pillaging. In the city of Fezana, Jehane, a Kindath doctor, is preparing to see patients; Ammar ibn Khairan is in town to oversee his pupil, Prince Almalik receive dignitaries; Rodrigo Belmonte, a captain in Valledo's army is riding to Fezana to collect the tribute paid each year to his king. All three are soon to be drawn into a plot involving two kingdoms, political intrigue and religious fanaticism. Kay has crafted an amazing story here with a rich plot that covers a lot of ground, both literally and physically. His world draws obvious parallels with medeival Spain as evidenced by the map included in the book. Religion also plays a strong hand, with the three main religions composed of Asharites, who worship the stars of Ashar, Jaddites who worship the sun-god Jad and Kindaths who worship the sister of the god, represented by the two moons. The allusions to Islam, Christianity and Judaism show Kay's obvious inspiration and allow the reader to gain an understanding of the conflicts and comforts of the three fairly easily.The characters are richly described. As a doctor Jehane has sworn an oath to protect and heal others but at times this tenement is tested, most sorely after a village is raided by Asharites with many of the occupants put to the sword. As well, the reader gets to experience the conflicting emotions among the characters as they get to know one another despite religion and borders and duty to one's country. Kay really makes you care about them and their plight but there were times when I found myself rolling my eyes. When first introducted Rodrigo and Ammar seemed almost indistinguishable from one another. They are both smart and capable warriors and I felt Kay didn't do enough to develop them into two completely separate people. Ammar may be a poet and recite lines throughout the book but his dialogue, his attitude, his body language and tactician's mind all seemed very much in line with Rodrigo. And let's not forget about Jehane. She was consistently referred to as beautiful, almost to the point of distraction. Instead of using ambiguous terms, Kay could have described her hands for example. As a doctor her hands are extremely important, her tools for fighting infection and disease.The story is action-packed but Kay plays the trickster when it comes to plot-points. There were several times throughout the novel where he misleads the reader, pulls at your heartstrings. It was cheeky the first time but after the third I was done with his maddening omission of pronouns and names. As well, while the story moved along at a quick pace, there were sections that were merely summarized which I believe would have benefitted from an action scene. This is most evident at the end of the book where the climax of the plot is summarized instead of described in detail. By glossing over this Kay started to fall into ""Lorna Doone"" territory, something a book should never attempt to do.Overall though, an extremely enjoyable read and a good introduction into Kay's writing. I will definitely be keeping this book in my library. I should also mention that Kay is one of ours, a home grown product of Canada!...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 07, 2010","Jul 12, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6749204-punctuate-it-right

And the lamp burned once more before the altar. I knelt and said a prayer - an ancient, newly-learned form of words. I thought that the builders did not know the uses to which their work would descend. They made a new house with the stones of the old castle. Year by year the great harvest of timber in the park grew to ripeness, until, in sudden frost, came the Age of Hooper. The place was desolate and the work all brought to nothing. Quo modo sedet sola civitas - vanity of vanities, all is vanity. And yet, I thought, that is not the last word. It is not even an apt word - it is a dead word from ten years back.""Charles Ryder is a young student at Oxford University when a chance encounter introduces him to Lord Sebastian Flyte. Sebastian invites Ryder into his family home, Brideshead, and in fact, into his life. But each member of Sebastian's family is somewhat damaged if eccentric. Charles takes to them though as his own family life is less than satisfactory. The two young men grow close over one summer but all too soon things begin to change. Sebastian drinks, driving him far from home and away from Charles. Without his friendship Charles soon becomes estranged from the rest of the family, only returning to Brideshead many years later to find it much changed. This was my first Evelyn Waugh book and he didn't let me down. The flow of his sentence structure and his description I would say were on par with du Maurier's ""Rebecca"" but of a different flavour. If this book were a meal it would most definitely taste of woodsmoke. There is a certain visceral sensuousness to his writing as evinced by this paragraph: ""The sole was so simple and unobtruse that Rex failed to notice it. We ate to the music of the press - the crunch of the bones, the drip of blood and marrow, the tap of the spoon basting the thin slices of breast."" Waugh manages to make eating both a violent and erotic experience.While I did love the writing in the book I found it nearly impossible to connect to and care about the characters. There was almost a vulgarity to their qualms about daily life. I couldn't wrap my head around being so rich as to be hard done by. I know that the reader isn't neccesarily supposed to like the family and their decadent lifestyle but because I didn't care about the characters I didn't care what happenend to them either. Perhaps it's the distance between writer and reader that makes this book feel so inaccesible to me. Waugh did write it more than 60 years ago but to be fair, I have no problem connecting with Cervantes or Austen and their works are far older. My main beef with the book was the point in time at which it started. I know the book is about loss and mourning what has passed but this felt like entering a theatre after the end credits have started. I wanted to see everything from the beginning. I wanted to experience the descent of these people, not reflect on their already decaying family unit. ""Brideshead Revisited"" encompasses love and loss, religion and secularity, loyalty and infidelity, everything one could want in a book. It was unfortunately not the book for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2009,Jan 2009,"Jul 04, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30933.Brideshead_Revisited

Although it was declared that awards would be bestowed based on merit only, that does not always seem to have been the case.""Have you ever felt that an Oscar went to the wrong person or that an undeserving movie won Best Picture? If so, this is the book for you. Danny Peary takes the history of the Academy Awards from 1927-1991 and offers his take on Best Picture, Actor and Actress. He includes vintage photos as well as indepth descriptions of the movies plot and characters. Not only does he justify his choices, he also goes into detail about the history of the Academy Awards and why they made the choices they did. The truth behind some awards is far stranger than you might imagine. The thing I love best about this book is the amount of detail Peary puts into each year. He obviously knows movies, even going so far as to offring runners-up to his choice of winner. He sees things the average moviegoer wouldn't, analyzes scenes and character, digs up the riches they're hiding and puts them on display for us. Take this excerpt about his choice for Best Actor 1946, Jimmy Stewart from ""It's a Wonderful Life"": ""Restless because he can't leave Bedford Falls, he does everything to expend energy, especially moving his hands and arms when talking. It's delightful when he finds Mary (Donna Reed) waiting at the house on their wedding night, amid a romantic setting, and is so stunned that he can't move his arms and must remain speechless. But at other times his arms swing wildly and he talks up a storm, makes speeches, argues with Potter, yells, screams, paces back and forth in front of Mary's house, runs through the streets, races up and down his stairwell, dances a wild Charleston with Mary, fights, jumps, dives into water, and on and on.""The drawbacks are few and far between. Peary's book only runs until 1991, almost twenty years of movies are begging for his opinion.

She, along with her three sisters, Meg, Beth and Amy struggle through the hardships of being young women and make do with an absent father and little money during the American Civil War. They are much comforted by the friendship of their neighbour 'Teddy' Laurence though. And they all have dreams: Jo wants to be a writer, Meg wants to marry and have pretty things, Amy wishes to marry rich and fix her nose and Beth wants to take care of everyone. As they grow up they face the trials of love, marriage and loss, including the formidable Aunt March and gruff Mr. Laurence Sr. I had seen three movie adaptations before reading the book so I was well aware of the plot and characters and knew what to expect. Jo is the main focus of the story, serving as a stand in for Louisa May Alcott as the book is loosely based upon her own childhood. Jo is a strong character with her own convictions and her more modern sensibilities allow readers to connect with her. That being said, some of the dialogue and attitudes of other characters are archaic with the book being set 150 years in the past. I enjoyed the fact that each sister was given equal time and developement withint the book and emerged as individuals. While some of their antics seemed ridiculous such as Amy's obsession with pickled limes (ew), her behaviour when it came to trying to fit in and impress her peers was completely believable. The vivid descriptions are few and far between in this book but my favourite by far was this. ""A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin."" I couldn't help but smile imagining a langourous prince talking to Gertrude. Overall I found this book a slog to get through which was unfortunate. I found it long and tedious. A main frustration came from reading 200 or so odd pages and believing I was finished the book. It turned out the book was split into two parts, the second part being called ""Good Wives"" as Alcott was unsure of how part one would do.

Yet there are children sledding on thehillocks, adults milling about, a path crossing the ice from shore to shore, also shanties with hand-painted signs advertising beef tea and sandwiches, coffee and cake.""Bess Heath lives near the mighty Niagara Falls where her father works as director of the Nigara Power Company. But when she returns home from boarding school for the summer she realizes all is not well. Her father has lost his job and her sister has taken to hiding in her room. Bess' only consolation in a world turned upside down is an encounter with a handsome green-eyed man who helps her load her baggage onto the trolley home. She's intrigued and later comes to know him as Tom Cole but society and her family seem set against their relationship. Cathy Marie Buchanan uses Niagara Falls as a backdrop to introduce a story of love and family, demonstrating how place can affect every aspect of a person's life.It's obvious that Buchanan has put a lot of time and effort into the story. The amount of research and the level of detail when it comes to describing the setting and historical background of the area is staggering. There is so much packed into this book, especially when it comes to the setting that the reader really needs to pay attention to keep from missing anything.Bess is forced to grow up too early when her family loses their status and position in society. Her struggle with the added responsibilities of adulthood make her a believable character. She has hopes and fears like anyone else but here they are front and center as she tries to hold her family together while developing a relationship with Tom. She makes mistakes, shows jealousy and loses her temper, all aspects that serve to make her more relatable to readers.Peppered throughout the book are newspaper articles, photos and drawings that add depth to the story and really bring the history of the falls to life. The articles were especially entertaining as they were a great format for delivering backstory without the need for exposition. I felt a bit mislead by the title though as I assumed the story would take place during the time the falls froze. Instead the story is set more than half a century later, only referencing the event in an article. I also thought the ending tied up too quickly.

He lunged toward her with clenched fists. Veins bulged at his neck.""Mariutza Glapion has been living in a swamp for as long as she can remember. One night she sneaks out to the road, a forbidden place and on her way home, senses something is wrong. She senses the Badness, hears a gunshot in the dark, finds her home empty, her grandfather missing. She finds him dying in a pool of blood and he makes a strange request. Forced to flee her home she encounters Jazz, a musician with strange powers of his own. Together they must solve the mystery her grandfather left for them to solve, all the while avoiding the Badness and the authorities. I received this book as an Early Reviewer from LibraryThing and found the mythology of the world intriguing as Mari belongs to a small group of people called 'The Standing'. She has special skills and powers, is wary of cities and as a result, doesn't know how to survive inside one. Her dialogue has an earthy feel to it and her diction reveals her ignorance of technology and mordern society. She's also very tactile when it comes to describing her world. Olson has some beautiful descriptinos that paint concrete images of the setting. ""Smooth moonlight, soft and timid as a sleeping babe's breath, seeped through the forest canopy, painting Old Man Oak's mossy beard with twisting ribbons of silver and shadow.""Various terms and concepts associated with the mythology of Olson's world are introduced throughout the book but by the end I still wasn't sure what some of them meant. I only saw the 'Badness' as an amorphous blob and wasn't sure exactly how Mari's 'dikh' sight functioned. As well there were various references to the Bible which seemed contrary to a book I would classify as fantasy. Then I realized this book is classified under Christian Fiction and the core of the book relates to a story in the bible.I found it difficult to orient myself at the start of the book. The combination of Mariutza's diction and the mythology of her world launch the reader straight into the unknown. It would have been easier to adjust had the POV not jumped into another character in chapter two. This jumping around occurs for the rest of the novel and included a POV for a character called Daniel Groves that seemed unneccessary. I didn't fully engage in the story until halfway through the book because at that point, the plot felt solid. Also it was difficult to tell how old everyone was. At the beginning of the book I thought Mariutza was quite young but the farther the read the older she seemed to become. She acted like a child though that may only have been to show how apart from the world she really was. Then when she was with Jazz she seemed to age seven or eight years and appeared closer in age to him. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2010,Jan 2010,"Feb 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6481072-powers

Her family uses this to their advantage and her detriment. Her father, Sir Walter is loves looking at himself in the mirror spends money like water. Her sister, Elizabeth follows in his footsteps, ever concerned about social standing. Lady Russell, a close family friend, stands in for her deceased mother; Eight years ago she advised Anne to break off the match between herself and young naval officer Frederick Wenstworth as he would have no means of supporting due to his reduced circumstances. Against her own wishes Anne followed Lady Russell's advice and has regretted it ever since, especially considering she still has feelings for him and he's newly returned with rank and wealth.One of the best parts about this book are the characters. I loved Sir Walter because he was such a slimeball. I was amused every time he opened his mouth. If you doubt the humour of his person, read on. ""Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliott, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion."" As well, I liked seeing into Anne's thoughts, comparing them to her dialogue. The readers see she's a caring individual, not playing at consideration like her father. Everyone takes advantage of her kindness for their own ends though, leaving her vulnerable.I did want more developement in terms of a subplot. Usually with other Austen novels there are subplots that have their own sets of problems and resolutions. These seemed pushed aside, only mentioned in passing. While Anne's story is more than enough to keep the reader's interest, it would have been nice to flesh out a few more stories about the characters we meet. Also, Austen's writing is engaging and elegant but at times requires a second readthrough to capture all the little nuances. Overall I wish I hadn't waited so long to read this book. While ""Pride & Prejudice"" may be considered the best known Austen novel, I enjoyed ""Persuasion"" far more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2009,Jan 2009,"Jan 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2156.Persuasion

She also happens to be one of five girls in a family with an extremely irritating mother. Her sisters are flighty and spend most of their time thinking about soldiers. Lizzy spends her spare time killing zombies but when a new tenant moves into Netherfield, things start to get complicated. The story made me want to know more about this world and how zombies came to ravage England. There are hints peppered throughout the book that the 'plague' started a generation earlier and that London is now a walled fortress. I also liked how Grahame-Smith changed aspects of the plot to fit in with the new zombie storyline. Unfortunately my expectations for this book were blown out of proportion. I thought that the combination of Jane Austen and zombies was a win-win situation but I found myself hung up on the original book.I found it almost impossible to reconcile the Lizzy Bennett of Austen's book and the interpretation by Grahame-Smith. There are scenes with the original thoughts and dialogue and then there are scenes where Lizzy is having not only violent but sexual thoughts. At one point she thinks about chopping off Lydia's head and during another mentions loving Darcy's trousers clinging to hsi My understanding of Regency England and the refined manners of the upper and middle classes does not jive with this interpretation. I know it's supposed to be a fun beach read but I think the fact that I've read ""Pride and Prejudice"" won't let me forget what actually happened. It's more of a modern take but I like Austen to be Austen.I also found it quite easy to distinguish the two writing styles despite Grahame-Smith's best efforts. His additions to the book felt indelicate at times because of the violence and veiled sexuality.

Basinger brings to light the lives of lesser known actors and shows us from the inside out how they were created and kept in line. It's an intimate look at a way of life that has since disappeared, accompanied by a great set of archival photos. My love of classic movies runs deep so this book was right up my alley. The great part about this book is it introduces the reader to actors they may not know as well. It doesn't cover the John Wayne's and Judy Garland's of the era. Instead it introduces readers to other amazing actors like Jean Arthur and William Powell, stars who were famous more than 50 years ago but have since been mostly forgotten. For me, it was nice to read more about a group of actors I'd watched on screen but knew little about. For example, Eleanor Powell was almost singlehandedly responsible for saving Warner Brothers Studios during the Depression. ""Her powerful, low-to-the-ground tap dancing tended to blow any male partner out of the water. She was physically stronger than most of the men available to play opposite her, and she certainly could out-tap everyone.""The reader is told the old studio system is no longer in existence but in its hey day was extremely impressive. MGM could complete a film every nine days. 'In 1950 alone they completed 16 cartoons, 12 ""Travelogues"", 9 ""Pete Smith specialties"", 8 ""People on Parades"", 104 ""News of the Day"" and 41 feature films.' I tried not to let my jaw hit the floor. The amount of complex coordination it would have taken is mindboggling. Basinger references a huge stack of movies and provides a variety of stock and candid photos that help put names to faces and also reveal the variety of talent at the studios. I only wish the book had included more actors or had been longer. It was nice to see how things worked but I almost wanted a more chronological approach to see how things started and follow through to when the system broke down. If you love classic movies then I would highly recommend this book.

And I don't just mean above the ears; I want you to feel these books in your heart, in your soul, and maybe even below your waist.

And trust me, if you read any or all of the books I'm championing here, you'll be shocked at what you find.""If ever there was a book to make you pick up a classic, this is it. Author Jack Murnighan equips the reader with all they need to enjoy what was once known as required reading for English class. He provides a brief taste of content with a story summary and lets the reader know what's sexy in these well-known tomes. If you're wondering about what sex there is to be found in books like ""The Iliad"", you'd be surprised. Another great if somewhat controversial idea was to let the reader know what parts of the classics they can skip.Murnighan's enthusiasm for these books is infective. He provides a survey of classics spanning over 2000 years from various cultures and authors. The amount of time and effort he's put into creating this list is evident but best of all, despite being an academic, this book is written with the layman in mind. Murnighan's prose is humourous and cheeky yet informative. ""I always found it odd that Claudius kills King Hamlet by pouring poison in the the ear. His ear? Wouldn't that have woken him up and given him time to swimmer-tap it out?"" I don't know that I would necessarily call all of the books in the list 'beach reads'. Some are fairly long like ""War and Peace"" while others like ""Middlemarch"" require more than a little focus to comprehend. As well, some titles that I would normally have expected to see on a list like this were absent. While I know Murnighan had to stick to a short list for his book, this is a good excuse for a second book in the same vein.

She had sat there, as far as he knew, for over two decades, unmoving, alone except for a brace of peacocks, currently prostrate at her feet. She had hair the colour of blackmail, a spine as straight as a guillotine, and a face that could sink ships. If she was even slightly surprised, after twenty years, to receive her first visitor, she didn't deign to show it.""It's been thousands of year since the Greek gods ruled from Mount Olympus and things had gone considerably downhill in the intervening years. They're currently crammed into a crumbling flat in London, trying to make ends meet. Artemis is a dog walker, Aphrodite is a phone sex operator and no one can remember the last time they saw Zeus. They're all trying to cope in a modern age where few mortals even even know their names. Some pine for the old days when they were openly worshipped, some have even converted to Christianity like Eros. Regardless of how they spend their days, they're running out of time. Their powers diminish with each use and after they're gone it's just a quick trip to Hades. It's going to take a few clueless mortals to set things to right and save these sorry gods. This book was fantastic. It was funny, easy to get into, entertaining, fast-paced and you don't want to put it down. Phillips clearly knows her Greek mythology as she's incorporated various aspects of the gods into her characters. Ares, the poor man, never has time to relax as there's always some conflict raging in the world. As well, the childish aspect of the gods constantly comes into play. As immortal all powerful beings, there are never any consequences for their actions and as a result, they never mature out of playing to their base emotions. They're somewhat like Cookie Monster; they want what they want when they want it. I also really liked the interpretation of the underworld and how everyone seems to be really bored as there isn't much to do. There was also some great writing, as in the quote I included in the post that help the reader see the gods as ethereal immortals. You can't really see 'hair the colour of blackmail'. You can only imagine what it might look like. I appreciated how many gods were interlaced into the story as well as the sideplot with mortals Neil and Alice.

While trying to survive, Florens finds love and loss, with the women of Vaark's land having to fend for themselves.Morrison conveys the reality of a virgin landscape, offering a brief glimpse of a land still wild, the harsh realities of digging out a life in the 1600s. Her writing, almost more like poetry in this work, has a fluid rolling quality that softly tickles the mind with description and dialogue. Her artistry is evident in that she writes in several voices, all with their own rhythms and cadences. These voices are more often than not dwarfed by the landscape though this is perhaps fitting. Back then the land was as much a threat to survival as was bad weather and illness.One problem with the book is the beginning. An unknown speaker confesses to an act of violence. The form and meaning of this convoluted explanation only become clear towards the end of the book. A reader shouldn't have to struggle that hard just to get into a book.

No wonder the enemy had waited so patiently and confidently.

There are also some interesting characters including Bolitho's commanding officer, Commodore Mathias Pelham-Martin, an antagonistic fool.There's also some beautifully evocative descriptions peppered throughout the book that lend themselves to creating images of 18th century naval life, from sea battles to military drills. For example: ""The sky was hidden by a film of pale cloud which distorted the afternoon sunlight into an angry glare and painted the irregular wavecrests with a harsh bronze hue.""Overall this was an enjoyable read with Bolitho traveling all over and having to deal with his nephew.

The American Revolutionary War is in full swing and their French allies are eager to antagonize the Royal Navy. Bolitho revels in his fast, well-armed ship, hunting privateers and the French while patrolling the Atlantic coast. But he must contend with Tyrell, a first lieutenant who is an American loyalist and a senior officer consumed with gaining personal power and glory, no matter whom he must put in harm's way. Amidst the cannonfire and bloodshed, Bolitho also manages to develop a relationship with an aristocratic lady that may be more than she seems. Kent addresses past events previous to the book, creating a larger world beyond the book and allowing readers to get a better idea of Bolitho's character and attitude towards his crew. ""Sloop of War"" also reads perfectly well as a stand-alone novel. As always, Kent's description and character developement are top notch. We not only get to experience Bolitho as a leader, we also see the world from first lieutenant Tyrell's eyes.

Charles Lamb and Leigh Hunt were described by a friend as savouring 'the flavour of a rare passage of poetry with an exquisite relish, as though it were a morsel of ripe and juicy fruit.'""Anne Fadiman is a writer and within this slim volume details her love affair with books among 18 essays covering various literary topics from what people use as bookmarks to the ever evolving nature of the pen. She also writes on courtly versus carnal book lovers and the strange collections that accumulate in personal libraries. I picked up this little beauty on a whim. I must also confess that it was the cover that first attracted me. I love books written specifically with book lovers in mind. This is the kind of read a bibliophile luxuriates in and returns to again and again. I was a little apprenhensive about this book as essays aren't my favourite form of writing but Fadiman makes it work. Not only is her writing humourous but it's also informative. The essays are peppered with little tidbits about literature, authors, life, etc. In ""The Literary Glutton"", she mentions how her son's DNA is now inextricably linked with Goodnight Moon because he'd chewed up and drooled on the corners. From there she segues into why so few first editions of Alice in Wonderland exist. They have been eaten by their readers. Books, literally devoured.As well, the variety of subjects keeps the pace quick and the material interesting. Fadiman admits to a strange collection composed entirely of polar exploration. It's these quirks along with her diction that make these essays a joy to read. This book is a beautiful but tasty snack for the literarily inclined. My only complaint is that this book is altogher too short! I can't say enough about Fadiman's writing. Every book lover should pick up a copy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2009,Jan 2009,"Apr 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46890.Ex_Libris

To quote directly is has, ""Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles."" The story starts with Buttercup, a farmer's daughter and her slow but inevitable relationship with Farm Boy aka Wesley. But when Wesley goes off to seek his fortune and doesn't return, Buttercup is persuaded into an uncomfortable engagment with Prince Humperdink, while still pining for her lost love. But things take a turn when Buttercup is kidnapped and encounters the Dread Pirate Roberts. I saw the movie first and imagined that this was one of those rare instances where the movie improves upon the book. I could not have been more wrong. This is one of the funniest and most enjoyable fantasy novels I've ever read. The complexity of the 'Morgenstern' plot draws the reader in and never lets go. The level of humour in this book is unparalleled in any other book I've read. The history of Florin and Guilder is amusing and ridiculous. ""There had been the Olive War, the Tuna Fish Discrepancy, which almost bankrupted both nations, the Roman Rift, which did send them both into insolvency, only to be followed by the Discord of the Emeralds, in which they both got rich again, chiefly by banding together for a brief period and robbing everyone within sailing distance.""As well, the characters are so distinct and well-defined. Each has their own quirks. Goldman certainly has a way with words when it comes to description. My favourite line happens to be ""Queen Bella was shaped like a gumdrop. And coloured like a raspberry."" How can you not grin at that?My only complaint is that it takes a few pages to get to the actual plot of the story. First the reader has to get through the Morgenstern plot and listen to the narrator go on about his father.I would highly recommend this book to people who like love stories, a certain level of ridiculousness and of course, swashbuckling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2009,Jan 2009,"Apr 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21787.The_Princess_Bride

She folded her arms, and with her fingertips stroked the brocading of her cloth-of-silver sleeves. Below the window where she stood, the small paved rectangle of the Penitential Yard lay cold and gray in the dawn. The courtyard was deep in the oldest part of the Numera, next to the prison beneath the Bucelon Ravelin, and in the courtyard's center stood a double gallows.""A horde of barbarians are invading The Ascendancy, an ages old kingdom ruled by Archates, an incompetent fool. His daughter Theatana is a power hungry wacko and Erkai the Chain, an evil sorcerer has just returned from the dead. Mandine Dascaris, Archates' other daughter and heir to the throne, must deal with all three. Only the Signata, a long lost magic that will help her defeat her enemies but she can't do it alone. With the help of Key Mec Brander, a knight, they will defend the kingdom and preserve The Ascendancy.I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I read it last year on the plane and found myself unable to put it down. It's very typical of your straight forward fantasy novel with good versus evil, ancient bloodlines, powerful bad guys and a complex mythology but I was entertained.Mandine and Key make an interesting pairing. Their relationship slowly evolves throughout the book and is put to the test more than once. Their are also some interesting additions to the fantasy novel mythos such as the cataphract, a horse/cat/bull mix that serve as mounts for the knights of The Ascendancy. Jones does a good job of creating a full world with its own rules and inhabitants. Another positive that I noticed is that Jones is Canadian. Can-Con is always a plus in my book.My problems with the book stem from the plot and characters. Key's background seemed too cliche in terms of his family history and frankly, I'd read it before in half a dozen books. He and Mandine just happen to get thrown in together and low and behold it was fated they should meet. As for the plot it starts with a punch but the tension starts to dissipate towards the middle. This series has definite potential and was an enjoyable read but the story needs to step it up in terms of tension and originality. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Mar 2009,"Apr 03, 2009","Mar 30, 2009",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/621485.The_Stone_and_the_Maiden

Like Bolitho's new uniform on the wey jetty, the Destiny seemed to shine through the drifting muck. From her lithe and buff hull to her three mastheads she was a thoroughbred. All her shrouds and standing rigging were freshly blacked down, her yards crossed, and each sail neatly furled to match its neighbour.""p12Richard Bolitho is now an officer, newly promoted to third lieutenant. His jump from midshipman's berth to wardroom is a significant one and he's been assigned to a new ship, Destiny. The crew has been tasked with a secret mission in the Caribbean involving revolutionaries. Britain is currently at peace but there are stirrings in the American colonies. Along the way Bolitho runs into pirates, storms and illness. He also must decide where his loyalities lie as his captain makes it clear that his command comes first, before king and country. This story is chock full of action. We not only flashback to where Bolitho meets his trusty coxswain Stockdale, we also get great battles on land and sea. Bolitho gets romantically involved and comes close to death. The variety within the plot keeps things interesting. I really liked the dynamics among the crew. Captain Dumaresq was just the right amount of crazy to frustrate both the reader and Bolitho. This story also showed how Bolitho handled his new responsibilities. He's not just one of the crew anymore and has trouble adjusting as an 18 year old trying to tell men three times his age what to do. It's been my experience that romance in books or movies about war tend to ruin the plot. It's no different here. The romantic subplot was unnecessary and detracted from the story. Overall though, I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 30, 2009","Mar 25, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1091801.Stand_into_Danger

The sound it gave out was low but piercingly clear; it seemed to fill the whole room with echoes.""Owen Hughes has a tough life. His crochety grandfather who runs the Pennygaff museum takes him for granted and constantly finds fault with his work. One night the Telyn Teirtu, the golden harp of legend is stolen from the museum and Owen is accused of the crime. He must recover it before his grandfather or the town of Pennygaff will forgive him. Fortunately he has a few allies to help him along the way. His good friend Arabis, her father and pet bird accompany him on a quest through a dangerous forest, into an underground system of caverns and into Castle Malyn. Unfortunately the castle is owned by the Marquess of Malyk who is obsessed with gold and his guest, the Seljuk of Rum has his own reasons for wanting the harp. Owen must outwit each in turn to reclaim the harp and return it to its rightful place.My favourite character was Arabis. She's a bit off the wall, talks to her bird a lot but she's original. Owen on the other hand felt somewhat cliche. He's an orphan, the other children in the village bully him and he maybe kinda likes Arabis a little bit. Aiken has a very lyrical style of writing that made for a very fluid read. I also liked the mythology incorporated into the book. Not only did the story incorporate several different creatures and stories from Welsh legend but they were seamlessly integrated into the story. My main problem with the book was caring about the main characters. I didn't feel invested with them, despite enjoying Arabis' character. I was really looking forward to this book because it took place in Wales and I thought I'd be safe because this book won a Guardian Award in the 60s.

Then there are people who stand around and watch them eat it. Sometimes I think it ain't right to stand and watch them do it.""The Hubbards are a familiy with ambition. Their greed is all consuming as they struggle to profit from exploiting what is left of the Old South after the Civil War. Ben Hubbard is head of the family with his younger brother Oscar towing the family line as a sheep would obey a sheperd. Regina is their sister, wife to Horace, mother to Alexandra, with a dangerous hunger for profit. The trio hatch a plan for a cotton factory in town, partnering with a Northerner but they need to raise the capital to start building. By coincidence Horace has a great number of bonds in a safety deposit box and it seems up to the siblings to pressure him to donate to their future financial happiness. Should their plan fail, Oscar's son Leo just happens works at the bank. I'm not a great reader of plays so this was a good introduction to post-modern theatre. Hellman has a real understanding of dialogue as the tension rises, the sentences get shorten, the diction more terse. Also, the infighting between siblings is believable and enticing to read. The intrigues of their attempted manipulation of each other reminds me of ""The Lion in Winter"" with bickering royals. My complaint is how few and weak the protagonists seem. Horace, Birdie, Oscar's wife and Alexandra are all that stand up to the Hubbards. Horace is an invalid, Bertie has personal problems and Alexandra is a child. They seem unequal to the task of holding on through the play. If Hellman had only created one strong character I would have felt the odds more in their favour. It's a good play and was even turned into a movie with Bette Davis as Regina. If you're a fan of reading about sibling rivalries this is the book for you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 06, 2009","Mar 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/280797.The_Little_Foxes

Can't parse the accents of smoke, or smell the beach as a charnel ground of clams, the non-stop enormity of this."" p31""Mount Appetite"" by Bill Gaston is a collection of stories, tied together by the protagonists' search for something unseen or unknowable. Readers will meet a faith healer who lives in a trailer with a donation box outside; a professional taste-tester who's dying and can't stand his neighbours carrots; a graduate who researches fish, stays with her unfertilized charges while suspecting her husband of infidelity; a brother encounters tragedy on a baseball field.Gaston's style has a natural, organic flow. This easily lends itself to the description of the landscape, an important aspect of his stories. The stories are diverse, the voices varied, giving the book a freshness that short story collections often lack. He pulls the reader in, almost drowns them in waves of original diction, never letting go until the last page. Each story is a universe, cupped in the hand.There are so many great lines within this collection ""her mouth shaped like a complaint"", ""fingers tooling in flesh and oil"", ""The dutiful tides of Indian Arm, the rich, fish-rank croaks of gulls and herons, the smell of shattered cedar, the sacred light in a dewdrop reflecting the sun, the mysterious light in a dewdrop reflecting the moon.""The only frustrating aspect of Gaston's writing is what feels like a lack of resolution. ""The Angel's Share"" involves Evelyn, a young woman running from the death of her father. While the story has an otherworldly west coast feel to it, the ending feels incomplete. We only dip into the relationship between Evelyn and her father whereas a full swig would have been more helpful in understanding her character. This truncation, this lack of closure occurs in several other stories and is frustrating as the rest of Gaston's works are entirely satisfying....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 03, 2009","Feb 23, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/990837.Mount_Appetite

Splendid blaring sound, very close, and once again that night I felt the actual chill right up the spine, and the slightly embarrassing eye sting, of easy emotion about nothing."" p34A group of seemingly regular people meet after hours in the basement of a university to discuss matters otherworldly. One has a photo from a Clark Gable movie that doesn't exist; one has a campaign button from Kennedy's second term; one has a recording from a man who saw the Titanic pull into New York. They are the remnants of ""The Project"", a former secret government organization dedicated to traveling back in time with supposed ulterior motives.This sequel to ""Time and Again"" has our protagonist Simon Morley living happily in 1880s New York, having ensured that ""The Project"", never comes into existence. Someone travels back though to put the original timeline back in place. Through a series of events Morley travels forward in time only to find himself confronted with the same group he tried to disband. He is then convinced that he could help to avert World War I and travels back to New York in 1912. He is set to find an agent due to travel to Europe who has important papers that will quell any ideas of warmongering among the governments of the day. Simon does his best to track down the mysterious ""Z"" and eventually finds himself aboard the RMS Titanic, knowing full well what her fate entails.There are some beautiful descriptions in this book as well as historic photos, ads and drawings that help to give a sense of the atmosphere and attitude of the time. They show a people dressed to the nines and a world opening up with the advent of aviation.Simon also happens to run into some well known personages such as Al Jolson, Teddy Roosevelt. We see history through his eyes when he meets aviator Frank Coffyn and wonders when Charles Lindburgh is going to show up.I'm a fan of speculative fiction and loved the little details that Finney inserts, having obviously done quite a bit of research on the period for Simon to have so many cultural experiences in 1912. We get a sense of how he travels back in time but much is left to the imagination when delving deeper into the how and why.The problem with the book is Finney seems to get wrapped up in his historic figures and photos. The details are wonderful and the reader feels they're being safely led down one path when suddenly the book ends. Finney's conclusion leaves much to be desired as well as room for another book, in which the whole mess of Simon's time traveling experiences might have been explained....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 21, 2009","Feb 18, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/72694.From_Time_to_Time

Almost without exception, there is a television or radio broadcast that indelibly etched the moment in our imagination, weaving itself into our memories of the event itself."" - page xiiiThis book is a compendium of events that have influenced the world for the past 70 years. They include events both political and social, full of joy and grief. Each story has accompanying photos as well as cds with the actual broadcasts that changed the lives of so many. Small details are included to help flesh out the description of events. For example, both Neil Armstron and Buzz Aldrin wore 185-pound spacesuits for their moonwalk but thanks to the moon's gravity they had little trouble getting around. Events like the moon landing have helped to shape our world today and it's thanks to those broadcasters who informed the world.The Good:This book causes curiosity. After reading about the Hindenburg and the fact that the US, the world's only source for helium, had priced the precious gas out of reach of the Germans, I wanted to know more. The book is also educational as well as reflective. I'd always assumed Korea was divided after the 1950 Korean War but it turns the country was separated into north and south after WWII.Amazing photos accompany each story, giving the reader insight into the time and place of the events. My personal favourite was the celebration at the Brandenberg Gate during the reunification of Germany. Night had fallen but the scene was lit with blazing lights and fireworks. People were crammed together, surrounding the gate that had once served as a passage between the two Berlins.There are also three cds that include the actual broadcasts from the stories. They really brought the events to life and you can track the passage of time throughout. For example, you can hear the formality and the archaic diction from the man reporting on the Hindenburg disaster.In all I would recommend the book to history lovers. This book is chock full of events from the past and the cds bring them back to life.The Bad:I was curious as to the decision to start in 1937 with the Hindenburg disaster. There were earlier events that gripped the world that I thought could have been included such as the Lindbergh kidnapping. I was hoping for a broader spectrum of broadcasts but the majority of the stories seemed squished into the 90s.I wish that there had been more international stories included in this book. It seemed too Amero-centric to me. While I agree that many moments in American history gave the world pause, such as the moon landings, I don't think stories like ""Truman defeats Dewey"", belong in the same category, let alone the same book.As well, there were some stories I couldn't relate to, as they had either happened before my time or had little impact on my life. I didn't grow up in the era of the Cold War so it's hard to comprehend the anxiety around atomics and the Cuban Missile Crises.The Ugly:Somebody find Eli Wallach....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2009","Dec 17, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/969778.We_Interrupt_This_Broadcast

While ""if it bleeds it leads"" may still apply to journalism, no one welcomes the paralyzing terror that news organizations seem hellbent on shoving down our throats. It seemed as if all we could do was gird our loins and hope for the best until I came upon this book from MiniBookExpo In it, author Chris Turner explains what various countries and companies around the world are doing to create environmentally friendly and sustainable communities. For example, Singapore is working on a zero-emission automobile project and currently suffers from a grid-lock free city. The island of Samso, near Denmark has reduced their CO2 emissions to less than zero. And did you know that the Reichstag in Berlin generates its own power from vegetable oil?This is the first book I've read that doesn't spell doom and gloom for our future. Turner focuses on the positive, on the leaps we've made in sustainable technology. He also makes it sound surprisingly easy to switch over to a more sustainable lifestyle. The book is helpfully divided into sections that each address areas of concern. From power to transport to housing, Turner draws upon examples from various countries and explains how they're adapting to the needs of their people and the changing world around them.The leaps and bounds in technology though, sound like something out of Star Trek. A high-performance glass made by French company Saint-Gobain, is designed to allow 75 percent of available light in but only 25 percent of the heat and is ideally suited for Southern India's climate where it's being put to good use. As well currently ten percent of the roofs in Germany are covered in vegetation. They keep the buildings cool in the heat and warm in the cold, produce oxygen and provide great green space for workers to use for relaxation.One danger that books on heavy subjects often suffer from is a dry style and complicated language but this book is surprisingly readable, most likely because Turner is a journalist. The writing also reads more like fiction at times, pulling the reader along. ""The grey sky faded fast into black. In fits and starts, the lights of the village came on, gold and orange and the strobing blue of a TV or two against the encroaching dark. I felt ecstatic in the warm embrace of it all.""My only complaint was the swearing peppered throughout the book. I can understand the need to get angry at our current state of affairs but it diminishes the message and academic candor of the book.If you're concerned about what we're doing to meet the challenges ahead of us then I would highly recommend this book. Turner provides a myriad of examples that give me hope for what we can accomplish....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2009","Nov 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2294452.The_Geography_of_Hope

I heard a confused noise about me, but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky"" - page 7In the same vein as ""The Odyssey"" and ""Castaway"", ""Gulliver's Travels"" takes us on four different voyages with Lemuel Gulliver as the adventurous traveler. He's tied down by Lilliputians who bury people upside down and punish fraud with death; dressed up by Brobdingnagians where he defends himself from giant bees with a fly stinger; held hostage by crazed mathematicians called Laputians who travel the countryside in their floating diamond fortress; pitied by horse-headed philosophers whose name sounds similar to the clearing of one's throat.I found this book incredibly frustrating. The main reason being that Swift's satire as a book just didn't work for me. I'm sure the reason being that I'm so far removed from the 18th century society Swift was mocking. I feel that the book may have worked better as a lecture.I had so many questions about various delicious tidbits Swift doles out. For example, there was a temple in Lilliput ""polluted by an unnatural murder"". What exactly happened we never find out. As well, the idea of the Laputians calling people back from the dead and conversing with them was very H.G. Wells. I also liked how the floating diamond fortress only occasionally crushed people.What I found interesting and enjoyed though, was far outweighed by what I found boring and pedantic, especially when it came to describing how the diamond fortress stayed aloft. We skip moments that might have added to the story like Gulliver's shipwreck. The reader is only given a small summary of what happened and they miss what might have been an amazing description of the storm and his survival. As well, Swift occasionally writes ""I shall not trouble the reader"", as if to excuse him from removing what little excitement might be found in a particular story. The sentences are convoluted, there's little description of action and the plot suffers while Swift's busy making his point about society and everything about it that he finds insufferable.The thing I find most frustrating though is that Swift could have done so much more with the story. It could have stayed a satire while beefing up the story. Instead of spending so much time describing the silly rituals and culture of the specific peoples he meets, Gulliver could have been taking action. The part where he's attacked by giant bees is exciting and interesting but it takes up less than a paragraph before Swift moves on. The result being that if I was asked I couldn't tell you much about what happens in the book because that's exactly what happens.

The family's dirty laundry lay at the heart of the investigation, their washerwoman was a key witness, and the investigation threw up three clues of cloth: a flannel, a blanket and a missing nightdress."" - page 70In an English country house in 1860, three year old Saville Kent was murdered and thrown down a privy. This incident shocked the country and became the focus for Detective-Inspector Jonathon Whicher, a member of the newly formed detective force at Scotland Yard. What followed were a variety of false leads, trials and years of painful silence. Throughout this journey to discover Saville's murderer, Kate Summerscale shows us how the investigation evolved, what went wrong and how it informed on the growing field of detecting both at Scotland Yard and in literature.The Good:I really enjoyed the fact that we see the story from before the murder until long after it was committed. Summerscale gives a full account of the incident and follows the consequences to their conclusion. She doesn't leave anything out, including colour inserts to give us an idea of what the family looked like and blueprints to show us a layout of Road Hill House. It's obvious that a copious amount of research has gone into this book and I appreciated the inclusion of footnotes. For example, apparently a ""defendant as not allowed to give evidence at his or her own trial until 1898."" This had an impact on the various trials that took place after the murder.Also, it was interesting to see the proliferation of newspapers at this time and how they sensationalized stories to make money. They may not seem different from today's tabloid newspapers but in that day and age newspapers were often guilty of libel and outright lies when it came to cases like murder. Summerscale calls journalists ""crusaders for truth"" and ""sleazy voyeurs"" for their earnest need for stories and biased coverage of said stories. In the Saville Kent case, the papers not only attacked various members of the Kent family, accusing them with no evidence but they also went after Whicher.The Bad:There was so much detail about the investigation and trial that I felt overwhelmed. At times the book read more like an academic piece than a story. I was really looking for more of a story and instead the investigation read more like a technical playbook. This is the weakness of the book. I was also disappointed with the ending though this is no fault of Summerscale's. The outcome of the case leaves something to be desired.It was almost more interesting to see how detectives operated and the how real cases influenced an influx of detective stories by people like Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. For example, ""Lady Audley's Secret"" by Mary Braddon and ""Bleak House"" by Charles Dickens were written in the period with various influences from the ""detective fever"" that had taken over England.The Ugly:Somebody find Eli Wallach....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2008","Sep 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1747896.The_Suspicions_of_Mr_Whicher

Only I will remain."" page 15Sometime in the distant future humans are scattered to the winds and now live all across the universe, ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Trade and travel between inhabited planetary systems is made possible by spice. Spice is life and can only be found on the inhospitable planet of Arrakis, backwater of the universe. It's covered in sand and in the deep desert, giant worms roam at will. It's here that Duke Leto and his family of the House Atreides are sentenced as Shaddam fears his popularity among the Great Houses. Leto's consort the Lady Jesscia is a Bene Gesserit, a group of women who practice a type of eugenics on the bloodlines of the Great Houses and hold the strings of power behind their backs. Their son, Paul, has been ripped from a homeland with an abundance of water and must adapt to a new and harsher reality.Shaddam isn't the only man worried about House Atreides. House Harkonnen decides now is the perfect moment to strike and remove a rival House. Shortly after the Atreides arrive, the planet is attacked by Harkonnen troops and what is left of the Duke's house must retreat to the desert and regroup if they hope to survive. Throughout the book author Frank Herbert delivers detailed information on how this universe operates and frequently makes references to the past, allowing readers to piece together how things have come about. In fact, he creates a world real enough to grind between your teeth.I first learned of Dune after watching the Space miniseries and then the 1980s version with Patrick Stewart. A blasphemous way to be introduced to a classic I know. But after watching the story unfold on my television, I decided to pick up the book and was not disappointed. As a story it stands out, not only for the obvious time and effort put into it - Herbert spent five years on the story - but also because the reader is treated with intelligence. Herbert doesn't waste time explaining everything. Instead he respects the reader enough to let them puzzle out the details and culture of this universe. Every time I re-read it, the story leaves me with new insight.The writing isn't just scientifically technical though, it's also quite beautiful and easy to visualize. It's obvious that Herbert took great care in writing his world to life. ""She glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled graygreen of bushes - dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung over the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a silvery cast-light."" page 67""Now she only saw the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads."" page 213It's a book I highly recommend if only to experience Herbert's world and blend of politics, religion, fate, ecology and symbols. If you're interested in sci-fi and don't know where to start then begin here.

Suzanne happens to be the product of an affair and her mother decides Suzanne has to make up for those sins. As well, her parents and step-sisters are concerned about family finances as the sisters are in need of dowries. It's decided that to save on costs, Suzanne will enter a convent. There she is subjected to both love and hatred as well as the unwelcome advances of a lecherous Mother Superior.The Good:Some of Diderot's writing is lyrical, even poetic. For example, ""A novice-mistress is always the most indulgent sister who can be found. Her object is to hide from you all the thorns of the vocation, she subjects you to a course to the most carefully calculated seduction. Her function is to darken still more the shades of night which surround you, to lull you into slumber, to throw dust in your eyes, to fascinate you, and ours paid special attention to me."" - page 23The story is pretty racy for the 1760s and Diderot has an interesting take on homosexuality, a subject which was even more contentious in the 1700s than it is today. The introduction gives us insight into his treatment of it in the book. ""Hitherto homosexual behaviour had been considered either an unspeakable abomination in the eyes of God and man or alternatively one of the two or three eternal themes of pornography. Few had treated it objectively and still fewer with any attempt at sympathy or understanding. Diderot does both."" While a Mother Superior uses her authority to force herself upon Suzanne, taking advantage of her naivete, Suzanne also has other lesbian experiences within the convent which are far kinder and consensual.You may be able to tell that Diderot isn't a fan of the church. In fact he was considered to be an atheist. His views on religion may have had something to do with the death of his sister. She was a nun and apparently passed away from being overworked in a convent.The Bad:I found this story extremely boring despite being less than 200 pages long. Suzanne is always suffering at the hands of someone. If it isn't her mother than it's her convent. I found it difficult to believe that for most of her stay at the second convent that she would be singled out and harassed. She's thrown in a cell and her fellow nuns steal from her in order to keep her in the convent. Suzanne didn't seem important enough for people to waste their time on her and I also found it frustrating that she skips over various parts of her life in the convent that might have actually been interesting. For example, she tells the reader she won't go into details about her novitiate and yet says that it is the pleasantest period of monastic life.The book makes more sense when you understand that it wasn't originally intended for public consumption. It was a practical joke to lure one of Diderot's friends, the Marquise de Croismare, back to Paris. The novel is told in a series of letters as if it were a true story. Diderot hoped the Marquise would feel so bad for Suzanne that he would come back to the city and rescue her.The Ugly:As well the nature of Suzanne's harassment was somewhat sadistic. At times it seemed as if Diderot was almost enjoying describing her torture at the hands of other nuns.Rating: 2/5...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 21, 2008","Sep 11, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18216.The_Nun

Most States nowadays are willy-nilly passive, subject always to successive alien forces. Spain still declines in the active mood. She is not a great Power, but in her minor way she is one of the prime movers still - still a nation that sets its own standards."" - page 22Jan Morris, travel writer extraordinaire shows us an in-depth look at Spain in which we traverse time and space, examining the rich and varied history of the country. We are exposed to Spain's triumph as a world power and her slow but inevitable slip into relative obscurity on the world stage. We see her domination of world events and her global isolation, her tolerance and persecution of peoples, her Jekyll and Hyde personality. This duality plays out over the history, the landscape and the peoples of Spain.The Good:One thing I believe is most important in travel books is providing a flavour of the country to readers. Jan has this talent in spades. Here's a taste of Spain in Jan's description her description of the running of the bulls in Pamplona.""Blood runs, men are often wounded, poor padded blindfold horse are gored, the bull inevitably dies and is dragged out for beef. They crowd all around, that Greek chorus of the bull-ring, with its little cigars clenched between its teeth, its cardboard sun-visors on its foreheads, its one-peseta cushions plumped beneath its bottoms on the hard seats - the crowd all around seems animated, to the foreign eye, chiefly by a brutish lust for blood."" - page 31Morris ties in the history of Spain to explain her slow evolution from world power to industrialized nation. She portrays the Spanish as a fearless and sometimes brutish people, quoting Philip II as saying he ""ruled the world with two inches of paper."" She also notes though that ""between 1814 and 1923 there were forty three coups d'etat"" and that Spain was ""strategically so inessential that the First World War contemptuously passed her by."" The truth of this is such that when I was learning about WWI, I never questioned why Spain wasn't involved.The other attractive aspect to this book is the writing. As always with Jan Morris, the writing draws you in with its rich, descriptive detail. She's able to dig into the truth of a place, to get to core of what it is to live there. The sentences just drip with gorgeous imagery.""You are seldom halfway in Spain. It is either fearfully hot or frightfully cold. You are either a good man or a bad one, either very rich or very poor, either a fanciful church-goer or an out-and-out disbeliever. The light is brilliant, the atmosphere is preservative, the colours are vivid - so vivid, for all the vast monotony of the meseta, that sometimes this seems like a painted country, as the mauve and purple shadows shift across the hills, as the sun picks out a village here, a crag there, as the clouds idly scud across the candlewick landscape of olives or cork okas, and the red soil at your feet seems to smoulder in the heat."" - page 46The best thing about Jan's books is that they're not just about travel. She includes literary references, historical detail, personal memories and more. My copy was less than 200 pages but felt so full. It was the home of Roman emperors, a bastion for artists like Goya, Dali and Picasso, an inspiration for Hemingway and a country that at the time believed ""Cervantes mocked its pretensions of chivalry in the book that is said to have killed a nation.""The Bad:This book was published in the mid 70s and I wondered how this wonderful picture of Spain could still be current. Here Morris references the Spanish Civil War, an event only 30 years prior to the book. From this I could only imagine that her description of Spain would be somewhat archaic in today's age.""The time-lag still makes Spain an anachronism among the nations. Her industrial revolution is really only happening now, and in many ways she retains the simplicity, even the innocence of a pastoral nation."" - page 26Morris does update her books with every publishing but barring a complete rewrite and a return to Spain, I don't think she can accurately capture what Spain is today. The most you can hope for in this book is a description of the Spain that was. Nonetheless though, the book is a fantastic introduction to a country full of conflicting opinions and traditions.The Ugly:Somebody find Eli Wallach.Rating: 4/5...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2008","Sep 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/462194.Spain

Talking of it could not stop its coming; it was better to put the thought of it behind one, and to be merry while the sun still shone."" - page 209It's 1815 and Napoleon, only recently escaped from Elba, has crowned himself Emperor again and marches on the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The coalition forces to stand against the French are massing, led by the Duke of Wellington (aka ""Old Hookey""). This news does little to dampen the spirits of the people of Brussels. Parties are constant with women pairing off with smart looking soldiers in scarlet. One of these women is Lady Barbara Childe, the beautiful but scandalous widow who cares for naught what people think of her. As of late she has set her sights on Colonel Charles Audley, an aides de camp to Wellington and ignores the whispers that she will ruin him. The drums of war rumble in the background while speculation grows as to whether the pair will endure.The Good:This book is courtesy of the Mini Book Blogger Expo so I'd like to thank them for giving me the opportunity to read this story.I appreciated the fact that Georgette Heyer was well-known for her historical fiction and dedication to research. Her thoroughness in evident in both the dialogue and diction that were accurate to the period. It lends an air of authenticity to the characters and the world Heyer has created. Also, her descriptions are luscious in their detail. For example: ""The lurid light, the flickering flashes in a cloud like a huge pall, the clatter in the sky as of a giant's crockery being smashed, made even the boldest quail, and sent many flying to their homes."" - page 330/331There was also a good deal of humour and witty banter, especially between the two main protagonists, Audley and Childe. Humour is difficult to write and I imagine it would be even more so in a book of historical fiction.Something you may also notice is how well everyone is put together. The soldiers are mentioned seeming to be more concerned with the condition of their uniforms than the fact they may be dead by next week. Heyer contrasts this wonderful naivety with the truth and horror of war and how it affects her characters. ""Some of the old soldiers lit pipes, and lay smoking and cracking joke, but every now and then there would be a sob from some man hit by a splinter, or a groan from a boy with a limb shattered by caseshot."" - page 381The Bad:While I am somewhat familiar with the events of the Napoleonic Wars, I would have appreciated a summary at the start of the book as I was confused about the story's setting and how the various characters involved came to be in Brussels. Also, a map detailing the battle of Waterloo would have been much appreciated. There were several chapters dedicated to the battle but without the ability to place various characters and skirmishes, I was lost, confused and bored with the action.The book was difficult to get into as a glut of characters are introduced with some of them calling each other ""brother"" and ""sister"" when they are merely in laws. A variety to titles and ranks were thrown about and it would have been nice to have a list of rankings or real life characters at the back of the book that I could refer to.Also, the word ""infamous"" was repeated several times throughout the book.

He hates his job, he has to support his ungrateful family and he's recently devolved into a bug. This story isn't just about Gregor though, it's also a study into family dynamics and how people can turn on one another when pushed to the limit. His family has a hard time accepting his ""condition"" and that's when things begin to go downhill.The Good:This book begins much like ""The Shipping News"" in that the story arc is reversed with the climax taking place at the beginning and the remainder being a slow denouement. This mirrors Gregor's descent from human to vermin both physically and mentally, a descent from civilization into isolation.This story is told in the same vein as classic transformation tales and there's an interesting parallel in Ovid's ""Metamorphosis"" in the story of Arachnee. But Gregor's story isn't typical in that he undergoes a negative transformation. Kafka says Gregor had been suffering from ""unsettling dreams"" but it explains nothing. We're not meant to understand why Gregor transforms though we still question it as his family does. They end up transforming as well, forced to change thanks to Gregor's ""condition"". His sister ends up getting a job and his parents change from ""Mom"" and ""Dad"" to Mr. and Mrs. Samsa as they become more removed from their son, forgetting he was ever human.While this book has been analyzed from every angle I did think it was interesting to note that Kafka never really says ""cockroach"". The English translation says ""monstrous vermin"" and the original German says ""insect"" or ""bug"" and yet we associate Gregor turning into a cockroach, a most grotesque bug. Perhaps subconsciously, readers see Gregor having fallen so far that he becomes something unanimously hated. This may have been Kafka intent because we do see Gregor's actions become parasitic. He lives off of his family, depending on them for almost everything.There are various ideas about how Gregor's condition is reflected in Kafka's own isolation and daddy issues. To be sure, Gregor's family's acceptance of him in his current form slowly deteriorates. Their true natures are revealed in how they adapt, financially and emotionally to the situation. Gregor also, begins to deteriorate, his mind becoming more ""bug-like"" over time, the status of his room reflected in his own personal hygiene.The Bad:Why was Gregor bending over backwards to help support his family? His sister was good for nothing and his father seemed ungrateful for the money his son brought in.""And was his sister now supposed to work-who for all her seventeen years was still a child and whom it would be such a pity to deprive of the life she had led until now, which had consisted of wearing pretty clothes, sleeping late, helping in the house, enjoying a few modest amusements, and above all playing the violin?"" If Gregor had to go to all the trouble of being a traveling salesman the least his sister could do was stop buying pretty dressed and pull her own weight by having a job. If she wants to study music that's fine but don't make your brother put his back out trying to pay for it.If you're into fast dialogue, vicious action and exciting description then maybe this isn't the book for you. The slow pacing and plodding characters make this book feel longer than it is. There were also some overlong, confusing sentences that weren't worth the effort to figure out. In all it's a very dry read with various unanswered questions that some may find frustrating.The whole family including Gregor, seem far too calm about the situation. There was that initial panic about him but they seemed to settle down too quickly.The Ugly:I'm not a fan of bugs, especially cockroaches so if you're not into bugs then either skip those parts or skip this book entirely....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 14, 2008","Aug 11, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis

Even today in China and Japan, where Khubilai once reigned and where the battles and shipwrecks that marked his failed invasions played out, most do not have more than a cursory understanding of what really happened.""Khubilai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, took control of his grandfather's empire and for a time ruled China as Emperor. In 1274 and 1281 he tried to invade Japan, failing both times. The story that most of the world knows is the second invasion was supposedly destroyed by a ""divine wind"", otherwise known as a kamikaze. This gave rise to the idea that as an island nation, Japan had the divine protection of the gods. No one knew what had really happened to these invasion fleets until the early 1908s when mechanical engineer and WWII veteran, Torao Mozai made a discovery off Takashima Island.The Good:Delgado tells a good story around the facts when this book could have easily been a dry academic text. Things are described in layman's terms, making it easy for the average person to understand. As well, the reader gets a good background on ships, sailing and trading in Ancient China, showing how technologically advanced the Chinese were. They invented the stern rudder whereas it was unknown in the Mediterranean until the 13th century. Also, Chinese mariners used watertight bulkheads, something the Titanic failed to faithfully reproduce.It was fascinating to discover how much of a contribution Khubilai made to China as well as read about his rise to power, despite the machinations of other family members. He introduced paper currency to China and ""in his memoirs, Marco Polo waxed eloquent on the novelty and efficiency of the Khan's paper money, manufactured from the bark of mulberry trees.""Despite the face that ""nautical archaeology has yet to be developed"", we are able delve into what really happened to the Mongol invasion fleets of 1274 and 1281. Several theories are put forward, including the idea that a great storm, a kamikaze, was indeed responsible for breaking up the fleet of 1281. The proposed truth is far more interesting and complex.The Bad:This book includes a photo section and Delgado make various references to paintings, artifacts and manuscripts but very few of these examples are accompanied by photos. For example, Delgado mentions surviving portraits of both Kubilai and his wife Chabi, yet they aren't reproduced in this book. Delgado goes to great lengths describing the Great Khan's rise to power and his decisions as Emperor of China so why not let us take a look at the man?As well I don't believe enough time has passed since excavation began to warrant a book. It's only in the last twenty years that some major discoveries have been made. I would have expected to see a book perhaps twenty years down the road, when a more concrete idea has emerged from Takashima Island. Here the archaeologists and Delgado only scratch the surface of the invasion fleet with less than one percent of the estimated underwater battlefield excavated. Only one chapter out of twelve is actually devoted to the finds made. This was disappointing considering the book seems aimed at answering the big question: what happened to the fleet?

Royal Navy officer Lieutenant Jack Aubrey is an anxious, crass and somewhat impetuous man. He has lately been promoted and given command of the sloop of war, the H.M.S. Sophie. During a dinner party in Port Mahon, Minorca he runs into Stephen Maturin, a physician and a natural philosopher. Aubrey is in need of a surgeon and both share an interest in classical music, influencing his choice to invite Maturin to join his crew. The Sophie is soon off, escorting ships across the Mediterranean, taking prizes ships and exchanging broadsides with the Spanish and French.The Good:O'Brian published 20 books in the Aubrey-Maturin series and all are loosely based on historical events. He uses this to the book's advantage as his research allows for a close focus on details and the way of life on board a ship of the line. He also has a wide command of the English language, using various words like ""mammothrept"", ""nacreous"" and ""gravamen"" that I had to look up.The two main protagonists, Aubrey and Maturin provide two differing points of view on naval life. Aubrey is the experienced ""lifer"" who has no problem making sacrifices to get the job done. Maturin being a physician places a high value on life and knows little of sailing, being more interested in flora and fauna. He acts as a foil and conscience for Aubrey, especially in the midst of conflict.O'Brian also has a superb ability to evoke the past, describing scenes that feel authentic to time and place but are also engaging to read. For example, ""To windward now, and he saw a sleepy line of gulls, squabbling languidly over a ripple on the sea - sardines or anchovies or maybe those little spiny mackerel. The sound of the creaking blocks, the gently straining cordage and sailcloth, the angle of living deck and the curved line of guns in front of him sent such a jet of happiness through his heart that he almost skipped where he stood."" - page 77 As well, the action scenes were well paced and effective, with my favourite being the last battle.The Bad:As engaging as O'Brian's writing was, I found the story somewhat lacking. Aubrey and Maturin are obviously interesting characters but a majority of the book seemed committed to describing every detail of the Sophie. Some scenes were confusing and/or boring as they felt more like an encyclopaedia entry, spending pages on ship exercises. While I appreciate that O'Brian has extensive knowledge of ships of the line, I don't know the terminology, nor do I care to be educated on it in a book that's labelled ""fiction"".In some ways the book felt as if it had been written for naval historians rather than the average Joe.

She is a self-confessed ""observer"" of people and though nothing much happens in her little village of St. Mary Mead, she is keen to the motivations and weaknesses of human nature. Things do start to heat up though when Colonel Protheroe, a much-loathed man, is found murdered in the study of the local vicar. Miss Marple inserts herself into the investigation in the hopes of keeping an innocent from being charged with murder.The Good:As is usual with Christie's mysteries, I found the solution original and interesting. The variety of details and red herrings kept me from solving the story on my own, though Christie does poke fun at the idea of ""the butler did it"".I also like how here we can see the kind of sleuthing that separates Miss Marple from Hercule Poirot. Miss Marple is more of a criminal profiler, getting into the heads of her suspects, finding out how they tick. Poirot is more of a meticulous CSI who detects the smallest of details that provide the answer to the crime. And after reading several Poirot stories, it's nice to see how Christie can take a mystery in a different direction. I personally love the idea of delving into how and why people think.There's a good deal of dry humour to be found in the book that I found refreshing and helped to lighten the mood at times. ""If you come to a Vicarage, you ought to be prepared to find a Vicar.""i - page 7The Bad:For a book that claims to be the first introduction to Miss Marple you don't actually see a lot of her. She doesn't play a major part in the investigation and only makes a good appearance in the last thirty pages of the book. She does offer her advice and suspicions about various suspects but is mostly in the background. It's only thanks to her curious nature and the fact that the murder took place close to her home that she becomes involved, though she's not considered part of the official investigation. This is made evident by what others in St. Mary Mead think of her. ""'I really believe that wizened old maid believes she thinks she knows everything there is to know. And hardly been out of this village all her life. Preposterous. What can she know of life?'"" - page 70As can be expected with a book published 70 years ago, some of the language is archaic and not easily translated. It took me a moment after reading ""picture house"" to understand Christie meant a movie theatre.This is the first Marple book but having seen the TV adaptations and I was surprised at how negative and cruel Miss Marple was in this book. I'm far more used to Gwendolyn McEwan's as Miss Marple. She has a gentle manner, a mischievous smile and though she discovers the faults in others she rarely ever calls them on it. Apparently though, this Jane Marple is markedly different from later books. Here's an example of what had me so confused about her attitude. ""'Dear Vicar,' said Miss Marple, 'you are so unworldly. I'm afraid that, observing human nature for as long as I have done, one gets not to expect very much from it. I dare say idle tittle-tattle is very wrong and unkind, but it is so often true, isn't it?' That last Parthian shot went home."" - page 15The last scene in the book summarizes the action to tie up plot points.

He had committed--would have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.Written in 1949, this book is George Orwell's imagining of a dystopian future where Big Brother is the ultimate control freak. Those in power, the Inner Party, control the actions in their own ranks and those of the the Outer Party who could also be termed the Middle Class. The world has split into three super governments. Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia with a constant war brewing between one or the other. This book take place in Oceania and concerns one Winston Smith. We watch as he suffers through a life where a telescreen (read creepy camera surveillance) watches his every move and monitors his heartbeat and facial expressions for anything that could indicate he might be a dissident. People disappear every day in his life and everything is regulated. The Inner Party is even writing dictionaries to limit and dictate what people can talk about. Every subsequent dictionary is smaller, with fewer words because the party believes that by controlling words they can control thought. After all, if you never heard the word 'lemon' would you ever know what it was?What I liked was how accessible this book was even after almost 60 years. While some parts seemed quite archaic I found the piece quite modern and easy to read. The only place I was a little put off was the sentence ""Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold."" There was just something about that line that didn't work for me.The story moved along at a quick pace and then immediately got bogged down when Winston started reading ""the book"". Whether Orwell started to suffer from soapbox hysteria, spouting his own ideals and morals from his book, I don't know. What I do know is the story started to drag and I got bored with all the technical gobbledegook that didn't move the plot along.Orwell completely lost me at the end. It was as if the story had unraveled. When I reached part three I assumed the story would pick up again and quickly come to a conclusion. Things only became more confusing, especially where O'Brien was concerned. And Winston's transition at the end felt as if it was skimmed over. The very ending was a little surreal as well, though I don't know if it was meant to be. The first two thirds were amazing though and I would recommend the book just for that. The sad thing is that I really got into this book. I completely devoured it and in the end I was disappointed.

He continues to interweave the various plots that span the length and breadth of the known world. As always I was salivating over the Jordan's description of costume, character and place. Mat continued to be my favourite character thanks to his awkward dealings toward Tuon. It was also interesting to see how Egwene handled herself in the Tower.I always love the little details included in each book in this series. For example, the descriptions of what different ter'angreal do, the hairstyles and clothing of various nations and the strange rituals of the Seanchan. Something to watch out for is the confrontation between Mat and the Seanchan. It was easily constituted my favourite scenes in the book. The Bad: As always with Jordan, there was a glut of information. The world he's created is too large to comprehend. Every time he referred to a different country I had to refer back to the map and soon enough I got fed up with it. The same applied for the cast of thousands that seemed to have various unpronounceable names. Overall, there was a lack of editing. In short, the book suffered from too much writing and not enough story. Also, I expected more in the way of battles. Jordan went to The Citadel, a military college, so as usual I had high expectations. In previous books in the series, these action scenes have always been some of my favourites. Instead, Jordan seemed to skim over what little battles there were, leaving me disappointed. The Ugly: With most books, the title usually ties into the story.

It follows the story of two magicians, Mr. Norrell and his pupil Jonathan Strange and their search to bring magic back to England. The story takes place over several years, through the Napoleonic Wars and across several countries including Spain and Italy.One of my favourite parts was the use of footnotes throughout the piece. This was the first time I'd seen them used this way as I'd never considered using them in fiction before. Clarke uses them to expand and explain names, places and objects throughout the course of the story. These explanations flesh out the world and leave their reading up to the discretion of the reader.Also, I loved the various imaginative details about magic and the effects it has on England and its inhabitants. For example, creating a fleet of ships out of rain or strange pillars of darkness that follow an individual around. These fresh fantastical ideas prove Clarke's imagination to be of the highest caliber.The writing style and dialogue of the characters are true to the period and draw the reader into the this world where magicians and fairies walk amongst the public.The Bad: I did have some issues with the book though. Part of my problem was the length. While Clarke's writing style compliments the historical period of the story, there was a lot of extraneous information and details not necessary to move the plot forward. They ended up bogging down the story. This is most likely due to a lack of severe editing. The book itself at 782 pages, gave me sore wrists if I didn't rest it in my lap. The most disappointing part of the book though was the almost complete lack of the Raven King. I understand the focus of the story was on Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell as the title indicates. But all of their efforts seemed to point towards the Raven King's return.He never showed up and there was this quick explanation at the end about about what happened to him that wasn't sufficient for me.

The current monarch, bloated and inept, is blind to the treachery and corruption surrounding the court and the Lannisters, his wife's family. Across the sea the heirs of the ousted monarch plan their revenge. Beyond the Wall, a defence against dark creatures from the north, something is stirring. Winter is coming.Martin's writing follows the same vein as Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series but in a more concise manner. His descriptions could stand to be Hemingway-ed but overall they're effective and serve to illustrate various character's traits. This is due to the form of the story. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one of the main characters. This refreshing technique allows the reader to see different events from various angles and to see who's lying, who has something to hide. He also manages to communicate his time period through diction as none of his characters use contractions. This gives the dialogue and description a more archaic feel. Another impressive aspect of Martin's writing is the plot. Through the character chapters we are able to follow several stories, all of which intertwine. The genre Martin writes in is easily classified as Sword and Sorcery but with this series, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", he leans heavily on the Sword aspect. This was a relief as I often find too many fantasy novels use the sorcery side as a deus ex machina to get out of situations. Martin's story is about people and their problems; it's gritty and realistic, like sand in the teeth. There are deep mythological and religious roots in this story and the reader is given occasional tidbits that round out the world. As well, you can never predict what's going to happen next and certain rules that apply in other fantasy novels don't apply here. Everyone is fair game; being a main characters does not guarantee safety. It makes the world more realistic. Various characters have different truths they live by and there are many you will hate at the mention of their names. I can honestly say that I recommend this book to anyone I know who likes fantasy. Martin is one of my favourite writer's in the genre. The Bad: Like Robert Jordan, Martin is sometimes too flowery with his descriptions. He also doesn't shy away from violence and other graphic scenes that are sometimes censored from other fantasy novels. Like any good western, this book is full of sex and death and it's not for everybody.As well, this book is jam-packed with characters and subplots that some may find difficult and frustrating to understand. My advice is if you can follow Lord of the Rings or Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series, you shouldn't have any trouble with Martin. I'll agree he isn't for everyone just as Jordan isn't for everyone. The books are long and jump around location wise. There's lots of swearing, graphic behaviour and occasional offensive misogynistic actions. There's also little resolution when it comes to the various plots but remember this is book one of a series. Some events are setups and plots that seem pointless now develop and grow in later books.

It describes the invasion and subsequent takeover of England by Martians. We follow the first-hand accounts a man and his brother who experience the Martian landings and their various attacks on the populous. The reader witnesses the power of the Martian's tripods, strangely coloured gases and their deadly heat-ray, a pre-cursor to the laser. All attacks against these strange creatures seem futile, prompting a mass evacuation from London and the countryside.The action is fast-paced and we meet various characters who react differently to the threat of invasion. The reader practically gets a geography lesson with all of the towns and specific areas of country covered and mentioned by the main character. I have to commend Wells' imagination as he couldn't draw upon other literature to create the Martians and their technology. There is also some beautiful language here ""Those who have only seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the named clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.""It was interesting to read the book that has inspired so many works and to read between the lines. Wells was a staunch evolutionist and this is obvious in his detailed description and reasoning behind the Martian's appearance. Isaac Asimov argued the book was a condemnation of British colonialism, comparing them to the aliens. There were times I forgot this was taking place before the turn of the 20th century. The reason for this was that several places made me think of WWII. For example, All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days."" That made me think of the rationing going on the UK and the ships coming with supplies from North America.The language is archaic and very much of the Victorian era, being written in 1898. The syntax and diction is more technical than flowery but I had a hard time picturing some of Well's descriptions of the martian's equipment. I think this probably comes from being one of the first science fiction novels out there. I didn't find the main character believable. I couldn't see how he would remain sane while the rest of the world went mad around him. The scene in the cellar was a good example. I expected this to be the place where Wells redeemed himself and made the protagonist truly contemplate murder to save his own skin. It would have brought up questions about humanity and how far a person will go to survive but instead Wells dodges the issue.The book also felt extremely short. It was just a recounting of events over a period of three weeks and in some parts I felt Wells had left part of the story out or we were missing something important....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 24, 2008","May 22, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds

Like many immigrants, he dreams of a new life: work, good pay, food on the table. Things begin to go wrong from the moment they arrive. Con men are quick to take advantage as greed, corruption and moral decay are the driving forces in town. The fortunes of the family dwindle and they learn to shrink from opportunity as it often serves as a Trojan Horse.Upton Sinclair traveled to Chicago to research this story, originally intending to focus on the morbidity of working conditions but instead switched over food safety after witnessing the revolting conditions in which food was prepared. After the book was published, its effect became apparent. Foreign sales of American meat fell by one half and to calm public outrage, major meat packers lobbied the government to pass legislation to pay for the additional inspection and certification of meat packaged in the United States. This led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which established the Food and Drug Administration.This story is a great example of the idea that books can change the world, something I deeply believe in. The publishing of this book led to public outcry and a government investigation that led to the passage of pure food laws.The Bad:The story and main characters are victims of Sinclair's criticism of the meatpacking industry, the poor working conditions and the all consuming poverty and hopelessness of the lower classes. While Sinclair spends time over-describing slaughterhouse conditions and the joys of socialism, the plot fades into the background, subservient to his hidden agenda.While I like the idea of a book changing things for the better in the real world, I was looking forward to the story of this Lithuanian family and their struggle as immigrants. Instead the story is treated more like a textbook documenting the lack of food safety in Chicago in order to illustrate the problems with American food safety. The book shouldn't have tried to be both story and textbook as the two inevitably end up clashing and leave the reader wanting.The Ugly:I had trouble stomaching this book. I'm not a vegetarian but it was difficult to contemplate eating meat after finishing this book. As well, I found I couldn't physically eat anything in the actual reading of the book. Sinclair doesn't hold back on detail or description when it comes to the horrors of the packing houses or other various food preparation factories....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"May 07, 2008","Apr 30, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41681.The_Jungle

These six stories intertwine and echo one another to create a story that transcends language and time to reveal how human ambition and progress can be wonderful yet dangerous.The Good:This book has been described as a series of Russian dolls, one inside another, revealing more depth and complexity with each story but I prefer to think of it more as a Mobius strip or a mirror reflecting another mirror. It's an ambitious book that requires more than one read to fully appreciate the time and detail put into the stories.One reason this book works so well is the use of language. The six stories are set in different time periods and this is evident through sentence structure, diction and slang. For example, Adam Ewing's journal uses very archaic language while the Orison of Sonmi-451 is peppered with slang and shows an evolved language where people say ""xperienced"" and ""xpected"". These differences help to ground the reader and show the passage of time.We also get to see Mitchell's diversity when it comes to writing styles. In this book we have several forms jockeying for attention. There's a travel journal, a series of letters, a memoir, an interview, etc.Also, one of the great things about this book is that the stories can be read as stand alones. While they are interconnected they are also fully contained and are interesting to read on their own.The Bad:This is also the ultimate flaw with the book. Some stories worked and resonated more than others but the connection Mitchell tries to draw between stories and characters at times feels contrived. At times it felt that they were held together by the merest of threads, that Mitchell was trying too hard to make a good work into a great work. This can make the attempt come off as pompous, as if there's too much self-awareness about what he's written.As well, while the archaic style and diction in the first story lended itself to the believability of the plot it was also extremely frustrating.

My greatest dread was that they would have a better marriage for her than I had made, that I would have to follow the hem of her gown as she swept ahead of me for the rest of my life."" page 12Mary Boleyn was a married woman whose family and husband encouraged her into the bed of King Henry VIII. While she fell in love with the man known as the 'handsomest prince in Christendom' he moved on to a newer conquest in her sister, Anne. Anne makes it quite clear that Mary was just keeping the bed warm until she made her move. The situation becomes more complicated when Mary has an illegitimate son by the king and Anne convinces Henry to rid himself of his current wife. The rivalry between these two sisters takes place on the royal stage with the entire court looking on as the future of England depends on the whim of their king.This is essentially a story about women. Katherine, Mary and Anne and their struggle to remain relevant to a king who's not easily satisfied and is obsessed with producing a male heir to solidify the succession. Both sisters serve as a conduit of power and influence for their father, Thomas Boleyn, an example of how women were more a commodity than individuals in the 16th century.Gregory showcases an interesting family dynamic, between the parents and children and amongst the siblings. While Thomas Boleyn is desperate for whatever advancement he can gain for his family through his sisters, his wife is decidedly cold to the whole affair. The way that George, Mary and Anne stick together and fall apart is by far the most fascinating aspect of the book. It's nice to see how paths diverge and how intertwined the fates of the Boleyn's becomes.There was also a lot of dialogue that foreshadowed the events to come in far too obvious a manner. I call this ""overforeshadowing"". For example, Anne says ""If I were in your shoes it would be the king or nothing for me,"" she said. ""I'd put my neck on the block for a chance at him"". I don't know if Gregory assumed no one knew how the story ended but this deliberate smack to the face made it blatantly obvious what was going to happen and every time it happened I wanted to throw the book at the wall.I didn't like how Gregory made Henry into this weak man constantly pleading with and appeasing Anne. I've always seen him as the psychotic bully of the Tudor playground. He would and could do anything he liked, and always had to get his way. Anne may have entranced and wooed him for years but in the end he ditched her just as he did many of the other women in his life. In Gregory's book I saw little of the man who lusted for war and wanted to create a name for himself throughout EuropeGregory may hold a Ph.D. but it's for the wrong century (18th) and to me this is simply a transplanted soap opera with little depth beyond what you might find in a local wading pool. There were some very descriptive lines like, ""there was a trail of extravagance and dishonesty and waste that followed the king round the country like slime behind a snail,"" (p54) but some of the diction felt too modern for the time it was written in. There was constant talk of change and some of the sensibilities of the women seemed centuries ahead of their time. I understand that Gregory may have tweaked the language and society to make the material more palatable for the average reader but being a student of history, the inaccuracies were like being blinded by bright sunlight.The really telling thing about the book was that I only started to feel a connection to the story and characters halfway through the book.

It made me feel better. It made me feel not so depressed any more."" page 115Holden Caufield is troubled. He's a 16 year old New Yorker with a distinctly cynical take on the world who just wants someone to talk to, yet no one will listen. He tries talking to friends, teachers, perfect strangers and all brush him off without a thought. He wanders around New York after getting kicked out of school, getting into unique situations and trying to figure out his life. Often noted as 'the' coming of age story, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" brings the reader back to a time when everything was life and death and you knew everything there was to know.This is a book that people either love or hate. There's little room for fence sitting. I'm sure that's because this book reads much like a teenager thinks, all raging, ecstatic and confused. Caufield's voice is unique but grating. His observations about human nature are raw and insightful but most of the time all you want to do is give him a good shake. On the one hand you feel for him because he just wants to talk to someone about the ducks on the pond. The one person he does find to listen to him turns into a creep, leaving Caufield with more questions than answers.One of the things I liked most about the book was the fullness of it. Salinger packed the story full of details, odd characters and wonderful dialogue, especially whatever spouted out of Caufield's mouth. His talk was annoying but refreshing. The diction is somewhat archaic though, using words like ""prince"" and ""chewed the rag"", creating some distance between the story and reader.The interesting part comes upon a deeper or second reading of the book. The reader sees that there is a Caufield that the story is about and a Caufield that is telling the story. Occasionally you see him slipping into a more adult voice, acting like an adult, nostalgic for the past and noticing the march of time. We see his red hat as a sort of safety blanket, connecting him to his brother Allie and how his alienation from others leaves little stability in his life (ie getting kicked out of school).I personally found Caufield an almost wholly unlikeable character save for his interactions with his little sister. At most he's a walking contradiction. He's always doing nice things for people like doing their homework but ends up calling them phonies. He says he isn't literate and yet mentions reading several classics like ""David Copperfield"", ""Return of the Native"" and ""Hamlet"". He doesn't like phonies, constantly pointing out various people within the book that he hates because they are so and yet he freely admits that he's a liar. Thoreau said people often lead lives of quiet desperation but not Caufield. He says what he's thinking or at least lets the reader know and doesn't stick around when he thinks something's lousy....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 14, 2009","Apr 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5107.The_Catcher_in_the_Rye

Page - 105Roger Ackroyd, the wealthiest man in King's Abbott is found murdered one night and almost everyone has a motive. His nephew, Ralph, has a gambling problem and as inheritor of the estate, could pay off his debts. His niece and sister-in-law, dependant on his miserly penny-pinching ""charity"" could live comfortably off his money. And then there's Parker the butler. Fortunately Hercule Poirot is called upon to solve the case, having conveniently retired to the same town to cultivate marrows.The Good:This is one of Christie's best known works and a great example of her authorial abilities. The story is narrated by Dr. James Sheppard who lives with his sister Caroline, a nosy would-be-detective. They team up with Poirot to solve the crime with Dr. Sheppard standing in for Captain Hastings who has retired to the Argentine.Christie manages to keep the reader guessing with various red herrings and a convoluted series of events to throw them off the scent. But Poirot slowly wheedles down the list of suspects as he gathers evidence and conducts interviews. Maps and diagrams help to illustrate the crime scene and enable the reader to try and puzzle out the truth but you'll have to read quite close to the end to discover who really murdered Ackroyd.Poirot is as always, amusing and deductive in his reasoning. His ""little gray cells"" work overtime and it's interesting to see his analytical method at work. As well the reader relies on him heavily to explain the various secrets and motives of the various characters.This book has everything. Poisoning, a blackmail plot, murder, a nervous butler, drug smuggling, marrows, etc. As well, it has a great plot twist at the end that makes it a most satisfying read.The Bad:Christie's ability to tell a story is the only frustrating aspect of the story. Events build on one another, complicating the plot and the explanation of the murder. This leaves the reader suspecting everyone and no one until by the end you're thoroughly confused and anxious over what really happened.The Ugly:Somebody find Eli Wallach....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,May 2008,"Apr 07, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16328.The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd

Scrooge is told he will be visited by three ghosts to show him the error of his ways. What follows is a redemptive journey into the past, present and future of Scrooge's world where he learns his long-held contempt for love, friendship and the Christmas season is unfounded.The Good:I wasn't sure what to expect, having never read Dickens before. What I found was quite pleasing. The book is peppered with a variety of vivid descriptions of settings and characters. For example, Scrooge was described as ""a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire, secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster."" p - 13/14 Dickens manages to create these original images that breathe life into what might have been a very bland character. Scrooge himself is well-developed. We see this in his interactions with his employees, his nephew, strangers and Marley. I loved when he checked his dressing gown for persons unknown after seeing it hanging in a suspicious attitude on the wall. I also enjoyed how he tried to explain away Marley's presence by calling him a blot of mustard or an undigested bit of beef.I loved how Dickens created a dense setting using both weather and architecture. ""The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale."" p-16 The description even creates a fullness in the mouth when read aloud.Here are some of my favourite descriptions from the book. ""The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed."" p-28 ""Secrets that few would like to scrutinize were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchers of bones."" p-171.Having finally read the book after seeing so many movie versions I saw a lot of correlation between the story and ""It's a Wonderful Life"". A man with the aid of a supernatural being, goes back in time and is made to realize truths about himself. I would definitely recommend this book for holiday reading. It has so much more packed into than the various movie versions floating out there.The Bad:I didn't appreciate the random and many authorial intrusions throughout the book. I could have done without the narrator directly speaking to me and interrupting the flow of the plot.Also, while there were some beautifully evocative descriptions in this book, they were few and far between. Dickens is typical when it comes to the Victorian style of writing in terms of various long and convoluted sentences. I saw so much that could have been edited for efficiency and conciseness.As well, I had a lot of questions that weren't answered in the book. For example, why did Scrooge move into Marley's old house? Did he inherit it after Marley's death? In any case it seemed more than creepy to move into your dead partner's house. Also, the Ghost of Christmas Present talks about his ""brothers"". I wanted to know more about this ghost world that Dickens had populated and yet he only provided the reader with snippets here and there.Some of the diction and sayings were archaic enough that their full impact was lost on me. For example, there was a simile ""like a bad lobster in a cellar"". I was intrigued but stumped as to its meaning. Some of the humour as well is outdated and would probably have been far more amusing to someone reading this in the 1840s when it was first published.The Ugly:Somebody find Eli Wallach.Rating: 3/5...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 13, 2008","Apr 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5326.A_Christmas_Carol

I had gone back in thought and in person to the days that were gone."" - page 200A shy naive girl is companion to an insufferable woman in Monte Carlo. It's there she meets Maximilian de Winter, a wealthy Englishman and falls in love. They get married and spend their honeymoon in wedded bliss before returning to Manderley, Maxim's family home. It's there our protagonist encounters Rebecca, Maxim's deceased wife who drowned off the coast a year ago. Her presence is felt in everything at Manderley, from the dinner menus, to the dog, to the interior decorating. Even the creepy housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, does her best to keep Rebecca's spirit alive. Maxim doesn't want to talk about the past and seems to have something to hide. Events come to a head at a costume ball where a faux pas is committed and disaster strikes. The truth about Rebecca comes to light, affecting everyone involved.The Good:This is an interesting novel as du Maurier plays with the roles of both wives. The title of the book is named after the first wife. Though she is physically absent from the entire book, she is omnipresent, so much so that Maxim's second wife seemingly can't escape her. Also note that the second wife isn't named. She is simply the naive companion, the second wife, the innocent girl-child. Her self-conscious personality is constantly overwhelmed by the remnants of Rebecca's life. She feels helpless as one can't fight a ghost any more than they can fight a memory and in the battle between the two de Winter wives, our protagonist fears she's losing Maxim.du Maurier's writing has a fluidity that makes for ease of reading. As well, the description of the outdoors is stunning and macabre. The plants are menacing and given a character of their own. du Maurier often associates images of death with vegetation, creating a literal prison around Manderley.""A lilac had mated with a copper beech, and to bind them yet more closely to one another the malevolent ivy, always an enemy to grace, had thrown her tendrils about the pair and made them prisoner. Ivy held prior place in this lost garden, the long strands crept across the lawns, and soon would encroach upon the house itself."" - Page 3Mrs. Van Hopper is deliciously annoying, almost like a spider, with people being fed to her. At one point she's even referred to as a ""large complacent spider"". Also, Maxim is sufficiently aloof and Mrs. Danvers creeps me out. ""A black figure stood waiting for me at the head of the stairs, the hollow eyes watching me intently from the white skull's face."" - Page 70 Her seeming infatuation with Rebecca and need to preserve all that she was is disturbing and also dangerous for the second Mrs. de Winter.du Maurier also doles out little truths about the human condition that flesh out the themes of the book. ""They are not brave, the days when we are 21. They are full of little cowardices, little fears with foundation, and one is so easily bruised, so swiftly wounded, one falls to the first barbed word."" - Page 34As well, the ending leaves just enough out to allow the reader to come to their own conclusions. du Maurier respects the intelligence of the reader by not spelling everything out. It also leaves the conclusion somewhat open-ended, allowing an escape for both the readers and characters.The Bad:du Maurier can be very wordy. While the descriptions in certain sections are beautiful she does elaborate too much at times.We also spend a lot of time inside the head of the second Mrs. de Winter. She's always imagining what might happen or what she might say. It can be annoying especially if you get lost in one of her day dreams, only to realize nothing has actually happened.The Ugly:Somebody find Eli Wallach.Rating:4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"not setJul 27, 2022","Oct 23, 2008not set","Apr 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12873.Rebecca

It would lie on in the hills, the rivers, the land, until Arthur returned to reclaim them.""The Good: I received this book as an Early Reviewer on Library Thing. It's a story about a manuscript proving the existence of King Arthur and what various parties will do to get their hands on it. Maren Southcott's sister, Rachael, an academic was on its trail before she was murdered. Now Maren is on the hunt for not only her sister's killer but also the manuscript. I was really looking forward to this book because I love Wales and its mythology. The prologue, set in 15th century Wales sets the tone and pace for the novel. We meet Brother Gruffyd who hides the manuscript from soon-to-be Henry IV. The syntax and diction fit with the time period and I hoped to see more of these flashbacks to show us Owain Glyndwr, an Arthur-like figure for Wales who could play a parallel hero to Maren. The Bad: I found it very difficult to get through this book. I would categorize it as a quick read, the kind of book you read in an airport to pass the time but I couldn't read more than a few pages at a time. The plot is very disjointed. In fact, I would say the book became more about Maren and the various problems with her marriage and child than about the manuscript. The focus of the book jumped around thanks to various subplots that were nothing but distracting. There were even times I forgot Maren was looking for the manuscript. There were too many coincidences, loose ends and a lack of clues for me to enjoy the story. As well, there were too many characters for me to keep track of, meaning they weren't fleshed out enough, they weren't believable. For example, it seemed like every man Maren met fell in love with her. And I can't tell you how many times the word ""bigamous"" was used because there were too many to count.The most disappointing aspect though was the lack of mythology. I expected with the story taking place in Wales that we would see and hear more about King Arthur and Owain Glyndwr but more often than not we were subjected to mountains of dialogue. I would even say that the setting was missing for the first fifty pages of the book. One reason for the disjointedness of the novel is the story behind its origins. Vandagriff suffered from an illness that required her to undergo a procedure that wiped out most of the last ten years of her life. She had been in the midst of writing ""The Arthurian Omen"". Fortunately her doctor was able to find the right medications to manage her illness. By this time she had found the half-finished manuscript on her computer and I think this is the main reason for the story not meshing together properly. The Ugly: This book really wasn't ready for publishing. It reads like a very rough draft. It's wordy and suffers from a lack of focus in the plot. It's very dialogue heavy with various characters jumping to wild conclusions. The reader is left floating without a proper setting to grab onto and we're missing an important story component, the mythology of Wales. The worst part is this could have been a good book if it had been edited properly....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Apr 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2385628.The_Arthurian_Omen

If she had she would not have committed her crime. So much would not have happened, nothing would have happened, and the smoothing hand of time would have made the evening barely memorable.""The Good:Briony Tallis is a writer. She is also thirteen years old and has a very defined view of the world. Her brother Leon is home from school and she's writing a play in his honour. In the midst of this she spies a flirtation between her sister Cecelia and Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son. One night she believes she sees something that will change her life and the lives of all those around her.The story takes place in the 30s and the writing style, while wordy and somewhat archaic, lends itself to the time period, confirming McEwan as a master. Also, the level of detail is, in a word, delicious. Here's a great example.""An old tin petty cash box was hidden under a removable floorboard beneath her bed. In the box were treasures that dated back four years, to her ninth birthday when she began collecting: a mutant double acorn, fool's gold, a rainmaking spell bought at a funfair, a squirrel's skull as light as a leaf.""The story is divided into three sections and I liked this form as each section had different themes and voices. The style also seemed to change as the sections progressed through time.This is definitely a writer's book, which I love. Briony is a writer and by the end of the book, you realize how important that fact is. The ending is a rug-puller. It was absolutely maddening in some ways as I felt that to truly understand the book I'd have to read it again. The title is truly appropriate.The Bad:Just as with ""Life of Pi"", the first part of the book sets up the rest of the story. It may seem slow in some parts with little plot development but McEwan uses this time to develop the characters and their various relationships.While the writing style felt appropriate to the time period it was so wordy. There were some amazing paragraphs of description and dialogue but I usually subscribe to the Hemingway style of writing.

His family had owned a zoo in Pondicherry, India and was transporting the remaining animals they owned various Canadian zoos. The ship ends up sinking and Pi is left floating on the Pacific ocean accompanied by a zebra, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger.This an amazing tale in the theme of survival stories. Martel provides the reader with sumptuous detail that illustrates a direct contrast before and after the shipwreck. Here's one of my favourite excerpts.""Every morning before I was out the main gate I had one last impression that was both ordinary and unforgettable: a pyramid of turtles; the iridescent snout of a mandrill; the stately silence of a giraffe; the obese, yellow open mouth of a hippo; the beak-and-claw climbing of a macaw parrot up a wire fence; the greeting claps of shoebill's bill; the senile, lecherous expression of a camel.""I loved the description of the steps Pi took to survive as well as the aspects of magic realism that crept into the pages. Although the fantastical elements of the animals does vanish by the middle of the book. Watch out for the twist ending. It's both amazing and heart-wrenching.The book combines religions and philosophies, common sense, magic realism, the will to survive and an understanding of zoo animals. It's not every day that a book combining all these elements is this good.I'm also pleased to say that there's a Canadian connection as Yann Martel, the author, just happens to be Canadian. As well, this book won the prestigious Man Booker Prize.The Bad:The first 100 pages drag. Martel uses those pages to ground the reader in the reality of the story in order to make the rest of the book more believable. The problem though is if you're not willing to plow through the lack of suspense and tension, you might miss the best part of the book.As well, the book requires you to suspend your disbelief. As the book progresses it becomes considerably more unbelievable, asking more of the reader. This is why that 100 page setup is so important in the beginning.The Ugly:If you're uncomfortable with violence or gore then you'll want to watch out for some parts in the middle and the end of the book.

Let us see, Mr. Clever Poirot, just how clever you can be.""The Good: A serial killer uses the alphabet to direct his crimes, first killing Alice Ascher from Andover, leaving an ABC Railway Guide behind at the scene. He sends notes to notable retired detective, Hercule Poirot, warning him of impending murders, daring the Belgian to catch him in the act. Poirot, along with sidekick Captain Hastings, travels the English countryside to discover the killer's identity.I liked the fact that Christie took a risk and decided to play around with POV, though I had some problems with it. Within the POV there are interruptions in Hastings' narrative where the reader is given various accounts from the killer's perspective. Christie cleverly disguises and/or omits an information that might give away their identity.It was also interesting to see the internalization of Poirot's process. His ""little gray cells"" have their work cut out for them but fortunately the world's favourite Belgian notices the smallest detail.The Bad: This book just didn't have the usual flavour of a Christie novel. It was missing that usual spark of cleverness that pulls you through the story. I kept expecting to be caught up in the mystery I was bored throughout. So much so that I had to re-read the section where Poirot outs the killer. It's unfortunate but this book doesn't measure up to her usual standards.My main issue with the book was that too much time was spent on the first three murders. I started to wonder when we would get down to the nuts and bolts of the killer's identity. As well the story probably stagnated because of a lack of action and too much talking.The explanation itself feels forced and is unusual. When reading Christie you 'expect the unexpected' but the reasoning behind the killings in this story wasn't even in the same ballpark.My issues with the POV concerned transition. The jump between third and first person was jarring. I can only suggest that if you're looking for a good Christie novel, skip this one.

In this book Hobbes gathers important dates, speeches and strange but true facts spanning the length of recorded history from the Greeks to the present.I liked the diversity of the time periods covered. It provided variety both geographical and in terms of the equipment as well as the development of war.One usual drawback to military books is the risk of slipping into the beige of boring. This isn't the case with Hobbes as he provides readers with a host of facts bizarre and ridiculous enough to keep your attention. For example, did you know that in 1898 a war started over French pastries, sort of. Apparently Mexican leader Santa Anna took some from a restaurant in Mexico and in return, France sent warships to extract reparations for French business losses during recent rebellions. The resulting conflict was called the ""War of the Cakes"". There was also Operation Mongoose, where attempts on the life of Fidel Castro included booby-trapping a seashell. Supposedly it would explode if he lifted it from the seabed while diving. This brought up a whole host of questions, as you can imagine, about the illogicalness and stupidity of it all.The Bad: The organization in this book is non-existent. When skimming back through the book for examples I couldn't find what I was looking for. It would have been nice if Hobbes had presented the information in chronological order. It would have been nice to have all the facts about WWI in one place.The Ugly: As can be expected with most books on the military and war, there are some violent and gruesome parts.

Over the course of these stories Pooh pretends to be a raincloud, gets stuck in a rabbit hole, hunts Woozles, steals a baby kangaroo, survives a flood and manages to (almost) find the North Pole. His is a busy and exciting life but he doesn't do it alone. Throughout these experiences he's accompanied by friends like Piglet, his anxious best friend or Owl, who had problems spelling or Eeyore who suffers from self-esteem issues. If you think this is little clinical for a children's book the the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) published an amusing article about the various disorders of the characters in the Hundred Acre Woods.My experience with Winnie the Pooh involved being read to as a child and watching the movies ""The Blustery Day"", ""The Hunny Tree"" and ""The Day for Eeyore"". Even at that age I thought Pooh was funny but a little silly and not the brightest bear in the woods. (That title belongs to Yogi). But the stories did have an impact on my life. I play poohsticks every chance I get, every bridge I find and I've memorized the ""Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" song, though I sing it without the characteristic lisp.I was surprised and amused by the dry wit peppered throughout the book. I expected it to be far more simple in how it was written, considering it's a children's book. But I think it's a book anybody can pick up and read.This book is on my BTRBID (Books to Read Before I Die) list so I was happy to check it off.The Bad: My major hangup with Winnie the Pooh is that no one knows the truth behind the bear. It may surprise you but Winnie is actually a girl and Canadian. Let's get this straight right here, A.A. Milne named the bear in his stories after the teddy bear owned by his son Christopher Robin. Christopher named his bear after Winnipeg, a bear in the London Zoo. Winnipeg was brought to England by her owner Lt. Harry Coleburn, a Canadian soldier. Harry purchased ""Winnie"" from a hunter for $20 and named her after his hometown, Winnipeg, Manitoba. He brought her over during the Great War (that's WWI to some of you) and she sort of became a mascot for Harry's regiment. He had to leave her at the zoo when his unit went over to France.So in short, Milne gives bear name - bear named after Chris' teddy - Chris' teddy named after bear at Zoo - bear at zoo from Canada, brought over during the Great War - Canadian bear named after Manitoba capital, Winnipeg.There are also some quirks that I would like to understand. Why does Pooh live under the name 'Sanders'? And what about that ""Tresspassers Will Be Prosecuted"" sign by Piglet's house? Also, why is Alexander Beetle sidelined? He disappears and goes to live with his Aunt forevermore.The Ugly: Somebody find Eli Wallach.

AJ felt he needed to brush up on his world knowledge, believing his education at an Ivy League school (Brown University) was out of date.As you might not be aware, the Brittanica version contains 33,000 pages and 44 million words. I picked this book up because I have a minor obsession with trivia. The book is organized alphabetically but interspersed with interesting tidbits. For example, did you know that a ""haboob"" is a hot wind in the Sahara Desert, or that an ""oyster"" can apparently change its sex depending on water temperature or that Rene Descartes had a thing for women with crossed eyes? Maybe I should have ignored my mom when she told me my eyes would stay like that. Who knew it could be a turn on? Jacobs incorporates comedy and real life with his quest for knowledge. A decision that keeps you entertained from beginning to end.He`s fighting jealousy of his father, a lawyer who tried reading the Brittanica but stopped somewhere around ""Borneo"", which by the way is an island in the Malay Archipelago and his brother-in-law, Eric, a smart smartass who likes rubbing his intelligence in Jacobs' face.Jacobs is goofy, funny and a little dorky but his desire for knowledge is understandable.The Bad: It was difficult to believe some of the situations Jacobs was involved in and put himself in. They seemed to fit so perfectly into the story and alphabetical style of the book, I wondered whether he hadn't taken some poetic license with the truth. For example, under the word ""Christmas"" he diverges into the office Christmas party. I think some liberty was taken with the timeline. And some moments, like the Mensa meetings were uncomfortable to read because I felt embarrassed for Jacobs, as if I'd walked in on him on the toilet.Also, Jacobs spouts off obscure and random facts to pretty much everyone within earshot and I had to read about every single time it happened. You know those annoying people who feel the need to present their intelligence to you on a daily basis? That's what this felt like.

The catch to this agreement is Jesse has to watch three movies a week with his dad. But Jesse doesn't get to pick the movies. This is what intrigued me on the book jacket because I love movies. It doesn't hurt that Gilmour was CBC's tv movie critic through most of the 90s. I was also drawn to the fact this was a memoir about a father and son relationship. That aspect of life has always seemed strange and mysterious considering I'm a girl. I've always wondered what father's and sons discuss when they actually have conversations.I liked how goofy and comical and true Gilmour was in how he dealt with life. I really felt for how he handled the situation with Jesse and his various problems. It brings to light the dilemmas parents face when raising their children. Different choices lead to different outcomes and not always with the intended result. The most interesting parts for me were the conversations over the movies. I learned that a lot of male conversation has a lot to do with what's not said. Strangely enough I already knew this from books and movies. It's called 'withholding' and doesn't just apply to men.The Bad: I was really expecting more. The book felt short, almost truncated. I think the main reason for this was Jesse was 16 at the beginning and several years passed within the book but fairly large chunks of time were skipped over. I know Gilmour most likely highlighted the interesting and important parts of those years but I wonder about what was left out. I wonder about what movies were left out.The Ugly: I thought this would really be my kind of book. What could be better than a father and son bonding over movies? I was especially looking forward to the movie discussion. But when it came down to it, the discussion was short and most of the films discussed were what I would call 'art house' films. They weren't mainstream and I'd never heard of quite a few. I had no way of identifying with David or Jesse when they discussed these books. Although, I do agree with what they said about Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", having just watched it over the weekend. But you'll have to wait for my movie  to find out about that.Granted, they did discuss movies like ""Psycho"", ""On the Waterfront"" and ""The Shining"". I think my main problem with this book is that I expected more from the movie side when the book is marketed and written as a memoir. Only a few movies watched over these years are actually mentioned in the book. My expectations were blown out of proportion, making the book feel like a letdown. While it's a nice little book about a father and son, it doesn't necessarily break new ground in any area.Don't get me wrong, I liked the book. I just didn't like it as much as I expected to. If you watch a lot of movies, especially older and more obscure films and like reading about true stories and the struggle between parent and child then this is the book for you....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Apr 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2012757.The_Film_Club

The events in between define her life and show her living according to the desires of others.I had this book on my ""By the Decades Challenge"" but that's not the only reason I read it. Carol Shields was Canadian and when possible I try to read Canadian authors. I don't feel they receive the attention they deserve when it comes to the world. Most people can only name Margaret Atwood when asked for a Canadian author and it's important to remember she's not the only writer in the country (despite what some people may think).I was particularly taken with the form. Despite following the traditional linear structure, Shields divides the book into sections of Daisy's life like ""Birth"" and ""Marriage"". It was interesting to see her grow from a young child into an old woman, with each section concentrating on the theme of the chapter title and how past events affected her present.Part of Shield's genius is how she makes you care about Daisy, a seemingly ordinary character with not much of a personality. But things happen to and around Daisy that make you take a second look. The story of an unrealized life is always somewhat heartbreaking and Shields manages to communicate this as a quiet dignified tragedy.I had two favourite sections, one being ""Work"" where the story is communicated in letters. It's very difficult to maintain plot and reader interest with a letters in a novel but Shields is a master craftswoman. I also really enjoyed the period where Daisy was in her writing phase for the paper.Shields also manages to populate the world with a plethora of interesting minor characters. They don't just hold up scenery, they have their own stories to tell. One thing to watch for is the family tree and the photographs. It's interesting how much trouble Shields goes to to convince the reader this is a true story.The Bad: My main problem was with Daisy as character. Despite the fact she was the main character, we don't see the book entirely from her perspective. The story itself is very ordinary as is Daisy. While Shields makes us care about her, the most interesting things in Daisy's life are what happens to others around her.This book was typically ""Canadian"" about 'small lives lived in the small'. I don't always mind this but it can be detrimental to Canadian novels as it reinforces stereotypes about Canada and authors seem to find it difficult to break out of this mold. (I can't tell you how many stories I've read set in Canada that take place in a small town where nothing much every happens). At times I thought Daisy's life was so tedious I would have to walk away for a while before picking up the book again.The Ugly: Sheilds plays around with point of view which can be highly confusing if you're not paying attention. While it was nice to jump into other character's heads, I found it distracting and felt it detracted from the plot.I won't lie to you, this is a difficult book to read because it doesn't contain a driving plot. But it's lyrical and intimate and if you're looking for a challenge then I definitely recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2007,"Apr 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77554.The_Stone_Diaries

I'd never read a direct account of someone in London during the blitz. The fact that Ritchie was Canadian was a bonus.Charles Ritchie was a diplomat who acted as Ambassador to the United States and then the United Kingdom. He lived through the London bombings and managed to paint a picture of public opinion that was contrary to Allied propaganda. Something to consider is what Ritchie says about his own book. ""Thinking over what I have written. What a pack of lies intimate journals are, particularly if one tries too hard to be truthful.""The Good: Reading personal diaries can be as exciting as watching grass grow but Ritchie's writing is engaging, descriptive and informative. In another life he would have made a good journalist.The book was popular when published and even won the Governor General's Award for non-fiction in 1974.Here's a sample of his delicious prose. ""A week of air raids. Our ears have grown sharp for the sounds of danger - the humming menace that sweeps the sky, the long whistle like an indrawn breath as the bomb falls. We are as continually alive to danger as animals in the jungle.""One alarming fact was how prescient Ritchie was in terms of the post-war world. Ten months after it began, May 1940 he wrote ""they tell us that the greatest battle in history is beginning. London is sultry with the rumour of it. The possibility of defeat appears in whispers and averted glances.""This idea of defeat and how public opinion evolved over the course of the war were most interesting parts for me.February 23, 1941: ""It is being dinned into my mind with persistence that after all we may be going to lost this war. No one admits the possibility publicly but you could hardly expect us to do that.""May 2, 1941: ""We are in danger of losing the war. As for england she will be outflanked on a world scale and left like the Maginot line, a graveyard of equipment and static armies with nothing to defend except herself.""In three months Ritchie went from 'may' to 'are' and you can be sure that his opinion was in keeping with popular opinion. I know the propaganda machine made it look like the Allies couldn't be anything but triumphant so it's nice to see the real thoughts of the people. Ritchie doesn't go so far as to elaborate on his feelings but you can detect undertones of alarm in his words.It was also interesting to see Ritchie interacting and working with famous historical figures like Mike Pearson and Vincent Massey. This is where his biting wit really comes into play. He described Mackenzie King as a ""fat, little conjurer with his flickering, shifty eyes"" and said Harry Truman ""looks like a sparrowy, little, old, small-town, American housewife who could shut the door very firmly in the face of traveling salesmen and tramps.""The Bad: I was really looking for more of the big events of the war to be included in this diary. In fact, it's one of the main reasons I decided to read the book. We do get a good descriptions of the bombings and Ritchie evens manages to sneak into France during D-Day Operations. The problem is we only get hints of the aftermath, we only really see Allied camps and the country from the seat of a vehicle. This is understandable as Ritchie wasn't a soldier but he doesn't even write about the end of the war. Surely this event would have merited a mention.The Ugly: I had some issues with Ritchie's opinion of Americans, despite the fact this is a personal diary. ""All the same I feel that I never shall forgive the Americans for not being in this war."" I understand the frustration and anger at the American's isolationist policies but at times he goes too far.""The attack on Pearl Harbour has caused very human sardonic satisfaction to everyone I have happened to see today. This will take the Americans by the scruff of the neck and bounce them into the war."" While this was the incident that brought America into the war, the fact that Ritchie was so callous about the incident was off putting. Thousands of people lost their lives in that attack, a fact he seems to ignore.I also thought Ritchie's opinion of his girlfriends painted him to be something of a jerk. ""She has more sense and feeling than one would give her credit for at first. What is shocking about her is the contrast between her romantic looks and her flat commonplace mind. Like many completely uninhibited bores she wins in the end by sheer persistence.""""The ballerina leaves today with the ballet company on tour. I am looking forward to early and varied infidelities during her absence.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Apr 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/259674.The_Siren_Years

His family doesn't like him, his wife has affairs and he's socially awkward. His only thought is for his children, Bunny and Sunshine. When a situation causes them to move from Mockingburg, New York to Newfoundland, Canada, home of Quoyle's ancestors, he finds himself in over his head. Proulx is a master manipulator in this story as she forces the reader to sympathize with Quoyle's situation. He's dumped into a new setting, new country with only his children and Aunt Agnis to keep him company.The descriptive detail in this book is fresh and full. ""In the bay they saw a scallop dagger halfway to the narrows, a wake like the hem of a slip showing behind it."" I feasted on this line because I loved it so much and you can look forward to this richness throughout the story.Proulx makes Newfoundland come to life. This is likely due to the fact that she splits her time between there and Wyoming. This may not be the kind of Newfoundland you know though. It has this wild and dark, mythical side to it that you may have heard as a stereotype about the province. Incidentally when this book came out, there was some controversy about Proulx`s portrayal of Newfoundlanders. Some people from the province thought readers would assume these stereotypes were true. I would say the novel does nothing to dispel the stereotypical view of `The Rock` and its inhabitants but you have to remember this is Fiction. This is clearly stated on the back of the book.Watch for the chapter titles. Each relates to a type of knot and informs the reader on the content of the section. Chapter One is entitled ""Quoyle"", 'a Flemish flake is a spiral coil of one layer only. It is made on deck, so that it may be walked on if necessary.' This gives you an idea of Quoyle`s character even before you start reading.Something that deserves mention is the book won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award in 1994.Proulx's writing style is unlike anything I've read before. Her syntax is fragmented and her removal of pronouns interrupts the fluidity of the story. For some this may be difficult to get around.As well, a suspension of disbelief is required as various coincidences and other `unbelievabilities` pop up throughout the book and would be difficult to take otherwise. This includes the strange characters with quirky names like Billy Pretty, Tert Card and Beaufield Nutbeem.Please note, this novel is not for everyone. The climax of the story occurs at the very beginning of the story and settles into a slow denouement. This is completely contrary to the normal story arc. This a quiet, steady book about family and the idea of home. It is not, I repeat, not a page turner. That being said, I enjoyed the stillness and contemplative quality that rose out of the book. For those who like stories about how a person can change and the influence of the land on the mind, this book is for you....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Apr 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7354.The_Shipping_News
