Those are some of the words that come to mind after reading Midnight in the GardenClever, creative, crazy, unconventional, and absolutely delightful. Those are some of the words that come to mind after reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt. The author, a former New York magazine editor, lived in Savannah on-and-off for eight years, chronicling the comings-and-goings of socialites, politicians, aristocrats, fun-seekers, drag queens, business owners, country lawyers, history buffs, and voodoo devotees. Most prominently, he showcases a murder case that mesmerizes the community and lets many of these actors perform in their natural setting, Savannah, a city that, he concludes, has only one motive: to preserve a way of life that it felt was under siege from all directions. Berendt sums up this way:  The city looked inward, sealed off from the noises and distractions of the world at large. It grew inward too, and in such a way that its people flourished like hothouse plants tended by an indulgent gardener. The ordinary became extraordinary. Eccentrics thrived. Every nuance and quirk of personality achieved greater brilliance in that lush enclosure....""  Berendt put together a remarkable book. It is well worth your time....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 30, 2022","Jun 04, 2022","Jun 04, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/386187.Midnight_in_the_Garden_of_Good_and_Evil

Youthful dreams have begun to darken. But in Christine Hemp’s hands, the challenges and defeats -- and the pain they bring -- do not dim dreams. In fact, they may deepen them, even cast them in more lasting hues. In her book, Wild Ride Home: Love, Loss, and a Little White Horse, a Family Memoir she has captured the texture of life’s middle years. She chronicles the aging and then passing of her parents, her personal battle with breast cancer, and the ups-and-downs of building her own family. And she does so with optimism intact, as if pulled along by the wonder of life itself.She reaches her insights helped, in part, by working with a beautiful, spirited little horse named Buddy. Mistreated in his youth, Buddy misbehaves at times and might even be dangerous. But he can be warm and loving as well. Ms. Hemp interweaves her efforts to understand and reach Buddy with stories of her own life, marked by trials and errors, loss, but also by resolve and perseverance. Ultimately, by accepting Buddy for who he is, warts and all, she grows a special language with him:“My relationship with Buddy has opened a window to a deeper perception of the world. Maybe this is actually what we’re called upon to do in this little life: find home in the most elemental place possible, our own skin.”This is a lovely book.

I will now need about as much time to think about what it's all about. This shouldn't take more than, oh, two or three months. A small note: One thing I love about Murakami (which drives some people absolutely nuts) is his moment-to-moment narrative of the main character's activities: boiling water for tea, going to the fridge for cold cuts, settling into a thick couch, listening to Strauss' Rosenkavalier, picking out a shirt. Often inconsequential, these moments are nevertheless also often vital to his themes, not the least of which is the importance of each tiny moment of time, the present moment, the quantum world of meaning within each drop--of course, a Buddhist principal contrary to the vast rush of the West forward and to the future.Tim Lott wrote an excellent essay in Aeon in September, 2012, which captures this notion: ""The emphasis on the present moment is perhaps Zen’s most distinctive characteristic. In our Western relationship with time, in which we compulsively pick over the past in order to learn lessons from it and then project into a hypothetical future in which those lessons can be applied, the present moment has been compressed to a tiny sliver on the clock face between a vast past and an infinite future. Zen, more than anything else, is about reclaiming and expanding the present moment.""That's not to say that Murakami doesn't  the past, especially the damages from World War II, or peer into the future. It's just that so much of his work sends us inward, to the internal beating of our souls, ushered there in part by attention to the nano-moments of time.

Like the small tightrope walker who, in August 1974, inched his way along the steel thread he'd strung between the Twin Towers, and who brought the city beneath him to a near stop, the people of New York make their way onward, step-by-step, into what lies ahead. Prostitutes, priests, judges, mothers, pedestrians, artists, cops, bartenders, office workers, all balance themselves amid the frequent despair of life, best they can. Along the way, they fail, often. Wars take the sons of mothers. Prostitution and poverty rob the hopes of the young. Car accidents, and snap decisions, and failed marriages, and broken bureaucracies defeat even the most determined, as if life is little but randomness and chaos. And, as readers, we know what is coming--for the Twin Towers, for the people that inhabit them, for the city and the world, in the aftermath of 9/11. But McCann's story, made up of what sometimes feel like unconnected short stories, pulls us forward nonetheless, through the din and the danger. It's strands show us the links in lives, the rebirth and rebuilding, the foundation that, despite frequent destruction, grows stronger--captured brilliantly, in a moment, when a young man on a tightrope performs a death-defying act, against all odds, that makes every little corner of the chaotic world beneath him stop and look and wonder, in awe of the audacity of such hope....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jul 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

Here we have George as he routinely interviews a Foreign Office official who has been fingered (anonymously) as a Soviet spy. All seems well and good--George allows that at that time, in the early 1960s, virtually every intellectual had toyed with Communism as a viable option for the West--so he gives him the all-clear. But the intrigue that follows brings Smiley together with his spy-hunting team (which becomes famous when Le Carre publishes Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy) as they disentangle multiple allegiances and double-dealing in post-WWII/Coldwar Germany.

Both are set in logging camps, during the Great Depression, featuring timber barons clashing with workers, and a hidden mystery. Though my story takes place in the Pacific Northwest, not North Carolina, and ultimately takes a very different route than Serena, it was hard, as an author, to read past these similarities.That said, I'll try. Serena is a beautifully written novel that mixes mystery, ambition, and survival in a steamy cauldron of Depression-era logging, bureaucratic infighting, and, well, sex. It opens with two of the most amazing sentences I've read in a novel, speaking both of their structure and ability to kick-start a plot. From there, we are introduced to characters that open themselves slowly, so readers discover the nuances and imperfections--and their true intentions--only a bit at a time. There's George Pemberton, who wants to build a powerful timber company in the North Carolina hills; his wife, Serena, whose ambition is every bit as grand as her husband's, and exudes a kind of mystical presence; a pregnant young woman, who works for the timber company and carries Pemberton's unborn child; and various roughnecks, troublemakers, snooty-rich businessmen, and hill people.Rash moves this along nicely, and with evenness, and introduces the true complexity that drives the novel to its conclusion with writing that is as gentle and evocative as the North Carolina forests. But I must also say that the story itself is dark, despite all this beauty. I'm usually up for any kind of mayhem or disharmony in a well-written, well-told story, but this one felt too cold. I had trouble feeling empathy for any of the characters and came to dislike them--well, most of them. Maybe Rash is too good at telling about how mean some people can be.But I'd recommend this book nonetheless. A very enjoyable read.

The book captures a man as the institutions and culture he has built his life upon rapidly approach extinction. As such, Major Pettigrew often appears as a relic, almost a character from a Kipling story, but his deep sense of self and his compassion for others show how he is much more than a man of the past. The Major is able to cut through the cacophony of modern life and communicate with people as they are, whether with a child, an edgy young woman, a devout Muslim, a moody son, or an arrogant land developer. He actually listens and thinks. To be sure, he often stumbles, struggles with his long-held senses of appropriate behavior, and must retrace his steps to correct the mishaps. But he endures and succeeds. The symbols of his rigid connection to the past--the cherished guns, his proper standing at the club, even the often stunting reliance on accepted manners and decorum--slip away as he functions in the noisy modern world. In my view, his last stand is this mighty stand to adapt and grow, and to rely upon compassion and caring in all human endeavors.I did like this book. The author, Helen Simonson, gave us some believable, complex characters. I enjoyed the inner conflict in the Major, as well as his good humor. I also thought she captured the setting beautifully, and kept the plot moving nicely. That said, the book went on much too long. Some characters, especially his son Roger, felt like cliches. And the twists and turns sometimes seemed contrived. I felt that the stabbing and threatened suicide detracted, as if the author wasn't confident enough that her strong storyline of character and aging, love and cultural demands wasn't enough to hold the reader. But in fact, it was plenty strong, at least for this reader. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Feb 2016,"Feb 15, 2016","Feb 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6643090-major-pettigrew-s-last-stand

Some of these events still echo today, such as the decisions by global bank regulators to lower US interest rates--thus, according to Bryson, setting off the financial chaos that would trigger the 1929 market crash--and the intensity of racial disharmony and outright racism that gripped many parts of the country. Bryson's style is relaxed and informative, often humorous, and he's quick to point out irony.

But then there is its brutality -- death and decay and depression and drunkenness; Max Morden's anger and repulsion at the gritty realities of life, from his wife's death to the realization that the physical of act of sex is sweaty and smelly and so far removed from that single moment of ""instant divinity"" when one finally touches a breast or touches the lips of a pretty girl. Then, of course, there is Max's constant, nearly instinct-driven journey toward his own death and destruction, rejecting all manner of love and acceptance along the way.The Sea, by John Banville, was the Man Booker prize winner in 2005. Understanably, it garnered massive praise. But it is a complex, often deadly cold tale that requires a detachment in the reader to fully appreciate the work and to step back to gather in its breadth. It also takes some patience, because Banville's brilliant writing is almost undone by his sophomoric use of names and symbols to underscore his meaning. To wit, the word ""morden"" in German means to kill or to end life, which is Max's apparent life-goal, at least as far as his own life is concerned. Giving the character the name ""max"" makes it only worse. The visiting family in the seaside resort are the Grace family -- the source of Max's fascination with daughter Chloe, her mother, and even the governess, Rose. Max indeeds finds grace in the lips and scent of Chloe, and in the upskirt views that her mother offers Max. And then there is the color blue which the author hits us repeatedly over the head with, blue as in sea, light, air, breath, etcBut that aside, Bannville offers a look into a character type that lives for that perfect moment of glee -- discovery, awareness, delight -- but then shuffles off into hiding when it realizes that extending the moment requires hard work, defeat, assertiveness, and, well, living. Max falls in schoolboy love with Chloe's mother, and reaches near ecstasy when she gives him a look at her private regions, but then feels instantly used, even taken advantage of. Same with Chloe, a nymph of the sea who he dislikes and bashes mere moments after he kisses her lips and declares his love for her.Bu the again, he is that type of man. He aches for his own demise. He will not accept his dying wife's admonitions to just go out and live. He is eternally caught in a threesome, whether with the Graces, or Chloe and her twin, or even with his landlady and the aging fellow boarder. But stepping out of that role would nearly sicken him -- he is more a leech, a sucker (and harsh judger of life) than an active participant. Deep in his soul, at least as a youngster, he sought consummation, but found that consummation was complicated. In reading this book I wonder if Bannville is aiming at male egos, always eager for the hunt and the capture, but bored with the aftermath. Max is surrounded by big, powerful women, many of whom seem to know themselves (and can see through him). And he realizes very late that two of his apparent male ""conquests"" -- one with Mrs. grace and one with the aging landlady-- were simply elements of lesbian love that he just downright misinterpreted.Three stars is the best I can do,...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 02, 2014","Nov 10, 2014","Nov 02, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3656.The_Sea

After all, he's pulled together dribs and drabs of cowboys-and-Indians stories, riffs of conversation between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, near random scenes of the soon-to-disappear Wild West, and tossed them together into a physically very thin novel that seems half written, disjointed, and haphazard much of the time. As many of the one- star s suggest, is this just a blown-off after-thought of a famous writer bored with the franchise, but still mining the gold that it pours out?Not at all. This is Lonesome Dove Lean: a tale of an ending in American history, without the beautiful detail, without the hues and colors of the original. This book is stark, sometimes primitive. It strips the ending of the West to its barest bones. It mixes scenes that crisscross the imaginary boundary of the dying Wild West andthe uncertain, modern future, almost as disconnected news reports -- an Indian ambush, an English investor, violent deaths on the plains, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, the shoot-out at the OK Corral, and the new California which becomes home to the Wild West odds-and-ends just as it becomes the birthplace of the lasting American legend. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday ruminate and jawbone their way back and forth across this great divide, sometimes cowboyin' and sometimes shooting and sometimes just play-acting as the world moves on around them, and increasingly without them.As McMurtry says, he has written his characters as""afloat in time,"" to show the legends not in actual detailed history, but in their proper place in the big,broad sweep of America's history....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 28, 2014",Nov 2014,"Oct 28, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18379039-the-last-kind-words-saloon

A collection of short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri, it presents characters, usually of Indian descent, who struggle with life's challenges large and small -- a failing marriage, a housewarming party, a tour of an ancient temple, a hoped-for promotion. Across many of these stories runs a complex, many-hued backdrop: the characters are somewhere along the transition from India to America. Some are born in India but move to America; others are born in America but interact with families still in India.This is a rich environment for producing high-end, nuanced fiction. But it doesn't seem that way at the beginning. In fact, the early stories, on their own, feel thin: a struggling marriage that falls apart a little too predictably over a stillborn child; an American couple of Indian descent who return to India to visit, but who drip of reckless, high-cost, over-sexualized American culture. They seem to have lost their religion, their depth, their way in their transition from ""Indian"" to ""American."" In one of the early stories, an American schoolgirl, whose parents are from India and living in the US, wants to learn more about the battle between Pakistan and India, a war that is raging at that time. But when she wanders to the back of the library in her US school to find books on the subject, her American teacher chastises her because the books bear no relevance to the book report she is supposed to be focused on.These, and other examples like them, made me feel initially that this collection was simply not very sophisticated; not a book of Pulitzer Prize dimensions. But the Awards Committee of the Pulitzer Prize kept reading, as did I. And they apparently discovered what I did -- that this rich environment of complexity and nuance, of India and America, old and new, modern and ancient begins to yield stories of depth, of deep and confusing questions, and of subtlety in meanings that stay with the reader well beyond the completion of the read. Indeed, Lahiri is writing at the top levels of current fiction, despite the occassional clangs of symbolism or predictiability...

There is only American berserk, according to Roth. Bad things happen, very bad things -- explosions, rapes, cheating spouses, nasty children, prostate cancer, forks aimed at the eye. This is true even for the handsome, seemingly perfect, excessively talented high school athletic star and his beauty-pageant wife.My reading of this book is that it is a very personal statement about what life brings. There is the perfection we can often see in youth, but that perfection is an illusion. Don't try to embrace it and hold it. Because there is another wholly unexpected event coming along that will disrupt it and, very likely, blow it to the sky. I suppose this is a very cynical view of life, but as spoken in the voice of an aging novelist and focused on the life of a high-school hero whose best attempts often end in failure or total loss, it feels -- as I noted -- like a very personal, lonely lament of a life shaped by harsh realities and disappointments. More of a ""coming-to-terms with what I've seen"" than ""this is a lousy life and don't expect to be happy."" Others may see this point differently.This book is beautifully written but also terribly overwritten. I felt bludgeoned by paragraph after paragraph that said the same thing -- again, in gorgeous prose. That said, this is a book that is worth the time.
