Yarros is wisely milking the insane success of her fantasy/YA/romance, Fourth Wing, which felt quite clever in its world building of Dragons, a military academy, relics and runes and signets. Not my normal choice for reading but I was entertained. That entertainment did not continue for me with Iron Flame, book 2 in I'm not sure how many sequels she plans for this now series. With her fantasy world pretty much built, Iron Flame's 640 pages were left to fill with cringe worthy dialogue between dragon and human written in italics and a plot that didn't bother with a steady development but, instead, threw climax after climax at its readers. Each of these plot conflicts leading to a climax felt like it could have (maybe even should have) ended the story, but I knew from my page number that it wasn't ending soon. Instead of all of these dire situations feeling exciting, I felt like I was sprinting to false summit after false summit on a frustrating hike. Is this the top? No! I've still got a couple of miles to go. This must be the end....but no! There's more. Not to mention, all of these conflicts were always life and death. And it feels a little weird to not really care if any of these characters die because part of the story is this total nonchalance this world has towards the life of most of the supporting characters. Characters literally die all the time and I never know when it's going to just be a side note, like, ""oh...the death toll for today is 7,"" or ""now I cannot function because there is chance of death for a friend if I cannot control the lightning shooting out of my hands!"" It's really unbalanced. The book ends on a false summit again...shocker. Why write one great book when you can draw it out into 4 or 5 mediocre ones? Authors have to follow the money but readers don't. I'm turning around now to get off this hike....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Mar 11, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/90202302-iron-flame

As the 6th book in a series, there is a continuous, developing story among the main characters, mostly focusing on the relationship between Cormoran Strike and his detective parter, Robin Ellacott. While not necessarily vital to understanding the plot of this book, knowing that story does help shade the motivations, frustrations and reactions of the two detectives throughout their investigation. I had to go back and read the summaries of each book. Then, I discovered they had all been developed into a show that is currently available on Max, so I watched them too! The Ink Black Heart feels significantly more modern than Galbraith's previous books in this series because much of the investigation involves researching suspects' YouTube videos, Instagram, Facebook, online chat forums, fan fiction games, Twitter threads, blogs and a developing Netflix series. The amount of anonymity available online, as well as the possibility that any of the suspects/characters being responsible for more than one account made this murder crime tricky to solve. Just about everyone seemed a likely suspect with plenty of motive and evil in them to do it. I did feel like the final reveal took a bit too long to get to and wasn't as satisfying as earlier books. I just wanted to be done with all of these psychos! One thing that was quite tedious in the audiobook format was the many, many, many chat forum/private message/twitter scenes. The narrator had to verbalize all of these, including the names, dates, times and user handles at the start of each message plus each hashtag at the end. This became pretty annoying over time and I know had I been reading, I could have gone through these passages much faster. Still, if you like mysteries and crime thrillers, these are enjoyable books to take you there. The writing is great. The moral commentary is nuanced enough to not feel preachy and the characters are flawed enough to root for and believe. I'm glad to be back in the Cormoran Strike world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Mar 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60144955-the-ink-black-heart

First of all, I had to wait for forever to get it from the library. I think I waited on hold for a digital copy for almost 6 months. I was so excited once I finally got the book and figured the 21 day loan to read it would be about 18 days longer than I needed, but I ended up power reading it on the day it was due because...I never felt like reading it!My first impression was that the narration was almost fairytale-esq. It felt folksy and a little bit...goofy? I don't know it just wasn't the kind of writing I could take seriously. Each character was developed in an almost slapstick way, like this was all some kind of vaudeville play. Then, the plot did not develop in a straightforward manner. Every time the story progressed, a new character and their backstory and their nickname and who their relatives are and what their jobs are and where they came from and what their religion is and even they way they walk were written about for pages. If someone were telling me this story, I would interrupt them and say, ""Focus!"" because it felt so tangential. Lastly, I couldn't help but feel like this story that was about the unjust prejudices of the Chicken Hill neighborhood outside of Philadelphia in the 1920s and 30s felt very prejudicial. Or at least very stereotypical. The jewish characters were mystical and tribal and owned all the businesses and maybe even a little unethical with money. The black characters were down on their luck, gritty, hardened and not law abiding. The Italians were emotional and uneducated and willing to do anything for money. And the white people were rapists, members of the KKK and had horrible taste in music. So, I should have maybe even hated this book but I didn't. It's not a bad book. On that last day, when I just plowed through all of my grievances, I felt its charm. I got the themes of the American dream and working together and doing the right thing the hard way. It has a strong message of hope and the power of inclusivity and what could be possible without the evils of corruption. Maybe a little bit of heaven on earth. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Mar 04, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65678550-the-heaven-earth-grocery-store

I felt giddy while reading it, feeling certain that I was finally going to have a 5 star book reaction but something happened in the second half of the book. I'm not certain if I just got tired of the back and forth between the 1850s and 60s and 2019 (with a little time spent during the 1950s) but I lost a bit of zeal towards the end. Still, this is high quality historical fiction. It's really almost everything I love about a book. I actually learned a lot! I had never heard of the horse named Lexington, a real horse from the Civil War era that dominated horse racing until a physical ailment forced him into early retirement. I learned about art provenance and its archiving, horse anatomy and what you can tell from skeletons and more about the Civil War including some new, but sadly not surprising, injustices of slavery. I can't imagine the amount of research required to put a novel like this together and voices to both real and imaginary characters along side the actual history. Everything is so smart and helps uncover the mystery of several paintings. I've never been passionate about art and I loved getting a glimpse into the lives of those that art...from the artists to art collectors to gallery owners. While I didn't quite believe the love story between the modern characters, Jess and Theo, I appreciated their inclusion. Both were extremely well educated and described as attractive but Jess was a white Australian and Theo was a black Nigerian American and the subtle yet present traces of systemic racism impact their own views of their blossoming relationship. It was such an interesting contrast to the blatant systemic racism throughout the rest of the book and an important juxtaposition. I'm embarrassed to admit that my own privilege prevented me from predicting the tragic ending. It's horrifying that any of it is a reality for anyone living in the United States today.

I'm always impressed with authors who have the courage to allow the protagonist to be unlikable. In Kuang's case, she not only allows it, but puts the narration in first person, which totally immerses the reader into the obnoxious, jealous, insecure, racist and unpleasant thoughts of the main character, June Hayward. June, an unsuccessful novelist, steals her very successful Asian-American friend's manuscript and then publishes it as her own work after her friend's death. The novel becomes a huge success even though June is a white author and the book is about Chinese Laborers on the European front during World War I. All of that immersion of June and her theft and following Tell-Tale-Heart experience made the book difficult to like. I get it. I kind of admire the satire and tongue-in-cheek navel gazing at how impure books can be...from the writing, publishing, marketing, ing and even award giving. But that didn't mean I enjoyed it. I couldn't wait for it to end and had my own cultural appropriation questions by its end. Does anyone have the freedom to write anything? It seems like a given to me that the answer to that question is yes but this book and many books released, adored and criticized over the last decade call that freedom into question. Should it be a requirement that an author somehow represent the main character or plot in a book, whether that be by race or gender or sexual identity or religion or nationality or any possible thing? This seems only fair to marginalized authors who have such a hard time breaking into the publishing world and finding mass success and appeal to all readers. Many accounts document that experience to be true. So, if that is the highest priority...to increase the percentage of representation of minority and marginalized authors, then the answer to that must be yes. Then, we can at least hope that those books we are reading will be more authentic or true. But Huang, a Chinese-American, throws this question into the book sphere by not only writing about white authors appropriating the culture of others, her Asian culture specifically, but by diving into cultural appropriation herself...by writing the entire perspective of this novel as a white woman, which she is not. I thought it was clever and infuriating. I think (I hope) she intended it to be so. Because she is wildly successful. This book is a hit. But is it fair? Isn't that the point of it all? I thought so until I read her afterward where she says wrote the book to expose the loneliness and stress of being an author. What the what? I mean...yeah. That was in there. But, that can't be the point of this book. To even write a  of this book seems fraught of possible offense. Kuang touches on the influence and weight of book s, even Goodreads, and how polarizing good and bad s to authors as well as those who love or hate any book. She also exposes the absolutely toxic world of Twitter (ok...X), the hustle of book promotion and the surprising accusation that best-sellers and critical darlings are chosen before most books are even finished. That seems super depressing and very George Orwellian. What a weird, troubling, interesting, book.

I don't think there are many people who can deny his legitimate genius. But...he's not very likable. Fortunately for Musk, he's one of the rare cases who truly doesn't care. In fact, if there were a hierarchy of values, being ""likable"" might be at the very bottom. He believes worrying about stepping on toes or following rules or being concerned if someone's feelings might get hurt inhibits innovation and progress. Which deeply bothers the masses who demand our modern day heroes also subscribe to modern day sensibilities. In an age where cancel culture tries its darnedest to silence any offender, attempts to cancel Elon Musk have been often but also futile because...he'll just take over the company trying to silence him instead. Just this week, a news article in the Wall Street Journal claimed the boards for Tesla, Space X, and X (formerly Twitter) all want him gone because of his purported drug use. Now, I don't know if the article is true or not, but I'm sure the boards want him gone. He must be a nightmare to work with. After reading this biography by Walter Isaacson, I can't help but wonder what's true. Did the reporter have sources that have a grudge against Musk? It's very likely. Elon Musk is a polarizing figure. You either admire him or hate him. There doesn't seem to be much in between. Walter Isaacson, as a biographer, definitely admired him. I read a few warning s that this book is biased in favor of Elon Musk but I disagree. I think Isaacson does a fair job in laying out the facts of Musk's life. As a reader, I definitely felt repulsed by him. He and my values do NOT align. But, I found myself admiring Musk, much like Isaacson, anyway because...well...I don't really know. He's just a really unique person who is changing the world in real time. Not decades after the fact or after they die like so many artists, musicians, genius are only allowed to do. It's pretty incredible to think about. His priorities in life are creating sustainable energy to try and save the earth (Tesla), creating an interstellar reality where people can escape Earth due to nuclear war or climate change (Space X and trying to get people to Mars), and protecting all of humanity by ensuring artificial intelligence won't have the ability to wipe out humans (Open AI. Google's Sergey Brin accused Musk of being a speciesist for thinking humans have superiority over other forms of intelligence, even artificial intelligence. These geniuses are definitely weird!). He also thinks artificial intelligence can help humans never have to drive again (self driving cars), and recover from paralysis, blindness, deafness and other brain or neurologic ailments (Neuralink). What's crazy is these aren't just ideas for him. He's doing it. He's creating the cars. He's building the rockets. He's starting to put chips into human brains that code into computers the tasks they just thought about doing. Every time Isaccson uncovered another fascinating tidbit about Elon Musk's life and actions, I felt a bit in awe. But, Isaacson didn't shy away from all the things that make Elon Musk soooo unlikable. In great, and often tiresome detail, there is incident after incident of Musk firing people for challenging his ideas or not doing things his way. Because Musk has zero work/life balance (again...he doesn't operate like most people) he doesn't allow others to say ""no"" or ""later"" to a job demand. He has no compassion or interest in anything that doesn't serve his interests. He undoubtedly had a bad childhood with lots of physical and emotional abuse. He self-diagnoses himself to be on the autism spectrum. He keeps having children with different women through surrogacy and IVF because he thinks smart people need to have more children, never mind the future train wrecks these kids may be in the future because there isn't much nurturing going on there. I don't think these are the actions of a ""great"" person. Truly, I loved this biography. I can't think of a more interesting person than Elon Musk on the earth today and Walter Isaacson is a talented enough biographer to share his genius, maybe even evil genius, with the world. ...more",Notes are private!,2,4,1,"Jan 16, 2024","Jan 16, 2024","Jan 16, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/122765395-elon-musk

The writing is great. Very fluid and descriptive and so easy that you feel like you're in the cherry orchard or at the lake or on the stage. I liked the dialogue and felt like the rhythm and conversations were natural and how people actually talk and interrupt and listen. And I loved listening to Meryl Streep on the audio. I'm pretty sure that was a perfect pairing. But, there was quite a bit I didn't love. I didn't love the dependence on knowing something about a play called, ""Our Town."" As it sometimes happens when I listen to an audio book, I missed the title of the play when it was given at the very beginning, when Laura (pre Lara) and her friend Veronica were checking in the locals for the community play auditions. She kept talking about Emily, Emily, Emily and George, George, George so I actually Googled (because it can be hard to rewind and find a certain spot in an audiobook), ""What play are they talking about at the beginning of Tom Lake?"" I saw the answer, ""Our Town"" which I have never seen but didn't worry too much about it because I didn't figure a literary novel would require a prerequisite knowledge of an old play. I guess it's not a prerequisite but it sure would have helped me connect to the book better. The entire plot is intertwined with the main character's love and participation in the role of Emily. I still don't know anything about the play but I know there's a guy frequently referred to as the Stage Manager, who is Emily's father (I think) and that she marries George and that Emily eventually dies. Sorry if that's a spoiler but, like I said, there's almost an assumption made that this play is all part of the general consciousness. The story is a back and forth between mother and daughters who want to know every single detail about a summer their mother spent at Tom Lake acting in the play ""Our Town"" opposite a now-famous movie actor, Peter Duke. Most of the book is spent in recollections building up to a summer Lara spent at Tom Lake. The current setting is at a fruit farm in Michigan during the world-is-shut-down phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. At least, I am guessing why all three of Lara's (I don't think she goes back to being Laura but it's hard to tell in audio format) daughters are at their childhood home as grown adults with their aging parents (eventually revealed to be 57, which is seeming less and less elderly to me now that I'm only a decade away from it). I'm not saying it's unrealistic that all of her children are equally eager to hear their mother monologue about a summer 33 years earlier over the course of many days but....ok...it feels a bit unrealistic. I have two children in their 20s and I think I could hold their attention and bend their ear with the kind of details Lara includes (what she was wearing, how my boyfriend (who...yes is a famous actor but is not their dad) dresses and walks and hits tennis balls) of my young adult life for maybe 10 minutes. Maybe. And it was always Lara cutting off the story. Her daughters didn't want to go to bed. They didn't want to go to work. They never wanted to miss a single detail so if someone had to go somewhere, Lara was given strict orders not to continue the story until they returned. I found this ability to monologue and share so many details (not all but most. The reader gets to know all) inconsistent with the modern day Lara. This easy going, cherry-pickin', seamstress, hard-working farmhouse dwelling Lara doesn't seem like an attention whore or someone who possesses a particularly dynamic personality. She seems pleasant and easy to be around...as a teenager, college student, summer-stock actress and mother. I just couldn't figure out how this big love story of her youth had never been shared before and how comfortable she now felt sharing it. Even around her husband. It's possible I guess. But...her two characters just didn't melt together the way my brain needed to happen. It also didn't seem that devastating when all the details were revealed. So, someone she loved at 24 didn't end up being the love of her life. This is probably most 57 year-old's stories. I guess Peter Duke's fame made it more interesting but since we didn't really get to know older Peter Duke (other than he became a sterotypically troubled Hollywood star), none of it seemed that earth shattering.  All my complaining aside, this is a really sweet, fun piece of fiction. It made me want to take up sewing and eat fresh fruit. It made me want to go to my local theater and witness the disparity between good acting and you-get-what-you-get-and-you-don't-throw-a-fit acting. It made me want to swim in a lake. But, I don't think this is a big revelatory story that connects us as humans. Most people don't date people who go on to become famous and most of us don't have a chance at fame but decide we want to live on a farm instead. And most of us will never get our children begging us to share all the details of our young lives because...there's probably a TikTok (or 100) they'd rather watch....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,Jan 2024,"Jan 06, 2024","Jan 06, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63241104-tom-lake

But, I heard from several respectable readers that Carrie Soto Is Back was a different style and better. So I tried again. And....I enjoyed it much more than her previous books. For a book about tennis, it contains A LOT of tennis. That's kind of fun. Maybe it was a little tennis heavy (there are whole games that are play by plays) but I admired the unadulterated ode to tennis and professional athletes. For a book whose plot is based solely on the main character, Carrie Soto, I thought it was rather bold of the author to make her hard-to-like. Carrie Soto is ambitious to the point of being rude, selfish and unkind to almost everyone. Through back story and conversation, the reader is led to understand some of the why behind her behavior but I liked that the protagonist was prickly. It felt real. She seemed a little neurodivergent to me - disliking hugs, eye contact and pleasant conversation, and I found the characterization interesting. She is different and unlikable but maybe that is ok. Maybe I can still cheer for her and want her success. There is a little bit of romance. Some trauma. Some growth. I never felt bored and wanted to know how the story would end. That's a solid ""like"" for me.

Perhaps I shouldn't have listened to both on audio. Because for some reason, I liked Anything Is Possible, the sequel or book #2 in the Lucy Barton series written by Elizabeth Strout, a whole lot less than the first book. I asked myself if I would have liked this more had I not read Lucy Barton first...if it would have even made sense. Anything Is Possible is A LOT like Strout's Pulitzer Prize winning Olive Kitterage. There are 9 short stories that each have characters that somehow tie into knowing Lucy Barton or one of her siblings or the town of Amgash, Illinois where the Bartons grew up in abject poverty. In my opinion, I think I like the narrative style of connecting in this book even MORE than when Strout used it with Olive Kitterage. It made sense to take these mere mentions of names from one book and develop them in another. It's really clever and worth all of the writing accolades and praise Strout receives with this style. What I didn't like at all is that each story ultimately reveals a horrific, criminal level amount of abuse, sexual deviancy, or unresolved trauma in every person's story. As if every Tom, Dick or Jane walking around the streets has a hidden story that could and probably should put someone in jail. For me, that beautiful humanity that Strout creates crumbles into something almost unbelievable because it's just so overdone. I'm not saying these stories don't exist. They certainly do. But most people have marital problems because someone has a higher libido than the other partner or resentment over socks not making it into the hamper or just boredom. Not spouses secretly having affairs with prostitutes, being voyeurs and predators, or abstinent due to past sexual abuse. As each short story would start, I found myself asking, ""I wonder what the weird sexual dysfunction will be in this story?"" and would only need to wait a while before it was revealed. There was always a revelation. I also took a bit of offense at Strout's repetitive body shaming. She, or at least the narrators of her books, seems to hate fat people! The word fat is used as the worst kind of insult in almost every story. Her fat characters were usually pathetic and pitied...as if it was the worst possible thing. The man who had an affair with his secretary for a decade. But the secretary was fat! Patty had such a pretty face. But she was fat! The sister who couldn't cross her legs on the sofa. Because she was fat! I appreciate getting a picture of the characters but this repeated and condemned flaw in many of Strout's characters seemed to stand out to me. Ultimately, I felt tired at the end of the book because all of these stories were pretty depressing. I definitely believe that every human suffers and there are unknown tragedies in every life but there were very little triumphs in these stories to help balance it all out. For such an optimistic title, I did not feel like any of these characters actually believed that anything was possible in their lives. Most, if not all, were stuck in their unspoken about horror.

""There is a series?"" I replied.Indeed there is and My Name Is Lucy Barton is the first book. I read this slim book fast...not knowing what to expect. I was immediately taken in by Lucy's narration of spending nine weeks due to complications following an appendectomy in a New York City hospital with a view of the Chrysler building. All of that time for her to lie around thinking about her past, her present, her relationships. The reader learns that Lucy grew up in extreme poverty in Amgash, Illinois with a brother and a sister and that they all were, at times, horribly neglected and abused. Lucy is intoxicated by kindness and immediately loves any person who displays any, especially towards her. When her mother comes to visit her in the hospital for five days, we learn little about their relationship but quite a bit about their discomfort to talk about their feelings and their past. Instead, they gossip about other people and their marriages, never talking about the problems in their own. Lucy has two young daughters and a husband who seems to care for her and shows it by making sure she has a private room and a television, even though she never watches TV and feels lonely almost all of the time, but he rarely comes to visit her because of his own trauma with hospitals. I understand the frustration with this type of narration because it IS frustrating to read at times. So many things are referenced vaguely (I hate this in real life. If you're going to share...share!) There is rarely a point to her ruminations except for a gentle uncovering of the human condition in such a painfully honest way. When I let go of my need for greater details about a character or loose ends to be tied up from one of her memories, I really appreciated witnessing Lucy Barton's vulnerability. And I enjoyed Elizabeth Strout writing her.

When a murder happens at their very own residence, they manipulate the detectives on the case to letting them help solve the case. And, of course, they do. It's all very cute. Just not at all believable. I really liked the detectives: overweight, smart lonely Chris and jilted but kind Donna. The narrator's time spent with Chris's self-reflection were some of my favorite parts of the book. However, I don't think I like cute murders or cozy mysteries all that much.

Set in Australia, having a narrator with an Australian accent really helped me feel immersed in the setting. I'm not sure I would have been able to feel the setting as an additional character without simultaneously hearing the charming vowel diphthongs so throughly enunciated by the narrator. I loved it. Apples Never Fall is a wonderful mixture of serious and funny. The situations are almost always serious: marital strife, poor health, sibling rivalry, jealousy, infidelity and then the big ones...a missing person and suspected murder.

The times I've said it have been motivated I have told my sons before that there are few things in life as unattractive to me as an adult male gamer. The times I've said it have been motivated by fear after realizing one of them has spent an entire day playing some game that seems pointless and stupid to me in hopes that they'll be so swayed by my prejudice and motherly influence that they'll recognize the folly of their ways and go outside to play or read a book...my ideas of appropriate and better uses of free time. Video games have always seemed like a horrible and addictive hobby to me. A time waster. Possibly even dangerous. Of course, this is my own admittedly polarizing opinion but I've been very cautious as a parent in their access to the world of video gaming. For a long time...no interactive play (that's near impossible now). Nothing online where the creeps of the world could have any access to them. No shooter games. Nothing rated M. Allowed games were sports games like Fifa. Madden. Or unrealistic fantasy games like Lego Star Wars. I fondly reminisce about the innocent days of Wii bowling. Anyway, I share my anti-gaming bias (that will likely enrage some) because I didn't know going into reading Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow that it was a book about gaming. I'm sure I wouldn't have read/listened to it had I known. It came as an audio library hold that I think I initially selected because it was in the ""popular"" category and I'd seen the cover on Goodreads and figured I'd get in the hold line. I didn't read a book jacket or look anything up on Goodreads or Amazon and once I started listening to it, I was immediately pulled into the characters of Sadie and Sam. Sam and Sadie who met as kids in a hospital and bonded over their love of video games. Sadie and Sam who later meet again in Boston while both are in college and reconnect to design and build a video game. Sam and Sadie who spend the next 20 years pushing each other towards career and financial success, resenting each other for perceived failures and jealousies, hurting each other by not saying the things that should be said, living through shared traumas and reconnecting again through video games. By the end of the book, Sadie and Sam became the book for me. It wasn't so much about video games as it was about these two people who happened to play and like video games. Their characters and how real they felt and how much I understood their hopes and fears and why they lived their lives in the manner they each chose felt perfectly reasonable. They experienced trauma, abuse, poverty, sexism, racism, pain, love, ability, perception, attention, lack of attention, ambition....and all of those building blocks created a very believable world. A world that is vastly different from mine but one I appreciated having access to while in this story. Yes, the process of video game design and the strong defense of it as an art form were both effectively shared, but I loved these beautifully flawed characters who hurt and loved each other in beautifully flawed ways. The meaning of the title wasn't revealed until I was nearly 80% through and I loved the metaphor. It comes from Shakespeare's MacBeth (which I haven't read but it is explained) where he despairs the futility of life. That all our tomorrows ultimately, pointlessly lead to the same end as everyone else: death. But for gamers, Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow is the point. There is always the opportunity to Restart. Level up. Earn more lives. Play it differently. Learn the cheats from someone else. Keep playing. Both Sadie and Sam love games because gaming allows them to escape to a different world...a better world that is more fair and more equal and where they can be who they want to be without limits. But Sam and Sadie ultimately learn that they can use what they learn through their games to be the versions of themselves they want to be and maybe even have the relationship with each other that they both crave. I don't think I'll ever be a genuine fan of video gaming but this book opened my eyes to my own bias towards a world and population of people that now feels unfair. It shouldn't keep shocking me but once again I learned that judging people really just means that I don't understand them. Or fear them somehow. I judge when I don't take the time to see or try to understand something foreign to me. The book Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow helped me learn something. I see the world....their world...my world....our world differently now. Just a little bit.

It's listed as historical fantasy and the title is long and weird and the cover really unappealing to me. But, I trust my sister's taste a lot and needed something to motivate me into reading and discussing something with some oomph and teeth again. There are parts of this book that are written so lyrically and philosophically sound that I found myself nodding my head at times. I am impressed b Kuang's dedication to defend language translation as art as well as a source of power. This modality of communication has the power to unite, divide, explain, confuse, reveal and lie and yet it's billed as something as banal as academic. It's certainly not an exact science and those who can translate...those who understand languages fully enough to look beyond definition but, instead, can see use and meaning...have a gift and power to use for all of the above. With my gushing awe in mind, I forgave Kuang a lot for writing some unapologetically boring paragraphs in her narrative. The etymology of words was her schtick, and I knew it and the book is so full of long descriptions of what words mean and what they used to mean that I feel like I can't complain about not caring but...I stopped caring early on. Every time she does this, which happens way more frequently at the beginning of the book than at the end, my reading muscles would tense and I'd feel irritated to be taken out of the story and into a lecture. But, the literal translation of many words is only a small part of this massive work in the end. Kuang effectively builds a fantasy world set in 1830s Oxford England that closely resembles actual history. The fantasy only lies in the actual power she gives translators instead if the symbolic and philosophical power they have in the real world. In Kuang's Babel, translators can etch words on the sides of silver bars in different languages and the subtle differences between the meanings powers or gives energy to the silver in a way that makes things like ships, bricks, wheels, and even food function better. Since efficiency and luxury are products for the wealthy, those that have have even more and those with less get nothing. Kuang's attack of capitalism and Britain's colonial past is not subtle and the revolution that ultimately serves as the climax of the book felt heavy handed to me. The main character, Robin Swift, was the best developed and I felt his struggles with equality, friendship, loyalty, self-interest and power the most but nearly all the other characters were allowed to be only good or bad. No book can do all things but characters and nuance are not this book's strengths. So, why 4 stars when I'm complaining about what I didn't like? This book is massively impressive. It's smart. It's really ambitious. And, even though it has boring moments, it's not boring. So, while 4 stars on Goodreads is supposed to mean ""really liked it"" for me, it's more ""really admired it."" More of a 3 for liking.

It didn't feel funny or outrageous or a colossal bungling of misinterpretation and good intentions like the first book, which I quite enjoyed. Instead it felt ridiculous, confusing, and tedious. The same cast of characters appears in Finlay Donovan Knocks'Em Dead as the first book only this time, Finlay, a romantic suspense author struggling to write the sequel to her smash hit book (it's a parallel story), is now on the hunt for two online forum posters: the person who offered cash to kill her ex husband and the contract killer who said they would do it. Since the entire premise of the first book is how awful her ex-husband is, it was hard to drum up any sympathy and urgency for his safety to begin with. Then, all of the fun supporting characters from the first book were just....no longer fun. Vero, her live-in nanny, is not only not helpful, she's a total leech and criminally irresponsible. Then, there was zero heat between Finlay and her two love interests, Nick, the cop and Julien, the law student. The Russian Mob shows up again but the bad guy is behind bars and less present and threatening. However, Finaly's callous disregard for human life and corpses makes her only slightly more sympathetic than them. Her children, who supposedly make her the hot mess we're supposed to be rooting for, barely make any of the scenes. They are just never around. Ultimately, I felt annoyed for most of the book and super disappointed that I didn't get the fun escapist mystery that I hoped for. The author is clearly building a series as the book ended in somewhat of a cliff hanger but Finlay Donovan and her lack of common sense or really any redeeming qualities is dead for me now....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 03, 2022","Mar 08, 2022","Mar 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693474-finlay-donovan-knocks-em-dead

Why should I care about their life? Most of the time, when I choose to read a memoir, I have some previous knowledge about who the author is. In the case of Crying in H Mart, I did not know anything about Michelle Zauner. I didn't even know what an H mart was. All I knew was that this book gets great s and it was available at my library. That's usually enough motivation for me to read something. I liked it right away. From the opening pages, I found the writing to be very accessible, vividly described and emotional. I could see each scene almost as if I was watching a movie. I loved the author's honesty and authentic feelings towards a mother who adored her, belittled her, smothered her, shared things with her, kept secrets from her and then died way too soon. I loved the description and access to her grief. It was so raw. Eventually, I found out through the book that Michelle Zauner is an indie rock star for a band named Japanese Breakfast. I had never heard of the band and went to Apple Music and YouTube to check it out. Talk about great cross-promotion. I didn't love the music but she is a fantastic writer. A real artist in many ways. Food and Korean food in particular play a starring role throughout the book. Zauner's description of dishes, which include nothing I have ever eaten, sometimes made my mouth water and other times, I grimaced. But the connection that she had to her mother through food, and then to her Korean roots through food was powerful. It made me want to connect to my children through my own style of cooking. Towards the end of the book, Zauner talks about preparing Kimchi and the process of fermentation that is required to make it. The description isn't out of place because there is so much talk about food throughout the book but then she ties the Kimchi to this amazing metaphor about death and remembering those we love who have died. She writes:“The memories I stored, I could not let fester. Could not let trauma infiltrate and spread, to spoil and render them useless. They were moments to be tended. The culture we shared was active, effervescent in my gut and in my genes, and I had to seize it, foster it so it did not die in me. So that I could pass it on someday. The lessons she imparted, the proof of her life lived on in me, in every move and deed. I was what she left behind. If I could not be with my mother, I would be her.”Just....wow. I would never presume a 20-something year old Korean American rocker who has a passion for Korean food would already have a lived a life that I need to know anything about or that would help me in any way, but Crying in H Mart honesty and clear writing helps its readers build bridges of understanding between generations and cultures...between mothers and daughters...between resentment and forgiveness... between grief and hope....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 21, 2022","Feb 25, 2022","Feb 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54814676-crying-in-h-mart

That's it. I was pretty ignorant. From all of the book suggestions I saw across Goodreads, Amazon and my public library promoting Black History Month, I saw this cover and decided to read this classic to educate myself about a world and perspective on race that is surely different from my own life experiences.  The Color Purple  is narrated in an epistolary style with letters written by Celie first to God and, later, to her sister, Nettie as well as Nettie's letters written to Celie. The sisters are separated after Celie, who was sexually abused by the man she knew as her father, sold her off to another man who wanted a wife to help raise his young children. The man, Mr. ____ (this is how Celie refers to him in all of her letters) really wants Nettie, who is better educated and described as more attractive, but Celie protects Nettie from both their father's and now husband's sexual interest and abuse by sending her away, even though Nettie is Celie's only experience of feeling love and kindness. Nettie ends up in Africa on a missionary trip so the story highlights the racial and economic issues from European colonization there as well through Nettie's letters. It was an interesting way to intersect two pretty different settings and stories. While I was just getting into the book and realized it was set in pre World-War II Georgia, I wondered if my time, energy and understanding about racial matters in America would be better served reading a more contemporary novel with current outlooks and voices. I soon realized that some books and the themes they present can never become outdated because the issues never go away. Who is God? Why do we suffer? What does love look like? How does abuse and oppression affect its victims? What are the effects of slavery...the descendants of slaves...the traders of slaves from Africa...the owners and descendants of owners of slaves? Why do we adhere to gender roles and what is the harm or help in them?The title is perfect. Early on in the novel, when Celie needs a new dress and notices and likes a purple one in the store, she writes in her letter to God that purple is the color of royalty and reserved for confident, independent and queenly women like Shug Avery. Not feeling worthy to wear such a beautiful color, she chooses a blue dress instead. Later on, when Celie is friends and lovers with Shug, Shug tells Celie, “I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it. People think pleasing God is all God cares about. But any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back.” Celie is finally able to enjoy the color purple, even after all of the harm and pain she has experienced. This book brings an important and timeless voice to any current conversation about race, gender roles, abuse, family, love and the dignity and joy every human should experience in life.

The president in that book was a thinly veiled caricature of President Clinton and it struck me as a bit narcissistic to write a ""fictional"" book so flattering about oneself and so obvious about it. But, I also have never been a big James Patterson fan so chalked it up to a combo of a story/writing that didn't appeal to me. When I saw this book, and saw that Louise Penny had co-authored with Hillary Clinton, I felt some apprehension, (because how different could it be?) but I do like Louise Penny's mystery books a lot more than Patterson's books so thought I'd give it a try. I like mysteries. I like political thrillers. I'm not a Hillary Clinton hater and even voted for her but who she is in real life shouldn't influence whether I like a fictional thriller she wrote or not. Right? Ummmm, it totally influenced my reaction to this book because I found her guilty of the same writing sin as her husband! Her protagonist, Secretary of State Ellen Adams, was clearly based on herself and while the certainly realistic and behind-the-scene political settings are fascinating to read about, and something Clinton has had an up close and personal view of for years, it's such a turn-off to me to recognize the real-life feelings, politics, and opinions expressed as poorly disguised fiction. It feels petty, blatantly biased and, honestly, uninteresting. Obama is in there as the character of the newly elected president who appoints her as Secretary of State just to watch her fail (but she doesn't...surprise!) and Trump is definitely in there as the former president and reason the entire earth is about to be blown to smithereens by crazy terrorists because he is just that horrible of a human being and his administration ruined America. Subtle, it is not. After about half-way thought the book, I found myself disengaging from the plot, which shouldn't happen in a thriller. That's when I should be the most invested. The most concerned. The most desperate to discover how the threat is going to be averted. But, it was clear that the smart women were going to save the day from the powerful but incompetent men in charge and...ta da. Hillary Clinton is obviously a very smart woman, capable politician, experienced diplomat and has the skills to be a good writer of fiction. I think she should try to write a book using all of those positive attributes and leave out the airing of all her real-life grievances.

I really enjoyed the confidence and strength she gave these voices from the past as well as her plea to judge them based on their own words and their own sources rather than strictly through our 21st century lens or from historically weak sources. When I came across this book, I was eager to know more about Emma Hale Smith, a well recognized but often misunderstood woman.The main issue I have with First: The Life and Faith of Emma Smith is the formatting. It is very scholarly and divided into topic rather than any sort of chronology. With heavy documentation, sourcing and footnoting, I usually had one hand on the page I was reading and the other hand saving the place to that chapter's footnotes so that I could identify the source from sentence to sentence while I read. It's frustrating that very few of the sources are ever from Emma Smith herself. She did not keep a journal and did not write many letters. Several times, the same source was used repeatedly in different chapters which had me feeling like I was maze reading...passing by the same spot again and again. All of that attention to historical detail, while super important for validity, wasn't exactly conducive to riveting reading. There weren't many surprises for me, which was a relief but also a source of frustration. Especially in regards to the end of Joseph Smith's life and the chaotic schism that happened between Emma and the main body of church members who continued to follow Brigham Young. It was clear to me, although there is very little explanation as to why, how deeply betrayed Emma was by the practice of polygamy. My heart hurt for her and she has all of my compassion and empathy because I honestly can't imagine being any less hurt in her situation. Jennifer Reeder, the author, suggests an equally compassionate and empathetic response to the practicers of polygamy and I need to probably lend them the same time and effort to understand their why as I made to Emma by reading more. Although it didn't adequately answer the questions I had, mainly why she vehemently denounced polygamy and even lied to her children and others about her knowledge of it, but never denounced Joseph, who betrayed her by practicing it without her approval or even knowledge (not every time but multiple times). I appreciated the well sourced book of information about Emma and the remarkable woman she was. I echo Emma's own desire when she wrote, ""I desire the Spirit of God to know and understand myself, that I might be able to overcome whatever tradition or nature that would not tend to my exaltation in the eternal worlds."" What a pure desire of the heart. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 14, 2022","Jan 30, 2022","Jan 31, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57379304-first

It's so jumpy and with all of the ""notes to self"" and ""bumper stickers"" and poems interjected into stories, it was hard to follow at times and...well...kind of weird.But, it's also a good memoir. He's a unique person and an interesting guy with a pretty crazy childhood and really fascinating life experiences, like floating on the Amazon and motorcycling through Europe. I couldn't help but envy his sense of freedom and unconventionality. I don't think anyone could avoid being at least mildly entertained listening to his stories. It's certainly not boring listening to a story about him being around 5 years old and witnessing his mother breaking his father's nose with the phone handset she has in her hand while she calls 911 because he is chasing her around the kitchen with a broken ketchup bottle, squirting her with ketchup but when he finally reaches her, instead of fighting they passionately embrace, drop to the floor and begin making love. IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN. No, not boring at all but also not ok. That's called family dysfunction and chaos and abuse and kudos to McConaughey for still managing to become a productive member of society in spite of his chaotic ""old school"" childhood he had. But, the fact that he giggles (really giggles) while sharing these stories and somehow seems to believe that this tough love was all for his benefit makes me question the wisdom of any of his moral certainty. I did really like the title and his perspective that life is full of green lights (signals to proceed, act, go!) if you look at most experiences the right way. And, even if it's a clear red or a yellow light, and you don't get the go you want...patience and perseverance will eventually switch those reds and yellows to greens. I'm very happy that Matthew McConaughey loves his life so much. Good for him. Things definitely worked out in his case.

It's an interesting mix. Some of the 10 were misses for me; they left me unfulfilled after following the arc, but many of these stories were incredibly profound for being so short. I loved the longing of Creature, although I hated what the protagonist had to learn. I wanted to hug the bookseller in Five Tuesdays in Winter, his loneliness and awkwardness constantly shadowing his goodness.

And since she seems to imbue her own morality, thinking and politics into her books, (as I'm sure most authors do but it's quite obvious here) eventually, I'm left a bit turned off. Her characters in Beautiful World, Where Are You are all so gorgeously flawed, complicated and even contradictory at times to how it seems Rooney would want them be and act that it makes me believe them. I'm convinced that Eileen and Alice and Felix and Simon really think and act like they do and why. And, then the writing...it just flows. Nothing exciting ever happens and there is so much melancholy and frustratingly poor communication happening and yet I was almost always eager to get back to the book after a break. Because I wanted to know...could these unhappy souls find their beautiful worlds? Would they? Beautiful World, Where Are You dives into the lives of two women, their friendship with each other, their romantic interests and failures and their search for meaning in their careers, their families, their community, their political beliefs and even their joint non-belief in religion. There is a lot of philosophical navel-gazing as the two exchange emails back and forth throughout the novel. As interesting as these emails were, and as much as they give the book its bit of gravitas, I also had to seriously question whether anybody actually sends or receives emails like this. I, for one, love to email. But, I have never, in any exchange with anyone, ever, discussed the lost truths of the Bronze Age or the irony of conservatism or the never-ending evils of plastics. They were definitely more essay than a conversation. There was also a lack of distinctive voices in these emails and I could never tell if it was Alice or Eileen writing, if I happened to put the book down and pick it up later (I always had to turn back a few pages to get my bearings back). My guess is that is because the emails were both Sally Rooney. Which made the parts of the email where Alice, who was a successful but cynical writer, complaining about the disingenuous ability of successful contemporary literary authors to write anything honest or real, because their success and worry about awards and fame preclude them from knowing anything honest or real anymore, really interesting.I'm about as anti-marxist as it pertains to a viable economic system as you can get in my personal beliefs but I do appreciate Rooney's convictions in her books. Her characters really hate capitalism and the oppression of the working class. I'm also an unapologetic believer in Jesus and even though I think Rooney does a thorough job of making sure her readers understand that anyone that believes in Jesus is pretty much an ignoramus, she also allows the beauty of sincere belief to be described with kindness in her character, Simon (who happened to be my favorite character. Shocking, I know). I'm not a millennial. I'm not a marxist. I'm not Irish. I'm not an atheist.

As smart as those computers usually are at predicting what I'll like, they were wrong this time. I keep asking myself why this book was mostly a miss for me. The truthful answer is...I finished it feeling unmoved. I'm pretty sure I was supposed to feel aghast and ashamed at how the world treated the LGBTQ+ community in the past (and there certainly is a sort of wonder and embarrassment about how, not that very long ago, a lack of acceptance or at least tolerance towards members in the community was not only NOT cancelled, but considered a virtue) but I think Jenkins Reid's tangling those sentiments with Evelyn Hugo's selfish and ambitious-to-the-point-of-cruel character lessened that effect for me. And I didn't want it to be lessened. I wanted to step into the fictional character's shoes and feel a pain I don't feel in my real life. I wanted to learn. But I didn't really get to wear her shoes due to the format of the narration and I didn't buy her love story and, in the end, I really didn't feel much sympathy towards her after the way she manipulated and treated others her entire life. Hugo's grand life lesson in the end...that it isn't the money or the fame that matters but the people who you love and who love you...was still doled out in an extremely manipulative manner.

While I mostly select books I think I will like, I will occasionally challenge myself with something outside my comfort zone. Usually, those other genres only reinforce my preferences: I like fiction best (and a really good biography or non-fiction piece once in a while). During the 1st chapter of Cloud Cuckoo Land by Anthony Doerr (I'll admit the weird title put me off a bit), I thought to myself, ""This is exactly my kind of book! I think I'm going to love this!"" The description of the characters...what they were wearing...how they felt...why they were in a library...the hint of conflict and foreshadowing of trouble...I felt so excited. Then, the book shifted to a transcript of an old greek play (umm....I don't read those on purpose), followed by a story of Ana in Constantinople in the 15th century during the siege of the sultan of the Ottoman Empire (is this historical fiction??), and THEN a chapter of Konstance in some future spaceship on its way to another inhabitable planet lightyears away. Very sci-fi. I was disheartened. Doerr was not going to feed me my fiction in my preferred contemporary or at least fairly recent historical form. This book was going to take some effort. It did take effort. Anytime narrators change and settings change and even the conflict changes, the author takes a leap of faith that the reader will be motivated enough to go through another development. Connect to more characters. Doerr at least hints throughout his multiple narratives that all the various stories will eventually come together but I had to be patient because not all of the narratives held my interest. I did not enjoy the retelling of the translated greek story Cloud Cuckoo Land. It was fanciful and mythological and juvenile and I had to force myself to read it instead of skip over it. I figured Doerr included it (and used it as his novel's title) for a reason. I'm glad I persevered and slogged my way through those parts because it ends up being THE metaphor for all the stories. My takeaway is that every generation is experiencing its own end-of-days type apocalypse and searching and hoping for a way to find relief from the suffering. I think I read a news story or a social media post every day that somehow alludes to the belief that ""things have never been worse than they are right now."" And I always think, ""Really? Ever?"" That's not to say I don't think things are bad right now or that we don't face serious challenges. We do. So has every generation before us. And logic argues that so will every generation that follows. So, what is the point of the struggle and suffering and is there a place for hope amidst the despair? The point IS the struggle and the hope that knowledge, courage, resilience, cooperation, truth, ideals and love will carry us through. Because they have...through every generation. And our stories, when written down, saved and shared will be the hope and source of power for future generations. Cloud Cuckoo Land is a ridiculously ambitious work of fiction but one I whole-heartedly think deserves the effort to be read. Because our stories matter and connect each one of us to the past and future world....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Nov 03, 2021","Nov 10, 2021","Nov 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56783258-cloud-cuckoo-land

This may sound extremely judgmental and narrow minded but as a religious person with a deep commitment and belief in Jesus Christ as THE source of peace, healing and personal growth, it offended me a bit whenever I felt like the masses, and especially my fellow believers, bowed down to the golden calf of Brené. In a reaction to that prejudice instead of a more honest reaction to any actual primary source material, I actively avoided all the books, the TED talks, the podcasts. I just didn't want to worship the wrong thing, you know? Then, due to some cajoling from a respected friend, I watched her TED talk on Shame and Vulnerability last year. I really enjoyed it. I loved her humor and self deprecation and speaking style. She's someone I think I would love to have lunch with and someone with whom it's possible to have a ""real"" conversation. In a short 10 minutes, she gained my respect at what I believe she is trying to do: help people love and accept who they truly are. And, that message needs to be heard in today's culture of veneered perfection through filtered images on social media. We need to know that we, the imperfect, have value as we are. I value all roads that lead humanity to love each other as we are and strive towards accepting whole heartedness in ourselves and others. And Brené Brown is one of those roads. While I still didn't become a devotee, I did check out her Gifts of Imperfection 10 year edition when it became available at the library. And....drumroll....I liked it. I get why people really like Brené Brown and quote her incessantly on social media. She's quotable. What I really liked about her Gifts of Imperfection book was the forward that mentioned how much easier it is to be vulnerable when you aren't also marginalized. I thought about that good and long. I absolutely flock to those who can be vulnerable in a palatable-to-me way but recognized immediately after her mentioning how uncomfortable I am with those who expose their different-than-me vulnerabilities. We're in a weird dynamic right now where some vulnerabilities are revered and others are cancelled. Like I said, I'm still thinking about it good and long. I also appreciated her emphasis on how boundaries are necessary to be truly compassionate. I keep trying to apply her reasoning to different situations and I don't think most humans really recognize the compassion when accompanied by boundaries and instead interpret the boundaries as unkindness, judgment and selfishness. I wonder if we can evolve a bit more to really connect the two.What I think is lacking in her book, a bit, is access to all the research she refers to in her writing. Most sentences are prefaced with some kind of ""my research shows"" or ""the data indicates"" but she never shares her data. It feels a bit made up, honestly. I don't think she's wrong or lying about her conclusions but because she doesn't include her hard data in the footnotes, I'm left to wonder if she can skew the results in whatever direction she wants them to go. Perhaps not, but I did notice the lack of transparency in how she got all of her big-reveal results. After I finished the book, I listened to her podcast, ""Dare to Lead."" It may have been too much too soon. It happened to be a podcast devoted to the anxiety and depression we feel due to the Covid-10 pandemic and I just felt like she was less than gracious in some of her comments towards those who think differently than her. An intellectual snobbery towards the less than perfect in their vaccine understanding, if you will. So...shrug. I don't know. I guess she's still a bit of a golden calf to me....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jan 2021,"Sep 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52578859-the-gifts-of-imperfection

The quote says, ""He [Walk] was all cop, and Vincent was all bad."" This quote shouldn't mean anything other than possibly revealing the black and white thinking of a young, traumatized, teenage girl but I underlined it because at that point of the book, more than half way through, it perfectly described my own thoughts about ALL of the characters of the book so far. They were all....something. And nothing else. When I read a book that is full of characters I have never met, who are only allowed to be one thing...I just...I don't believe the story anymore. Because I don't believe them. The most obvious was Duchess Day Radley, who called herself an outlaw. Without a doubt, she had every reason to be messed up. Being the primary care-giver to her younger 5 year old brother, Robin, because her mother, Star, was incapable of caring for anyone, including herself, Duchess had a weight on her shoulders that most teenagers never experience. But, the things she does in this book with this weight on her shoulders are so extreme, and always extreme, that I could barely drum up any sympathy for her. She made bad situations worse and torched any bridge laid down to help her out of her desperate life. She never seemed 13. I get that her situation would have forced her to grow up fast and yada, yada, but she was never 13 in any scene. That leads me to how all of the other characters treated her. Also not believable. From Walk (whose name I detested. I actually started this book on audio and had to stop because of this freaking name. Please don't give your characters a verb for a name), to Vincent to Hal to Dolly to annoying Thomas Nobel and even Darke, no one ever reacted realistically to this very messed up girl who gave off nothing but f$%! off vibes. You know what's a realistic reaction to someone who is mean to you, cusses at you, demeans you, scares you, assaults you or embarrasses you? To actually f%$! off! To ignore them because they are hard. But no one did except the perfectly stereotyped mean kids at Duchess's school who resembled every mean kid on every Disney show. If Duchess annoyed me then Walk (it bugs me to even type his name) drove me insane. Why was he so messed up? Why couldn't he move on beyond his 15 year-old self ever? I hated being in his lonely brain. I hated his weird conversations with all of the other weird and completely stuck characters. Every character was limited to being one way because of one thing that was or had happened to them. And what was the bad thing that happened to them? For something that caused so much emotional and psychological damage to so many characters, a description...even a short one, of what actually happened to Star's sister, Sissy, would have been appreciated. Small town or not, nobody's life actually just stops that way. Ugh. Brandon and his mustang. Milton and his bloody meat. Darke and his completely irrational priorities. And, of course, Vincent and Star. The one positive of the book was the somewhat satisfying mystery. I did not figure it out before it was revealed and that is always noteworthy, especially when you realize you could have had you been paying better attention. The clues were there but all of the annoying narration and characterization ruffled me. Of course, just as in infuriating and unbelievable rom-coms, so much trouble could have been avoided had people just told the whole truth from the get go. Every single character kept a game-changer truth from someone else only to reveal it when the harm had already been done. Again...Ugh! Last gripe: Montana. I didn't know part of the book would be set there and I was thrilled when Duchess and Robin went. Because the author included quite a bit of detail about their route in his narration, I had them in Swan Valley in my mind. Then when Walk (%$!#) drove up, a couple of times, the author again detailed the route but had them going a way no one from California would ever go. I know....it's a stupid gripe. But, I'm from Montana and I was already disbelieving this whole book and the made up towns and relative distances irked me. Maybe people from whatever town on the coast of California Whitaker was trying to describe feel the same way.OK. I'm done now.

One sister, Esi, gets sold as a slave after being captured from a rival tribe and is then raped and impregnated by a British soldier while being held captive on the Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. The other sister, Effia, is given away in marriage to a British officer who ends up loving her but also has a white wife in England. One half sister is living in luxury in the castle with her British husband while the other is being held in the dungeons down below. The rest of the novel follows their lineage in alternating chapters. Esi gives birth to a daughter aboard the slave ship and her descendants' stories take place in the United States. Effia's descendants stay in Ghana, although with privilege and complicity in the slave trade. This was a difficult read for me because I didn't read it quickly and frequently couldn't remember lineage or what happened in previous chapters. While the lineage provides continuity, the book reads as short stories, in a way, because enough time has passed in most cases that the setting and secondary characters are all completely different and undeveloped for the reader. Still, it is really impressive literary fiction, filled with symbolism and recurring themes and an unapologetic look at the generational trauma that resulted from the slave trade. I don't use that phrase in any ""woke"" sense either. You can see and feel it on the pages. Lives that fall off track and families that break apart due to cruel laws, segregation, residual anger and complicity. The strands beautifully come together at the end of the book. Descendents who are both living now in the United States (but who have no idea about their ancestors Esi or Effia because both lines have been made impossible to trace back due to violence, wars and changed identities) travel back to Ghana together and face their anguish, disappointment and hopes in the waters at the Gold Coast Castle. I liked this book more than I enjoyed it. I can absolutely see its brilliance while simultaneously acknowledge that it feels a bit unaccessible to me. I choose to read mostly fiction because I thrill at the access to situations and lives I will never experience. I believe that fiction readers can tap more easily into empathy because of that access. But, for some reason, maybe just because of the incredible scope of the novel that covers two continents for over 200 years, I always felt like I was still outside looking in. I could see the rage but couldn't feel the rage. My favorite quote from the book was in Yaw's chapter, a descendent of Effia, living in Ghana during their independence from British colonialism. He said, “We believe the one who has the power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must always ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth? Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there, you begin to get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture.""

I really enjoyed it though so listened to the audio as I traveled through Montana last week. I absolutely love the first part of the book. The development of the characters is so well done so that I'm simultaneously feeling compassion and irritation for each one as their story progresses. As the title implies, this book showcases the nuances of faith through the lives of two Presbyterian ministers and their wives. I felt so incredibly hopeful for each of these characters as they navigated through college and early married life and found partners that both strengthened and challenged them. Mostly set in the late 1950s and 60s, the description of clothing and furnishings and society and gender roles was fascinating. As the story slows down and a particular plot point gets developed, I was just as interested but less enamored. I can see why the author, Cara Wall, decided to zoom in on this particular plot point: a developmentally disabled child. All of the earlier viewpoints of faith had to now adapt to something less philosophical and way more immediate and intimate. But changing from the previous panoramic view to how each character handled a very specific challenge felt less accessible to me. Now, the story felt to me very much about these characters and less about human nature in general. Of course, its very possible to glean broader morals and lessons as the book ends, but I was still just a bit let down, somehow. The prologue and epilogue attempt to foreshadow and summarize the book but the distance from each event in time to the actual setting of the novel felt too far removed. I didn't hate them but I almost wish they hadn't been included. Still, all of those gripes notwithstanding, this is such a lovely, lovely book.

Osla (modeled after a real life woman named Osla Benning), is a wealthy debutante from a broken home who wants to be considered more than be a silly ""deb."" She uses her education and fluency in German to translate decoded message. Mab is desperately trying to leave her poor, working-class London upbringing behind and uses her keen observation skills to learn whatever she needs to land a husband that will raise her social class. And Beth is an awkward, shy and emotionally abused spinster whose extraordinary crossword puzzle skills land her a position as a cryptanalyst. What Quinn does really, really well is developing and presenting all of the nuanced drama in each of these girls' lives. Their romantic interests. Their loneliness. Their ambition. Their unique voices. Their relationships with each other. What Quinn does pretty well is weaving the fictional drama with some actual history. For instance, Osla's main love interest in the book is Prince Phillip, who ends up marrying Queen Elizabeth by the book's end. Yes. THE current Queen Elizabeth. And Phillip really did date a woman during the war named Osla Benning, who worked at Bletchley Park and was a wealthy debutante. But, The Rose Code's Osla is Osla KENDALL...so...fiction! I guess that's how it works but it feels weird. It could have been worse had any of these fictionalized-real-life-characters been involved in anything salacious or scandalous but they aren't so no harm, no foul. Also making an appearance in the novel is Alan Turing (briefly) and Kate Middleton (epilogue). Loads of the other characters were probably either real or based off of real people but those were the names I recognized.

I'm not sure that this is the book. Edward Tulane is a 3 ft toy rabbit with a china-made face and hinged body, long velvet ears and fluffy tail. His owner, Abilene, dresses him with fine clothes and loves him as dearly as any child has loved a toy. Edward is a vain little toy, however, and is frequently offended when treated with anything less than fawning admiration. When teasing boys steal Abilene's fussy toy and play keep away with Edward, the unexpected happens and Edward becomes lost. What happens next is a story about the purpose of existing: is it to love, or be loved? Or is it both? I think the thing that kept me from loving the book is that with each parable that Edward's journey took us readers on, I wanted the thing I learned from it to be different. For example, towards the end of the book, Edward becomes broken and a doll fixer takes Edward from a sad, little boy who can't afford to pay for the repairs and I eagerly anticipated the doll fixer being a Christ-like figure: fixing what others can't fix without money and without price. But....nope. There was a lesson but it wasn't that and so I was disappointed with an ending I was never promised. That's weird, right? Ultimately, this is a good book with a good message about love. There are some pretty depressing side stories like homelessness, neglect and abuse and alcoholism, that may be distressing to younger readers but with explanations and follow-up discussions, I think this would be a good read aloud with young people.

Maybe another look at what it means to be human like I felt Ishiguro did so well in his books Never Let Me Go and Remains of the Day. If that's where he intended this book to go, I didn't get there. I never felt like any great lesson or warning about humanity was made. And the sun...is it God? Is it power? For awhile, I let myself imagine that the setting of the book was sort of like The Truman Show with Jim Carey: completely artificial and the sun wasn't even the sun but a prop that emits light but I think it was the sun. And for a robot to not scientifically understand what the sun can and can't do, where it does and doesn't set was just super unconvincing and eye rolling to me. Why would a robot be so obtuse about something like that? And why could absolutely no human being in this entire story speak in anything except vague generalities and incomplete thoughts? It was being mysterious in a completely annoying way. What was Josie's illness? What happened to Sal? I lost track of how many times the phrase, ""I'm not going to talk about it,"" was uttered by the characters. OK. Why am I reading? I had hope until the very end that all the symbols (like the very weird bull going back into the earth????) and the boxes of angry eyes would all eventually mean something. Perhaps they do but lots was left unexplained or developed. Perhaps I need a cliff notes guide to understanding this book. I can usually work symbolism out on my own.

I loved his biography of Steve Jobs and Jobs's role in creating Apple still think about it years later. So, I anticipated a thoroughly researched and well interpreted narrative about science, ambition, ethics, opportunity and achievement. I was not disappointed.I had never heard of Jennifer Doudna before reading this book. When I got my degree in microbiology 23 years ago (holy cow...I feel old), Doudna was just getting noticed as a brilliant young scientist with her specialized interest and discovery of the structure of RNA. At that time, back in the 90s, science was ALL about the DNA (the human genome project had just been expensively funded and completed) and RNA was definitely considered the scrawnier Robin to DNA's Batman status. With Doudna's research and later expertise at understanding the function of RNA in cells and her later ability to manipulate its function, RNA proved to be its very own superhero. Maybe even the most powerful of them all. The beginning of the book is more biographical as it delves into Doudna's family life and her introduction to science. It quickly and very shallowly explores her personality and relationships but mostly focuses on what labs she worked in and her accomplishments and discoveries. It is VERY science heavy. I enjoyed that aspect because it threw me back into my college classrooms with many, ""Oh yeah...I kind of remember that,"" moments. But, it's also very dense, very technical and not always very page turning. It felt a bit like work. I think I spent 2 weeks reading the first 150 pages. If Isaacson truly understood everything he wrote, then I'm impressed. There is quite of bit of assumption that the reader can follow along with all of the acronyms and remember what they all mean and what they do. Like I said earlier, I got my college degree in microbiology and had entire semester classes devoted to the chemistry and molecular biology of RNA and nucleotides and I was still frequently overwhelmed with the information presented on each page because it is complicated. If science isn't your thing, push through these pages it because it gets better and being taught or helped to understand the science gives the more literary and application of the science more weight. It's like you've earned the right to think seriously about it! The second half of the book is where Isaacson shined. It's a little disappointing in that the biography of Doudna all but ends. I forgive Isaacson this abandonment of her nuanced involvement because The Code Breaker isn't really billed as her biography. I just let myself assume that it was because of the kind of author Isaacson is and his past books but The Code Breaker is more of a philosophical look at what is a new dawn in humanity: gene editing. What is it? What can it do? What should it do? What should it never do? And why, why, why? Who says? So many questions and thoughts. Isaacson manages all of this by introducing a wide cast of characters and scientists who, for now, have been leading the way into this new frontier. They've unlocked the door, so to speak, with their crazy, unbelievable intelligence, perseverance, competitiveness and curiosity and with the door open...who gets to walk in? Should we walk in? Do we alter our genes? Do we have a say in our own evolution? What is a desirable trait and what is a disability? Who pays for it all? Will this even the score in the fairness game or widen inequality even farther between the privileged and the marginalized? Seriously interesting questions to think about and discuss with others who you trust not to infuriate you with their answers. I got to talk about it with my sisters and it was really fun. So, if you have a bookclub that can handle the science...there are few books that provoke better discussions. Throw in the timely conversation about the covid pandemic, coronoviruses (an RNA virus), the rapid development of vaccines using the very science Doudna and RNA scientists have been developing and unraveling for years, boss female science empowerment as well as the merit and role of competitiveness vs. corroboration and I just really liked this book.

She does this by convincing a commercial fishing captain and his crew to allow her passage on their vessel with the promise of helping them find fish while she follows a trio of birds to which she managed to attach tracking devices. Honestly, I wish the author would have focused on this story because I actually thought it was fascinating. Even though my mind was skeptic about the novel's setting (No animals? No forests?), I found the scenes on the ocean, on the boat, in the arctic and antarctic really fascinating. I liked the attention it forced on the devastation that is predicted (or that has happened in the book's case) if mankind doesn't stop raping the earth and its creations. Just as books like 1984 and Brave New World and Handmaid's Tale have us imagining corrupt societies and governments, Migrations is a bleak, futuristic look at an unproductive earth that can no longer support life. What I didn't enjoy was the symbolic parallel story of a mentally ill woman's ""migrations."" Rather than being about a free-spirited woman who loves the sea and can't seem to choose to stay anywhere, even when leaving hurts her loved ones, the author gave us a nearly psychotic woman with a horrifically traumatic past who really shouldn't be living outside of a mental institution because of the harm she inflicts to individuals and property when sleepwalking or in whatever trances she goes into when she thinks about birds. It was all too weird and dramatic for me. My eye rolling at how implausible her life was made me feel like I was eye rolling at her passion for how important birds are and at climate change, which brought on a guilty feeling I did not appreciate. I enjoyed the mystery, even though I predicted the big reveal before the big reveal. I was disappointed and ultimately frustrated by the foreshadowing because I don't feel like it necessarily matched the outcome.

Without a doubt, this book can be labeled a romance but for readers, it is also a really enjoyable look at what the process of writing a book might look like. Two people living in neighboring beach homes, both successful authors, spend the summer on Lake Michigan trying to write their respective books. January Andrews has only ever written romance and Augustus Everett is known for his literary fiction, which is described as depressing and stark. The banter between their two adversaries who also happen to be very attracted to each other and their conceived prejudices about the other's book genre and their merits is quite entertaining. As someone who enjoys romance but finds that fact a little embarrassing to admit to because romance has a reputation for being fluffy and unimportant, I appreciated the defense of romance found in this story. But, I also really, really enjoy literature and literary fiction and could understand why this one author couldn't write a happily ever after. Both are struggling through writer's block due to the grief stemming from losses in their lives and bet each other to write their next book in the other's genre. January must write literary fiction and Augustus is to write a happily ever after. As part of their bet, they spend their weekends helping the other find inspiration for their stories. Fridays are for research and Saturdays are all about the meet cutes and magical moments. It's cute.But, there are also some pretty serious side subjects. Infidelity. Divorce. Abuse. Betrayal. Cancer. None of these depress the book or kick it out of being a literal beach read. It just makes it really relatable and way less fluffy. There are some sexy times in this book so be warned.

While it defiI thought reading The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennet would immerse me in the confusion of racial identity that comes from being biracial. While it definitely did that, The Vanishing Half brings the theme of identity and how identity changes due to the circumstances of our lives and the choices that we make and inserts it into so many more situations. A man who used to be a girl. A child abandoned by his parents. A girl who loves learning but drops out of high school. A man who becomes a drag queen on the weekends. A wife whose husband is murdered. A housewife whose marriage suffers when she gets a job. A woman who leaves her abusive husband. A country girl trying to fit in in the city. An actress who no longer gets called for any jobs. A woman who succumbs to Alzheimers. On top of all of these fascinating characters who lose part of their former identities is the obvious main theme. Two biracial sisters. Identical twins. Both light enough to pass as white. One rebels against the message that lighter is always better and marries a dark man and has a dark daughter. One gets mistaken for white and abandons her past to live a white life. Marries a white man. Has a white daughter. It's so clear when you're splitting up twins. Each sister has a vanishing half. But then, they each have a part of themselves that vanishes due to their choices. It's like doing math fractions. I really enjoyed the writing and the commitment the author displayed in each storyline to developing this intriguing theme. The characters were believable and imperfect. The historical timeline from the late 50s/ early sixties to the late 80s was enjoyable and I felt the authenticity in the descriptions of cars, clothing, hairstyles and prejudice.

But, there was a lot I didn't like about the book which pulls the above average rating down to average. There were so many unanswered plot questions (Archie's teeth...WTH???), I felt that the omniscient narrator created indistinguishable characters and there were too many random, unhelpful and lengthy tangents (2 full pages of everything one character bought at a grocery store!) that irritated me more than they should have because I then compared knowing those things with everything the author chose NOT to include. There are also a few baffling sexual scenes that I wonder if the author included just to make the book even more disturbing. I certainly didn't enjoy them or think they were necessary. My sister told me that they are making a movie out of this book and I wonder if seeing it in that format will make me like the story better. I'm guessing it will but I avoid scary movies at all costs and this story is scary. The title made me think it was going to be a vacation story gone awry and it is that times eleven.

I was surprised, then, when I actively disliked the first half of this book. The punchy sentences and near constant zingers irritated me. Ok. You've made your point. You're funny. And, truthfully, all of those zingers were funny, in that brutal I'm-laughing-at-you-and-not-with-you way, but I felt so barraged with their frequency that it annoyed me as much as when my 9 year-old watches a Disney show with a laugh track. But then I noticed something. The beginning of the book, the part I struggled to connect to and enjoy, was filled with descriptors of character. Older cop. Younger cop. Bank robber. Psychologist. Older married couple. Real estate agent. No names. Everything was cold and perfunctory and I felt very removed from every scene. In the early parts of this book, I resented Backman's writing style because I could not strum up any energy to care about these people and wondered if everyone who loved his writing and books merely loved them for the humor because I felt zero warmth and intimacy with the characters in the story. Then, the description of characters got names. Older cop became Jim and younger cop turned out to be his son and colleague, Jack. Psychologist became Nadia who had a surprising history of her own. The older married couple, who seemed super unlikable and almost caricature-ish in their ridiculous roles as fuddy-duddies, became Roger and Anna-Lena who were struggling with communication after decades of serving different roles in their marriage. And it goes on and on with lots more characters. Ro, Julia, Estelle, London, Zara, Lennart (who might be the weirdest character ever who wears rabbit head and only his underwear for most of the book). These weird, unlikable characters who seem stressed, unhappy and quite unpleasant gained my sympathy and understanding as the story continued to develop, as they had deeper and more revelatory conversations with each other and the whole over-the-top conflict heads towards a satisfying (if not quite believable) resolution. I realized about 70% in that this had to be done intentionally. Backman, with quite a bit of literary genius and technique, mirrored the reader's experience with those of his characters. I began the story feeling detached, annoyed and condescending towards all of these idiots (a noun chosen intentionally as a nod to the author) and ended up liking them a whole lot more because I came to know their intentions and their setbacks, their dreams and their compassion. In short, Backman said it perfectly when he wrote, ""they had all heard one another's stories, and that made it harder to dislike one another."" This is one of life's truths and it's so hard to remember sometimes. We have to know each other to love each other. And since we are supposed to love each other, we need to get to know all of the weird, anxious idiots that surround us. Throw in a Monty-Python-esque bank robbery and hostage situation and a whole lot of people who end up trying to do and be better and you end up with a very satisfying read. I'm glad I stuck with this one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 28, 2021","Mar 31, 2021","Mar 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49127718-anxious-people

Because if it was...everyone would get a biography of their life written by Ron Chernow. This is my third Chernow work and I have to say, I am throughly impressed with not only the breadth of his research but his ability to put it into context in an accessible and readable format. Like a lot of the world, Chernow first came to my attention with the incredible popularity of the musical, ""Hamilton."" Again, like a lot of the world, I didn't know much about Alexander Hamilton. I had wondered why this seemingly non famous founding father got his face printed on money. Knowing the musical was based off of Lin Manual-Miranda's reading of Chernow's biography of Hamilton and loving the musical, I wanted to go to the source for more information. I went from knowing nothing about a person to learning just how important someone's contributions in this world affected my own life. Warts and all. Impressed, I then read his biography of Ulysses S. Grant and couldn't believe how much my opinion of that man changed after reading. My son had done a history day project of the past civil war general and president and had come to the conclusion that he was a failure. A drunk who had only gotten elected based on his military accomplishments. Once again, Chernow's book helped me feel like I learned actual history, not just the wikipedia or cliff notes version of it, and I realized how unfair Grant's legacy is. In Chernow fashion, the warts and all history formed a more complete picture and left me appreciative of Grant's amazing pluck, honor and accomplishments. I started Washington with a completely different vantage point. Unlike a mostly unknown or misunderstood historical figure, I've heard and read lots and lots about George Washington. I've been to Mt. Vernon and its incredible museum twice and knew about the controversies concerning his slaves and that he was a slaveholder and wondered if I would be shocked, impressed or disappointed in any way by Chernow's VERY detailed book (41 hours of audio, people.)Turns out...no. Because in spite of George Washington being a flawed human being, like ALL human beings are, he still did all of the amazing things I grew up learning about. His unique ability to command, inspire and lead in a quiet, confident and decisive way meant he was probably the only person in THAT environment, in THAT moment of history who could have led the American Revolution to victory, unified the American people to somehow ratify a controversial and unprecedented Constitution for a republic, and walk away from power when very few people wanted or encouraged him to do so. What I did come away with after finishing this book is the satisfaction that knowing the details...even the gritty ones, is ok. It's empowering. It's what we need. Before literacy was widely encouraged, histories were often told with art and tapestries. If George Washington's history was a tapestry, there would be a huge, eye-catching stain on it in regards to his slave holding practices. Dark red. Can't be unseen. It is conflicting. Because how can you possibly continue to honor a person who owned human beings? There is no universal answer to that question but, for me, I choose to still be in awe of an amazing tapestry that holds a lot of beauty and detail and importance in spite of the stain. I see the stain and am glad that I've been taught what the stain means and that it's wrong. I recognize that my own personal tapestry, that is still being woven and designed, will very likely have stains on it that generations following will see and feel scorn towards because that is the purpose of time and hindsight. To learn. To become better. To be grateful. You know that question: ""Who, from history, would you invite to dinner?"" Never very comfortable making chit chat with total strangers, I usually abhor this question. But, Chernow makes these historical figures seem like friends and family members. Flawed...even irritating at times, but known. And so, I'd have all three, Hamilton, Grant and Washington, over for dinner.

First, the title is weird. It makes it sound…I don’t know…gothic This book had three solid strikes going against it before I ever even turned a page. First, the title is weird. It makes it sound…I don’t know…gothic or something. Being at a library at midnight sounds super unappealing to me. I like lots of light when I browse! Second, when I read the book jacket blurb, it sounded like way more fantasy than I tend to like in a novel. It had The Invisible Life of Addie Larue tones in its description and I loathed that book. Lastly, I couldn’t even finish Reincarnation Blues by Michael Poore a couple of years ago (and I finished Addie Larue so that tell you something) so I had my doubts about liking a book that’s about learning about the value of life by living lots of different lives.You know the saying, “Keep your expectations low and you won’t be disappointed?” Well…my low expectations let me love this book! Five stars for me are books that I not only liked and think are well written but that I had an emotional reaction to. I honestly got teary AND laughed out loud while reading. This is what Addie Larue should have been. When you get a chance to live lots of lives or to see what could be with your one, powerful life…my sincere hope and belief is that we all would choose to live and, more importantly, that we would choose a good, helpful, loving life. That is what we all long to know how to do so we tend to enjoy the allegories, parables and novels that support that. Charles Dickens understood that when he wrote A Christmas Carol as did the people who made the movie, “It’s a Wonderful Life.” It’s a good story!Matt Haig uses a librarian and an infinite number of books instead of the ghosts or angels to help Nora, a smart and talented but lonely and depressed woman living in Bedford, England see the value in her life. What I really liked about this book was the sharp wit Nora had with the third person narrative. For a book about depression and suicide, it was a pretty funny book at times. Not irreverent. Reincarnation Blues was like that and it was a total turn off. Life is sacred but it’s also so, so, so funny. Nora, as she entered the scene into different lives had to figure out what was happening and who people were and it often resulted in some pretty humorous dialogue and situational comedy. Ultimately, as she tried on different life after life after life, she realized that there’s no choice, no job, no opportunity, no relationship, no education, no experience that guarantees our happiness or misery. Instead, each of those things is more like a piece on a chess board ready to be used to find purpose and joy in our strategic game of life. Recommended read for a satisfying look at life and how the impossible as well as all of the possible happens via living. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 15, 2021","Mar 17, 2021","Mar 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library

His wife left him, his only daughter is grown, living acCal Hooper, an ex-cop from Chicago, moves to a small town in Ireland to get away from it all. His wife left him, his only daughter is grown, living across the country and with her boyfriend and doesn't need him anymore. And he's tired of all the anti-police sentiment happening in America. In Ireland, he buys a run-down, abandoned cottage and spends his days fixing it up and sometimes chatting with his older next-door neighbor. After getting over halfway through this novel, I wondered if anything...I don't know...bad or stressful was ever going to happen. The initial tenseness occurred when Cal started hearing strange noises around his cottage and had the feeling he was being watched but it resolved quickly and easily when he reeled in his stalker, a surly 13 year-old truant named Trey Reddy. Trey comes from a dysfunctional family who live in a shack up the hill and the regular town folks don't respect or care much about. After a couple of weeks of hanging about and helping Cal with fixing up a broken desk, Trey finally asks/begs then bullies Cal to use his cop skills to find out what happened to 19 year-old Brendan Reddy, an older brother who has been missing for about 6 months. Cal's developed a soft spot for the neglected and awkward teen and reluctantly agrees to help. To note, it took almost 6 hours of listening for all of that to happen (I had the audiobook version so my progress is measured in time instead of pages). Hours! The writing was great and I honestly wasn't bored but when I checked my progress and I was halfway through and no crime had been committed, no body discovered and nobody besides Trey at all concerned about Brendan's absence, I felt...peevish. What kind of book is this? I've read most of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series and I wrongly assumed when I selected  The Searcher that I would be getting a similar whodunit-esque book. Nope.While this story eventually peels away layers to a crime, the crime never takes center stage. Instead, French wrote a book about morality. Why does anybody do what they do? That question is explored through the behaviors of many secondary characters but Cal and his ""code"" are the main focus. One thing that kind of bugged me throughout the book was the unexplained reason why Cal was helping Trey at all? He retired from police work. He didn't know this kid. He didn't know Brendan, who was missing. There didn't seem to be a strong enough motive to get involved. Then I remembered the title. Aahh. He's a searcher. And he tries to do the right thing. It's deeper than that but it helped me get past the weak motive. Ultimately, I ended up really liking this book because it was a satisfying character driven story that didn't use a story of morality to lecture me about what I'm supposed to think. The reading is so easy without the writing being simplistic. Here is one of my favorite parts of the book, talking about the difference between etiquette, manners and morals:""Cal finds himself uncomfortable with this conversation. It brings back things that put a bad taste in his mouth. Over the last few years, it's been brought home to him that the boundaries between morals, manner and etiquette, which have always seemed crystal clear to him, may not look the same to everyone else. He hears talk about the immorality of young people nowadays, but it seems to him that Alyssa (his daughter) and Ben (her boyfriend) and their friends spend plenty of their time concentrating on right and wrong. The thing is, that many of their most passionate moral stances, as far as Cal can see, have to do with what words you should and shouldn't use for people based on what problems they have...what race they are or....who they like to sleep with. While Cal agrees that you should call people whatever they prefer to be called, he considers this to be a question of basic manners...not of morals. This outraged Ben enough that he stormed out of Cal and Donna's (his ex-wife) house in the middle of Thanksgiving dessert, with Alyssa in tears running after him and it took him an hour to cool down enough to come back in. In Cal’s view, morals involve something more than terminology. Ben damn near lost his mind over the importance of using the proper terms for people in wheelchairs and he clearly felt pretty proud of himself for doing that, but he didn't mention ever doing anything useful for one single person in one single wheelchair and Cal would bet a year's pension that the little twerp would have brought it up if he had. And on top of that, the right terms change every few years, so that someone who thinks like Ben has to be always listening for other people to tell him what’s moral or immoral now. It seems to Cal that this isn’t how a man or a woman goes about having a sense of right and wrong. He tried putting it down to him getting middle aged and grumpy about young people these days but then the department went the same way. They brought in a mandatory sensitive training session, which was fine by Cal, given the way some of the guys treated, for example, witnesses from bad hoods and rape victims, except the session turned out to be all about what words they were and weren't allowed to use. Nothing about what they were doing underneath all the words how they can do it better. Everyone was always talking about talking and the most moral person was the one who yelled at the most other people for doing the talking all wrong. “Morals” is the stuff that does’t change. The stuff you do no matter what other people do.""Which leaves the question: What are your morals?...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 02, 2021","Mar 10, 2021","Mar 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52661162-the-searcher

When I It's kind of bizarre that this is about the same bit of history Jojo Moyes wrote about in The Giver of Stars that came out at the end of 2019. When I read the ""about this book"" section on the library website to see if it's something I wanted to check out, I kept thinking I had already read it but knew that I hadn't because I had never seen the cover and didn't recognize the author's name at all. But I didn't remember Moyes book either (because I never ed it and I struggle to remember books I read but don't , which is most of them from the past 4 years. Sigh. That's why I've set goals to  in 2021). Once I finished the book, I set out to discover why it all felt so familiar and discovered Moyes book again, which I read last year. These two books are different enough to be completely different stories but both center their protagonist around the real life Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky which were a group of women hired as part of Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration program during the Great Depression. Any book reader has to enjoy a story about the importance of reading and libraries and education but make the librarian a woman who rides a horse or a mule to take books to people who need them the most in isolated and ignorant parts of Kentucky and I'll trip over myself trying to read that book. No wonder I did. Twice! Unfortunately, both times, it seems, I was left underwhelmed and wishing for something more. What this book has that Moyes book did not is another fascinating bit of history woven in. I had zero idea that there were blue colored people living in the hills of Kentucky. Blue. People. What the what? It's a blood disorder called Methemoglobinemia that is very rare but started showing up in the Fugate family in the early 1800s and seems to have all but disappeared by the 1970s. Basically, these white people have unoxygenated blood, which makes their blood appear chocolate brown which looks blue under the skin. Of course, none of that was understood and mankind seems to lash out at anything that can't be understood so the protagonist in this story, Mary Cussy (who is based on a member of the Fugate family), is not treated very well in her small community of Troublesome Creek. She copes and tries to survive by joining on with the Packhorse Librarians and faces all of the racism, sexism, and just plain mean-ism as she works. This blanket description of prejudice is what ultimately lost points with me. I don't doubt that the prejudice was real and that it happened. But, the characters in this book are not very well fleshed out. There are the good guys and there are the bad guys. The good guys do good things and have pure hearts and the bad guys are horrible. It makes for a tidy story but I don't learn anything when characters are written this way. Why is Mary Cussy so pure, even though she's been treated cruelly by almost everyone? Why is Vester Frazier an absolute sociopath that everyone seems to tolerate? I don't know...they just are because they were written that way because we had to learn that we shouldn't treat people differently because of the color of their skin. It was all very after school special appropriate. This would be a good book for a young adult reader to use to learn about racism in a different way. It also promotes the wonder of the written word and reading and the importance of being exposed to new ideas and information. There is description of marital rape in the book but it's all done with very vague and backwoods terminology so it's subtle and not triggering. At least it seem like it wouldn't be to me. I think the application of real history and these fascinating blue people is something worthwhile to discuss and there's even a little romance thrown in there to sweeten the deal. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 25, 2021",Mar 2021,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40914165-the-book-woman-of-troublesome-creek

The narration was very accessible and aptly descriptive of whatever setting and decade Shultz moved the story towards but I was disappointed in the overall arc of the novel. The story begins in 1975 with a prologue of a girl, Sam McGinty, writing the word, ""Lucky"" in the foggy steam she created exhaling on inside of her dad's car window. He's driving her to college and their relationship seems stiff and strange. The foreshadowing of a big, devastating occurrence that happened in 1969 that changed her and her entire family seemed wholly unnecessary and a bit of a letdown by the time the event was described in chronological time towards the latter half of the novel, especially when the novel flew past 1975 and continued on into the 80s and 90s. Why include the prologue then? It was weird pacing. I felt like this was a straightforward description of the kind of life one might live in a working class family in small town America in the 1950-70s. As I mentioned up above, the novel extends past those dates but the development and intimacy of each character's thoughts isn't nearly as detailed towards the end so the events didn't mean as much to me at the end of the book. They felt more like a slide show sometimes shown at the end of a movie before the closing credits...a ""and this is how they turned out"" montage. Moreover, as much as the town of Erietown played a role in shaping the attitudes and ambitions of the characters, I felt like the women (and the men...it's definitely not just about daughters so the title is a little misleading) in this novel were much more impacted by the neglect, abuse, abandonment, adultery, sexism, racism, misplaced pride and catastrophically bad communication skills in their own families than by the fact that they were blue-collar, working class citizens living in industrial Ohio.

But, my brain is on fire after reading it and I appreciate an author that leads me to this kind of reflection. VanessThis isn't an easy book to like. But, my brain is on fire after reading it and I appreciate an author that leads me to this kind of reflection. Vanessa Wye is a smart, 14 year-old living in a remote Maine lakeside town when she earns a scholarship to attend a prestigious boarding school. At the beginning of her sophomore year, she is now 15 and friendless after a falling out with her freshman roommate, Jenny. Feeling invisible to the rest of the student body, she is quickly drawn into doing whatever it takes to continue receiving the special attention she starts getting from her literature professor, Jacob Strane, who is in his mid 40s. Naive, lonely and melancholy, Vanessa is convinced she is in love with Strane and begins what she believes is a consensual sexual affair with him. The book begins with Vanessa in 2017, now in her early thirties, obsessively checking a Facebook post from a girl named Taylor who has come forward and accused Strane of sexual abuse when she was a student at the same boarding school. In the midst of the #metoo movement, Taylor's post goes viral and the reader follows Vanessa reaching out to comfort her old teacher, Strane, and not Taylor in the aftermath. Right at the beginning of the novel, the author exposes the hooks Vanessa and Strane seem to have in each other in all of its gross, yucky, dysfunctional need. The rest of the book alternates chapters between a younger Vanessa and the 2017 Vanessa, who seems to finally be willing to allow an alternative to the story she's had running through her head for 16 years. What makes this novel compelling is the unreliable narration that Vanessa always provides in first person, present tense whatever age she happens to be in the story. I felt her awkwardness and her confusion and her depression and her justification and her darkness. I felt her need for her story with Strane to be a love story and not a story of abuse and pedophilia. I felt her reluctance to alter her reality even when presented with evidence from friends, family members and even her therapist. Vanessa, as an unwilling and reluctant victim, perfectly portrayed the psychology of abuse and how difficult it is to universally identify abuse. What I think would be fascinating to discuss is going beyond this clear demonstration of abuse (while I could feel Vanessa's confusion, a relationship between a 15 year old and 42 year old, a student and a teacher is unquestionably abusive) and applying this murky situation to other situations the #metoo movement exposed as hotbeds of harassment and abuse. What is consent, really? What line needs to be crossed to count as abuse? Are memories always reliable? We chant and hashtag, ""Believe Women"" but Vanessa showed that not all victims are able or willing to tell the truth. Taylor's character and side story showed that not all victims are rewarded with perfect justice, even when they are courageous and strong enough to share their stories with the public. Perception is the reality for all who are involved. Considering the headlines that continue to fill our newsfeeds, the conversation of consent and abuse needs to be a part of everybody's sexual education. While this book in no way glorifies pedophilia, I do think it could be confusing and possibly dangerous for younger readers to consume. I love that the story was told in Vanessa's voice but her inability to see her relationship with Strane with a healthy and safe perspective is troubling and alarming. Other than being a teenager and living in a place that didn't seem concerned with protecting its students, the reasons Strane groomed Vanessa and Vanessa's lack of awareness and quick attachment to her abuser are unclear. She has working class parents who may not be the most attentive but are never abusive. She is smart. She is talented. She is a cautionary tale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 11, 2021","Feb 14, 2021","Feb 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44890081-my-dark-vanessa

Victor is a medical student whose studies are interrupted by the war but serves as a medic/doctor throughout the war on the side of the republicans. Roser is a student of music and lives with Victor's parents who are ardent supporters of the republic as is Victor's brother, who she falls in love with and becomes pregnant. When Victor's brother is killed in battle, Victor is determined to care for Roser and her son, Marcel. While they are refugees in France, a country at the cusp of entering into World War II, they choose to marry as friends in order to travel as a family aboard the SS Winnipeg, a ship carrying 2200 Spanish refugees to Chile. This first part of the book is by far the best part. Richly detailed and evocative, I felt the frustration, chaos and eventual futility of the Republican spaniards when Franco overthrew their government and came into power. The rest of the story mostly takes place in Chile, a country the poet Pablo Neruda describes as ""a long petal of the sea and wine and snow."" Because of the title, I was expecting Chile to feature more prominently in the story line. Allende definitely includes a lot, beginning with the election of Chilean president Pedro Aguirre Cerda, a leftist and leader of the Radical Party, and his welcome reception and help to the Spanish refugees. But, then Allende leaves Chile out of the story for decades as we watch Victor and Roser adapt to their new surroundings with new jobs, friends and romantic relationships. And by watch, I mean just that. I felt like I was floating above the story, being told that Victor was shy and awkward and Roser hard working and unsentimental but not feeling any of it. Allende introduces the del Solar family, I think, to contrast the different political and economic views within Chile but the two families mix in an unbelievable way. I felt like Allende followed this storyline in order to make commentary about the wrongs of the Catholic Church and the heartlessness of capitalists but, again, I only floated above the story and was told all this rather than feeling it for myself. Ultimately, I rooted for Victor and Roser, because they were really easy characters to root for, but I don't feel like I knew either of them very well. The pacing of the book didn't allow it. Some sections of the book developed a day in detail and then...whoosh...a decade had passed. Chile finally came alive again in 1970 with the election of Salvador Allende, who happened to be the author's real life uncle, and the narrative of the military coup that ushered in the Pinochet dictatorship. Even though the book jacket told me this book was about Victor and Roser, and their journey of love and friendship, I felt that this book was really about socialism and all the ways the world won't allow for its success. From the opposition from the Catholic Church, capitalist nations, monarchies and militaries and the movement's own extremists, I sensed Allende's frustration each time a legitimate government was pulled down by undemocratic means. I sympathized with her viewpoint but also never felt like the case was made for socialism. If anything, everything I fear about socialism always seemed to be true. Inflation, poor management, corruption and lack of productivity. I guess I got the sense that I was supposed to be converted to the cause and I definitely wasn't. However, I learned so much about the history and political shifts in Spain and Chile and even Venezula and I love when fiction gives me more than entertainment and escapism. I love to learn and feel and experience different cultures, time periods, socioeconomic levels, religions, races, beliefs...any point of view that takes me out of my own.

If it had been about any other subject matter than Jesus Christ, I probably would have liked it more and rated it 4 stars. The weaving of fiction with history was done quite well and I liked recognizing well known stories from the Bible with believable backstory and personality. I also liked Sue Monk Kidd's deliberate feminist angle about women and their unrecognized ambitions and abilities and how a society, the ancient Jewish and Roman society in this case, perceives and treats women who do not fit into their accepted traditional roles. I've often wished for more history from a woman's perspective and what lessons we would have had they been written down and preserved. Kidd gives us an idea about what some of those stories may have been through her protagonist, Ana, who she writes as the fictional wife of Jesus Christ. While Kidd never degrades or demeans Jesus Christ as one of her characters, she admits to focusing solely on his humanity and none of his divinity. I can understand her motivation to write him that way but by doing so, she actually reduces Christ to a weak character. He is not well developed. His motivations are murky and actions, specifically in his role as Messiah, often unintentional. Because he is not the main character, this all happens in the background of Ana's story and I could forgive it if the character were anybody other than Jesus Christ. But, it is Jesus Christ and I have strong opinions and beliefs about him that I can't lay aside for the sake of her story. Still, it's such an interesting premise and lots of things worked well. I happen to believe Jesus WAS probably married and his wife's story silenced in the aftermath and establishment of Christianity. So, I enjoyed most of Ana's story. I did get pretty bored when she left the Galilee for Alexandria for a couple of years and lots and lots and lots of details were written about Alexandrian society and the library and papyri. Kidd explained in the author's note that all of those historical details were true and...I could tell. It read like a documentary instead of a story and didn't blend very well with the rest of the book. Fiction is fiction and I love it and learn so much from it so I get that none of this has to be true but it can still be true. That's fiction, right? But, my deep and unwavering belief in the divinity AND humanity of Jesus Christ can't shrug off a book that lessens him. Ana lessened him. Not as his wife but as someone who never recognized who she was married to.

We do not work together, we have no real sense of a greater good - I've come to realize this now."" - MustafaIn pre war-torn Syria, cousins Mustafa and Nuri work as beekeepers in the city of Aleppo. As death and danger close in on the characters due to a civil war that author Christy Lefteri never explains to her readers, they must choose when and how to flee their homes. I found this literary technique both frustrating and fascinating. It's effective as a reader to feel the confusion about not understanding why the chaos is happening. Why are bombs dropping and destroying homes? Why are people being shot execution style on the side of a river? Why are people's livelihoods being looted and burned? If Lefteri's aim in omitting any explanation was to get her readers to research the Syrian War conflict, she succeeded because I spent about 2 hours last night googling all about it when I finished the book. I just couldn't be that sad and not know why Nuri and Afra and Mustafa and Sami and so many others were forced to embark on the dangerous journey of a refugee. I still don't really understand. It's very, very tangled and this will be the 10th year of conflict with some estimating half of the Syrian population displaced over this time. Half of a country. Wow. Without a doubt, this is a sad book. This is not historical fiction. It is contemporary fiction. This is what is happening in Syria right now and in many other parts of the world where governments do not work together and have no real sense of a greater good. As I started reading this book soon after our own national shock of mobs raiding the capitol building, I couldn't help but think, ""Is this what's coming to the U.S.? Will civil unrest turn to war because those in power refuse to compromise? To work together? To care about a greater good more than personal pride?"" What is even sadder to me is that, unlike one of my favorite quotes by Fred Rogers, about ""looking for the helpers"" when scary things are going on, the helpers seem few and far between in the world. At least in this story. There are a few workers at camps and such in Turkey and Greece and Britain that seem to genuinely want to help these poor, miserable, unlucky humans who just want to feel safe but most of the helpers seem tired, suspicious, corrupt or bureaucratic. You can't even fault them, even though you want to because you know that Nuri is good and Afra is grieving and all Mustafa wants to do is keep bees. But they have to wonder...are they dangerous? Are their stories true? So the help is slow or given grudgingly or, worse, with horrible strings attached. There is a lyrical quality to Lefteri's writing that I quite enjoyed. She uses a dangling word to connect past to present, dream to memory and it had a powerful anticipatory effect for me. I looked forward to it each time it happened. I also really liked the emphasis on the psychological trauma of the refugee. Getting somewhere safe is so fraught with danger that you can document and account for the obvious physical threats. Bribery. Robbery. Rape. Kidnapping. Assault. Murder. But what does that do to the soul? Survival is the basic, pressing, constant need for way too long and the brain does what it must to cope after experiencing and witnessing these horrors. We see how each character copes emotionally and the toll their mechanisms take on their relationships. One thing I didn't particularly like is there is quite a bit of narration dedicated to secondary characters and their journeys that don't progress the story in the best way, in my opinion. After reading the author's notes at the end, I can understand why she included them. Lefteri worked as a volunteer at a refugee camp in Athens, Greece and was, herself, the daughter of refugees. I'm sure she has notebooks full of stories she wanted to include because of what she saw but at times, I felt like I was just getting these stories as a bit of a tangent and they didn't necessarily belong in Nuri, Afra and Mustafa's story. Not that they didn't belong at all. Refugees will meet other refugees and those relationships and interactions are part of the story but sometimes, particularly with Diomande, it seemed tangental. Just my opinion. We chose this book as our sister's bookclub pick this month and I'm looking forward to discussing it with my sisters.

Both reminded me (when it was easily forgettable due to the real time emotions and descriptive detail in the main portion of the book) that the story was being told with hindsight by a man old enough to be a great grand-father. When I was given that reminder, the story seemed less likely to be really true and more, ""when I was young we had to walk uphill to school both ways!"" kind of true. I'm not sure why they were included. I also think the story's ties to the land and river could have been stronger. With the title being what it is, this was way more a story about Odie, Albert, Mose and Emmy and their relationships with each other than any of their relationship and experiences with the land. Having never traveled to Minnesota or any of the other places the characters went, I never got a sense of the land. Was it humid? Was the soil soft? Did the wind blow all the time? Actually, I liked the emphasis on the relationships more than I would have liked more description of the land so maybe it just needs a different title. As for the story itself, it was a very good coming-of-age/Disney/Grimms fairy tale type saga. There were orphans and cruel adults and tons of adventure and danger. Set during the Great Depression, it was also heartbreaking and eye-opening about how, less than a century ago, there weren't many safety nets for the poor and downtrodden. Perhaps due to its focus on these downtrodden, the story contains lots of characters from the outskirts of society: a mute Sioux boy whose tongue had been cut out, bootleggers, a German with a finger cut off, a one-eyed rancher whose wife and daughter left him, jews, lesbians, prostitutes, alcoholics, a snake charmer and other misfits and marginalized. The weirdest characters are the one that can see your past and what you want most by simply holding your hand and the one that can change the outcome of the future during one of her seizures. There is also a truly horrible villain that stops at nothing to ruin the lives of everyone and she appropriately wears only black. It's a colorful cast and crew.The main protagonist is a 12 year-old boy named Odie O'Banion, who travels alongside his 16 year-old brother, Albert, as well as their friend Mose and a young six year-old girl named Emmy. They are all orphans and escape from the Lincoln Indian Training School and the evil clutch of the school's superintendent, Mrs. Brickman (the Black Witch). After their escape by canoe on the nearby Gilead river, the majority of the story takes place in a hodgepodge of stops on their journey along the Gilead, Minnesota and Mississippi rivers to St. Louis. Each stop introduces new characters, new problems and an opportunity to include social commentary of the times. Many people compare the story to the likes of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn or even Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath and I can see the similarities, because there is a river and it is the Great Depression, but I didn't every feel like the moral of the story got close to the depths of those classics. The writing was good and very readable but I'm not sure what the point was. Perhaps that life is unfair or that money corrupts or that native Americans were treated horribly or that survival makes people do desperate things or that God doesn't exist or that he's a tornado or a river or an energy that can heal. My take away is that there once was a boy whose parents and guardians own poor choices provided a difficult childhood for him. And through that difficult childhood, he learned some survival skills that also led to some poor choices that provided difficult circumstances for others. But, ultimately, good can overpower evil and humans can choose to help others because love and light exist in even the darkest of circumstances. It's a good take away, I think.

My parents, who I consider to be very intelligent, watched it and Wheel of Fortune most nights. Once we all moved out and left them as empty nesters, I think it was one of the few scheduled parts of their day. 6:00-7:00 pm. Even with the DVR! I have always loved that a good, wholesome, smart game was enjoyable for them and that it never changed so much in television's frenzied need to always be current and drawing in new demographics to leave them behind. I'm the kind of Jeopardy fan that only watches it when somebody else has it on but I've always liked Alex Trebek's hosting style. On television, he always seems smart and sincere...likable without making the show all about him. Sometimes, he came off a little bit snobby and I always smiled when he made sure to pronounce everything as it should be, with foreign words said in the style and accent of a native speaker because him doing so reminded me of my high school government teacher who did the same thing. Immature teenagers think it's hilarious when they hear their teacher say ""Ha-vi-ee"" for ""Hawaii"" and ""koo-bah"" for Cuba and I can't even phonetically go there with Niccolo Machiavelli but suffice it to say it was very dramatic and spit producing. Thankfully, I'm way more mature now and when Alex Trebek pronounces things correctly during Jeopardy, it makes me smile, particularly when the clues are in French! Je l'aime!With all of that good-feeling prefacing done, I wish I had liked this book more. I definitely didn't dislike it. There is nothing to dislike. Trebek is exactly who his TV personna claimed to be over the past 36 years. Likable. Smart. Kind. Humble. I guess what I wished for in his memoir, especially one he only decided to do after being given a terminal pancreatic cancer diagnosis, was more of the why. More philosophy. More connecting of life dots. He does it occasionally but never in a way that the story preceding it doesn't obviously go. There was never, ever any ""huh"" or ""aah"" moments for me. The book is formatted with each chapter titled, ""The Answer is...."" and something. Then he would write about that. Some were short. Some are longer. It's pretty chronological but more interesting antidotes than anything developmental. There isn't much of a beginning, middle and end so very little arc to follow and get invested in. It was very, very simple writing and pretty simple reflections. He admits to that in the book's preface. He is a simple man who never felt like he was interesting enough to write a memoir. He loves his wife. His kids. His job. Working hard. He never had to overcome any great debacle in his life or addiction and never seemed to suffer any major life blows or crushing heartache, at least that he's willing to share with the public. Even his cancer diagnosis is written about with great acceptance and grace. I listened to the audio of this book and probably 80% of it is narrated by Ken Jennings. I love that they are friends and respect Jennings as a part of Trebek's life and his Jeopardy career but his voice isn't Alex Trebek's and since this is all in first person narrative, I liked the parts Trebek narrated more. He was in radio and television for a reason. His voice is awesome and easy to listen to. I wish he could have done more of it. I'm sure there are reasons why he didn't narrate more and I respect them but I might have enjoyed reading the book more instead of listening to it as Jenning's voice and my enjoyment of it, swayed my response. If Alex Trebek and his years hosting Jeopardy are something you enjoy, you will like this book if you read it. The colorful language surprised me but it's mostly in the beginning of the book and he explains why he cusses. It did make me wonder if my dad would like it but, in the end, it's not a big deal. On the other hand, if you are ambivalent about Alex Trebek and Jeopardy, there really isn't any reason TO read this book. There just aren't many amazing insights and the kind of introspection that might compel a reader or a thinking and not just a fan of the show to read and recommend this book. It's a nice book about a very nice man who seems to have had a very nice life. Rest In Peace, Alex Trebek. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 08, 2021","Jan 12, 2021","Jan 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52854193-the-answer-is

Normally, I really enjoy character driven books whose flaws and growth are the engine of the plot. All Adults Here was just that kind of book and I really didn't enjoy it. The book's description make it seem like this is a book about parenting adult children and realizing the mistakes you've made in hindsight. Without a doubt, the book tells you repeatedly that is what it is about in each chapter as the various narrators, mainly Astrid, the matriarch and her grown children, Elliot, Porter and Nicky all recollect various memories and express current bad behavior that seems to stem from their past experiences. However, I found a, perhaps more subtle, but more determined storyline that clouded over all of that adult-parenting-is-hard-but-I-can-still-change-and-have-new-relationships-with-my-children-feel-good-schtick.. Straub uses several of her characters to highlight the risks and fears of living a non heteronormative lifestyle, which I could appreciate more if she didn't simultaneously use every ancillary character to progress what I consider a dangerous, anti-male rhetoric. The two male narrators who have voices (Astrid's sons) are both weak, selfish and bad partners and parents and the other male characters are even worse. They range from infantile to criminally predatory. There is actually one more male narrator but his voice falls into the non-heteronormative category but I won't spoil it here to say how but it doesn't soften the male character voice or add any balance at all. As a mother of 4 boys, I worry about the current shift in who is to blame for all the ills in society. For generations, it has been erroneously dumped on minority races and the marginalized. Rather than learning from history's mistakes and making progress about the use and abuse of power and the unfairness of those actions and rhetoric, it seems that many just want to change the name of the bad guy to ""man"" or, more specifically, ""white man."" It's their turn to sit in the back of the bus, if you will. But, that's not progress, in my opinion. That's linear movement. Someone is still being forced to sit in the back of the bus based not on their own personal behavior but on what they look like on the outside. It's subtle in this book but it's definitely present. I don't even know if Straub did it intentionally but when I finished the book last night, that was definitely what my brain took away. Emma Straub is a good writer. The writing is the redeeming star for me. While All Adults Here was never riveting reading for me and I could always easily put it down, every few pages, there is an excellently written line with just the right amount of wit. I have no doubt she could (and maybe already has) write a book that I do really enjoy but there was too much manipulation, bad behavior and unhelpful stereotypes for this to be that book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 05, 2021","Jan 08, 2021","Jan 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51907346-all-adults-here

Whitehead responded, ""I write."" That stuck with me. One man, albeit a very intelligent and articulate man, has been given the opportunity to influence the views of millions throughout the world because he used his experience, values, education, talent and perspective to craft a lesson about slavery and how to escape from its horrific, historical chains. It was his response that motivated me to not only pick up his words and read but then to also pick up my pen (in the form of a laptop keyboard) and write. Because I think that's how I handle my confusion, anger, worry and rage too. In the second chapter titled, ""Georgia,"" Whitehead first embeds some...fantasy? magical realism? really straightforward metaphor? by having Cora and Caesar, two fugitive slaves on the run from the Randall Plantation in Georgia, get on a boxcar train that is actually underground. I was so confused. By no means an expert about the Underground Railroad, I still felt that I had at least a decent, adult understanding about what it was, who helped run it and who used it in American history. But then Cora and Caesar were being led down steep stairs underneath a barn and feeling the cool mist of a tunnel and getting on a train that stayed underground until they got to another state. No kidding, I googled, ""Was the underground railroad actually underground?"" because I wondered if my admitted white privilege was so profound that I didn't know there were actual underground railroads. My google searched led to Whitehead's own explanation of his literary technique: he mixed fact with fantasy to create a sort of Gulliver's Travels/Alice in Wonderland experience to share the experience of the fugitive slave as well as those involved in helping and hunting them. Historically, no, there were no actual underground railroads There were no actual railroads either. Rather, individuals with courage, wits, perseverance, trust, help, the art of deception, kindness and, truthfully, luck made up the stations, agents, conductors, locomotives, rails and tunnels that moved human beings from the bowels of bondage in the south to fugitives with fragile freedom in the north. I've wondered if Whitehead's choice of storytelling had a purpose beyond technique or whimsy. He included a conversation between Caesar, Cora and Lumbly, a station agent in Georgia, about the building of the railroad, which is interesting since it didn't exist. Why take up pages, perhaps taking attention away from the real to describe the fantasy? When Caesar and Cora see the tunnel, Caesar asks, ""How far does the tunnel extend? Lumbly shrugged. ""Far enough for you."" ""It must have taken years."" ""More than you know. Solving the problem of ventilation, that took a bit of time.""""Who built it?""""Who builds anything in this country?"" Caesar said, ""But how?""""With their hands, how else?""Because I was still caught up in the confusion of what I thought I knew and what the author was describing, my mind went there. Picturing miles and miles of underground tunneling that couldn't possibly have been created without the aid of blasting powder, tools and equipment. It would have been...impossible. However, Whitehead lets it be possible in his story. Not easy. Not trifling. And not magical. Instead he describes the sacrifice, time and individual effort it required. I think that imagery helped me better understand the incredible difficulty of escape. Because escape...true, real, meaningful escape, from whatever binds us, will also take a lot of sacrifice, time and all of our combined individual effort. Another interesting conversation happened between Lumbly and Cora during the time she is getting on the underground railroad for the first time. Lumbly, apparently joking as they were underground, tells Cora, ""Look outside as you speed through and you'll find the true face of America."" If taken literally or even as a joke, we readers would simply think, ""Well...she'll see nothing. Nothing but darkness."" But, at the end of the book, when Cora is on her last leg of the underground railroad, she remembers Lumbly's advice as she ""ran her hand along the wall of the tunnel, the ridges and pockets. Her fingers danced over valleys, rivers, the peaks of mountains, the contours of a new nation hidden beneath the old.""Once again, I believe Whitehead is using the imagery of an actual tunnel for an actual railroad used for escape by those in bondage to show us that the old can disappear beneath the new. We can escape the darkness of the past and come into the light of the new. Light and beauty can be the face of America. As the story develops, Whitehead takes us through stops in South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Indiana all experienced through Cora's viewpoint. Each stop is filled with glimmers of hope and gut-wrenching despair. Interspersed between stops is the perspective of six secondary characters. Cora's grandmother. A slave hunter. A doctor. A reluctant white abetter. Caesar. And Cora's mother, Mabel, who escaped Randall Plantation herself when Cora was only 10, leaving her alone there to fend for herself. The different voices were interesting because their points of view were so very different from Cora's own, which was mostly harsh, cold and aloof. Truthfully, this technique not my favorite form of narration, because I find it jarring to switch from story to story, but it fleshed out a wide variety of attitudes, rationale and the flawed thinking of the time period. When I try to understand or imagine how there ever could have been so many who believed that people with a different skin color weren't actually people, these various voices don't ever justify but they do explain how ambition, glut, fear, desire, ability, mob mentality, ignorance, religious fervor and...yes...white privilege can turn a blind eye to outright wrong. In all but Dr. Steven's chapter, which seemed to ""jump the tracks"" so Whitehead could describe the horrors of grave digging in pursuit of medical knowledge, I felt like the side perspectives added a lot of depth to Cora's own story and the underground railroad. My ultimate takeaway from this book is that while the railroad, both the literal literary and the figurative historical, required the hands and hearts of many, true escape from bondage requires Herculean individual effort. At each underground station on Cora's route, there are always others in charge of the particulars of her arrivals and departures. With her very limited experience and knowledge, she is dependent upon others as a condition of her freedom. And yet, at the last stop of her journey on the underground railroad, it is solely Cora's decision, determination and daring that take her from darkness to light, from chains to freedom.""The mouth of the tunnel started as a tiny hole in the dark. Her strides made it a circle and then the mouth of a cave, hidden by brush and vines.  She pushed  aside the brambles and entered the air. In this day, when it has become clear that there is still systemic racism in America, and we seek for real and lasting escape from whatever binds us from lasting change, I hope that we, collectively with many hands, can build whatever structure is necessary to help those who are under valued and mistreated out of the current systems of bondage. Most importantly, I hope that we can take whatever individual strides are necessary to push aside the brush and vines that keep us staring at the old, dark face of America and into the light and air of a new and hopeful present. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 11, 2020","Jun 13, 2020","Jun 14, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29584452-the-underground-railroad

If anyone can help shed some light on why immigration along the Mexican border has become such a polarizing issue, I figured a person working as a border patrol agent would be a good and helpful source. Unfortunately, Cantú's book only reinforced what I already knew: the border is a mess. But, why? Why has building a wall and having the perceived ability to control immigration from Mexico become a reason a president willingly alienates and hurts hundreds of thousands of American citizens? Cantú attempts but fails (in my opinion) to establish the why by tracing the trajectory from when the current border was created after treaties and wars, a time in between when citizens from both the United States and Mexico easily crossed the river or desert to trade, visit or shop at nearby towns and villages to our current situation where its become Big Business to traffic humans illegally across the border. The reason Cantú's book fails to successfully explain this trajectory is because this book frequently shifts between a book about the border and his own personal memoir. It doesn't work. My brain couldn't keep up with the rapid fire shifts from subjects in both parts 1 and 2. I'd be reading a story about his childhood or a dialogue between him and his fellow agents, detailing a scene of capturing and transporting those who have crossed illegally in the desert and then, with only a paragraph change to announce the shift in thought, I'm reading about genetics and the aggression gene or an interview with an assassin from the drug cartels. It's very, very disjointed. However, it is also all interesting information. I only wish Cantú found a way to write so that all of it flowed better. That way, readers can process and assimilate the information into their own values and viewpoints better instead of trying to figure out what the heck is going on. I enjoyed Part 3 the best. In it, Cantú shares the story of his friendship with Jose and what happens when Jose travels back to Mexico to visit his dying mother only to find that he can't reenter the United States because he isn't a citizen. His several attempts to cross illegally become the narrative for the motive and the heartbreaking reality that the current policy of immigration and path to citizenship doesn't work. Jose is a good man, with a good job and sons who are citizens because they were born in the United States. He claims to have crossed illegally 30 years ago to escape the violence and poverty in Mexico but never attempted to become a citizen of the United States legally. I know it's complicated. I know it's hard. But addressing THAT hard seems more humane and effective than spending billions on a wall that will never work. Jose's story explains why. They do it for family and they do it for love. There has got to be a better way. Still, the reality is there is terrorism. There are drug cartels and horrifying violence from which the citizens in the southern United States need and deserve protection. I think it is super naive to think the only people who want to come to America are those wanting opportunities for a better life. So...I don't know what the answer is. Either, apparently, does Cantú. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 09, 2019",Feb 2019,"Jan 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34818440-the-line-becomes-a-river

I think I've forgotten how to write them. I was motivated to pick up this classic after finishing Esi Edugyan's Washington Black and the brief part of the book where the characters spend time in the arctic north. Why do people want to explore and survive in the poles?The early 1900s was still a time of exploration and discovery. The south pole had never knowingly been reached and there was a race, of sorts, to get there first. After the Norwegians won in 1911, Shackleton changed his goal to being the first to cross the entire antarctic continent from sea to sea going through the south pole. The expedition barely got started when the ship he was on, with a team of 27 others, got stuck in an ice drift. The story follows the man vs. nature showdown when their boat is eventually crushed by the ice and the men are left to escape their certain death in three smaller life boats.It really is an incredible journey and tale of survival. My frustration lies in that I couldn't connect to any of the characters and was thus less grateful than I should have been, that they were able to do or ""endure"" the things they did. Yes, the author introduced the characters and spends a bit of time describing most in distinct and charming ways but I couldn't keep most of them straight as only a few were ever quoted or singled out regularly. Instead, it was a story of the group and groups are much harder to attach to. Attached or not, the way these men survived and persevered in truly extreme conditions gets a slow clap from me. I cannot fathom going through anything like what these men went through. Like Unbroken and other books of survival, the quality of some to stave off death is...well...book worthy. This story is book worthy. I'm glad I know it now. It did nothing to entice me to the antarctic but I have a very healthy respect for it and for anyone who has been there and gotten back. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 26, 2018","Jan 09, 2019","Dec 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/139069.Endurance

Endurance was all story. My fault with it was that because it actually happened (I suppose even if it was fiction and just fictionally happened), I needed to care more about the people it happened to. In Nine Perfect Strangers, Moriarty seems to bet it all on caring about ANYTHING that happens because she spends the first two-thirds of the book developing the characters. Nothing happens. They are at a health resort but the chapters bounce back and forth between the nine and who they are and what their background is and it's all very interesting but...something needs to happen before the book is almost over. When the action finally starts, it is interesting but....it's all tell. Something happens and it happens to all of them and....it's weird. Maybe that's my problem with it. It's just too weird. I also thought the ending was a bit too campy. I like her writing though and have enjoyed most of her other books. I enjoyed this one but it's too character development heavy to be great. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 22, 2018","Jan 09, 2019","Dec 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39280445-nine-perfect-strangers

Really, the first part of the book is hard to put down. It’s interesting and intense and well developed. The second half is all over the place with weird long winded descriptions of many unnecessary tangents. But, overall, I have never read this story before: a free-ish scarred slave who is educated and gifted but haunted and insecure. It’s a story of friendship, loyalty, love and freedom.

For analogy's sake, imagine a cell is...say...the country of Portugal. Why Portugal, you ask? No reason, other than it's something you probably know a little bit about, like maybe how you think about a cell, but you haven't really bothered exploring much further. Now, imagine you had the power to zoom out of Portugal, understanding its relation to its neighboring countries in Europe. Zoom out a little further and, wow, now you see where it fits in with the Middle East, Africa, how it borders the Atlantic Ocean and how those colonists might have made their way to Brazil. In short, you see the part Portugal plays in the world. Next, zoom in. Zoom in to see the mountains and valleys, its rivers and inlets, cities and even hospital locations (so easily spotted with their red crosses). It looks like a really interesting country that I'd like to visit. Huh. You're probably thinking, ""That's a lot of information about Portugal for a book about Henrietta Lacks."" You're right. It was totally unnecessary to include such a long-winded and not very interesting analogy, but that's what I thought about when I considered the angle Skloot took when deciding how to tell Henrietta Lacks's story. To begin with, all she had was the name of a cell line she heard while attending a community college biology class: HeLa. Her professor briefly mentions that HeLa stands for (He)nrietta (La)cks and Skloot wonders, ""Who is she?"" Years and years worth of research later, she zooms out to answer that very question.Henrietta Lacks was a poor and uneducated African American woman who happened to have an extremely aggressive form of cervical cancer in her thirties. During a treatment session at the famed Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, her doctor removed a sample of tissue from her cancerous tumor and gave it to a scientist working on establishing the first human immortal cell line, or a cell line that continues to divide indefinitely. This was done without Lack's knowledge and without her consent. She died less than a year later but her cells continue to live today. The story about what happened to her family when they discovered that their mother's cells had become famous twenty years later, as well as what advances in science have come about because of these immortal cells is fascinating.Most of the book's point of view is written while zoomed out and is easily understood. The family's plight and general information about vaccines, gene therapy and other scientific discoveries are all written with human interest details and never get bogged down with boring histories or complicated procedures. Occasionally, Skloot zooms in specifically on the HeLa cell and when she does, the microbiologist in me was fascinated. I worked for two years in a diagnostic virology laboratory and one of my duties was to regularly make more tissue for culture. Without any real thought, I'd take my bottles of culture, go into a sterile room, and perform each necessary step to take living cells and divide them into eight more bottles. Not once did I wonder where these cells had come from. Now, years later, I'm wondering. Were they HeLa cells? This is the part of the book I'm not sure is as easily digestible as the rest, but I find the cell and its parts an absolute wonder. I loved reading about what made Henrietta's cervical cells so virile and how that virility has caused havoc throughout the science community. I loved every single detail about its rapid mitosis and self-generating telomeres. I think Skloot's journalistic style to bring cell biology to the masses is commendable. In the end, I think this book addresses the real Machiavellian issue when it comes to science. Do the ends of scientific discovery justify the means? The world has made innumerable advances to understanding our bodies and every single one of us has somehow benefited, in one way or another, to having HeLa cells available to study. But, as the author points out by referencing the historical Tuskegee Syphilis studies and the atrocities committed by Nazi's to Jews at Nuremberg, human rights should trump science. Whether or not that line was crossed in regards to Henrietta's story and the family she left behind, is what would make this a really great book to discuss with others....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 21, 2011","Apr 14, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/7672904-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks

It just had too much hype to appeal to me for a very long time but when I saw it was available on Scribd as part of my monthly subscription, I decided to finally see what the fuss was about. I've always believed that it's hard, maybe even impossible, to hate people you really know. The human experience tells us time and time again that we humans are more alike than different and when we understand the backstory...the history and experiences and perspectives and values that shape a person...we are capable of great love. Fredrik Backman showcases this phenomenon of humanity through a grumpy old man named Ove (pronounced /u-vuh/) who has decided to end his life but keeps getting sidetracked and interrupted by annoying neighbors needing his help. Backman used a similar narration technique of describing characters with labels and then transitioning into names as they become better known in his more recent novel, Anxious People, which I really enjoyed, and have come to realize that he used it first in A Man Called Ove. I think it's effective narration. Pregnant woman becomes Parvaneh. Overweight man becomes Jimmy. The Young Man With Dark Stuff Around His Eyes become Mirsad. And all of these people who Ove dislikes or who he finds irritating or who he judges based on what he can see from an initial look or an initial encounter lose their labels when they become known to him. Interesting then that the man in the white shirt and the blond weed, both permanent antagonists of Ove, who never get to have redeeming qualities, also never get named. So, how do the labeled get names? How do they become known? By both needing help from Ove and by helping Ove. Ahhh....the great answer to humanity. To help and need each other. We can't and shouldn't do it all alone, as frustrating and disappointing that is to Ove. Sure, he can remodel his own home, back up a trailer without backup cameras and radar, fix a bike and brew his own coffee, unlike all of the other idiots around him, but when he realizes he can't buy an iPad, (because where is the keyboard?), and he can't stop all the men in white shirts from their bureaucratic tyranny and he can't see in color anymore without his beloved Sonja...he finally gets the help he needs and deserves from these same idiots. The dry humor, the hilarious and emotional symbolism of Saabs and Volvos and the onion-like layers that get peeled away from Ove's crusty persona through flashbacks all add up to a memorable and heartwarming story about what it means to be human. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 22, 2021","Jul 31, 2021","Jan 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove

Because when people ask what kind of books I like to read, I tell them, ""Fiction and literature."" I promptly got online and reserved every nominated book from my library and The Royal We was the first to come to my hold shelf. First of all, this is a pretty fluffy piece of fiction and literature. I know this because I have been unable to read anything with even a hint of seriousness or depth for months and I breezed through this. As the famous wedding kiss cover suggests, The Royal We is about a handsome and dutiful prince falling in love with a pretty commoner at college. I know. It sounds like a Disney movie. But, the writing is WAY above disney level and the characters are so much more than a Hillary Duff/Zac Efron (I don't think this Disney romance exists but you know what I mean) ensemble. Although the story line is not likely to be discussed by many English Lit classes anytime soon, it does have merit. It could happen. Ummm...it did happen?So, this is when I need to confess that I am a hypocrite. Once it was clear that this was a fictionalized version of the Prince William/Kate Middleton relationship, I had to pause and reflect about why I was enjoying it so much. Because I kind of condemned another book that did a similar thing. I ed American Wife by Curtis Sittenfield 7 years ago and blasted the author for taking such license with obviously recognizable characters: George and Laura Bush. I'm not particular fans of the Bushes but it seemed unfair at best and libelous at worst to write characters that were clearly recognizable figures, write salacious details about their relationship and lifestyle and then say, ""No foul! It's all fiction!"" I had no such reaction to The Royal We. Maybe the details were less scandalous, or perhaps the ocean that separates us desensitized me from their right to privacy and truth that much more but I thought this was a fun, thoughtful book. It's better than chick-lit because the writing is good and the characters and their choices are more complicated and nuanced but it's still something that could easily and happily be read on a beach. As glamorous and famous as the royal couple are, I sure don't envy them their lives. Even if it's only fiction, Cocks highlighted in her book just how tiresome and confusing it would be to be in a relationship with royalty. She had a picture perfect couple for inspiration and writes about a real couple, and not the oft-told fairytale. It would never get my vote for best fiction but it's an enjoyable book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 24, 2015",Jan 2016,"Nov 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22875451-the-royal-we

I remember reading Suite Francaise years ago and being flabbergasted and impressed that the author was able to write THAT while simultaneously experiencing it. I think it would be incredibly difficult to be reasonable and write with structure instead of pure emotion. It seems that kind of immediate access to fiction is more rare. Perhaps 20-25 years is a good length of time because Girl at War nails what I appreciate about fiction. I grew up looking at maps that included a country called Yugoslavia. During the 1990s, when then news reported horrors of ethnic cleansing and genocide during The Yugoslavian War, or the breakup of Yugoslavia into Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Slovenia, Kosovo, and Sprska, it all seemed too difficult to follow. Why were these people killing each other? Sara Novic doesn't use her novel to explain the whys but her protagonist, Ana, and her quiet suffering led me to search out more. Even after a bit of research, it is incredibly difficult to grasp that so much prejudice, cruelty and hate can exist within such a small border. But, I digress. Girl at War really is about a girl who lived through a war. It might seem insensitive of me to write this, but at the conclusion of this novel, I found myself thinking, ""Ana only experienced a few weeks of terror and confusion at 10 years old and her life was still so messed up."" I won't spoil the plot about those horrible weeks but she was loved by many before and after and it was frighting to think about how much damage fear and violence can inflict upon our psyches. I think about the millions of boys and girls who lives currently are surrounded by war and wonder how they will cope? What are we doing to each other? Considering the current refuge crisis as a result of civil wars in Syria, the seemingly never ending conflicts in the Middle East, the hate between Israel and Palestine, the violence in Mexico, the power grabs in the Ukraine, unstable tribal areas in Africa and so many more that for some reason or another, don't merit a mention in the news, the world is creating a generation of people who are affected. And, of course, none of this horror is new. It's the cyclical story of mankind since the story of mankind has been told. One difference is poignantly noted by Ana, ""As a side effect of modern warfare, we had the peculiar privilege of watching the destruction of our country on television""This simply written, accessible, not-too-long novel, had me thinking about all of this. Girl at War by Sara Novic is incredibly timely and an important work of fiction about war and all of its damage. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 11, 2016","Jan 12, 2016","Nov 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23209971-girl-at-war

I will avoid this book and books like it forever."" Horror books are easy for me to avoid but when I read post apocalyptical books, I frequently wonder why I'm reading it and if I'm not just scaring myself on purpose. There are so many lately and I'm not even sure what led me to this book but it starts so innocently: an actor playing King Lear in Toronto having a heart attack and a former paparazzo now trying to be a paramedic with a bad girlfriend rushes up on stage to try and save him with CPR. It was just the kind of introduction that sucked me in...interesting characters doing something interesting but not out-of-this-world-so and before I knew it, everyone was dying of the flu and the survival meant luck and traveling in bands foraging for food in a dreary new world order with no order at all and in my soul, it was as uncomfortable as a scary clown monster coming up out of a sewer. More so, really, because I happen to think a pandemic (Or nuclear showdown. Or major natural disaster) are a little more likely to be my horrible than an ""It."" Nevertheless, I did read it and now I can't stop thinking about it. Because, as devastating as a pandemic that wipes out 99% of the population could ever possibly be, something comes after. It's not the end of the story. At least, our imaginations always allow this to be the case because there's no point in thinking or writing about the alternative (never mind. I can imagine words stopping mid page and hundreds of blank pages following it unto the back cover ends the theoretical nothingness. It would probably win an award). Although my mind likes to organize this story into the pre-outbreak, outbreak, and post-outbreak periods, the author, Emily St. John Mandel presents her world and characters non-linearly. It's quite artful how she threads all of these stories and characters together. If there is a main character, it has to be the actor Arthur Leander playing King Lear even though we know by the first few pages that he dies from a heart attack and not the flu. His location, his friends, his fame, his colleagues, his failed relationships...even the part he was playing when he died all eventually matter to this story and then when, why and how is what compelled me to keep reading through my nervous discomfort. It also helped that the setting of the book frequently returns to the more comfortable pre-outbreak time. There were times when I thought it would help to be from the midwest or familiar with the Toronto area and a lover of Shakespeare because his plays get significant weight but I enjoyed this book a lot even though I have never lived or traveled in this area, have only read Romeo and Juliet (which isn't mentioned at all) and don't particularly like to think about my world without any of its comforts that we take for granted. It is descriptive without being obnoxious about it, disturbing without being ridiculous and cautiously hopefully without being unrealistic. Mostly, I'd love to discuss this with someone and that's always a sign of a good book. Recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 19, 2015","Feb 22, 2015","Jan 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

I am forever in search of good audiobooks that we can all enjoy listening to in the car together. Noting that this was written by a BYU professor (who is my age. Sigh), I figured it would be ok. I was definitely uncomfortable at times having my 8 year old listening when the narration veered towards the attraction between characters and the violence. The made up cuss words turned into an interesting discussion about what is swearing and how words become vulgar when used in certain ways. My older kids would easily give this 5 stars but I found the plot development very plodding at times. Much time is spent on the characters talking and planning and theorizing and it was tedious for me to listen to at times.

I'm feeling all sorts of ADD with books of late and it's embarrassing the number of books I've checked out from the library and never read, started and returned unfinished, bought and shelved unopened and stacked with a bookmark placed somewhere in the first half of the book upon my nightstand. Of Human Bondage suffered from the Audiobook of 24 hour length, which always seemed too daunting to start unless I had several hours to devote to wearing headphones and the mood to follow the life of a pretty whiny, insecure man. That being said, this really is an excellent book that, I've no doubt, would have received more stars from me had I been able to listen to it in a more timely manner. Maugham, with a distinguished subtly, reveals a man's tendency to both limit his own experiences due to fear and prejudice as well as succumb to tempting and addicting vices, both physically and emotionally. These human flaws that each of us possess, create a restricted life: a situation of human bondage. The protagonist, Phillip Carey, is an orphan born with a clubfoot. Because the book spans Phillip's life until early adulthood, the only real continued arc that I perceived was his intense sensitivity about his foot and noticeable limp. It is his largest chain. Underneath that arc are several other subplots: Phillips's professional struggles, romantic entanglements, financial stress and tendency to be influenced by his friends. Maugham masterfully develops this character into a believable and universal human. Like I said, if it hadn't taken me over a year to finish, I'm sure I would be gushing more because it is so well done. I didn't know much about this book before I started it. I loved Maugham's A Painted Veil and heard this book was better and considered his masterpiece so my expectations were perhaps a tad high. Although well written, the story often fails to get traction due to its long timeline and many tangents about art and literature. Although Philip was a very flawed character, his kindness, even when reluctantly given, redeemed him. Being inside his head was very tiring at times but it was also....well...kind of incredible. Philip Carey and I have little in common on the surface but knowing him as well as I got to know him, it's impossible not to recognize a bit of myself in his struggles and triumphs. Fear, guilt, pride, ambition, lust - they chain us all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 30, 2014","Jan 11, 2016","Dec 30, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31548.Of_Human_Bondage

Sometimes, when a book describes a scary/cruel/racist/ignorant/complacent Nazi/facist/Japanese soldier/offficer/citizen that treats a Jew/woman/artist/communist/child/POW horribly but, somehow, kindness and love rise above it, I cringe and cheer and ache for a better human race but also think, “I’ve read this story before.” I know the dangers of history repeating itself without learning from and remembering the mistakes from the past, and I do believe fiction can help spread a word of warning, so I’m not saying that this story isn’t worth telling. But, personally, I have read quite a bit WWII fiction and have started to avoid books that seem to be a remix of this oft told story (which IS an excellent story. Many of my favorite books have been this story). When I started to see multiple five star ratings of this book on my Goodread feed, I marked it as one I wanted “to read” but worried when I realized it was a WWII novel set in France and Germany. How could this possibly be something I haven't already read? While there are elements of familiar in it, like priceless art from museums being seized and stolen, brutal Russians taking their revenge on the innocent and the horrors of the Nazis conditioning the German youth with propaganda and jaw-dropping abuse, I had never read about the siege of Saint-Malo, France on August 6th, 1944. It is fascinating.Anthony Doerr takes this historically significant event and creates characters that happen to be there on that fateful and devastating day. Sixteen year-old Marie Laure is French and blind but incredibly independent thanks to her loving father who created perfect scale models of their neighborhood that she could touch and memorize in order to navigate around on her own. Eighteen year-old Werner is German and so good with radios that even though he is an orphan and poor, the Nazis place him in an elite school to train him to triangulate the position of anyone using a radio to transmit messages. Although Werner and Marie’s paths do not cross until nearly the end of the book, All The Light We Cannot See is about these two humans who love and lose and wish and want and regret and fear and although they are on opposite sides of the war, they both want to do the right thing....if only they knew for sure what that is. The writing will please any lover of language. The title (so good!) has layers and layers of meaning. The characters are perfectly imperfect, with flaws that don’t seem to be there just for the sake of having them but because they can’t seem to avoid having them. The plot builds fearsomely with some mystery shrouded in what appears to be fantasy and myth but still safely within the more logical borders of greed and luck. There is even a wistful and sad epilogue that sort of feels out of place in both time and feeling but also necessary because it adds meaning to the characters and the decisions they made in impossible circumstances. All The Light We Cannot See is a WWII novel but I have never read this story before. I have never been this fascinated by radios and trigonometry and descriptions of blindness and Saint-Malo and narrow houses with 6 floors and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and legends surrounding priceless diamonds. Truly, this is a five star book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2014","Jun 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see

It is the least descriptive rating available. Did I like it? No. I didn't. I thought the characters were unlikable and bleak. Sure, the setting had them in Italy during the end of World War II, when things were most likely the least hopeful and actions were the most desperate, but the war only partially influences these characters' motives and choices. They are, generally, a selfish, self-absorbed and unsympathetic bunch. I also don't really think the format of mixing a first person anonymous psychopath confessional, family saga set in 1944 and police investigation in 1955 worked well. I kept waiting to care more - about the horrible murders and the hidden motive and the back story of the female detective who was clearly suffering from the memories of her own past. So, why 3 stars? I didn't like it, even though my 3 stars claims that I did, but 2 stars, for me, is a book that is poorly written (I reserve 1 stars for books that I hate) and Bohjalian has talent.

I have become a bit into reading books on my ipad. I held out on having an ereader for so long because I love books...love the way they feel in my hand...love they way they stack on my nightstand. But, I also know this about myself: I am a homebody. Ebooks and the kindle deals make it easy for me to avoid the library, a place I love but a place that requires me driving through traffic to get there and dealing with a toddler who doesn't seem to sympathize with my desire to stand next to a shelf of books, tilt my neck sideways and read the titles of thousands of book bindings. This path of least resistance has led to me reading a number of books I don't think I would have checked out at the library or bought a physical copy of from a bookseller. I Am Livia is the perfect example. The subject matter, a historical fiction rendering of the wife of Cesar Augustus, Livia Drusilla, isn't something I knew anything about or figured I was very interested in. Turns out, I really learned quite a lot about this time period and the major characters involved in the assassination of Julius Ceasar, his heir and his rivals. I've never been to Italy so the closest I've ever come to studying or carrying about the ancient Roman Empire is when I visited Israel last year and saw so many ruins testifying of their ingenuity, ambition and cruelty. This book definitely has a much more sympathetic opinion of the Romans and their building projects, defense of slavery and conquests, although those things were never the focus of the book. This was much more about the possible love story between a powerful leader and a woman whose own history is molded much more by rumors and speculation than known facts. She was, after all, a woman. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. The writing doesn't stand out as amazing, nor does the plot or characters, but it isn't void of compliments. I believe the author did a good job weaving her fiction into an actual history. I don't feel like I've been on a fool's errand and although I certainly can't claim any sort of expertise about the Roman Empire and these major historical figures, I no longer feel as ignorant.

A window closed by someone other thanI just got on to the computer to finish this book  that I started writing three weeks ago and it was gone. A window closed by someone other than me....erasing thoughts that I don’t really want to rethink. I have lost my habit of writing book s but I wanted to jot down my thoughts about this stunning book and be as articulate as I could because this story really affected me. I’m annoyed that I have to try and remember passionate reactions that have dimmed each passing day but hope that by writing this, I will be able to converse about this book in the future - a feat I am only able to do if I take the time to write about it. Here’s my take two!First of all, I think this book qualifies as amazing. That is why I gave it five stars on Goodreads. Not because I loved it and not because I learned something I didn’t know before but because the plot caused me to reflect on my gender, my religion, my politics, my government, my beliefs and my world. Furthermore, I believe my experience with The Handmaid’s Tale was enhanced by listening to the audio version narrated by Claire Danes. I just so happen to also be watching Season 2 of Homeland on Netflix and Claire Danes’ character in that series is brilliant but also suffers from bipolar disorder. Her voice, not a soothing one but filled with panic and confusion, absolutely lent credence to Offred, the handmaid in this tale, and her fear and paranoia about who she could trust in her instinct for survival. In addition to the effectiveness of Danes’ voice was the fact that, essentially, this story was given orally. Most of the book is narrated in first person until the very last chapter, which is an epilogue of sorts. In this final thought, the narration switches to third person where an academic lectures to an audience about his study of a collection of cassette tapes discovered and believed to have been reordered during what was known as “The Gilead Era.” The cassettes were transcribed into “The Handmaid’s Tale” and he added context, history and theories about who might have made them and what might have been her fate. So, I felt like I was actually listening to those recovered audiocassettes. It worked really well. I’ve wanted to read something by Margaret Atwood for years as she is a favorite author of a highly esteemed friend but I didn’t really know anything about her books or style other than I’ve seen The Handmaid’s Tale and Blind Assassin on several modern classic lists. Luck of the draw or fate or what have you led me to this book at just the right time. You see, I’ve been thinking a lot about women lately- our roles, our rights, our responsibilities - and Atwood’s dystopic look at how bad things could become as well as the conditions that existed in the society before it got to that point blew me away. Because more than any other book I’ve read that warns or imagines the way life could be....if....Atwood’s tale of subjugation based on ideology seems so possible. At least, it doesn’t seem so science-fiction-y or futuristic that it’s too difficult to glean the here and now similarities. That doesn’t mean I think women are eventually going to wear red habits or winged hats that limit their vision to straight ahead or even that I think Christian fundamentals are a dangerous threat to America but if Atwood’s Republic of Gilead could be placed in other parts of the globe, then it’s already happening. There are places, particularly those places in the news right now, where a woman’s right to education, personal style, marriage, economic independence and belief is dictated by someone else, usually a man. I just read an article yesterday about Boko Haram’s announcement that the more than 200 school girls his radical group kidnapped in Nigera back in April are now all converted to Islam and married to soldiers. I want to cry. These women are not valued beyond their gender and reproductive capabilities. As a woman who is grateful for my uterus, respectful of its powers and disturbed by so many’s casual disregard of it, still, I know that I am not my uterus. I am me. Influenced by my gender, certainly, but not contained by it.Segregation between the roles of women and men was certainly a major theme in Atwood’s novel but it wasn’t exclusive. Women were further segregated into “Aunts” (trainers and enforcers of other women - a governmental role), “Marys” (cleaners and cooks of households), “Wives” (elite but infertile) “Handmaids” (undecorated women given to a husband and wife for the purpose of conceiving a child) and the even less fortunate who were sent out to an area known as the colonies to clean radioactive waste and die. It was interesting to me that one of the tools to successfully isolate women was to pit them against each other. Don’t we do that a bit now?Another major theme in the book was the time it takes to transition between lifestyles and how this particular generation of handmaids felt sad because they could remember their former lives but that the next generation, conditioned to believe what they were doing was noble and best and not having knowledge of anything different, would have no regrets. I wonder if that is true. Certainly we can be conditioned to believe certain things but history has shown time and time again that there is an innate hunger for personal liberty and emancipation from oppression. Indeed, from the perspective of the epilogue, we see that this extreme society of Gilead did not last. It’s still shocking to me that there are some who would want to try. If I had any disappointment with the book it is that towards the end, the story got a little too caught up in the sexual needs, corruption and dysfunction within the society. But, who is to say that that actually wouldn’t happen when it is so unnaturally regulated? I suppose what I missed was Offred’s earlier voice that was used so effectively to explain the past to present. By the end, I felt like the story was hyper focused on her relationships with Nick and the commander. That disappointment, however, felt minor compared to the big picture ideas presented within Atwood’s storytelling. The slippery slope of governmental control. Personal rights vs. what is best for society. Religious persecution and perversion. What it means to be a woman. What it means to be human. All masterfully and accessibly told by Atwood. My immediate comment upon finishing this book was that I was “gasping with amazement and fear.” A month’s passing has stopped the gasping but I’m still amazed. And I still fear....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 05, 2014","Sep 25, 2014","May 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale

Don Tillman is a brilliant professor of genetics and enjoys his organized and structured lifestyle but would like a wife. Because dates usually go so poorly for him, he devises a way to sift through potential candidates through a detailed questionnaire. His requirements are impossible to fulfill for any one woman (and should there be that one woman, Don's own suitability would probably be in question) and, most likely as a joke or a dare or some other unkind motivation, his one adult friend, Gene, a professor of Psychology at the same university, sends Rosie over to Don's apartment. Rosie, unaware of the wife project, shares with Don her frustration of not knowing who her biological father is. Even though Rosie doesn’t fit his what-i-want-in-a-wife criteria, he likes her and offers his help in identifying her father through his ability to test DNA samples and their complicated friendship develops. Because of Don's inability to follow social norms, this development is filled with comedy. Intellectually, it feels mean to me to find amusement in another person's lack of awareness but Don is so smart and so unaffected by being considered weird that the book comes off as very fun. I doubt whether that is always the reality for those who live, love and work with people with Aspergers. I think the thing that was the hardest thing for me to admit was that there was no way I could ever fall in love with a man like Don. Interestingly, even though we are reminded through Don's character that he has few friends and has never be involved with anyone romantically, the ultimate question becomes can Don love someone in return?

One more negative was that I felt annoyed reading fake letters from a ridiculous woman about her connection to Degas and his fake painting and the fact that none of the modern day characters had access to.

He said it would give me a great feel for what it is like to run the race. After reading, I agree with his assessment but can’t match his excitement because details like leg cramps, stomach pains, bloody toenails and “shredded” quads from running downhill don’t interest me that much and those kinds of details actually make up about 3/4ths of this book. Hal Higdon, a man I’ve never heard of but who assures me several times throughout the book that he is a big deal among runners (gag.

I think it’s a pretty cool idea and reading about the race in short quick blurbs like that made for a much more interesting and complete picture than had he focused on just one person’s account or a generic historical account. He never claimed to be writing a book about the bombings and so I can’t really fault him for leaving out what I deem are important details, but it bothered me that when he mentioned the 3 spectators who died, he didn’t give their names but, instead, only a perfunctuary description of them.

The Impossible Knife of Memory is a YA story whose protagonist, Hayley, is going to high school for the first time after 5 years of being ""homeschooled"" or taught on the road by her trucker dad, an Iraq war vet suffering from PTSD. Like a lot of teens who have to prematurely shoulder adult burdens, Hayley lives in survival mode, enabling her delicate world to continue as is. Frustrations arise when the attention of a cute, likeable and aggressively successful boy, Finn, gives her first taste of what normal teenagehood might feel like. Like a fish out of water, she goes to her first high school football game, eats lunch with other kids her age and half-heartedly agrees to help with the school newspaper. As much as I enjoyed Finn's character (and he was delightful), his interest in Hayley lacked motive. He is so determined to win her over and she is so often unresponsive or dismissive back...I just don't know many teen boys whose egos can take such a beating. Still, their relationship and his support for Hayley is what drives Hayley to push for change in her own dysfunctional life. Her dad is a mess. I don't personally know any veterns who suffer from this disabling disease but the author describes his ups and downs in pretty bleak detail. In addition to helping her dad handle his minefield of memories, Hayley has to deal with her own haunting feelings of abandonment and loss, both from her mother who died when she was young and her dad's ex-girlfriend, who helped raise her but left when the going got tough. Although it deals with the darker side of teen life through secondary characters (drugs, promiscuity, divorce, co-dependency), I think the writing and issues presented make this a worthy choice for mature teens and interested adults....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Mar 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18079527-the-impossible-knife-of-memory

Knowing much of the story is based on fact helped me forgive the book for some of its unlikable loose ends and unproductive tangents. I see now that Sue Monk Kidd was painting a complete picture of these brave women pioneers and not just the parts that moved the story best. For the first few chapters, I really resisted liking this book. I didn’t know what it was about at all when starting and when I realized it would be about slavery, I had the weary thought, “I don’t know if I can read another book about slavery!” Such a juvenile thought because soon thereafter, I was completely drawn into the world of Charlotte, Hetty, Sarah and Angelina. While very definitely a book about slavery and its injustices and history, this is more a book about women. Charlotte and her daughter, Hetty, are slaves and while their bodies belong to a master, their minds are never chained to their situation. Sarah and her younger sister, Angelina, however, are born into wealth and privilege. All they have to do is marry into another respectable family for that life of ease and prestige to continue. Both eventually feel “chained” by their gender, never being allowed to follow the path of their own choosing. I had this thought while immersed in this book: Sarah, from a very early age, seemed to have an automatic and natural hatred towards slavery. I found that interesting. Her entire family enjoyed the benefits of slavery and her other siblings, even those of decent character, accepted slavery as the will of God. No one taught her to think the way she did. In fact, she had to constantly fight against her parents, siblings, clergy and others to protect her own proclivities. Angelina, on the other hand, was essentially raised by her older sister, Sarah, and I felt like her attitudes towards slavery was much more of the “nurture” type: learned. I often compared the two and their abilities to act on their beliefs. I wondered why it was so much easier for Angelina to be rash and daring in her abolitionist views. Was it because she never felt alone in her beliefs but always knew she had support from her sister? Is it simply temperament? I don’t know. Regardless, I think this is impressive historical fiction and I’m ashamed that I didn’t know anything about the Grimkes. I wonder why their courageous stances aren’t more well known? ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 03, 2014","Mar 31, 2014","Mar 03, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18079776-the-invention-of-wings

It is the story of a teenage boy living on the Spokane Indian reservation and realizing that he wants more out of life than what is being offered to him. That means changing high schools and being ostracized by members of his tribe who think his ambition translates into a personal insult. I loved the setting on a reservation and the unique humor and culture it highlights but this is the timeless story that those trying to break out of the box they are expected to stay in write. I think books like these are important for teens to read; they gain empathy for the great struggle fought by some and can learn the recipe of how it can be done should they need courage and insight. I chose to read this because of its consistently high s from other book lovers but, according to my sister, this is required reading for some high school students. Predictably, there are parents that are opposed to it. Are there other, less crude, less proud of masturbation, less full of alcohol alternatives teachers could choose to expose students to worlds beyond their own? Probably. But, this book is full of teenage humor, courage, spunk and has a very accessible protagonist to believe in and root for that I wouldn't be opposed to my own teenage children reading it. More importantly, it is deceptively well written. Filled with funny drawings, I bet a lot of ""non readers"" can enjoy a book with important and thoughtful themes that they might ignore or miss in another cleaner or classic book.

As much as I love going to the library, there are times when it is isn’t convenient and I don’t have anything to read! That happened last week, so I got online and found this and downloaded it because it sounded promising. After the first 100 pages, I admit I sped read and skimmed. I had to get out of this book fast. Because, an interesting thing happened. I have a toddler and it just so happens that Sprout is his favorite channel. For a reason I truly cannot understand, this 2 year-old of mine particularly loves Caillou who I think is the whiniest, most irritating hypothetical 4 year-old that ever existed. Have you seen Caillou? First of all, there are the blurred corners. Like the animators are too lazy to actually finish the drawings. Then, there are the 1990s color scheme. Everything, from the houses to the clothes to the kitchen appliances are blue and red and yellow. I also don’t appreciate how frumpy they make Caillou’s mother. And the dad…oh my word. Does the guy have a real job? Just once, I’d like the show to highlight some real parenting and have either parent say, “I’m too busy to take you to that construction site you find so fascinating” or “I’m just going to tie your shoe for you” because there are teaching moments and then there we-have-to-go-right-now moments and not be at Caillou’s beck and call. Maybe I need to start the grumpy Sprout channel or something. Anyway, I mention Caillou because in addition to all these other annoying things, there is this obnoxious to me narrator who explains to us watchers (I try not to but what can you do when your 2 year-old needs to snuggle? Ack! I am just like Caillou’s parents! (frumpy mother included)) what Caillou is feeling in every situation. Seriously, as if the crease marks around his eyes and bald forehead aren’t enough, we get to hear things like, “Caillou felt frustrated that that cat wouldn’t come to him. He wanted the cat to go on a walk with him,’ in this weird, needs a lozenge voice. This is truly my worst, most snarky side that I try to contain to the realm of sprout cartoons but when I was reading The Map of Lost Memories by Kim Fay, there were sentences…many sentences…that were written in the exact voice of the Caillous narrator. Once the voice was there, every time the author told me how her smart, woman-before-her-time adventurer Irene Blum felt about anything, which was way too often, I visualized everything happening in primary colors with fuzzy edges. Not really but I shouldn’t connect Caillou to a grown-up book. And I did. Which is why I didn’t like this. It’s not terrible but I will forever have a negative association with reading it. Sorry to Kim Fay. If this book doesn’t take off, she might look into getting a job over at Sprout. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 19, 2014","Feb 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12341021-the-map-of-lost-memories

I shouldn’t begrudge her her preference but I do wonder why and wish I could read something she wrote that could develop more plot, because everything else - her characters, settings, point of view, is perfect.

When I saw this at my library and read that its purpose was to inform parents about the new rules and realities of Boy World, like her Queen Bee book did for girls, I checked it out. Then, I missed two nights of sleep due to anxiety. Seriously. I’m sure the many boys she refers to as her “editors” and whose opinions and experiences she used as proof for what boys’ lives are like through middle school and high school are being honest and forthright about what their lives are like. I’m sure Wiseman uses these specific boys and their truths to create her generalities about how they communicate, why they torment, who they accept and what parents need to know with the best possible motives. In a lot of ways, this was every John Hughes film/Friday Nigh Lights/Glee episode I’ve ever seen (which isn’t a lot. Well…I’m pretty sure I’ve watched all the john Hughes films). In a nutshell, boys are told from a very young age that Batman, a mono-emotion superhero, is the ideal and straying from this model affects their standing among friends, girls and even adults. We expect boys to be boys: tough, clever, athletic and cool. In addition to exposing this Boy World, she explains to parents when and how to ask questions, when and how to be concerned about social media/videogames/pornography and what we’re all doing wrong by worrying about the wrong things. Queue sleepless nights. My overall feeling upon finishing this book is that, according to her and her helpful editors, I’m doing everything wrong. I ask too many questions, demand too much and pretty much live a hypocritical life. To summarize some of her points, I put him at a social disadvantage by not allowing violent video games (Rated M) and shows (TV-MA) because those are the things his friends are watching and playing and being able to discuss these things with their peers is vital to them feeling like they have a place in boys world and there has been no proof that exposure to violent media makes kids become violent. Girls are going to sext them so I should provide a smart phone, stop checking it after 9th grade and leave them with the advice that when those girls send them naked pictures of themselves, look at it for a minute and then delete it. I find all of this crazy! But, I checked this book out for a reason. My oldest child, an eighth grader, struggles to talk to me and after reading the “What kind of parent are you?” chapter, I think I fit into the “Dictator” mold which is pretty much the worst type of parent to be. The disparity between what I want for my children and what I’m probably doing for them is harrowing. I don’t know how to be cool or perfect. It sucks. I don’t think that’s the point of the book but….it kind of is. I found her writing style to be annoying close to arrogant (she admitted her own problems with her kids but very frequently uses her own parenting as a model). There was quite a bit of good information and I appreciate her advice but with my religious perspective and my own common sense, there are some parenting suggestions that I think goes beyond bad advice and is harmful. Does that mean my own bias is getting in the way? I don’t know. I tried reading with an open mind and I have stopped asking so many questions when my middle schooler gets in my car after school and I have a plan about how to handle homophobic jabs (boys are particularly prone to using them) and potential bad coaching. But, there is an entire chapter about boys playing Lacrosse. Lacrosse! It took that chapter, towards the end, for me to realize that her information is not universal. Still, her book is very eye opening and I’m not going to be naive about the possibilities and probabilities of what my children are facing and are going to face being active, sports-playing, boys. It’s going to be tough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 04, 2014","Feb 15, 2014","Feb 04, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262151-masterminds-and-wingmen

Part mystery, part horror film in print, part tour of New York City and upstate New York, and part “how to understand” black magic and the occult, I didn’t particularly enjoy the sum of all its parts. I love mysteries and this is a mystery, for sure. Scott McGrath is a disgraced and eager-for-redemption investigative journalist whose reputable career was ruined when he attempted an expose on cult horror film maker Stanlisas Cordova (think Stephen King but worse because Cordova’s films were so debased and horrible that they had been banned and watching them was only possible with bootleg copies or secret underground screenings). When Cordovos’s daughter dies from an apparent suicide, McGrath sees it as an opportunity to finally redeem himself and prove that, somehow, Cordova and his twisted lifestyle were responsible for her death. His discovery of the “whodunit” and, more complicated, the why, are actually quite scary. At least, I felt very nervous and tense at times. When it left the mystery and delved in depth into the horror film references, I wondered why I was still reading. I avoid horror films at all costs because I don’t enjoy scaring myself. I don’t want to know about torture scenes and absolutely terrified women. Remarkably, in the midst of all this tension and worry, I often felt bored by McGrath constant defense of his investigation as well as uninterested about the various plots and purposes of the made-up horror films he felt like we needed to know all about to truly understand the setting. Sometimes, I’ll ask my son about something he read or a movie and, instead of summarizing, he proceeds to retell me the story in as much detail as he can remember until I can’t take it anymore. I wanted to cut McGrath/Pessi off and shout, “Summarize the important point!” There is also a lack of cohesiveness between the known world and this occultist world surrounding Cordova and his uber-fans. The chapter that isn’t a chapter (all the other chapters get numbered but there is an entire section nestled between black pages) is hard to read. I’m sure it’s supposed to be but between the history of the past Cordova films and the surreal telling of McGrath’s journey, is so confusing that I ended up skimming. It didn’t seem to matter all that much. The ending, or endings, were very unsatisfying to me. I didn’t care for the conclusions about belief in occult or magic and I didn’t care for any of the characters’ journeys anymore. I did enjoy this as an ebook. It is my first time checking out an ebook from my library and I was surprised I lucked out choosing something so obviously made for the digital format. The story is filled with screen shots of web pages and newspaper clippings and those, in color and looking like actual web sites, looked perfect on my iPad. There was also something to download for an even more interactive experience but I was less invested by the time that capability was revealed. So…good stuff. Bad stuff. Boring stuff. Techie stuff. It’s a mixed bag for me. Good but not great. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 22, 2014","Jan 30, 2014","Jan 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10112885-night-film

Weaving his tragic backstory into his current job, caring for a young man, Trev, with advanced muscular dystrophy, Evison exposes something raw about us humans and why and how we love and care about others when it is so messy to do so.Besides the laugh out loud moments, I almost clapped for joy when I realized that Ben Benjamin was going on my favorite road trip. He describes a journey I have done so many times (travel on I-90 between Washington State and Montana and then south to Utah with a detour to Yellowstone) that I could see it almost perfectly. It’s all very accurate. Even the aptly described C’mon Inn in Missoula. It’s not always believable, not always clean (language and rude talk about sex) but Ben Benjamin broke my heart and made me laugh. I loved him.

Every sentence carries the burden of great expectation and each page iReading a book with as much hype as The Goldfinch is an interesting experience. Every sentence carries the burden of great expectation and each page is weighted with anticipated excellence. I certainly bought into the hype and, mostly, I was not disappointed. Until the end. I really disliked the ending.Donna Tartt has us readers invest in her flawed and well-crafted protagonist, Theo Decker, who from the very first page is clearly in some sort of trouble. After briefly being introduced to adult Theo, who explains that a dream he had about his mother is the impetus for the story to come, we are taken back to witness how an injured and traumatized 13 year-old Theo, disoriented and separated from his beloved mother amidst the mayhem of a museum bombing, innocently take a priceless and famous painting from the wreckage. Not knowing how to explain to the authorities or his quasi foster family (he goes to live with a wealthy friend from his school after his grandparents refused him) why he took it, and despondent upon learning about the death of his mother in the attack, he secretly keeps it, more out of fear than greed, turning a tragic moment of confusion into a soul-crushing crime that influences every future decision he makes. Just like Fabritius’s famous goldfinch, his life becomes chained to that painting.One part of the story that confused me a bit was the time span. 13 year-old Theo possessed an iPod and the setting seemed to be present day. But his future, older story-telling self also seemed to be set in present day. At least as far as I could judged based on how people communicated with technology. I couldn’t figure out if the explosion that set Theo’s tragic trajectory in motion was set in the past, like the late 1990s to early 2000s, or if his older, more ruined self existed in the future and it was sort of science-fiction-y without the science fiction. I pointed out my confusion to my mother, who had finished my copy from the library right before me, but she didn’t notice it (or care) so perhaps it doesn’t matter, but I often found myself troubled about the progression of time without any obvious progress in time. Not too troubled though, because the writing is so engrossing that I was mostly absorbed in whatever scene Tartt threw Theo into, whether it was in a ghost town, foreclosed neighborhood in suburban Las Vegas drinking Vodka with his Russian and equally neglected by his father friend, Boris, selling antique furniture with his rescuing guardian, Hobie, in lower Manhattan, or hiding from the Dutch police and Russian mafia in Amsterdam. Every shift in Theo’s world was fully developed and his guilt and obsession with The Goldfinch prominently staged as the major contributor to his mental decline. In that regard, I kept comparing this complex book to Poe’s The Tell Tale Heart or Dostoyevesky’s Crime and Punishment. For most of the 700 plus pages, I actually thought I was reading a modern retelling of either of those great accounts of obsession and guilt.Until I got to the last 60 or so pages. Everything was going along swimmingly…depressing, for sure, but good, well-developed depressing, when Tartt decided to go with the bad ending. I had forgotten, but the book did begin with Theo stating he was telling his story. Still, even with the first person narration, I never felt that meant that Theo was actually writing a story. Novels often use flashbacks or first person recollections, and Theo’s recollection, once started, proceeded in an orderly, chronological retelling. When the past caught up to present day and Theo began to refer to me as his reader, I felt jolted. The change in tone from recollective to persuasive irritated me for some reason. Suddenly, there was an intimacy in the story, a confessional conversation between Theo and me and I felt like the purpose and direction of the story changed. Instead of me neutrally observing Theo and the chaos his drug dependency and PTSD gave to his life, I was now required to sympathetically agree with Theo and his philosophies about right and wrong, good and evil, God and fate and agency and death. To be honest, I got annoyed. I wanted to get there by myself, if that was where the story directed me. It bordered on being spoon fed the moral of the story, as if the author didn’t trust me enough to figure it out, if there was anything to figure out, on my own. In my opinion, I would have loved for the story to end where it started, in Amsterdam, with Theo’s personal Road to Damascus experience. I would have loved to have wondered what he did after that.Can an ending I dislike ruin an otherwise incredible book? A little bit. I think this book is stock full of wonder and literary gold.

Attachments, by Rainbow Rowell, is a very sweet story. It's not saccharine sweet because the characters are all desperate and flawed enough to understand how their lives could easily not be awesome and yet, they are all funny and romantic and self-aware enough to seriously root for. I read Eleanor and Park earlier this year and loved the way it made me feel about first love as well as the nostalgic look at the 80s. Attachments feels very different in that while the heartache is there, the brutality of bullying, abuse and fear is absent and so the entire book has a very lighthearted, hopefully vibe. It is set in the late nineties, when Y2K was in the worrisome future and using the internet at work was still new and confusing to bosses and employees alike. As I stopped working in April of 2000, after the birth of my first child, the whole setting - lengthy email conversations (now people text or facebook message or snapchat or whatever), wardrobe descriptions, pop culture references, - it was like pushing play after a lengthy work break. I don't know how work places have really changed! The protagonists is male and the book is written in his POV, which is easy to forget as many chapters are copies of email exchanges between two women: Jennifer and Beth. My only complaint about this entire book is that I truly struggled to differentiate between these two women. Their voices were incredibly similar. I enjoyed that singular voice, because they were funny and self deprecating and definitely produced the laugh-out-loud humor of the book but I had to look at the name inside the <...>s or else I wouldn't know who was speaking unless they were referring to their significant others (who were very different). The conflict is so very fun.

I love getting both a historical and modern day look at what it means to be human but feel like I read a lot more books set in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia if I'm not reading about the good ol' U.S of A (and Canada. They are similar). But, whether by choice or neglect, my image of South America isn't very well rounded. I've read a few magical realism books, which aren't my favorite, but figured that most women from the south don't solve their problems with a mortar and pestal, nor do the majority of the men wear white button-down linen shirts and sell drugs. You see the problem with my literature stereo-types. That's why I was excited when I read a  about this book set in Colombia. Yes, it is about drugs but it is not about the white-shirted men. At least not directly. Instead, this beautifully written book (it is translated from its original spanish and very, very good), is about living in Colombia during the drug wars and what it means to be human in an area that is plagued by random violence, political corruptness and dangerously powerful drug lords. Immediately, I was impressed by the author's introduction to Antonio Yammara and his very modern-feeling life. He drinks coffee at a sidewalk cafe. He teaches law at college. He could be living in Seattle but, no, he's living in Bogota, Colombia, a capital city I didn't realize was so cold and remote, and when he describes his new friendship with a quiet and mysterious man named Ricardo Leverde, who is rumored to have spent time in prison for ""something bad"" I could see between these men the effect of mixing the notorious and the modern Bogota. The attempt of living in the present in spite of and because of a weary past. By the book's end, through memories shared, letters written, and a desperate search to make sense of the senseless, I was treated to a vibrant and interesting look at what happens in the background of a violent and unstable place. I expected a book about Colombia, a country that has never even crossed my radar to visit because of its association with drugs, to be about its violence and cartels. Those things are there but not the focus of the story. If anything, there is a notable lack of either. Instead, this is a look at love, loss, reconciliation and change. The title kept me thinking of the unanswerable question,""If a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?Antonio Yammara and Ricardo Leverde could be those trees - falling in a forest that lacks listeners - and the sounds they make to those who love them is quite heartbreaking....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 14, 2013","Nov 18, 2013","Nov 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16171259-the-sound-of-things-falling

Although I haven't liked The Girl You Left Behind or this one as well as Me Before You, I do commend the author and her versatility and use of fiction to engage thoughtful debate about a topic of morality. The Last Letter from Your Lover takes on infidelity, a topic that should have an automatic negative response but Moyes manages to explore it in a way that doesn't make you automatically hate the guilty characters. The setting alternates between the male-dominated world of the 1960s and present day. A woman wakes up from a car accident with a shattered memory, and doesn't understand her reaction to her unfeeling husband and lifestyle until she discovers a letter from someone who only addresses himself as ""B"". She realizes she must have had an affair before her accident and with painful self-discovery, tries to figure out the details. This entire story line is very Mad Men-esque. The second story line follows a woman-of-the-world journalist, in a frustrating affair with a married man, who discovers one of the letters between the 1960s lovers. It's desperate feeling, along with the threat of losing her job from her unimpressed editor, moves her to discover who the lovers are and if they got a happy ending.

It is an intriguing look at the lives of female pilots and female spies during World War II. With two protagonists telling their stories in similar voices, I admit to being confused a time or two about who was who and who was where but the twist at the end and heartfelt climax won me over. I was excited to learn that Elizabeth Wein had released a second book, Rose Under Fire, that contains some cross over characters from CNV. As in Code Name Verity, female pilots are once again on display. Rose, the single protagonist of this story, has been flying since she was twelve. She deems herself as worthy and experienced as any male pilot and feels restless going on her never-ending plane delivering services. She is also tired of living in fear of being bombed, as London and military bases around England were constant targets of pilotless bombs sent from the Germans. When she hears a rumor of how to bring these bombs down, just by messing with their air dynamics with some daring flight maneuvers, she imagines playing the hero and doing just that. During one of her delivery responsibilities, she gets her chance. Unfortunately, her extracurricular pilot activities catches the attention of patrolling Nazi pilots and she escorted via plane across the front and into Germany. From there, she is sent to Ravensbruck, a work camp for women. The conditions there are every bit as horrible as described at other concentration camps, but Wein reined in her focus to a small group of women held at the camp. Rose, through mistaken identity, finds herself in the company of a detainees known as ""Rabbits"" because they were victims of cruel medical experiments. Mostly Polish by nationality, their stories, mixed together with Rose's poetry about their and her experiences make for some powerful story telling. The deprivation these women experienced is highlighted with Rose's quick demise from confident curly-haired-blond-and-lipstick-wearing-pilot to a sickly, shorn, scared and fearful prisoner in just six months. I wonder what criteria has to be met for books to be categorized the way they are. Is it up to the author? Publisher? Are the librarians all in cahoots as to where they want to shelve these books? Because, I really can't figure out why this book is cataloged as Young Adult Fiction. I suppose the main character, Rose, is only eighteen at the start of the novel but she isn't in high school and there are no parents' thumbs anywhere near any of her decision making. She is an adult in very adult situations. I remember thinking this same thing with Code Name Verity. They are great books for adults. Definitely OK for mature teens but I think there is a significant portion of fiction reading adults who dismiss YA because it brings books like Twilight to the masses. This should be brought to the masses. Wein mixes her fictional Rose with real history and actual heroes and villains at Ravensbruck (also a real camp) and allows their stories to be unlocked from history with her quite spunky writing. I really enjoyed this heartbreaking and hopeful tale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 18, 2013","Oct 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262236-rose-under-fire

She isBefore I write a single thing about this book, I want to make it clear that Elizabeth Smart gets ten stars for being an incredible human being. She is strong and resilient and articulate and heroic. The work she is doing to help other victims of abuse is commendable and awe-inspiring. Her story is definitely five stars. I am giving her book, My Story, three stars because as a memoir, it is lacking some essential elements. For starters, I felt like this was a one emotion story. Smart experiences terror, humiliation, hunger, hope, despair, fear, pain, embarrassment, anger, gratitude, relief, love and more and yet, all of those emotions had to be experienced through Smart's 26 year-old disdain. She really, really doesn't like Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee. Obviously, that is an understatement. She no longer fears the pair who kidnapped her and kept her hostage for 9 months when she was only 14 years old, and she claims to have forgiven both as far as not holding on to any anger but, instead, moving on with a happy life, but there is definitely a tone throughout the entire book that sees them both as ridiculous, evil, narcissistic and manipulative and her attitude is felt throughout the entire book. I certainly give her every right to feel those things but my issue is that it made her 14 year old self less accessible. She explains her terror at being awoken in bed by a black-clothed and bearded man holding a knife to her throat but the terror is missing. Likewise, she never sidesteps the horrible fact that she was raped daily by a delusional and disgusting man but, again, her 26 year-old hind sight and determination to escape that psychological damage changes the horror of the act to an almost cursory sidenote. There is an interesting display of LDS theology throughout the book. One doesn't need to be a member of the LDS faith to understand it but I think the dichotomy of his warped faith and her powerful belief shows the fruits of both. One could easily pick up one without the other and say, ""See what this faith does?"" and have equal ammunition to attack and compliment. Something happened in the lives of Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee to see some of the less understood and more sacred theology and justify seriously hurting a 14 year-old girl. Elizabeth describes it as pure evil. She dismisses and repeatedly reproves any other justification, including mental illness on their parts. She certainly makes her case as Mitchell/Emmanuel is portrayed as the worst kind of hypocrite and abuser. Likewise, there is no doubt in my mind that Elizabeth's faith, and the love and acceptance of her family, in particular, her mother, are what allow this woman to not just survive but thrive. She believes that Christ and God's love can heal and she proves it to be true. It is amazing. I guess what I'm saying is that this book, My Story, her story, is told with the weight/blessing/presence of hindsight and it affects it. It does. I'm so glad Elizabeth gets a happy ending and even happier that she recognizes that her and all of our happiness is a choice but wish, from a reading perspective, that I could have experienced a little bit more of her story with her. Regardless, this is a powerful story about perseverance and the extraordinary strength of the human spirit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 15, 2013","Oct 20, 2013","Oct 11, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17287028-my-story

Moyes combination of humor, romance, morality, conflict, development and removed judgment in that book impelled me to search out more of her books. I picked up The Girl You Left Behind and was struck by how different it was. Usually, an author's doesn't stray very far from their comfort zone and I can pleasantly say that I don't know what Moyes's schtick is. The Girl You Left Behind  deals with two women, a century apart, who find solace in a painting with that very title (convenient, but it works). Sophie, a young french woman whose artist husband has left to fight at the front during World War I, looks at her own portrait and the provocative and challenging eyes that stare back at her gives her the courage to withstand and even stand up to the German soldiers who occupy her town. When the German Kommandant takes an interest in the painting, Sophie hopes the painting will be her ticket for survival. A hundred years later, the painting is a beloved honeymoon gift from her husband to Liv, a depressed widow much too young to be left dealing with the loneliness and financial strain left by her brilliant architect husband's death. When an architectural magazine features a story on her husband and includes a picture of the room where the painting hangs, a legal battle ensues when the heirs of the artist claim it is rightfully theirs and must have been looted during the war years. Liv, like Sophie a hundred years before her, sees the painting as the source of her strength and as a symbol of what once was and the story of its provenance and ultimately what happened to Sophie, is slowly revealed. I enjoyed both women's' stories but really think Moyes shined best developing Sophie in her provincial French town. The purpose of the title is felt throughout the book, something I always appreciate, but Sophie's pluck made her more endearing than Liv's desperation. Another feat of brilliance is including so much information about art and personal property restitution. Moyes made the issue even more complex by placing the art loss in World War I instead of the much more infamous and obvious looting by the Nazi's during World War II. That confusion is addressed in the book and greed, rights, and ownership are all investigated. Smart writing that will have me searching for even more Moyes work and I hope she comes out with more soon!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 09, 2013","Oct 09, 2013","Oct 09, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17572903-the-girl-you-left-behind

When I think of fluff, I think of pillows, clouds and marshmallows. I sleep on a pretty firm pillow but I always, always hug a really fluffy down pillow while I do so. I don't know much about clouds but the fluffy cumulus type are probably my favorite because I can find shapes in them. And while I never crave marshmallows, they make a drink of hot chocolate, rice krispie treats and those chocolate Easter eggs delightful. In other words, fluff has its place in the good world. Blackmoore, written by Edenbrooke's Julianne Donaldson, falls into the enjoyable fluff category. That isn't an insult. I've been reading a lot for the past few months (it always seems to come in spurts like this) and this was the first book I read in one sitting. It was easy, romantic, and written well enough to be able to admit to reading without embarrassment. Thoroughly predictable and sorely lacking in real conflict, Kate, not Kitty, is a likable protagonist who is in love with an even more likable romantic interest, Henry. I didn't find either's behavior very believable but that's ok. I liked that they were kind, thoughtful people who didn't want to hurt the other, bucking the more callous and selfish behavior traits displayed by both of their other family members. My only complaint, really, is that because the conflict didn't really exist, none of the book's drama matters much. (view spoiler)[ Kate runs away and goes to India without any consequence and Henry chooses his own bride and loses his estate and is totally fine! What's with all the imagined stress? Oh, that's right. Because not all would really be fine in a real 1820s world with a male and a female in the gentleman/lady class who made decisions like these two did, but it works in the name of romance!  (hide spoiler)]. It would have been more interesting to have a bit more confusion or competition on either or both of their paths to romantic enlightenment. Donaldson tried but it is clear throughout the book that there is no way either of these characters would/could/should end up with anyone but each other. Couldn't Henry go through a brooding and less appealing phase as he tries to transition to the gentleman of Blackmoore? Perhaps Miss St. Claire could have been more likable and less of a puppet or Mr. Barrows, a completely inessential character, it turns out, less eager or more appealing? Take away Eleanor's scandalous story and allow Kate, who is described as beautiful, to be pursued at Blackmoore, forcing Henry to decide if he'll actually let his childhood friend slip through his adult fingers. At the very first mentioning of Henry being ""The Giver of Your Heart's Desire"" in reference to a cat, it was beyond obvious that that very line would be used to wrap things up nicely at the end. I like the happy ending but, please, let my heart break a little in the middle so that I can be happy for the happy ending! A perfectly acceptable, clean, proper read that won't really matter much in terms of literature or fiction, but like its fluffy buddies, it makes life a little more sweet the day you read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 02, 2013","Oct 02, 2013","Oct 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15795628-blackmoore

A girl who is impregnated, by her own father, at the age of 12, who lets authorities at the hospital know, who can't read or write or speak without using the most profane kind of language because it is all she has ever heard or known, should send up a red flag...to someone. Anyone. A teacher. A principle A social worker. A nurse. The neglect, abuse and treatment she receives is as bad as any girl/woman in any book I have ever read. The fact that there was no war going on, no vacuum of power that typically brings out the very worst in humans, but simply that a girl was born to parents who never, ever should have been parents and raised in a place that must be almost immune to sad life stories makes the alarms go off in my head. Not fair! Help her! Save her! Stop whatever cycle of human depravity these people exist in!It seems to stop. At least, we readers are led to hope that the potential is there for it to stop. It took a principle who, unlike the movies, wasn't some kind of pure-hearted hero but someone who realized she made a mistake in kicking Precious out of her school for being pregnant at 16 and set up an opportunity for Precious to attend an alternative school. She had to shout her information through an apartment intercom over the cursing and belittling of both Precious and her horrible mother, but some of the information stuck and because some part of Precious's soul must have realized this could be an out, she went. And a life began to change. This isn't an easy book to read. Sapphire, the author, writes as Precious would speak. During the narrative when Precious would write in her journal, the writing becomes nearly unreadable (thankfully, there is an italicized translation underneath it). As the story progresses, the writing becomes better, never great, but we can literally see the improvements made by Precious. I'm not sure I loved the structure. As important as the women in her alternative school were to her, this was not their story and the inclusion of their journal entries/stories at the end was distracting and subtracted a bit from Precious's own push to improve. I think had this been non-fiction, I would have been a bit more forgiving of both these first person accounts as well as of the repetitive memory loop Precious could not seem to escape reliving the moments of abuse by the hands of both her mother and father. Even as her writing and reading improved, her emotional stability seemed as fragile as ever. When it is revealed at the end just how young Precious was when the abuse began, I can't help but wonder if she could ever really be better. Can anyone survive that kind of life? I don't know. Even after finishing, I still don't know. Hard, hard book to read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 30, 2013","Oct 02, 2013","Sep 30, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/71332.Push

I wondered for more than half of the book if I was going to get an actual plot or just reactions to an occurrence from a list of characters. There was a plot. It involved two brothers with the last name Burgess, hence the title, but that title is misleading because a lot of the book is about the Burgess boy's sister, Susan, and her son, Zach, who throws a frozen pig head into a mosque in the tired town of Shirley Falls, Maine where all three siblings were raised by their single mother.

I have heard about the angry Holden Caulfield for decades. I also knew this was a banned book and blamed by some for having been used as inspiration or motivation or...whatever, for various crimes. After all, isn't The Catcher in the Rye considered THE angry teenage boy book? That's what I thought, anyhow. Those bits of second hand knowledge learned along the way convinced my brain that Holden Caulfield and The Catcher in the Rye were synonymous with horror novels. Classic horror novels, but horror novels nonetheless. I don't do horror. I think my aversion to being scared on purpose kept me from discovering what this book is really about all this time. Turns out, Salinger is not a pre Stephen King. Perhaps I was thinking of that movie Children of the Corn. Rye...Corn. Both crops grown in midwest fields. An innocent mistake. In actuality, this is quite a tame book. Sure, we are exposed to the manic stream of consciousness narrative of Holden, a rich, neglected, traumatized and mentally ill teenage boy, and his thoughts do sometimes verge on disturbing. But, most of the time, he's thinking about girls or food or smoking. His manic state takes him to some dangerous situations but, luckily, his money and connections keep him from any real danger. And yet, it is a classic. A beloved and life changing classic for many and so, in my underwhelmed and relieved I wasn't reading about a slasher in a rye field state, I kept asking myself, ""Why is it?"" Because it wasn't for me, I can only surmise that perhaps it resonates more with teenage boys and not a middle aged woman. I tried to remember my own angst as a teen but I was never that melancholy or judgmental of my world. Maybe I can say that because my parents would have realized I was missing for several days and maybe that is because I never associated with the wealthy and pretentious schools Holden kept being forced to attend but it is probably mostly because I didn't self-medicate a mental illness possibly triggered by a sibling's death or sexual abuse with alcohol. I also think its likely immortality may be due to when it was written. Nowadays, teenage dramas are very popular and it is not uncommon to read about teens in various states of self-discovery, depression, school rebellion, romantic awakenings or shifts into adulthood. It would be interesting to know how many authors of these types of book think about Salinger's classic when creating their tales. Years ago, I wrote a  about Pearl Buck's The Good Earth and I had similar thoughts after finishing that book as I did upon finishing this one. Is it a classic because it was the first? The Good Earth brought the orient and its mysterious to the masses but many more have been written since with greater accuracy, detail and, frankly, in my opinion, better stories. I wonder if this is equally beloved because it took us into the mind of a troubled boy before anyone else bothered. I'm no historian, so I don't really know. Besides The Good Earth, I was reminded of another classic while reading: Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. While reading the beginning of the book, I did not recognize any great feeling within the book. If anything, the scattering of thoughts and quick shifts between subjects kept me from feeling anything at all. I wondered if the writing was somehow superb but all of the old fashioned language of ""grand"" and ""phony"" didn't convince me. I thought, ""Maybe Salinger just really nailed the lazy and disjoined grammar of a teenager,"" but, then, certain phrases started to appear out of the blue and poor Caulfield's extreme mental fragility startled me. By the end of the book, I felt quite down. I was supposed to, right? I remember reading The Bell Jar and feeling as suffocated as the character Esther and appreciating the author taking me to a place mentally I wouldn't naturally go. Although I never felt like Holden Caulfield and only recognized his great pain, I think I did catch the mood of the book. Perhaps those more permeable to his specific situation are the ones who go on to commit these crimes I have heard about that, in turn, make others wish to ban this book. Finally, I loved the title. I wish I knew the tune of the song referenced as its inspiration. I have never heard of a fable or song or folklore where someone catches someone in a dangerous situation but I think it is clear that Holden both wanted to be caught and realized that some personal healing could come from helping others and forgetting himself. I think Salinger wrote a bit of brilliance in framing his main character with having this desire, and thus the meaning behind it, but really giving it to another, lesser known character in a simple outing at the end. So, what's a lover of books supposed to think about a book that she did not particularly like or love but can recognize as original and powerful? Lump it with other three star books that are poorly written and historically forgettable? It's books like this that make me don't love the rating system but, there you go.

In terms of sincerity and courage, I would give Dr Alexander's account of his spiritual journey while in a coma five stars. Considering his profession, his reputation and the cynicism ever present in today's society, it really is a marvel that a man with no financial motive and not seeking a spiritual following would make the effort to share something so personal and hard to explain. In terms of readability, however, it really is more of a three star book. Alexander repeatedly fell into the trap of telling instead of showing and the telling too often veered from what he stated he was going to tell. A double whammy. I am a believer in the after life. Reading about NDEs (Near Death Experiences) don't really add or detract from my faith. I actually haven't read many personal accounts but have heard lots of stories about bright lights and loving feelings and meeting up with loved ones who have previously died. The argument against theses experiences usually stem from the very medical field wherein Dr. Alexander specializes: neurology or neurosurgery. These phenomena of awareness outside of the body or memories of consciousness when considered medically dead are explained as delayed neuron firings; a chicken running around with its head cut off, if you will. Possible but not live movement. A reflex. Alexander does a decent job of explaining why his experience was different. First of all, he teaches the important difference between ""heart attack dead"" and ""brain dead"" and how the latter is really the only kind that counts in medicine. Apparently, almost all of our consciousness comes from an area of the brain called the neocortex and his was essentially dead. The coma that came from a bacterial meningitis infection shut this part of his brain down, and his proof (which he never shoed. I suppose it is too complex to include in a diagram in a paperback book) was the plethora of imaging done on his brain during his intensive illness. He was in this coma for a week, a very long time to survive this type of meningitis, and describes a journey during that time to a place that is full of love, learning, and futuristic abilities to communicate, travel and understand. He never describes himself as a body but more as an identity. He was who he is. The companion with whom he traveled he did describe in bodily form so I suppose he makes his case for a body-like existence in the after life as well. Obviously, I can't get into his descriptions as they are hard enough for him to describe. I don't feel like he did a very good job explaining his experience in this afterlife, even though that is both the title and description of his book. Instead, the majority of pages are dedicated to taking the reader through his background, his family life, his medical training, his illness and what others were doing during his illness. It was a bit tiring, to be honest. I'm sure his family is lovely and all backstory helps to understand the larger picture, but in this case, I felt like it robbed me of more knowledge of what he experienced comes after. He claims that he remembers everything perfectly and it is merely the limitations of his bodily brain that keep him from translating his experiences more clearly. I certainly didn't feel like he made things very clear. I'll give him the benefit of my doubt, however, because I think that the afterlife must have a much different vocabulary than our earth life. At least he tried. There wasn't much about his account that felt silly or wrong to me. His knowledge and feeling that because of his medical background, he had a scientific responsibility to tell his story, felt almost prophetic to me. As a believer in prophets, it does make me curious why he was given this knowledge and so little instruction on what to do with it. I don't think it would make a believer out of a non-believer or really change someone's mind who already believed in an afterlife into thinking his experience is exactly what our own post death moments will be like, but I am glad this man told his story. I think it is life affirming and full of hope: two things that add much to our present life experience. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 02, 2013","Sep 05, 2013","Sep 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15851746-proof-of-heaven

My bias steals a star from an emotional and well-told story. I didn't read anything about this book before starting it. I only saw favorable ratings from a few friends and added it to my list without so much as reading the blurb on goodreads, something I never do. When I visited my library and saw it available on the very day I heard about it, I checked it out and kept my ignorance intact by forgoing reading the book jacket. The librarian then said, ""Ooooh. A book about (view spoiler)[assisted suicide. (hide spoiler)] How do you feel about that?"" which annoyed me greatly. With my pathetic passive-agressive response on full display, I shrugged and didn't reply. That'll teach her to stick to what should be known by every librarian and book seller: that if I don't ask...then don't tell!!!! Seriously, I could have slapped her. And by could have, I mean I would never ever do something like that. I feel like that pre-ejaculated knowledge from big mouth librarian kept me from getting the point of the book until a day or so after I finished. I always contemplate the meaning and reason for a book's title and kept thinking it was such a weird way of summarizing selfishness. In other words, I thought that both of the main characters in the story, Lou, a woman with no personal ambition who takes a job as caretaker for a quadriplegic to help pay her parents' bills, and Will, a former big shot now suffering from pain and indignity in a wheelchair, struggled to be motivated to act beyond their own wishes and goals. They both had much different views about how life should be lived. In spite of the change that happens to both Lou and Will when their worlds collide, each kept putting their ""me"" before the other's ""You."" But, after logging on to write this  and finally reading the goodreads blurb, I see that the title is clearly intended to reflect the changes that happen to both characters upon meeting. I totally get it now. They do both change. In beautiful ways. Just not enough for me, in the end. I thought Jojo Moyes treated this heavy subject brilliantly and left enough ambiguity to challenge anyone's preconceived views about choice and what constitutes a worthy life. While there is a bit of rah-rah attached to the story, thanks to Will's views, that life needs to be lived extremely and boldly, I don't think that is what the author is telling her readers. I dismiss that moral because I think it is both wrong and over reaching. There is a poignant conversation during the book between Lou and Will when she asks Will if he thinks his inability to adapt to his new situation is because of how he lived before. He rejects her theory and I suppose it's possible that with his reply, we are also to reject that idea, but I don't. I have studied happy people and unhappy people and I guarantee that bungee jumping and climbing Mt. Kilamanjaro, impressive as they are, aren't the key to happiness. Neither is having lots of sex or making millions of dollars. Again, I stress that I don't believe Moyes is trying to sell that kind of life. By using her two chracter's contrasting lives, I think she effectively shows that happiness is a state of mind. It is not our jobs or even our relationships. The fact that I stayed up until 2 am to finish reading and then had horrible dreams and fragmented sleep illustrated just how much affected I was by reading this. It disturbed me. I liked it but cannot quite resolve my anger towards one of the characters to love it. I hope I was a bit more ambiguous than that librarian. Perhaps I should forgive her.

The Ocean at The End of the Lane reminds me of Roald Dahl's book. While I tend to appreciate Dahl's books, rather than like them, Gaiman got past my preference for normal by sandwiching his bizarre with brilliant meaning. In spite of my inability to imagine some of his more intangible descriptions, like the ratty fabric in the sky with teeth, I absolutely engaged in both the fear felt by the memories of a 7 year old child and protection provided by the wise and calm Hempstock sisters. How it all came to be, hinging on memories rekindled by setting, with my comfortable normal just within reach in the background, is believable, even though I know it can't be.

One can understand her desire to release a novel without the she-wrote-Harry-Potter fanfare and to get sincere, unbiased s. I wish I had read this without knowing Galbraith was a pseudonym. I can't pinpoint exactly why, as I feel neither starstruck nor overly critical with my , but it would have been fun to believe that this impeccable writing came from a first time author. Since it comes from her...well...it should be good. There should probably have been a semi-colon somewhere in the first paragraph. Heaven knows, Rowling would have found a place to use one. I have never, ever read a book before where the use of a semi-colon appears so freely and assuredly. I'm certain most authors understand how and when to use a semi-colon so I'm very curious what a grammarian or author thinks about Rowling's frequent choice of pausing without a period. I'm sure she used it correctly. Not being a semi-colon user myself (it takes me too long to figure out if I'm using it properly), its appearance sometimes slowed me down as I would pause and wonder why she chose that form of punctuation in that sentence. I'm a bit embarrassed to admit how often I stopped to think about this. More than an author of a whodunit novel, where there is usually an element of urgency, would like, I'm sure. Overabundant usage of a lesser-understood punctuation mark is not a deal-breaker, however. Obviously. It's just something I noticed and then couldn't stop noticing. Perhaps she's like Justin Timberlake and ""bringing the semi-colon back."" Now that my own neurosis has been addressed, I'll get to the book at hand. It is decidedly good. I'd even go beyond my reigned-in praise and say it would be great except for the jack-hammering use of the F-bomb and her sometimes out-of-place show-off vocabulary. Both felt unnecessary. I am pretty forgiving when reading characters who would swear, swear. Not everyone has the ability, temperament or education to use good language. It bugs me when those who have all three still do. This book is filled with characters like that. They are vulgar because they choose to be and that wears on me. Fashion designers, actors, models, producers, and the rich and vapid all swear like soldiers. Then, in the same sentence, Rowling would reach deep into her thesaurus and use beautiful and obscure descriptive language. it was an odd and unsettling combination, to me. What did work brilliantly was Rowlings pacing of The Cuckoo's Calling. Never frenetic, and never veering into a hard-to-follow tangent, I was totally absorbed into Cormoron Strike's detective work. The clues and interviews and piecing all kept my interest and the big reveal was neither impossible to figure out or obvious from the start. I also really liked the characters. Not the yucky ones, although they were interesting when they weren't embarrassing me with their gutter-language, but the main protaganist, Strike, and his temp secretary, Robin, were nuanced, believable and well developed. I don't know if Rowling sketched out the arc of Strike's story on a restaurant napkin, like she did for Harry Potter, but you can see that she intends to take this detective and his relationships with Robin and ex-fiancee, Charlotte, somewhere in books to come. I can't wait to read what comes next. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 15, 2013","Aug 24, 2013","Aug 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16160797-the-cuckoo-s-calling

In an attempt to add some levity and relaxation into my reading, I read a fluffy ""beach"" read last week and felt a bit exasperated at its stupidness and general falseness. Then, I picked up Heft, by Liz Moore sort of desperate for a good book. Alternative titles could be ""Heavy"" or ""Burdened"" or ""A Boulder of Sadness on my Back"" but I think Moore was wise with her choice of Heft. The book is narrated by two characters: Arthur Opp, an obese 58 year-old recluse and Kel Keller, a popular 17 year-old boy who lives in poverty in Yonkers but attends a posh high school where he does his best to hide his real life. The author connects them through Kel's alcoholic mother, Charlene, who was once a student of Arthur's when he still taught, but their stories never intersect. That might be giving too much away but the way Moore unfolds their stories, parallel but relevant to each other, is really well done. I look at her picture on the book jacket and she seems young and pretty and successful and I wonder how she nailed the absolute loneliness these poor souls experience. In one description of Arthur's shame and remorse and obsession with food, I got teary. I want every person who ever says, ""Fat people just need to eat less!"" to read it and understand the complex psychological issues that come with overeating. Mostly, I loved the glimmers of hope at the end. As determined to be alone as both Kel and Arthur seemed to be, their only refuge from despair was to connect with another person. After reading, I feel determined to greet strangers with a smile and show kindness wherever I can. And when I see someone who is so overweight or a teenager that is acting out a bit, I want to remember that that person is possibly walking around with a huge boulder of sadness on their back. Quite possible the saddest book I've read this year. But, it's also one of the best. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 07, 2013","Aug 13, 2013","Aug 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11381910-heft

Of course, thy asked what the title was and when I said, ""A Constellation of Vital Phenomena,"" they both said that it was too confusing to remember. I agree with them. It is odd and seemingly senseless. The beauty and perfection of this hard-on-the-tongue title revealed itself on page 184, however, when Natasha, the beautiful but left behind sister, who is holed up in her Chechen communist apartment block, trying to escape the cruel and lawless civil war that uprooted her entire life, reads this banal statement in The Medical Dictionary of the Union of Soviet Physicians, the biggest and heaviest book she could find on her surgeon sister's bookshelf: Life: a constellation of vital phenomena - organization irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation..Even though I had been enjoying the story thus far, because and in spite of the non-linear storytelling, when I reached that proclamation of purpose, my brain did this zoom-out thing and the pieces of the story, which are a lot like some of the complicated and advanced quilts I saw on display at the county fair a few weeks ago, started to take form. Using the author's constellation metaphor, it was like all of these different patterned and various hued yellow fabrics, which have no business being together except for their general yellow-ness, became a star. A really interesting and important star. A work of art, really.The rest of the novel went much quicker as my brain zoomed in and out when necessary. The individual fabrics of motivation, background, family life, disappointments, abilities, aversions and hope from Dokka, Akhmed, Havaa, Sonja, Natasha, Khassan and Ramzen pieced together to educate me, a protected and blessed woman in the peaceful Rocky Mountains of the United States about modern civil war, specifically the one in Chechnya between the years of 1994 to 2004. To be fair, ""modern"" is probably an exaggeration for the villages, cities and hospitals built in the former Soviet Union, but phones went from working to not working. Gas went from available to a black market commodity. Safe drinking water was for the lucky and rich. Employers and employees disappeared and all that was left to fill that great vacuum of energy and productivity were mobs and the military. Even though it is historical and not dystopian, I kept acknowledging the warnings given: this could happen anywhere. This could happen to me and my loved ones. The educated were not exempt from suffering. The beautiful were not exempt from suffering. The loyal, the traitorous, the young and the old - all suffered. For what? Sovereignty? Maybe. A religious movement? At first. Like all wars, eventually, all that was left to fight for was power. The power to live and not be tortured, sold, or ""disappeared"" for information. Horrible.Using well known biblical stories of struggle and purpose, the question of responsibility to family, to other generations, weaves through it all. Abraham, and God's commandment to sacrifice his son as well as the sacrifice of parents to orphan their children in hopes of saving them (Moses are repeatedly asked. What are we to learn from these recurring lessons on life? That it is sacred? That it is fleeting? Frequently, the author would pause a story briefly to share a glimpse of a character's future. It felt like a gentler handling of a technique used in action movies when the shot freezes with a certain character on screen so that important information can be given. That little stretchy pause added both to the beauty and intricacy of this artful novel. It had the effect of filling in the dark sky with distant stars. This is what great fiction can do:make the lessons from different life experience available to all who read. I pray and hope that I never find myself and my family making the kinds of sacrifices or decisions that are required when at war. Should I be so lucky, I need to remember that every day, millions of people throughout the world are not. The Syrians and Egyptians are in the midst of this very kind of conflict right now and the world watches when convenient or if an atrocity is vicious enough. It is a story on constant repeat. And yet, in that definition given in the medical dictionary for Soviet physicians, there is also growth...adaptation...reproduction...movement as part of it all too. it seems there is no government, mob or military that has been able to control or drive out the human acts of generosity and kindness with their brutality. Fathers and mothers continue to love their children. Friends die for each other and people give up glory and comfort to do the right thing. These were the shades of yellow I liked best. It gave this beautiful constellation of stars depth and comfort and tenderness. I loved Dokka and Ahkmed and Sonja and Natasha and Havaa and Khassan and I pitied Ramzen, even though none were perfect and most did unforgivable things. How tender were their brutal lives. Highly recommended. It is not an easy read but it is so, so worth the effort. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Aug 24, 2013","Aug 28, 2013","Aug 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15797715-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

Set during and a few years after World War II in England, a love affair occurs between an author, Maurice, and a married woman, Sarah, and Maurice, with his bitter, depressed and unforgiving point of view, tells the story of how their relationship ended, began and wilted. At first, I thought this story served to highlight the obsessive and jealous nature of man and, ultimately, to convince that emotions of hating and loving need each other to exist. It certainly never felt romantic, even when Maurice describes his infatuation with Sarah and their passion for each other. In fact, it reminded me a bit of Wuthering Heights: more a display of obsession than love. Then, it rolled and despaired into the question of God's existence and forgiveness and miracles and prayer during war. I actually preferred this plot trajectory over the embittered memories of Maurice and by the book's end, really felt like I had thought and wondered and realized. Plus, it didn't hurt AT ALL that I listened to this and Colin Firth was the narrator. He has a fabulously proud and bitter and sexy voice and it was very easy to imagine him loving and ruining a woman.

It's mostly clean although there is a bit of totally unnecessary language that doesn't belong at all. I am pretty tolerant of language in books if its use fits the circumstance or character and neither criteria was met here.The author attempts to showcase the historical lore behind the classic Romeo and Juliet story. I enjoyed learning that Shakespeare was most likely not the creator of the star-crossed lovers tale but merely produced the most famous rendition. I also enjoyed being taken back to medieval times, even if the speech and actions of the main characters didn't seem very authentic.The modern day romance is what really annoyed me. I have found this to be the case in a lot of stories set up like this. Coming immediately to mind is Sarah's Key and Possession (although it works better in Possession) but I did not believe or care about the romance between the discoverers of the historical mystery. In fact, their conversations were torture for me. I felt like I was reading a very novice author (think high school level) writing dialogue. Oh, she definitely had a thesaurus at hand for the word ""said"" and used ""whispered"" ""gloated"" ""hissed"" ""moaned""....just about any word other than ""said"" but if felt terribly trite and juvenile to me. When I finished the book and learned that the author grew up and only moved to the US in 2002, it almost explained the irritating use of English. It just didn't feel natural.Like I said, if unbelievable dialogue doesn't bother you and you really do like Romeo and Juliet but want to learn about some different twists to the well-known tale, you might like this.

I'm not sure what I missed but reading Life After Life felt a bit like drudgery instead of bliss. I think I get the concept. A character, Ursula, dies repeatedly but then gets chance after chance to live her life again. She experiences feelings of extreme deja-vu and sometimes, but not every time, makes a different decision than in a previous life that leads to a much different outcome. Sometimes, that outcome is better than the life before but most of the time, it just places her along a parallel but equally miserable trajectory. Did Ursula know what was happening to her? In a few chapters, it seemed like she was fully aware of her reincarnated state, particularly at the end (and beginning because the author repeats the opening scene that, with context, means something) but, most of the time, it seemed as if life was just happening again and only after a strong premonition, usually an overwhelming feeling of terror when approaching the scenario in which she previously died, but not actual knowledge, did Ursula do something different that changed her history. And that's another thing that bugged me. She really only ever changed her own history. Oh, she saved a couple of different lives a few times, but usually, the same unfortunate end came to most of the background characters. It was like this unspoken and really unsatisfying argument about the supposed butterfly affect (could one person's decision change the course of history?) and fate (if it's meant to happen, it will no matter what). Both occurred so...which theory wins? The writing was vivid, characters were enjoyably fleshy and the concept pretty imaginative, although Groundhog's Day and Sliding Doors can both claim to have come up with it first, but, overall, I feel disappointed that I didn't like it more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 22, 2013","Jul 29, 2013","May 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790842-life-after-life

When posthumously opened, the curious daughter discovers A mother gives her daughter her journals, requesting that they only be read after her death. When posthumously opened, the curious daughter discovers multiple journals are all filled with blank pages. Why?Terry Tempest Williams uses 54 chapters to wonder. I loved the concept and execution of this book more than I loved William's voice and edgy opinions. Partly, that is due to her dismissal and bias against a church she has left and to which I still belong to. All I can say it is akin to having a cousin bad mouth your own family. Yes, they know them and those might be their opinions of things that happened once upon a time, but it doesn't make them true or current or fair. This referencing of the LDS (Mormon) church certainly is not the focus of the book, but as her mother was a faithful member and the daughter is an unbeliever, Williams' wonderings can't help but delve into the spiritual motives, longings, grudges and aspirations of her mother, many laden with LDS dogma. This quote at the beginning of one of the chapters had me snort out loud. I can't recall it exactly as the book is no longer in my possession but it says something along the lines that all LDS women hold two things sacred: their responsibility to procreate and have offspring and to keep a journal. There certainly is a sacred responsibility and reverence towards motherhood but I have never, ever been told it is part of my job, because I have a uterus, to keep a journal. Certainly, some women do. Lots of LDS women blog, which is sort of modern day journal keeping (plus bragging and showing off) but part of that has to be attributed to a high percentage of them (us) finding a creative outlet and purpose beyond laundry and taxiing. I know that's why I started to write. But, her flippant, know-it-all-because-I-grew-up-in-Utah-and-went-to-BYU attitude towards the church is more self-serving than true. At the very most, it is outdated. Perhaps some of the attitudes and traditions that she saw a child in Utah growing up in the 60s and 70s were present, but she has to give her mother more credit than being a brainwashed LDS woman as a reason for a blank journal. Defense of my religion aside, Williams is a beautiful writer who really evokes strong images and feelings in her poetic phrasing. An environmentalist who knows a lot about birds, she draws images of life and movement from birds and attaches them to human experience and the result is moving and life affirming. We are our world and our surroundings and I liked thinking with her about women: our strengths, passions, limitations and voices.

Honestly, I think every teen feels like a big freak but I usually don't relate to books like Perks of Being A Wallflower because I was involved and had friends and did sports and all that ""uncool"" stuff to those who rebuff the mainstream either by choice or by force. I couldn't finish Perks because of all of the sex and drugs but this book was able to highlight the difficulties of kids who don't fit in without making either of the characters degenerates. I adored Eleanor. I loved her thoughts and her insecurities and her coping skills. I hated her family. I wondered which kids I ignored because of their clothes or weirdness might have had home lives like Eleanor. Park was a little less believable to me because his isolation seemed more self-imposed. Still, there is a moment in the plot when Eleanor and Park are in an English class and studying Romeo and Juliet and the teacher is trying to engage the students to think why such a sad story has survived the test of time as well as it has. Predictable answers are given until Eleanor suggests that it reminds people what it feels like to be young and in love. This book does just that. I never had a high school romance as intense as the one experienced between Eleanor and Park but I have fallen in love and the description and progression of that magical discovery that someone likes you just as much as you like them is perfect. The nuanced secondary characters, awesome 80s references, tragic backgrounds and formidable odds to overcome made this read that much more sweet. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 30, 2013","May 10, 2013","Apr 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15745753-eleanor-park

I didn't love it because I felt it unnecessarily crude at times as well as curiously infuriating but there is no denying the craftsmanship of the writing - from the weaving of a mystery, coming of age and folklore - to its scope of highlighting the unique problems of the Native American tribal justice. Even though it fell short of becoming a favorite of mine, reading this book brought light to ignorance and made me care about fictitious characters, hallmarks of worthy books, in my opinion.As for my gripes, the protaganist, Joe, is a 13 year old boy who sometimes seems 13, sometimes 8 and sometimes 20. I know that age can be difficult to capture.  Heck, I have a 13 year old so I get it. But his behavior was so peculiar and unpredictable. Still, his world was ripped apart with the violent crime against his mother and the stress and tension it created within his once peaceful home. There were many times throughout the novel that I felt irritated and impatient with Erdich for taking me on another teenage escapade filled with all the language and crassness of boys in groups. Those events eventually contribute to the heartbreaking finale but it was not very pleasant to be repeatedly treated to what a boy thinks about breasts, dirt bikes, beer and food. Maybe I'd have given this book five stars had Erdich's 13 year old been a bit more virtuous:-)This is compelling literature about contemporary Native American life.

Actually, I picked up Gary Schmidt's Okay For Now on a whim and when I saw that he had a Newberry Winner called The Wednesday Wars and the blurbs on the back said it was just as good as his award winning The Wednesday Wars, I went back and got that book instead. It is adorable and funny and tender and insightful and historic and frustrating and well written! I have only ever read Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and it just about kicked my tail (I find the movie adaptations easier on my brain) and my only eyebrow raise is how easily a seventh grader seemed to digest and comprehend that old English style. Regardless, his enjoyment of Shakespeare and his subsequent application and interpretation of his famous plays exposed the very motivation and connection I feel with reading: that art imitates life, or vice versa, and we can gleam the human experience through any generation with books. I can only imagine how delightful a well-versed Shakespeare love would find this book. It's more than the smart use of Shakespeare, however, that make this so much fun to read. Holling Hoodhood's relationships with his friends, he teachers, his family, as well as his embarrassments and triumphs make this a compelling read. As a warning, it is juvenile literature. The shenanigans and conflict feel young, even younger than a current-day seventh grade boy might experience, because it is set in 1968 when schools were run differently and polite society had a much different emphasis. However, I actually found that innocence and conservativeness a much more effective story telling method than the crassness and shocking nature of todays young adult literature. Whether a seventh grader finds is as relevant will soon be discovered as I've already passed it on to my own almost thirteen year old son. I can't wait for him to read it!I heartily recommend this book to all readers of any age.

Really, I don't know why I have only finished two of her novels and not all of them.I thoroughly enjoyed The Secret Keeper.  Dorothy Nicolson is dying and her daughter, famous actress Laurel Nicholson, is determined to finally face the horrible violent act she witnessed between her beloved mother and a stranger on a warm summer day in 1961 when she was 16 years old. The book is organized into three main sections: Laurel, Dolly and Viven.  These three women are the main characters of the book but the narration mainly focuses and fluctuates between Laurel as a young woman still living at home and her as a 70 year old woman and Dorothy, or Dolly, as a young women living during the buildup and breakout of World War II as well as a dying 90 year old. Viven is mentioned regularly in the first two sections of the book but only as a mysterious periphery character who changes depending on when she appears in the timeline. We finally get to know Vivien, as a young girl and woman, in the final section of the book when all the previous development starts to make sense. There are also shadings of a man named Jimmy, Dolly's love interest as a young woman, and a few other interesting secondary characters whose relationships with the three main women cast them all in different lights.What I find fascinating about books like these is how well timed and in control the author lays out her plot. Because it isn't chronological at all, and certain scenes repeat and change as they are viewed from the perspectives of different characters, there is so much false foreshadowing. Perhaps false isn't the right adjective but definitely incomplete. There is one scene in particular that happens early on in the book that kept anchoring my ending guessing. I couldn't stray too far from my original hypothesis because I knew this certain conversation had to eventually take place. Then, when it took place again but through different eyes, nothing had changed in conversation but everything had in point of view and tone. I believe most mystery readers enjoy trying to piece clues together and finish the puzzle before the author gives it all away but unlike some authors, Morton neither makes it too easy nor impossible. Each time I was fairly certain I had figured out the mystery of Dorothy Nicolson, Morton would make me doubt myself with new information. I was pleased when I shut the book and could say, ""I knew it!"" but, the reality is, I knew it, then thought I must be wrong, then wondered, then changed my mind, then knew it again. Morton really knows how to take her readers on a ride.While there are a few meaningful ideas that would be nice to discuss, such as that prejudice that all young people seem to have against becoming their parents as well as the impetus or chain of grief, I think this kind of story is best read in the spirit of entertainment rather than in pursuit of historic or familial understanding.

Could the novel earn more respect and weight if its two protagonists, Ciro and Enza, had more than their one hardworking but happy mood throughout their ardulous life journey? I think so. The two of them had some pretty hard knocks at very young ages and it was difficult for me to believe that neither was more complicated or obnoxious as a result. Instead, they were very, very likable. And beautiful. And courageous. And stoic. And meant to be together. Like I said...Disney-esque. Pleasant. I enjoyed the Italian setting in the early 20th century more than pre and post war American but it might be because I'm less familiar with the mountainous northern villages of Italy than I am with old New York City or Minnesota and their immigrant eras. I also enjoyed the author's inclusion of both faithful and disenfranchised Roman Catholics. All in all, there was much more to enjoy than object to in The Shoemaker's Wife.

I didn't buy it, because I was in there to buy another book and I'm pretty stingy with hardcovers, but when I saw it on the shelf of new releases at the library, I snatched it up.Best read of 2013 it is not, for me, but this collection of short stories by George Saunders, who currently teaches creative writing at Syracuse University, is certainly fascinating. I liked the first person, journal entry style narration that he used throughout the book, although it was so casual at times that I wondered how he would grade a student's paper written this way. Every time the thought, ""I don't know why anyone would think this is extraordinary,""came to my mind, which it did while reading nearly every short story, a plot trick or his unexpected use of science fiction would immediately elevate the writing to a ""wow"" level. If he intended to showcase the difference between great language and mediocre language in a small space then he succeeded. It's like looking at a Jaguar and a Kia side by side. He really can be impressive with his words when he wants to be.But I don't think that was his point. I think the unpolished and rough writing was done purposely to match the various unsavory or rough characters featured in each story. I wish I had a favorite story of the ten included in this work, or one that I just couldn't stop thinking about days later to elevate my opinion of this book. It's not that I need cute and cuddly characters to root for. Believe me, there are no cute and cuddly characters. The book begins with a story about a hapless teenager forced to decide whether to be brave or safe, which was interesting until the end. There is a horrific story about two women involved in the sale of a puppy who think they are being the best parent and spouse possible. There are stories that feature a sleazy salesman, a financial idiot, a soldier, a long-winded boss, a dying cancer patient and a socially unaware overweight boy. These stories are rather depressing although each is written with a sharp, uncomfortable humor that doesn't make if funny but also doesn't make it dreary. More like scary dark.So, whoever wrote, ""Best read of 2013!"" must like scary dark with a side of twisted humor.  I don't know if I would have liked his style better if I could have become attached to these characters in a longer format or if someone explained to me why all these stories were thrown together into one book or if I hadn't started reading with really high expectations but I finished The Tenth of December feeling disappointed. I appreciate that there were many flashes of brilliance but, overall, other than being a bit shocked at times, nothing made me feel more aware of those unknown lives surrounding me or the all-encompassing human experience.

Although this is not an LDS book and should appeal to readers anywhere of any faith (or none) the theme of agency and accountability is one that is familiar and pivotal to members of our church.  For this reason, perhaps, I didn't find the characters' journeys all that startling or even very interesting.  I loved the first book.  I thought Condie's choice to portray a futuristic, dystopian society featuring happy, productive people instead of the more familiar scary and looming forced conformity was smart.  Because I've always been a believer that it is better to have good and bad so that we can know the difference and more fully appreciate the good, I found myself really thinking about a place where the things we seek after - good health, happy families, satisfying work and hobbies - are all but guaranteed. Sure, it was obvious that something was missing but because I felt those good things through Cassia's and Xander's experience,  in a way, I didn't want it to go away.  They were likable and good. Ky was used to illustrate what happens to the imperfections.  To achieve perfect health, the risks (foods, vices, idleness) against it were taken away.  Likewise, to achieve perfect societies, those who disobeyed rules or were even born to those who disobeyed rules, were taken away.  As Ky, classified as an Abberation or an outcast because his parents were part of the Rising, was also a character to root for, the conundrum was established.  Who or what should go?  Those threats to perfection or perfection itself? I suppose I needed to set that all up to explain that I did get the point.  I liked the point.  I just didn't like the story anymore.  As much as I enjoyed Matched, the first book in the series, I equally disliked Crossed, the second book.  Take that as a lesson in opposition! I had no idea where Reached would fall in the spectrum and due to its length, grueling repetitiveness (Cassia loves poetry and is thinking, hiding, trading, or writing poems to express how she feels about any topic.  Xander is learning about the nature of viruses while he thinks about Cassia.  Ky flies a plane while thinks about Cassia. Who is the Pilot? Who is the Pilot? Who is the Pilot?) and predictability, it falls closer to Crossed than Matched.  Everything felt so tedious to me.  From finding a cure (twice!) to waiting for something, anything to make the love triangle more interesting (everyone liked and respected each other an awful lot) I just kept waiting for the action to happen.  Either the conflict was too long in development or simply not overwhelming enough to notice, but I felt like there was no climax.  At least no page-turning one.  I also got tired of the Capitilizations.  Pilot.  Society.  Rising.  Otherlands.  Plague.  I felt irked each time one of those words popped up in a sentence.  If you've read the book, you have an idea about the frequency of the emotion.  What I did enjoy was Xander's growth as his eyes were open to both his limitations as well as his innate talents.  I know he had alternating chapters but I wish there would have been even more about Xander. So, I liked it but I didn't love it and because I wanted this book to redeem the series for me, I feel disappointed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 20, 2013","Jan 20, 2013","Jan 20, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13125947-reached

My favorite part of the book, by far, was the weight Will Schwalbe gave books.  Bookclubs get a bad rap and Schwalbe himself lightly mocks them by admitting that the bookclub his mother and he forms breaks all the rules as there is no food served and it only has two members.  As frustrating as book clubs can be, and they often are, I love that a book has the power to gather and join minds.  Even when I disagree with someone about something we've read, I am still delighted that we have that commonality of experience.  Will proves the worth of not only reading, but reading with the anticipation of discussion by the way he lovingly tributes the thoughts and beliefs of his mother with each book discussed.  It sounds like a country song, but I like this quote from the book: ""Reading isn't the opposite of doing; it's the opposite of dying.""If you like to read and want some affirmation that you're spending your time wisely, this book is for you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 13, 2013","Jan 23, 2013","Jan 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13414676-the-end-of-your-life-book-club

At first, I thought Barnes's The Sense of An Ending would have an ending as philosophically self evident as its narrator, Tony, repeatedly declared and quoted was the only realistic possibility of any history, that is ""the certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation.""  As Tony discovered throughout his attempts at nostalgia and navel gazing, memories of which he was certain changed with additional witnesses.  Moreover, memories long since forgotten were remembered with new cues and triggers never before considered. As an unapologetic gazer myself, I found the idea that our histories - whether it is our personal, national, or worlds' -  can't possibly be unbiased or thoroughly remembered both profound and accurate. Then came the ending.  What I thought was philosophy was actually a semi-detective novel in disguise and its ta-da revelation finale ruined everything.  As The Sense of An Ending won the Man Booker Prize, I have no doubt that many more educated than I can explain how this blind sided and frustrating reveal not only needed to happen but was actually developed and obvious the entire time, only obstructed by Tony's own need for redemption, but I really wish it simply had a different ending.  I honestly would have been more satisfied with his old girlfriend, Veronica, saying, ""You really don't get it.  You never have and you never will,"" one more time (although twice seemed like enough) and it just... ending.  With us not getting it.  I thought that would have been perfectly poetic and fitting with his painstaking defense of the weakness of memory.  But that was not Julian Barnes's sense of an ending.  See? Is it a play on the title after all?This kind of book leaves me at a loss for rating or recommendation because while I ultimately found it unsatisfying and quite ruined by the ending, the writing was eye candy there were so many lovely quotes to enjoy.  Those discoveries are worth the reading effort, I believe.  Here are some of my favorites:“How often do we tell our own life story? How often do we adjust, embellish, make sly cuts? And the longer life goes on, the fewer are those around to challenge our account, to remind us that our life is not our life, merely the story we have told about our life. Told to others, but—mainly—to ourselves.” “We live in time - it holds us and molds us - but I never felt I understood it very well. And I'm not referring to theories about how it bends and doubles back, or may exist elsewhere in parallel versions. No, I mean ordinary, everyday time, which clocks and watches assure us passes regularly: tick-tock, click-clock. Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time's malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missing - until the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return.” “This was another of our fears: that Life wouldn't turn out to be like Literature.”“What you end up remembering isn't always the same as what you have witnessed.”“Also, when you are young, you think you can predict the likely pains and bleaknesses that age might bring. You imagine yourself being lonely, divorced, widowed; children growing away from you, friends dying. You imagine the loss of status, the loss of desire – and desirability. You may go further and consider your own approaching death, which, despite what company you may muster, can only be faced alone. But all this is looking ahead. What you fail to do is look ahead, and then imagine yourself looking back from the future point. Learning the new emotions that time brings. Discovering, for example, that as the witnesses to your life diminish, there is less corroboration, and therefore less certainty, as to what you are or have been. Even if you have assiduously kept records – in words, sound, pictures – you may find that you have attended to the wrong kind of record-keeping. What was the line Adrian used to quote? 'History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation.” “Does character develop over time? In novels, of course it does: otherwise there wouldn't be much of a story. But in life? I sometimes wonder. Our attitudes and opinions change, we develop new habits and eccentricities; but that's something different, more like decoration. Perhaps character resembles intelligence, except that character peaks a little later: between twenty and thirty, say. And after that, we're just stuck with what we've got. We're on our own. If so, that would explain a lot of lives, wouldn't it? And also - if this isn't too grand a word - our tragedy.” “Yes, of course we were pretentious -- what else is youth for?” “That's one of the central problems of history, isn't it, sir? The question of subjective versus objective interpretation, the fact that we need to know the history of the historian in order to understand the version that is being put in front of us.” “But I’ve been turning over in my mind the question of nostalgia, and whether I suffer from it. I certainly don’t get soggy at the memory of some childhood knickknack; nor do I want to deceive myself sentimentally about something that wasn’t even true at the time—love of the old school, and so on. But if nostalgia means the powerful recollection of strong emotions—and a regret that such feelings are no longer present in our lives—then I plead guilty.”“What did I know of life, I who had lived so carefully? Who had neither won nor lost, but just let life happen to him? Who had the usual ambitions and settled all too quickly for them not being realised? Who avoided being hurt and called it a capacity for survival? Who paid his bills, stayed on good terms with everyone as far as possible, for whom ecstasy and despair soon became just words once read in novels? One whose self-rebukes never really inflicted pain? Well, there was all this to reflect upon, while I endured a special kind of remorse: a hurt inflicted at long last on one who always thought he knew how to avoid being hurt - and inflicted for precisely that reason.” “You can put it another way, of course; you always can.”  I adore that last one.  Actually, I do want you to read this book and tell me if I'm crazy about the ending.  Because how can those incredible quotes come from a book that I do not love????...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 07, 2013","Jan 12, 2013","Jan 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10746542-the-sense-of-an-ending

Like this modern day re-telling of Jane Eyre (it can hardly be called an original story), I liked Gemma Hardy well enough.  Gemma follows the same trajectory as Jane: being an orphan, living with a cruel and abusive aunt and cousins, surviving at a cold and unloving boarding school and eventually gaining the position as au pair (updated from governess) when she has nowhere else to go.  I think because Margot Livesey followed Charlotte Bronte's story so closely, I had a very hard time putting this story in a more modern setting.  Words like, ""minivan"" and ""radio"" jolted me from my comfortable victorian imagery and tried to place my thoughts into the author's 20th century.  Sometimes it worked but the farm setting, cold attic bedrooms and stern matrons combined with my memories of a classic made it hard to stay in the 1960s. As much as the author borrowed from the original, she didn't choose to copy the best part: the mad wife  blocking the heroine's path to long-denied happiness as well as the strict moral code that keeps the heroine on her straight path when the temptation to veer of course seems most fair.  In my opinion, Gemma's story is weakened when her guiding light becomes her - her lineage, her opportunity for education, her narrow view of truth - rather than a belief in right and wrong. The redemption she finds is ultimately less satisfying because I never felt like she sacrificed for her prizes.  Suffered, yes.  But there is a different lesson between snatching happiness when available and deserved and trusting it will come from a loving God.  Some would consider that difference archaic and naive, but I noted and missed its absence. Still, the story is interesting and I enjoyed reading it.  Gemma is a fantastic character and the setting in northern Scotland and Iceland, including the unusual names and inclusion of these remote countries' histories, was well done.  The secondary characters faltered, as did the inclusion of more modern issues,  but I kept turning pages to discover the outcomes.  Overall, a decent homage to a better book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 05, 2013","Jan 07, 2013","Jan 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12002819-the-flight-of-gemma-hardy

Without any doubt, Kingsolver is a magnificent writer able to challenge and question perceived tradition and morality with her metaphorical and graceful writing. Unfortunately, she seems to stumble over her own agenda in Flight Behavior  and the effect is a somewhat disjointed and frequently boring story.Dellarobia, who, sadly, is never offered a better nickname, discovers a forest full of Monarch butterflies while walking towards an abandoned mountain dwelling to begin an extramarital affair. The sighting stops her and the remainder of the book deals with the butterflies - why they are in Tennessee and not Mexico where they belong - as well as why she initially wanted to escape from her marriage and if the butterfly discovery, with its subsequent impact on her relationships and family life, changes that fact.I wish Kingsolver had chosen to be more subtle. Her feelings towards climate change as well as ignorant red-necks is unapologetic and judgmental. She developed some interesting characters but only ever allowed Dellarobia (again...that name is so painful to my brain) to change or grow. But her change was so orchestrated and predictable, I felt, that even it wasn't satisfying or helpful.I believe in climate change. I think there is plenty of data and evidence to support those that say the world is warming and, with that warming, uncomfortable changes to all life is inevitable.  What bothered me in this book was her tone used through characters like Ovid that humans and the media and how our sloppy, selfish ways are all to blame. It is more interesting because she takes quite a bit of time explaining the difference between correlation and causation to explain the uncertainty of the butterfly migration but doesn't seem to see its application with climate change itself.The entire book would feel obnoxious in the hands of a less talented author but Kingsolver does manage some excellent story telling in between her preaching. Her descriptions and settings are vivid and intimate and I could see the forest of butterflies as well as stains on her two-year olds clothes. While not from Appalachia, I could see the trucks and the cigarettes and the isolation and the beauty. Like all places, there is a struggle between the old and the new, tradition versus change and stereotypes threatening sincerity. I'm sure a dyed-in-the-wool (that cliche was used on purpose in honor of the wool dying done in the book) environmentalist will love this book. It is their truth. But, in terms of the future of butterflies and certainly the purpose of marriage - it is not mine. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 14, 2012","Mar 18, 2013","Dec 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13438524-flight-behavior

Whatever it is, there was a connection between myself and this book and an almost electric current ran between my hands and its pages while I read. I think it likely due to the fact that this woman, Bernadette, saw the ridiculous all around her. Sure, a cheery person will see Bernadette's point of view as critical and unhelpful, but I felt myself nodding and laughing when she described the overzealousness and competitiveness of school mom volunteers, the futility of cooking and shopping, the absurdity of living in Seattle - from its weather, streets, architecture, hair care, language, diet, style and recreation , the prejudice of loving your own child above all the rest and the simultaneously hilarious and depressing awareness of knowing you are the biggest problem of all. As far as plots go...whatever. I didn't read this to find out what happened to Bernadette the day her husband staged an intervention to commit her to a mental hospital and she disappeared. The plausibility of sneaking onto ships in Antarctica and a fifteen year old solving it all isn't very likely. As far as uplifting material goes...I get that it's dark. Bernadette really is suffering and it's undoubtedly unfair to laugh at/with a woman who on good days hides dirty dishes in drawers and on bad days causes full on mudslides which result in the destruction of her annoying neighbor's house. In spite of my awareness that this book won't be everybody's cup of delicious hot cocoa, I found the satire, writing, pacing, moral, and, above all, character of Bernadette to be the most fun I've read in a while.

The Language of Flowers is a beautiful book. With its imagery I realize no book can do all things but I also think a book can do more than one thing. The Language of Flowers is a beautiful book. With its imagery and description of beautiful flowers, not to mention the inclusion of every noted flower's victorian definition, it's easy to believe in the power of roses,jonquils and even thistles. It's easy to enjoy this story about a broken, abandoned girl who communicates with flowers and begins to discover her own worth and strength by using her talents to help others. Most of me wanted to believe in all of the blossoming magic. But, I didn't. Maybe that's unfair. Victoria is a victim of abandonment, never knowing who her biological parents were or why they left her to the care of the government but her journey through foster families reveals the sometime ugly realities of the system. At times starved, emotionally manipulated, and continually rejected by family after family, Victoria seems a textbook case of someone suffering from attachment disorder. When she is finally placed in the care of a loving woman who wants her and suffers through all of Victoria's attempts at sabotage, her future seems to finally have the possibility of a happy ending. From the very beginning of the story, however, we know something didn't work out. The novel uncovers the unhappy story, chapter by chapter, weaving between her newly independent adult life and the flashbacks through her childhood, mostly during her time with a woman named Elizabeth who teaches her about flowers and wine grapes and life. There is enough realism in the narration that the unrealistic parts of the book distracted me. Who are these secondary characters in Victoria's life that seem too good to be true? Is it possible that someone with as severe emotional problems as Victoria can really function at a job? Or have a relationship with a man? I'm not implying that the author made it easy for Victoria. On the contrary, the author repeatedly highlighted Victoria's difficulty in each of these life developments. Some of the details her moments of despair made my stomach church with sympathy and pain. What was missing was the difficulty of the other characters. Weren't they outraged by her behavior? Weren't they turned off by her appearance, her deception, her almost feral behavior around food? I want to believe that there are people who are blessed with patience in abundance and who are ambassadors to help rehabilitate these poor, love-starved souls and I do believe that they exist. I just want to know about them too. I was disappointed by getting a little bit of Elizabeth's story and motives but never really getting to know her. I never understood her connection to Victoria, a connection that was vital to believing the story. Ultimately, I think the author became a bit too focused on sharing the language of flowers and left out some critical development to the more interesting human story.

The title is beautiful.  It's nuanced and unique and has both symbolic meaning as well as being referenced several times in the story.  The book centers around a fourteen year-old misfit, June, who by any teenage standard is considered weird and whose only after school activity involves donning gunnie-sax dresses and lace-up suede boots while walking around the school woods pretending she lives in medieval times.  Her older sister, Greta, is a golden child.  So smart she skipped a grade.  So talented she's being offered Broadway roles.  June is consistently labeled ""average"" by both teachers and her parents so she revels in the adoration and attention from her uncle Finn and is left devastated by his AIDS related death.  After she discovers that important facts about Finn's life were kept from her, including his boyfriend,Toby, who is blamed by her entire family for Finn's death, she chooses to step out of her comfortable fantasy world and with much confusion and ignorance, begins to see a complicated but not awful reality. There are several toe-the-line YA rules that are followed.  June's parents are absent throughout the book (they are both accountants and most of the story takes place between January and April - tax time) as well as clueless, condescending and wrong.  That is not my favorite thing in a book.  Also, at 14, June seems entirely too free to engage in extremely high risk behavior including meeting a stranger by train, frequently hanging out without permission or notice in New York City, smoking cigarettes and consuming alcohol.  But it all sounds worse than it is.  I feel bad writing that, as if those things aren't big deals, but in this particular story, they aren't the main deal.  They are byproducts of her grief and not a glamorous portrayal of teenagehood. In actuality, this is a story of naivety and innocence and grief and friendship and love. The author makes a point to differentiate between ways of being romantic.  Through her character, Finn, she defends the romantics by defining them as optimists and I like that.  I'm not sure how believable the story is at times.  Lots of times, I thought it was weird, independent of June's own weirdness.  Greta seems contradictory as a character and the pacing is often irritating in its repetitiveness but by the book's end, I felt Brunt justified her writing.  With art and symbolism framing its message of beauty and acceptance, in spite of everything else,Tell The Wolves I'm Home isn't a perfect book but it's a good one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 04, 2012","Nov 04, 2012","Nov 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12875258-tell-the-wolves-i-m-home

Laura Moriarty highlights the tension between generations of women by pairing Cora with Louise for five weeks one summer.  Cora is twenty years older than Louise, wears a corset and skirts that come to her ankle and is in constant bewilderment, awe and worry over Louise's disregard for societal rules. She is of the generation that believes that a young woman traveling to New York on her own needs a chaperone to guard both the reputation and actual virtue of the vulnerable weaker sex. Louise could care less and resents Cora, who is neither a relation nor a friend, and openly mocks Cora when reminded about the rules that have never applied to her.  She freely talks to strange men.  Her clothes don't cover much and, worse, she seems to enjoy all the scandalous attention.  I thought the idea of unveiling the evolution of womens' rights, including the right to vote, birth control and having careers of their own, was interesting but Moriarty lost points, in my view, with her execution.In order to develop her characters, she rightfully weaves in a lot of backstory to both Cora and Louise's views on life.  Through Cora, she tells the history of the orphan trains and how sad, dangerous and incredible it was.  Through Cora's friends and family, she also brings up the taboo gay lifestyle, the Klu Klux Klan, the use of Lysol as a feminine hygiene product/birth control (for real) and sex as a means of intimacy and not solely procreation.  Through Louise's actual history, she includes the heavy topics of alcoholism and drug abuse, pedophilia, promiscuity and mental illness. If it all sounds like too much, you're absolutely right.  These were/are important issues.  Most were, I'm sure, relevant to women of all ages in the 1920s.  But, Moriarty's ambition to deal with all of them in one novel didn't work for me.  To make it all plausible, she had to make both her main characters live on the polar ends of the cultural spectrum.  I thought the story would have played in a more interesting fashion had Cora not been quite so naive or unhappy.  Likewise, although I know Louise had a real history that shouldn't be changed, I felt the question of which lifestyle was more dangerous to women could have been better addressed had she fictionalized a young and ambitious flapper instead.  That way, the side to root for wouldn't have been nearly so obvious, as it rarely is in real life. In spite of the overwhelming amount of propaganda to trudge through, I still thought The Chaperone was a well-written novel and worthy of a book club choice until the last hundred or so pages.  The book should have been about those five weeks Cora and Louise spent together in New York.  Had the author ended her story with the train ride back to Witchita, I would have applauded the way she left Cora's feminist awakening uncertain.  But, she just couldn't leave well enough alone.  Because Louise Brook's history continued, Moriarity decided Cora Carlisle's parallel history needed to be included.  She whizzed through years...decades at a time until both were old and gray.  The abrupt change in both style and pacing was disconcerting.  It ruined the whole book for me.   I thought including what was, in essence, a hundred page epilogue was the wrong choice.  We still managed to have a lively discussion on the range of women's included but we pretty much all agreed that the book ended poorly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 11, 2012","Oct 23, 2012","Oct 11, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13056159-the-chaperone

Life is strumming along for Alice and William and their two children, Zoe, fifteen and Peter, twelve.  Except they all seem so unfriendly, unhelpful and bored.  After a particularly lackluster night out with her husband, Alice decides to take part in an apparent random marriage survey she discovers in her junk email.  She is assigned the identity, ""Wife 22,"" and while giving her written responses, she wakes up her dormant memory of better times, evaluates her values and attitude, dusts off her old playwright writing skills and remembers she is a person worthy of interest.  The question she now faces is does she invest her rekindled  energy towards her twenty year marriage or pursue the researcher who seems so besotted with her. Like I said, parts were tremendously enjoyable.  There is this memory Alice writes about the time her William, who she wasn't yet dating, and her old boyfriend met in line at Au Bon Pain and the situation with her embarrassment over her boyfriend's blue bandana was laugh out loud funny.  But, unfortunately, funny parts can't seem to carry a story and if I remove the humor-filtered glasses, I see a book with many flaws.  Alice is a very weak protagonist.  She is actually hard to root for.  Her husband is not a complete character.  He is whoever the author decides she wants him to be in whichever chapter.  There was never any consistency in how he was written.  Her family life is appalling in both what she expects from people and what she gives.  Her poor kids. The writing switches between traditional narration, survey responses, emails and facebook chats.  I worry for the books longevity as it is so interwoven with Facebook terminology and technology that it will really date itself quickly.  I know this book isn't really meant to be a critical essay on modern marriage or social media so if you read it with the light-heartedness with which, I believe, the author intended, it should serve its purpose as enjoyable, anecdotal middle-aged chick-lit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 09, 2012","Oct 10, 2012","Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12737118-wife-22

Because he used a fable to make his point, I got lost at times in which was more important. Was it better to not pay attention to time? Or did paying attention to time make life more precious because time is finite? I may be thinking too hard about it. Then, when all preaching was said and done, I disagree with him. I do not believe man is the inventor of keeping time. My own beliefs state that God separated the light from the darkness and called His work a day. I also disagree with the idea that that man must die in order to enjoy memories or moments as if the finite quality of earth time is a superior experience over eternity.

I'm not sure what the point of Wild is. Strayed admits herself at the beginning of her trek that she had no real business being on the trail with so little experience and preparation. She makes the claim that hiking is really just putting one foot in front of the other over and over again. So, I thought it might be a sort of cautionary tale that warns other would-be novice hikers that hiking the PCT is about much more than moving your feet. But, she ends up ok. Oh, she has lots of side trips that include shelter, new boots, hamburgers and even a date to a nightclub but her adventure also includes rattlesnake scares, snow, water rationing and equipment failure. And so, even though her hike didn't really resemble what I imagine a pure PCT adventure would or should, perhaps the point is that we tend to over think things and, really, anyone at all can hike the PCT with success. Seriously, after reading the book, you have to think, ""Well...if she did it, so could I."" She's kind of an idiot. Memoirs are hard for me to  because it's not just about the writing. Without a doubt, Wild is an interesting tale. A single woman hiking alone in perilous conditions is just not the kind of thing most of us know anything about. Of course I want to know what happens next. For the most part, the details she included about the trail - it's scenery and topography - were the best part of the book. I wanted to be on the trail myself. But, memoirs always come with baggage. Why is this person writing this? Are they famous or wise? Did they have an extraordinary life or at least an extraordinary experience? I suppose Cheryl Strayed's motive would be an extraordinary experience but she includes enough of her life, as one writing a memoir must do, to taint the take-away message. Cheryl lost her mother when she was in her early twenties. Her mother was only 45. Her loss influences everything else throughout the book. In essence, this is a book about her grief and I acknowledge that there is no proper way to grieve. If someone deals with it all by abusing a loving husband with frequent adultery, shooting up heroin and escaping from a former life by leaving it all behind to go hiking....it is what it is. That's their way. But, there were times when her way of writing about it was so ripe with self-indulgence that her my-mother-died carte blanche got all used up. For instance, there was this sentence early on in the book that just left me reeling. She wrote, ""I got an abortion and learned how to make dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky and took a refresher course on basic first aid and practiced using my water purifier in my kitchen sink."" Just like that. She had gotten pregnant from a heroin-fueled affair and I'm not saying she should have been a mother. I'm not even saying that she owed her readers some kind of explanation about how ending her pregnancy made her feel. She didn't need to reveal her abortion to us at all. What I am saying is that if you are going to mention getting an abortion in your memoir, it'd be best if you didn't include making tuna and turkey jerky in the same sentence. I think the topic of abortion deserves, at the very, very least, its own period. It is not the kind of topic most readers treat lightly. I had a very hard time garnering up sympathy for her after that thoughtless inclusion. Especially upon later discovery about her own mother's unexpected and unwed pregnancy. There was no connecting of the dots. Just Cheryl, Cheryl, Cheryl. I'm glad she learned something. Or found peace. Or forgave herself. Or whatever. She's just another person who doesn't have any bigger troubles than the rest of us and yet the likes of me and Oprah buy her book anyway. She is lining her pockets with our chump change. That is wild. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Sep 13, 2012","Sep 26, 2012","Sep 13, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12262741-wild

Although there is the expected romance and descriptions of how the wealthy live, this is a much grittier novel than I expected.  It is mostly set in pre-war Europe during Hitler's rise to power, when Jews were losing more and more of their rights and the question of their safety was becoming a major concern.  Jews who could afford the exit taxes got visas to leave their homes and countries and some sent their  daughters to work in various jobs in a friendlier England.  In this novel by Natasha Solomons, Elise Landau, an 18 year-old girl born to a famous opera singer and a successful author, who grew up attending fancy parties and servants of her own, leaves her comfortable life to work as a house maid at a large English estate.  Not only does she lack the skills and experience to do well at her new job, but the pride in serving a noble family, not to mention the required humility, are absent too. I think had this really been about the transition between her two very different lifestyles, I would have enjoyed it more.  Instead, in the name of romance, the author focused on her relationship with the rich heir to Tyneford, Kit. The relationship is not completely out of the question as she once was a part of the circle she now serves, but I did not believe it.  She is a jew.  She barely speaks English.  She describes herself as pudgy and plain (don't they all in these books?  And yet, men are always falling in love with them?  I think the rich and noble tend to get the thin and rich, don't you?) The author attempts to paint Elise as rebellious and headstrong and I suppose that could be part of her allure, but because so much of the story depends upon the authenticity of the relationship between her and Kit, the story starts to collapse from the added weight of the war. Still, it is a book I think fans of Downton Abbey will enjoy.  I am a fan of the show and I liked it.  I could imagine very well the small attic room where she slept and the fussy butler not to mention all the rules about serving on the left while simultaneously appearing invisible.  I enjoyed the bit when Elise complains about the rule of never being seen cleaning.  She wonders if the masters of the house are supposed to imagine magic elves doing the work. No ringing endorsements as its neither very fun, very romantic or very important, but it is an interesting look at a time of great change in all the classes of Europe. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 03, 2012","Sep 03, 2012","Sep 03, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11488123-the-house-at-tyneford

Perhaps, because it has freakishly fantastic characters who portray human motives with so much variety and truth. Mostly, because it's unlike anything I've ever read. This has a really big scope. It's a dozen different stories and yet one human story. I could say it's about an Italian man who meets a Hollywood actress in 1962 and goes to America to look for her fifty years later. I could also say it's about a young idealist who comes to realize that nothing in Hollywood is real. At times, it's about a man who was part of The Greatest Generation who never was great. Other times, it's what must be salacious gossip about two dead stars: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and their infamous affair. It's about drug addiction and death and loss of identity and indifference and infidelity and, in spite of all that seriousness, has real humor and love added in.

Unfortunately, because of his scrawny build and small-town Wisconsin isolation, no one notices. Until Mike Schwartz, Westish College's team captain and catcher steps in sets Henry on the path to baseball stardom. The Art of Fielding is mostly about the relationship and motives of these two college baseball players but Chad Harbach decides to go for what he must have considered a grand slam and ruin a sweet home run by throwing Guert Affenlight, Westish College's Dean, and his depressed daughter, Pella into the character lineup. It's been awhile since I've read something that disappointed me so much. Books often have stronger beginnings than ends but Harbach's early plot development and delightfully nuanced characters fell short more than most. What I thought was going to be a subtle metaphor between baseball and life turned into a nauseating, immoral and overwrought drama. Characters who had flaws suddenly become one giant flaw. Everything was overdone. And then he tries to resolve the whole mess at once! Bah!It had so much potential. This book about fielding baseballs-both literal and metaphorical, was such a nice masculine book and after my somewhat heavy-on-the-chick-lit summer, I felt some balance return reading about muscle building protein shakes and road trips via bus. As a woman, I've been told that men don't like to analyze problems, they like to fix them and if that is true, then Harbach needs to fix this book. First problem: too much book incest. These people need to get out of themselves more. You have Henry and Mike and Owen and Guert and Pella and they are all sleeping with each other! It is icky. I know it's a small college and all but it's a fatal flaw.The first problem directly leads to the second problem. Because these five peoples are impossibly up in each others business, all of their problems reach a ridiculous climax at the same time. Really? How convenient for your story. The last problem is the most annoying. The end. It is so bad. You are seriously going to end your story by a feel-good group grave digging? Oh. My. Word.

It's an odd book.  Maybe it's Hoffman's style but the narration is unusually distant.  It reads as if ghosts are retelling their doomed story but that's not wholly accurate.  There is a methodical, almost hypnotizing rhythm to it.  It's filled with foreshadowing as whichever of the four narrators clearly already knows both the outcome and the reason for sharing any particular detail, and that sense of foreboding kind of feels ghoulish.  But, not scary.  It's not even that suspenseful as the outcome is pretty obvious if you know the history at all, which was first recorded by Josephus who claims that only two women and five children survived.  Hoffman sticks with that accounting but obviously fictionalizes the details. Apart from being a story about Masada, it is also a story about ancient feminism.  I don't know how true this is.  History has been mostly written and kept by men so the motivations, fears and desires of women can only be applied from general truths.  They must have loved.  They must have felt passion.  They must have shown great courage and strength and protection for those they nurtured when necessary.  As a woman, I know these traits could not have come only from more recent freedoms.   Freedom helps but it is who we are.

I don't watch many movies and even fewer R rated movies but it was the kind of weekend where I really, really wanted to have movie theater popcorn and diet-coke and so I looked at Rotten Tomatoes website and it was either the 12% stinky trash Taken 2 or the 95% good looking tomato Looper. Looper sounded like an interesting premise - mobs murdering their hits by sending them 30 years in the past through time travel - and somebody from the Tony Kornheiser show recommended it, securing Jay's vote, so we went hoping the R rated parts weren't going to be too awful. Turns out, they were. I hated all of the blood and guts. And the drugs. And the promiscuity (This wasn't The King's Speech kind of R-rating). Gross. And although the story WAS interesting, it wasn't nearly worthy of its 95% ripe and red tomatoes.. The time-traveling moral of the story is if you can personally change the future for the better, you should do it. I'm not sure it's the cloud parting, angel singing epiphany the movie critics seem to think it is but I think that's where the good ratings are coming from. Then, two days ago, I pick up The Good Dream and read about a single thirty year-old woman named Ivorie, in a small Tennessee farming community who causes a stir in her sleepy town when she rescues and cares for an abused 8 year-old boy and changes his future. I thought, ""This is Looper without the mob and strip clubs and drugs!"" It's a PG, 1950s, small-town non-time-traveling Looper!Ivorie's brother, Henry, says this to his wife in reference to his sister, ""It doesn't matter what sort of hate that boy's daddy was eaten up with. All that was broken the moment Sarah (he is the only person that calls her Sarah. Her name is Sarah Ivorie) went up in those hills with God Almighty filling her chest and she brought him down out of there....Love's in that boy's bloodline now. For a thousand generations....Not bad for a day's work."" He even goes on to say that he's not chasing rainbows and knows about the rough rows to hoe up ahead. Some readers take issue with the boy not being more emotionally damaged than the author portrays him to be in this story. I don't know. I'm not an expert. I certainly image anyone who is subjected to the kind of physical, emotional and sexual abuse this boy is described as enduring would face many life challenges in his future but I don't think the book ties a bow around these two characters and declares them finished. I think the author is saying in a more-palatable-to-me-than-Looper-way, ""Do the right thing."" Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.

As the story progressed and their conditions became more severe, I grimly thought that the author was  making a morbid reference to the characters' skin tones as they became sicker and sicker from malnutrition, exhaustion and disease.  Or, less grotesque, there was an early description of Lina wearing a pretty grey dress during a happier time that brought out the color of her eyes that I reasoned might have been mentioned to foreshadow another shade of gray later on creating a contrast of the two time periods.  Between Shades of Gray is a book about what happened to the Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and Finns during Stalin's rule.  As the author, Ruta Sepetys, predicted, I had little knowledge of the specific sufferings felt by these exiled people.  Caught between Hitler advancing armies in 1941 and the Soviet Union's own expanding empire, the citizens of these small countries were without allies or voice and their stories were left largely untold until their re-independence in the 1990s.  Sepetys was correct in assuming that their stories of survival, heartache, despair and love need to be told.  I'm grateful she has given a voice to these histories and glad that her book is doing well, even better because of a similarly titled book. I did have my disappointments.  By far the largest disappointment was needing to be told the point of the title.  I'm not going to give it away here, but should any of my above theories as to the meaning of the title show up on some kind of multiple choice exam in the future, choose D: none of the above. When the author revealed what she meant by ""Between Shades of Gray,"" I wasn't wowed.  In fact, I was a little more like, ""Well...obviously.""  That is true of all history and every story.  It bugged me that she felt like she was making this breakthrough announcement.   I also have to mention that the writing is quite juvenile with short simple sentences and a lot of guiding and telling how the characters felt. While her characters do feel genuine and there is a satisfying variety in their responses to depravity, they are mostly boxed into one identifying emotion.  A few of the main characters were allowed more than one but the additional responses were often related. Lina was angry but determined.  Her mother was kind and  generous.  The bald man was mean and scared.Nevertheless, this is a good book.  It exposes important morality that forces thought and judgment.  How do some survive the very worst kinds of suffering?  How would I choose to be in a situation like this?  Why is the world so cruel sometimes? Knowing that most of the situations throughout her novel are based on memories of real life survivors, any writing flaw or deficiency easily takes a back seat to its truth.  More than that, the take away message of love and hope overpowering despair and darkness is a message I hope all will be motivated to read.  Recommended!...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 17, 2012","Aug 23, 2012","Jul 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7824322-between-shades-of-gray

Oh, sure, I'mReady Player One has an element I normally find lacking when reading dystopian novels with an emphasis in science-fiction: plausibility. Oh, sure, I'm usually scared right out of my pants about the possibility of living in many of the worlds many authors describe, but, at the end of it all, I rarely have the thought, ""This could happen. Soon."" Ernest Cline and his thorough description of a virtual world not only influencing but actually taking over our flesh and blood reality in 2044 seemed not only possible but...well...likely.That doesn't mean that I subscribe to his doomsday forecast completely. Cline creates a world so depleted of natural resources and innovation that the only progress made since our current 2012 existence happens online. That world, with individual visors and hepatic clothing designed for full virtual immersion as well as altered online personas doing everything from working lame jobs and going to school to battling demons and traveling via some majorly souped up space ships, is so preferable to anyone's real life that no one bothers with ""actual"" relationships anymore. Heck, no one bothers with actual furniture anymore. All anyone really needs is a room with a bathroom, someway to heat pre-packaged food up and, of course, a strong connection to the web. For what seems to be pure entertainment value, or perhaps his own personal satisfaction, Cline chooses to include a lot of 1980s references. There were times I really enjoyed his mentioning of a band, TV show, clothing trend or, more likely, video game that was popular during my youth. It successfully induced nostalgia and gave the book some legitimate cool retro vibes. However, much more often, I was distracted by the tangent a description of a game or character or quote took me on and eventually annoyed by the extra work it took to keep my focus on what was really happening in the novel: a pure good versus evil/little guy up against a giant/rebel army fighting a Darth Vader empowered empire fight for the future of mankind. If you're into that sort of thing, you'll like this book. But you might be surprised by the hero.Wade Watts is the ultimate loser. Overweight, poor and acne prone, he has no advantages in life and everything going against him including living with a meth addicted aunt who charges him rent to live in the laundry room of her decrepit trailer. He is, however, very good at video games. When James Halliday (think Steve Jobs-esque), the person who created the virtual world called ""Oasis,"" dies, he announces via video that he is leaving everything - all his money and all his rights and control to Oasis - to whomever can find his hidden ""egg"" in the virtual world that consists of multiple planets and universes. Every geek with online access is searching for clues but Wade, who has spent most of his life in Oasis, sees his avatar name, Parzival, as the top scorer when he solves the riddle, gaming challenge and test of 80s knowledge (he has to recite Matthew Broderick's entire dialogue from the movie ""War Games"") to open the first of three gates. Overnight, Wade is thrown into a dangerous spotlight with very real-life consequences. Besides the bigger issues Cline presents, such as energy abuse and impotent governments, not to mention a free to the masses World Wide Web, there are lots of juicy ideas to reflect upon. As someone who has not only made but enjoyed many online friendships throughout the years, I especially appreciated the debate between Wade and his love-interest, Artemis, about whether these count as real relationships or not. Really thought provoking book with great characters, anxiety causing action sequences, satisfying principles and, more often than not, entertaining 80s humor.

It is found in the firsThere is a scene in Stephanie Nielson's memoir, Heaven Is Here, that has stayed with me these past few months since I read it. It is found in the first third of the book, where Nielson, or Nie Nie, as she is commonly known, writes about how much she loved to clean her family house while growing up. She recalls her tendency to routinely fluff the pillows on the chairs and sofa to make everything look nice. She then describes, and this is what fascinated me, how, afterward, she went outside and pretended to be someone walking along the sidewalk in front of her home. She looked through the window and thought, ""A nice family must live here."" It's both charming and creepy all at once but the inclusion of this seemingly insignificant anecdote felt like the big ""Ah-ha!"" for me. For the rest of the book, I realized I was on the sidewalk looking through the windows of her living room. You see, I never understood the appeal of her blog. Even before Stephanie and her husband's airplane crash, I found her colorful blog with its courier font and middle alignment hard to digest. I loved her sister's blog with her wit and irreverent but soul-baring posts and occasionally clicked over to Stephanie's blog from it but I wasn't interested in drinking distilled water or eating a vegetarian diet so while I applauded her happy marriage and love of motherhood, I never felt inspired by the life she presented on her blog. Moreover, she isn't a great writer. I'm not saying that to be critical of her life but because a blog is based on the written word and a book even more so, I think the ability to write well matters. If I'm going to look through into someone's home, I have always been more interested in the conversation between the people sitting on the sofa than the sofa's design or the colors and patterns of its accent pillows.Thankfully, she had help writing her book. Gone are the frequent grammatical errors from her blog and she and her family are presented in a fluid and accessible way. As she developed her personal story in the first third of the book, I understood her candid and unapologetic aspirations to be a wife and mother. I think she was right in laying out her case that way because her youthful goals were so different from mine and it helped me understand an additional layer of devastation that came after the crash. The middle section, about the crash is almost detailed enough. I'm not sure if it's morbid fascination with her survival of something so nightmarish but I wanted to know everything she knew about the crash and that was not to be. She shared a little bit about being in the plane before it went down, about being aware of her husband and his instructor's apparent stress but it wasn't until the end of the book that I realized I still didn't know how the crash actually happened. Something in the plane malfunctioned but what? Why? How? As much as I wish I knew those details, I recognize that Stephanie's book is about her personal journey and not just a chronological telling of events. Whether the crash occurred because of the plane's malfunction or pilot error isn't what Stephanie chooses to write about. I get it. I was glad she allowed the curtains on her window to stay open while the inside was uncomfortably messy. She went to a really dark place following her medically-induced coma and struggled with the will to survive. As she couldn't imagine ever being able to make her life beautiful again, she truly wondered what purpose on earth she would ever have again. I cheered for her breakthroughs and her spirit discovering the beauty she had within. It is very inspiring and life affirming. I appreciate the end of the book when she questions the title of her book. It was suggested to her by her editor and she explains how she had to be persuaded to use it and even believe it. All while reading, I wondered at the title. It was pretty clear that heaven was NOT here as Stephanie had more than one close encounter with it while she was spiritually elsewhere. Her defense and use of the title felt necessary to me. Critiquing a memoir is kind of a risky endeavor. As a book devoted to sharing parts of a life, it's hard to separate the person from the writing. In this case, I think the book is successful. It tells a unique and incredible story. As a book to read, it is fine. While I still care very little about her pretty living room, this book brought me the conversation within and I left thinking, ""A nice family really does live there.""...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 26, 2012","Jul 07, 2012","Apr 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11922297-heaven-is-here

Palacio, I have decided that I will always, always, always err on the side of kindness...cold food and all. You see, this is an excellent book.  It is about kindness.  It is a book I think everyone should read.  It is a book I gave to my seventh grader immediately after finishing and said, ""Please read this,"" and hoped and wished he would and not ignore it like he does with some of my suggestions.  He did and he loved it too.  We have had some great conversations about it since and I learned some things about him when we discussed the various characters. Good books do that.  They teach and inspire and warn and rebuke.  I felt all of those things as I read about a nice young man with a facial deformity that made him an outcast at school and in life.  I read about his fears and about his courage.  I read about how people treated him.  Once, in a moment of real confusion and questioning, I asked my mom what God could possibly have intended in his plan for people who suffered from debilitating mental illness.  I will always remember her response.  She said, ""I think, in large part, they suffer so he can judge how we treat them."" Here is a quote from the book: “If every person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place.

Short, curt sentences. Bleak. Unemotional. Plus, there was a lot of formal spanish dialogue. Reading about Hemingway was much simpler and more my cup of tea. I know novels are never as accurate as biographies or wikipedia articles (joke) but their delivery is so much more palatable, in my opinion. Novels that aren’t written by Hemingway, that is. The Paris wife is a novelized account of Ernest Hemingway’s first wife, Hadley, and the years they lived in Paris before and during his rise to literature stardom. I found Hadley and Ernest Hemingway and their relationship as depicted in The Paris Wife to be quite believable. They felt like whole people to me. Both were flawed, Ernest far more so, but as we were told the story through Hadley’s perspective, it felt right to see her as more of the victim of an ambitious and selfish man. What a time period! I admit, I watched Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris” and barely enjoyed it. Not knowing any of the legends depicted except the most famous (Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Dali, Porter), I didn’t finish that movie with a sense that life in Paris during the 20s was all that spectacular. This book both confirmed and corrected my attitude. Paris was filled with what would become the all-stars of American Literature. It was an interesting time in an interesting place. The Great War, World War I, had recently ended. Many of those living in Paris either fought in the war or witnessed its atrocities. The world was recovering from what probably nobody thought could have ever happened. So much death. So much destruction. So little reason. Thus, the free and lose values of these young and provocative artists created an atmosphere almost akin to the Renaissance. It was another rebirth. The rebirth came at a cost, however. Drugs, sexual promiscuity and an enlarged sense of lassez-faire may have created epic works of art and timeless literature, but it ripped away any kind of foundation for family life. Hadley Hemingway learned this the humiliating and painful way as her husband’s ego and success grew. What detracted from the book were the rushed histories on both ends of the main story. Hadley’s childhood, while certainly necessary to understand her character, felt one-dimensional. Her younger self barely looked like her married self. Likewise, the tidying up at the end with both her and Ernests’s later histories satisfied some curiosity but, again, didn’t match up. I ended up reading wikipedia to get more explanation. :) An interesting story of marriage, however.

I was sure Edenbrooke, where a young lady named Marianne Daventry is invited to visit the title's namesake estate with her twin sister and become entangled in the inevitable drama of suitors and advantageous marriages, would not be my thing.I was totally wrong. I found this book to be absolutely delightful.So delightful, in fact, that I read it again the very next day. I had heard from other admirers that it reminded them of Pride and Prejudice and I knew that didn't feel right to me. Still, I loved it and wanted to know why the romantic tension felt so familiar and interesting if it wasn't for its resemblance to Austen's beloved romance between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.I think it has more in common with some John Hughes films like ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" or the relationship between Jim and Pam in the early days of ""The Office"" than the buttoned up courtship of actual 19th century fictional figures. Not that this has much unbuttoning. It is very PG and refreshingly clean. And I don't mean that Edenbrooke's plot follows the same storyline as either of the above fictional romances.  They evoke similar feelings.  All three involve a seemingly insurmountable obstacle in the mind of one of the characters that prevents them from being with the person they really, really want to be with.   Just like The Office was better before Jim and Pam got together, romantic tension in this form is enjoyable to me. When it releases, with declarations and understanding, I find it all very satisfying. More stories should follow this formula! It's definitely my kind of thing:)The ensuing story includes lots of flirting, a bit too many mentions of Marianne blushing for my liking but, oh well, and some predictable conflicts when her more glamorous sister is determined to have the guy Marianne wants (but will never admit wanting) as well as some surprising action involving guns and kidnapping.  There is a letter writing scene that I read over at least five times!  Swoon!  Marianne is an every-day woman's heroine.  Pretty in a non-obvious way and better known for her wit, selflessness and love of nature, she can live a more genuine life as she has no aspirations to belong to the fast and beautiful crowd, unlike her not-identical twin sister. Of course, that kind of realness only makes her become more attractive to those who get to know her and when they do, they can't help but fall in love with her,  the beautiful people included. I don't know how realistic that is, but being of average attractiveness myself, I loved the possibility.I understand the comparison to Pride and Prejudice.  Although the plot points are quite different, the author places her story in the same time and setting and includes many of the same supporting characters: snobby rivals made worse by their jealousy, a villain disguised as a gentleman and a loving but distracted and absent father.  Additionally, there are the same sorts of rules and obstacles to overcome in regard to marriage, money and titles although the characters seem a lot closer to having our 21st century sensibilities than the class and gender restricting ones they would have actually had. There are also several scenes straight out of Pride and Prejudice. There is a reversed and much more funny wet-from-the-pond scene.  There is also some passionate practice fencing to rid a certain gentleman of his romantic frustration.  And you can't forget the balls.  It wouldn't be a period romance without the descriptions of balls and smoldering glances. All of this is fine and good but what really connected me to the story was the story of friendship.  Simplified, yes, but it was so nice to read about a budding romance that was based much less on physical attraction and more on common goals and values, interest in the other person's talents and abilities and, super cheesy here, wholesome recreational activities.  I actually believed that these characters could and did fall in love.  So fun.  Probably my favorite book of the summer. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 14, 2012","Aug 20, 2012","Apr 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12820360-edenbrooke

Its timeframe spans decades and although the story unfolds The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom is what I think fits under the definition of a saga. Its timeframe spans decades and although the story unfolds with two alternating first person narratives, Lavinia and Belle, there are many more characters in whom the author invests and in whom the readers come to care about. Set in post-Revolutionary War colonial Virginia, Lavinia, a young, white, Irish indentured servant, is brought to work on a tobacco plantation's kitchen house among the house slaves. Lavinia has been orphaned and takes comfort in clinging to Belle, a mixed race slave who also happens to be the biological daughter of the owner of the plantation, Captain Pike, and whose light skin looks the most like hers. As the story progresses and Lavinia matures into a young woman, her role on the plantation changes and her loyalty to the only family she can remember as well as her belief that these slaves are her equals is pushed to dangerous limits. It is a compelling read, especially the first half when Lavinia is young and bonding with her adopted family. I’ll be the first to admit that the conflict, the history and the limitations of both the slaves and women in defending themselves and standing up against tyranny had me on edge and rooting for what my twenty-first century sensibilities know are worthy causes. In spite of my interest and enthusiasm to know what happened next, this novel suffers from several flaws.First, I absolutely loathed all of the misunderstanding. Things not spoken, things misinterpreted, things covered up all contribute to much grossly unfair consequences. I believe a good story can be built upon the foundation of what happens from the consquences of a misunderstanding, for instance, Ian McEwan’s Atonement. However, the author’s repeated use of her characters hearing partial conversations or the assumptions made about unexplained relationships was more along the lines of what the old sitcom, Three’s Company, did in many of its episodes except tragedy, rather than comedy, being the end result. One misunderstanding I could have handled. For example, Marshall, the eldest son of Captain Pike, hates Belle because he believes his father spends time with her and gives her gifts from his travels because she is his mistress. He does not know that Belle is, in fact, his half sister. The Captain’s wife, Mary, also believes this and an ugly need for vengeance takes hold of Marshall that fuels his many transgressions. That brings me to Marshall, my second grievance. Marshall had a bad childhood. Even with the privilege of being white and wealthy, we are allowed to witness his confusion and sorrow as he is neglected by both of his parents, abused by his tutor and saved several times by the very slaves he eventually persecutes. I think the author was trying to make him a rounded character by making us privy to his difficulties but to them make him so uniformly evil in the end felt like a mischaracterization. I wanted him to want redemption. I wanted him to find it. That was not his role to play. Likewise, Lavinia morphs into several unmatched characters throughout the book. From a scared mute to a confident, educated and compassionate girl who later becomes an eager to please teenager and eventually a weak and terrified drug addicted adult. I’m not saying that couldn’t be someone’s life story, it was just a lot of changes to a character within one book. Plus, the narration was usually told with a hindsight perspective so I did not understand why she always seemed so different. Shouldn’t the use of perspective give some continuity to her voice?I loved Mama May, George, Ben, Fanny and Beatie (not sure about the spelling of those names because I listened to rather than read this book) but...I was supposed to. These are the stereotypical “good” slaves. Of course, slaves were quite capable of being good and patient and kind and thoughtful because those qualities are human and, even though they bore the weight of the injustice of being owned and mistreated, they were and always have been human and likely to be likable. I wished we could have been trusted to know their flaws as well. Sure, we saw some fear and sadness when things got really bad but no other weakness was allowed. It frustrated me because I still would have rooted for them even had one of them been depicted as lazy or shallow or unkind or selfish. It was as if Grissom devoted the book to show us how human slaves were without letting them be human. Finally, I loved and hated all of the romantic and sexual drama. The narration often hurried up to the point of the story where people were falling in love, in love, in lust or jealous about others falling in love, in lust or being in love. In short, I think this is historical fiction for women. Even with the messiness of slavery and farm work, I can’t see a man really liking this book. I could be wrong. Maybe there are men who are drawn into the workings of a kitchen house and all the fuss between men and women but I suspect all of the childbearing, nursing, and repeated rape and attempted rape might make them squirm. Because I am a woman, I found it all fascinating and horrible. Even with the many things that irritated me, I still appreciate the scope of the book. It examines the nature of freedom and the various things that enslave us: disease, addiction, fear...even perverted forms of love. It highlights the wonders of kindness and generosity which stood in stunning contrast to the wickedness and corruption. In addition, if it makes anyone more aware of the stain of slavery in American history, then it gets points for that....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2012","Apr 03, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6837103-the-kitchen-house

Of course, I’ve also watched Downton Abbey but I have a sneaky suspicious watching solders convalesce on the estate of a british aristocrat isn’t the everyman’s story of the war. Three Day Road probably isn’t either but I did get an unflinching look at the brutality of living, fighting and dying in the trenches. By reading, I got a glimpse of the unrelenting snails pace of progress or defeat. I learned what kind of provisions the lowly privates of the war had provided and the kind of artillery and strategy used by those hunting down Fritz. It was all very interesting and depressing. What sets Three Day Road apart from other dreary war books is the point of view of the narrators - both Native Americans. One is young Xavier, who enlists with his childhood friend, Elijah, both given Christian names by nuns trying to unheathenize them in Eastern Canada. Xavier and Elijah are excellent soldiers due to their lifetime spent hunting. They are selected as snipers and commanded to go out on midnight attacks, hunting their new prey - Germans. Xavier struggles with the cause and the brutality. As he narrates from the first person, I could feel his reluctance, his fear as well as his confusion about wanting to do well when doing well meant killing. Elijah, on the other hand, enjoys his success and becomes lost to sanity after killing hundreds and becoming addicted to morphine. How their friendship and loyalty plays out is a major theme of the book.The other narrator is Niska, Xaviers aunt, who continues to live as her ancestors did: hunting and roaming for shelter as a nomad. She is also perceived by her tribe to have special powers and visions that come to her when she has what appears to be epileptic seizures.

If you like reading in the first person narrative, you will like this book. If you like tidy endings, you will hate this book. William Landay, a former prosecutor, shows off his lawyering chops in this very compelling legal drama about an first assistant district attorney, Andy Barber, assigned to prosecute a murder case only to be pulled of it when his son, Jacob, becomes the prime suspect. I know John Grisham kind of ruined the legitimacy of legal fiction with his formalistic and over-the-top plots but Landay gives the genre an authentic and gritty reality without involving the mob, the CIA, the supreme court or Washington DC. Instead, he sets his court in suburban Massachusetts where murder crimes are nonexistent and the victim and suspect are teenage boys. Moreover, he deliberately highlights the impotency, flaws and tricks of the legal system from both a prosecutor’s and defense council’s standpoint. Some are depressing, others shocking and, more often than not, rather mundane. I especially appreciated the view from the defense side of things, getting Andy’s point of view with the understanding of his extreme familial bias. Knowing the game of law, he walks us through his narration deliberately with a sometime-in-the-future-looking-back hindsight. The foreshadowing seems to give away certain outcomes but you still are forced to wonder. Things aren’t so clear to his wife and mother of the defendant, Laurie. As we only get Andy’s perspective, we only see Laurie and Jacob through his opinion and he clearly loves his wife and son. But, he does not understand her suffering or her doubts and he certainly lacks the necessary impartiality to accurately see the state’s case against his son. Andy just defends Jacob as he deems best. Two things I very much enjoyed in this book were Landay’s weaving a court transcript throughout the book and his unabashed accuracy in how teenagers speak. The court transcript felt like short but interesting intermissions from Andy’s story. It was the only time we read something that Andy Barber wasn’t controlling. It was refreshing but never long enough or distracting enough to pull you completely out of Andy’s fog. It just let me catch my breath a bit and wonder what was going on. And, so often, dialogue in books is written in a way that, while interesting to read, sounds like no one I know. Landay’s teenagers sound like teenagers. It’s not a very uplifting subject matter, thinking about murder and teenage murder at that, but Andy’s background, his discipline and his resolute determination to defend his son will make readers question how well we can really know another person, including our children, and the prejudices we undeniably have towards others....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Apr 2012,"Apr 04, 2012","Apr 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11367726-defending-jacob

I was twitter pated through page two hundred, at least. Then, I noticed the navel gazing. By naval gazing, I mean that I became aware of the author’s probable vanity. His delightful main characters, Hazel and Augustus, are so esteemed in each others eyes. Although both teenagers suffer from cancer, they make up in wit and comeback lines from anything they suffer in terms of health. Everything they like, from authors to friends to music to food, seemed so, so smart. And they keep talking about it - how smart the other is. Their favorite fictional author, Peter Van Houten, plays a large role in the book and he is equally smart. Mean and drunk, but smart. Each of their sidekicks, though one is angrily blind and the other blissfully unaffected by life are hyper quick with fabulous diversions. Indeed, they are all very, very smart. Understand, I don’t mean book smart, though that element is there. I mean confident and thoughtful with themselves and others in that irreverent, brash, Gilmore Girl meets Ally McBeal kind of way (I realize this is a YA book and those two shows might be too old for the intended audience's to actually reference). John Green wrote them all this way. And just like witnessing the self adoration in the mirror, I thought, “I think John Green must think of himself as awfully smart and funny.” Still, I’m on this amazing date with a hottie.

Set in Alaska homesteading period of the 1920s, Jack and Mabel seem a poor fit for survival in the extreme conditions that surround them. Already approaching their twilight years, Jack lacks the strength to establish a producing farm on his own and Mabel struggles with loneliness and depression from a past miscarriage and subsequent infertility. Then, on a night when the winter snow begins to fall, Jack and Mabel have their first lighthearted moment in a long time thanks to their welcoming neighbors, Esther and George, and upon returning home, spontaneously play in the snow and build a showgirl. Mabel decorates it with a coat and mittens and Jack carves a beautiful lifelike face onto the snow statue. During the night, Jack wakes and sees their snow girl destroyed and what he thinks is a real girl wearing the coat and mittens they used to decorate their snowy creation earlier frolicking about his yard. The mystery of who the girl is, if she’s real or a creation of grief and cabin fever fills out the rest of the story.What’s fun about this book is the fable within a fable. The Snow Child introduces an unknown-to-me Russian story, Snegurochka or The Snow Maiden, and it is used as both foreshadowing and as a parallel with Mabel and Jack’s snow girl. The author is very adept at subtly shifting between their harsh reality of needing food and warmth and human contact and the enigmatic existence of Faina, the snow child. For instance, whenever Jack and Mabel are talking to or about Faina, Ivey leaves out traditional punctuation. No quotation marks or commas. The words seem more like thoughts than anything spoken aloud. The other conversations throughout the book are framed with quotation marks so it is deliberate and effective. Are those conversations real? I also appreciated the author’s ability to convey depth of emotion - both lighthearted joy and gut wrenching despair. I felt proud of Mabel when she successfully planted potatoes and mad at Jack when he didn’t comfort his lonely wife. Likewise, I cheered when Jack got a bull moose and wanted to shush Mabel when she pestered Jack. So much truth about marriage here - both the committed and romantic love but also the disappointment and grudges that are hard to let go. I also loved how the author showcased the need and purpose of friends and human interaction. We need it more than we think we do. It lifts our souls to connect with others. The part of the book that failed for me was the snow child herself. I never connected to her. I think we were supposed to, much like Jack and Mabel did, but her aloofness and ambiguity prevented her from being anything more than a “thing” in their life, and I never felt concern for her outcome. This confuses me because the way the book ends, I assume we are supposed to care very much. Which brings me to the ending. I don’t think I got it. I read a library’s copy and have since returned it but I wish I could reread the last chapter or two because I think what I thought happened may never have happened at all.

Art Breen, a Catholic priest, has been accused of molesting a young boy. His family members - a devout mother, sympathetic sister and estranged brother, all react to the news quite differently. The author employs a powerful plot tool in forcing the reader to also examine our own faith or doubt, not in catholoisism, but in mankind by keeping the truth covered until the very end. The narration is also very, very interesting. It's written from the sister's point of view but she writes it as the recounted memories and an unfolding expose of those she interviews and knows so, oftentimes, each character - her mother, Mary, her accused brother, Art, and her brother, Mike, are all known much more intimately than as often depicted when seen through another's eyes. She also frequently leaves the present situation to add understanding with a backstory or memory. It's complicated and murky and I really enjoyed it. For such an icky topic, it's not an icky book. There is quite a bit of language as it is set in working class Boston and those inhabitants are fond of the F-bomb, but each character is so well developed that you are able to sympathize and celebrate with their various flaws and triumphs. Above all, you see how there is no such thing as simple faith. Our experiences and choices make us who we are and influence what we believe, even if who we are is not how we appear to others and what we believe is not how we live. Interesting and haunting, I'll be thinking about this book for days....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2012","Mar 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9592213-faith

Turns out, I really enjoyed reading this.  Erin Mortgenstern writes about an elegant and magical circus; the kind of circus, should it actually exist, that I would love to attend.  The Night Circus, or Le Cirque des Reves (which actually translated means Circus of dreams but that's being nitpicky) arrives without any kind of warning in cities throughout the world.  It opens its gates at nightfall and closes at dawn.  No one knows how long it will stay or how it moves from place to place.  Its exhibits, which range from tranquil ice gardens that never melt to carousels featuring painted animals that breathe, would certainly be fascinating to visit.  I identified with the fictitious Reveurs, an enthusiastic fan club whose members follow the circus from city to city and don black and white garb as well as some kind of red accessory, to identify themselves to each other.  In addition to the bewitching description, an odd cast of characters are introduced from contortionists and clock makers to an orphan boy and temperamental girl bound to each in their youth with magical rings that burn and scar their fingers.  All this mystique and curiosity cast its magical spell upon me while reading but by the book's end, my ""ooh""s and ""ahh""s were replaced with a great big,""huh?""There is a part of the story where a young boy named Bailey is dared by his sister and her friends to sneak into the night circus during the day and return with some kind of proof of his success.  He manages to slip through the gate and get close to the black and white tents, but as he passes through, he notes how drab and tired the fabric looks under the glare of day.  That is exactly how I felt when I snapped out of my reading reverie. Although Mortgenstern did a beautiful job of entrancing her readers by including a mysterious challenge with deadly consequences, shadowy characters with abnormal abilities and the promise of romance throughout, she forgot to include some critical ingredients for a great book such as relevant details about the circus acts themselves (I knew more about the scent, shape and color of the food at the circus than the performances of the main characters) and, in my opinion, an actual conflict.  The one she promised was developing went poof...like magic...at the end.  Unfortunately, I don't like that kind of magic. Even though my daylight eyes sees these unfortunate flaws, I had a lot of fun experiencing this book in the moment.  I suggest you read it at night....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 29, 2012","Mar 18, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus

After finishing it two days ago and dismissing it as nothing more than a romantic fable, time and discussion with my mother have made it uncomfortably clear that I didn't appreciate this story for what it is: a juxtaposition between eastern and western thought and the probability of an alternate reality. In spite of those complicated layers, it IS also a romantic fable. Tin Win is a poor boy in Burma, forced to accept the fate the astrologers gave him on the day of his unlucky birth. Through acceptance and humility, he enjoys a peaceful and satisfying life of education from a Buddist monk and is surprised by the unfamiliar joy he feels when he falls in love with a local cripple, Mi Mi. While certainly no expert, I would guess it falls at least partially into the magical realism genre with the unbelievable happenings and quite fantastical plot development.However, as the story unfolds via story telling from an easterner to a cyncical westerner, Tin Win's New york daughter (you'll have to read the book to unravel the mystery of how Tin Win became a New Yorker), the reader is unknowingly exposed to his or her own bias. I am thoroughly western. I could scarcely believe anybody could think and act the way the Burmese people did in this story. My mother, who lived in Myanmar (Burma) for nearly two years assures me that there is indeed a great difference. So, I can say there is no way this story could happen, that it is fantasy, but perhaps I am seeing only with my eyes (again, you'll understand that reference if you read the book).

I’ve been muddling through books for what seems like years, liking some well enough and recognizing some that deserve to be categorized as amazing (i.e. Unbroken) but, it’s been a long while since I’ve picked up a book that I didn’t want to put down. It seems even longer than that when the book also qualifies as great.Even so, I’m nervous giving this an “amazing” rating but...I’m going to! Because, I loved it. It’s easy to read and funny and sad and unusual and interesting and thought provoking and exactly what I felt like reading. I read a translation from the original French and there were only a few times when it really felt like a translation. The rest of the time, I felt like the english language was used perfectly. As a brief plot summary, Natalie, a beautiful French woman marries the perfect man for her who then dies. The rest of the book deals with how she moves on and how others treat her.

Foenkinos takes each meaning of the word and layers his story with various situations requiring one or more of the definitions. It is perfectly titled - one of my very favorite things in literature. I almost feel annoyed when I read other s or, worse, the book jacket and it is simplified as a sweet romance. Because it’s really about how and why people feel and think and do. It just also happens to be sweet. Such a pleasure to read. I guess a movie is coming out as an adaptation of this book soon. I have no idea how that will work because, in my opinion, this book’s strength is not its plot or even its characters. It’s beauty is in the unspoken thought, reaction or motivation. How they’ll translate that into a screenplay is beyond me. Maybe it’ll work.

I had no idea.John Le Carre is the pen name for David John Moore Cornwell, who, for a brief period of his life, was an actual British spy, keyword being British. I was clueless from the get go about his use of British spy vernacular . Terms like scalphunter, the circus, lamplighter, babysitters, and ferrets were unabashedly dropped and Le Carre wasn’t going to explain any of it. He expected the reader to figure it out.I appreciate his confidence in the learning curve of his readers but if felt a bit like going to a Star Trek convention armed only with knowledge of the “Klingons” and discovering how grossly underprepared ones vocabulary is in that world (How do trekkies remember it all?). Considering this was my very first Le Carre book, I was reasonably confused.Add to the unfamiliar jargon characters alternatively being referred to by their first, last, code or nickname, a plot that is not moving chronologically and setting frequently shifted mid chapter with no announcement and I came to an early conclusion that I did not like this book. Mostly because I hated that it was above my ability to understand.Surprising even to me, I stuck with it. Perhaps George Smiley’s pathetic personal life amidst his own genius made him a sympathetic protagonist to cheer for. No, that’s exactly why I held out. The author takes his time developing each character and even though I didn’t appreciate it at the time as character after character was being introduced, each of his characters, whether major players or small-time support, felt full and real and utterly believable. I enjoyed how the author allowed the narrative to reveal the hero, Smiley’s, insecurities as well as his spying brilliance. And even though it doesn’t make for a very exciting plot, I also appreciated the frequent mentioning of how tedious, tiring and boring spy work actually is.I’m glad I stuck with it because by page 300, I was hooked. Sure, there were only 381 pages in all but this twisty story of who is who and who did what and with whom and where and when for the Russians finally becomes clear as Smiley interrogates and unravels each kink. For me, the pleasure came from little insights Smiley gave as he figured it out. The anti-climax of it all. Sadness, almost, at ruining someone’s life - even if that person was a traitor. Feeling small and mean towards a former friend who was never a friend. Yes, I believe this almost discarded book was completely redeemed by George Smiley.I’m nervous to attempt another Le Carre because I don’t like working so hard for a story, but now that I’m not a complete Carre novice, I may embrace my new knowledge and peek into the world of George Smiley once more....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 26, 2012","Mar 16, 2012","Feb 26, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11821566-tinker-tailor-soldier-spy

All of my sources were correct. It is delightful.Helen Simonson manages to do what plenty of authors have tried to accomplish, most unsuccessfully, I might add: capture the romantic and comedic flair of Jane Austen in a modern day novel. I have no idea if this was an intention of hers. While not an obvious adaptation of any of Austen’s popular novels, the themes of class, obligation to family, unsuitability and prejudice all surround Major Earnest Pettigrew, a sensible and established older gentleman in a small English village, and Mrs. Jasmina Ali, a Pakistani widow who owns the small village market, while their late-in-life romance blossoms.The story begins as Major Pettigrew answers his front door to Mrs. Ali on an errand and she finds the usually distinguished major in his deceased wife’s housecoat. Embarrassed, he explains the confusion and despondency on the recent passing of his brother. Her immediate kindness in making him tea and discussing his favorite author, Kipling, spark a new and surprising friendship. It is heartening to read that even in a later age, passion can still be discovered.Similar to Austen’s style, the rest of Simonson’s secondary characters are all developed through the major’s opinion and perspective, limiting most to be seen as a rather ridiculous and unlikable bunch. Of course, as certain characters become better known to Major Pettigrew or his sympathies change through experience, they develop more depth and nuance, sometimes in an unexpected way.While the plot takes a back seat to Major Pettigrew’s character development, there are balls, walks in the park, gossip, ultimatums, landed gentry, hunts and a rather dramatic romantic ending to enjoy. It may be predictable but it manages to avoid being at all fluffy thanks to the major’s conservative humor and his behaving in a gentlemanlike manner.

It was thoughtful, well paced and stood out in my mind from its dystopian YA cousins. Knowing it was part of a planned series, I eagerly picked up this blue/grey hued book when I saw it at Sam's Club the other day.Like its predecessor, Crossed takes place in a future world, after a great Warming, when an entity known as the Society makes choices for its citizens to optimize their health and happiness. Cassia, the young protagonist, has purposely broken some of the Society's rules in order to be expelled to work camps closer to the Outer Provinces to find her recently discovered love, Ky, who is an Abberation and has been exiled from Society and therefore not an acceptable candidate to be matched with (see book 1). After reading 195 pages, I found myself sighing heavily and felt weary. I made note of the page number because I remember thinking, ""This is boring."" and a book like this shouldn't be boring almost 200 pages in. I wish I hadn't been bored because Condie is a beautiful writer. The shape of her sentences blends harmoniously with most of the abundant poetry she chooses to include and make a priority. However, in a completely unflattering parallel, I couldn't help but wonder if Condie deliberately slowed down the plot to extend this series like I feel Stephanie Meyers did to the Twilight series. The story just stops moving. I think she might have been going for further character development by repeatedly stating that Ky loves Cassia and Cassia loves Ky in romantic and flowery language but then she overpowered their young and somewhat unexplained love with a whole lot of burying and walking and thinking and walking and starving and walking and.....drudgery. It's probably the point. It's book two. Book twos are notoriously slow. New Moon as well as Catching Fire are easily both at the bottom of my rankings in their respective series in terms of interesting plots. It's not like I needed Crossed to not contain the drudgery, although one of the facets of the first book I found so appealing was that the author didn't use a horribly stark, violent and unsafe setting to make a point about freedom vs. order like so many dystopian books do. I thought the entire premise of happiness and health and cleanliness as its own prison was brilliant. Well....it didn't last. Welcome scary air ships that kill innocent people and robotic officials who might as well have been wearing storm trooper costumes. But this is no Empire Strikes Back. Now THERE was a good middle of a series. Ultimately, what really irritates me about this book is that I feel like the author stopped trusting me to make the moral leaps with her. The concerns and questions and trappings of both Cassia and Ky, who alternately narrate the chapters, felt dumbed down and repetitive. I get that they are confused about who to trust. I get that life is going to be hard regardless of their choices. What I don't get is why Condie thought I wouldn't get that without her characters repeatedly telling me that these are their concerns. I don't know where this series is going. Sadly, my desire to follow it just took a beating. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2011","Nov 03, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9794437-crossed

However, logic tells me as much as I enjoyed reading it, Matched, by Ally Condie, was missing vital ingredients required for a five-star masterpiece, like flushed out flawed characters, good descriptive writing (I had a hard time visualizing the setting), and, because it is obviously part of a series, a good ending. Still, for a Young Adult novel, I found myself thinking, thinking, thinking and I'm giving kudos for the thoughts. Like many futuristic dystopian novels, some government entity, here called The Society, has taken away freedoms in order to eradicate or minimize pain. Unlike many futuristic dystopian novels, this society isn't marked by the gloom, doom, fear and isolation of the individual. Family life is encouraged, nay, scientifically planned. Education, friendships, health and wholesome recreational activities are encouraged. Of course, to ensure all this good fortune is maintained, it is also heavily monitored and regulated. Prescribed happiness.Though not asked, I believe the central question posed in Matched is, ""What makes us happy?"" Is it good health? Financial stability? Loving and supportive relationships? As the protagonist, Cassia, frequently reasons, The Society's rules and established order provide for a good life. She has nothing to fear in her future. She has been perfectly matched to marry her best friend, Xander, who happens to be handsome, kind and intelligent. She has been assured of a good job as a sorter, something she enjoys doing and does well. Cassia knows all this and yet, either as an experiment or by accident, something happens that casts a shadow of doubt over everything she has ever known. For the first time, she questions her future. For the first time, she questions period. What she must decide is if her questions bring her closer or further away from the life she ultimately wants. I can't wait to discuss this with others. I ordered a whole slew of copies for the group of teenage girls I work with at church and hope, through discussion, we can discuss Cassia's choices, planned life and agency. I hope they can identify with her concerns and hopes and fears. I hope they like it as much as I did. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 06, 2011","Sep 12, 2011","Sep 06, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7735333-matched

My apologies to Diane Chamberlain, who I'm sure is a nice woman with lots of ideas and talent, but The Midwife's Confession gives fiction a bad name. I feel rather strongly that fiction has a lot more to offer than escapism or entertainment. I feel its medium is especially suited to teach - namely empathy and understanding for the multitude of life experiences we'll most likely never have as individuals. Additionally, I have learned from Tolstoy and Stagner and Steinbeck and Stockett and many others that no matter our color or religion or age or gender, we are all a lot more similar than it seems. So are our relationships with others. Toss in some history, geography, or any area of expertise (governing, medicine, cooking, sports, kite flying), a few conflicts for flavor, steady it with good writing and better editing, and, voila, you've got yourself some quality fiction. What does not make quality fiction is unbelievable, unlikely and ridiculous drama. Again, those kinds of stories may be entertaining to some but it feels like such a waste of pages and ink to me. What can possibly be the purpose of reading about three women who meet at college and become BFFs and all live in the same town and all still hang out regularly together (unlikely) until one of them unexpectedly commits suicide? Is it likely that those who have been adopted relate to becoming a midwife because they happened to be given to the midwife who delivered them (unbelievable)? Or that they identify with the woman who secretly discovers the names of her birth parents while moving her adoptive mother's furniture because she kept her daughter's birth file in an old swivel chair (unlikely)? Maybe we can glean a bit of that universal human condition by reading about about happens when you accidentally drop your newborn baby niece that was just born to your sister who thinks you're really just her old RA from college turned friend because you were high on prescription drugs that you secretly take due to a back injury from a car accident that happened on the night you slept with your best friend's fiance who you will always love even though he then marries your best friend so you become engaged to his partner but use your old lover as your attorney to arranges the paperwork for the five surrogate children you secretely deliver to help you atone for the fact that you replaced the dead baby that you hid in your purse at the hospital, stealing a baby from a woman in a coma who now has another daughter who needs a bone marrow transplant but now this secret niece of yours who was raised by your secret sister of yours discovers that she is the stolen baby and maybe can save her real sister's life by donating her genetically similar bone marrow? No? And don't get me started on the jolted first person narratives between five or six or seven different women. It's like she didn't know how to write one story so she just changed to have someone narrate when they needed to express how they felt or what was going on in their life or what secret they had. I never really like this style but Chamberlain's use of it felt downright lazy. Like I said - unbelievable, unlikely, ridiculous. Criminal.

I especially seem to be drawn to multi-generational stories and the cultural gap that inevitably separates the youth from their parents. Kimberly Chang and her mother emigrate to the United Sates from China and live in squalor as they attempt to learn English, pay back debts to the family that paid for their move and find a way out of the factory work that enslave them. Kimberly's extraordinary gift for learning and working hard is their obvious ticket to a better life but when the added distraction of love and relationships blur her focus, Kimberly must choose the life path she really wants. The book's ending is almost an epilogue as the reader is allowed access to the consequence of Kimberly's choices quite a ways into the future. While satisfying in that I knew what happened-ish, I almost wish I didn't. I enjoyed the pacing of the majority of the book when each of Kimberly's school years, from sixth grade to her applying to college, were roughly given the same amount of space and attention. Suddenly, I was thrust forward and felt disconnected from the character I had been following. I appreciate the author's desire to conclude that, oftentimes, success and loss go hand in hand, but, since I felt annoyed at the end of the book, I'm not sure it really worked. Still, a very readable book about the drive of an intriguing Chinese-American immigrant. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 18, 2011","Aug 28, 2011","Aug 18, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7362158-girl-in-translation

While it's not a large book, or even difficult to read, the meandering thoughts of an old English butler reminiscing wistfully about scenes from his past service, while traveling on his first holiday, didn't have the glue to keep my attention for long periods of time. Still, once I got away from the distractions of my life and could focus on Stevens, and his marvelously flawed perspective of things, I chastised myself for any criticism or name calling (I think I used the term ""boring"") because this is a beautiful story. It is the story of a man who devotes his life to service, dignity and honor, and in the process, misses out on quite a lot. When hindsight makes him wonder if those priorities were worth the sacrifices required to maintain the standard he expected from himself, his own limited awareness of his life and the life of those around him is written with achingly stiff perspective.

At my local bookstore, favorites of the employees are marked with a special bookmark filled with signatures of all who loved the book. This had at least ten signatures on it. In addition, a trusted friend on Goodreads hinted that it was one of her favorite books, reminding her of a book we had both read and loved, City of Thieves. With that kind of fanfare, it's no wonder all I could say after I finished reading, ""Well, that was disappointing."" The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien is part fiction, part non-fiction, part personal memoir and part Intro to Writing about the Vietnam War. O'Brien served in Vietnam and claims the story as his as well as those he served with but by the book's end, I wasn't sure how much of the story was true and how much he thought would make an interesting book. He spends the first chapter outlining his characters, detailing what gear the soldiers were required to carry as well as the few individual tokens each chose to bring along and for what reasons and I suppose by leading with a chapter like that, I expected to form a connection of sorts with these men. Most are reintroduced during various later chapters, but I was never sure who was who or what happened when to which soldier, mostly due to the author being unclear about what was the truth. For instance, in once chapter, a character is home after the war, driving around a lake in his truck wishing he could tell someone, his father, his old girlfriend, a stranger at a restaurant, about how he didn't earn the Silver Star because he couldn't save his friend from drowning in a sinkhole of sewage because it smelled too bad only to be told in another chapter that none of it actually happened. He hadn't actually let his friend die. Or he hadn't actually almost earned the Silver Star. Or that particular character wasn't actually a real person. The truth comes from that it could have and probably did happen. To someone. At some time. Somewhere. O'Brien uses an entire chapter to boast about this method of writing and what he considers the most honest way to tell the truth about what happens during a war where there is no such thing as truth. He explains that much of what he writes actually happened but is probably not true and the stuff that he makes up probably happened. Wait. So you're telling me....what the...?While the quirky mixture of fiction and memoir and how-to-be-a-writer is probably what makes it such a darling of reading circles, I found the combination of short stories, modern day confessions and whole chapters explaining why he included the chapters preceding them all tinged with a certain self-importance. I felt he was trying to expose war as it really is, like he was the first one to figure out that war is hell and morally ambiguous. It's his version of the truth. Even if he had to make some of it up to prove it. I get that the war probably traumatized him for life. I don't see how becoming friends with people, only to see them blown to bits or drowned in a sludge of sewage could be anything but traumatizing. Furthermore, I see how this book might be considered intelligent, even artsy. The writing is unusual for a war story in that its circular and poetic, tangled up without any sense of chronology. But, for a book about a group of men who served together in Vietnam and what they carried and why, I should care more about these men and what happened to them. The writing, however pretty, shouldn't get in the way of that. The unpredictable and incongruent format O'Brien uses prevented me from forming any real intimacies with any of the characters, real or not. Unfortunately, I think that's exactly what the author was hoping to do with this book. I think he wanted me to care about these individuals and their varied backgrounds, the reasons they served and the manner in which some died. More importantly, he seemed to want me to understand that war isn't really about valiance or honor by sharing stories about heroes who were neither valiant nor honorable. On a certain level, both of those things happened. I saw the gritty reality, the heartbreak and the inhumanity. But, I believe I needed to really know these men and not just their caricatures as O'Brien painted them, for that to happen and so I'm left disappointed and wondering if I missed some different and greater purpose of the book that other readers noticed....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,Oct 2010,"Dec 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6910629-the-things-they-carried

If so, I cannot think of a more poorly chosen actor to portray Captain Corelli, an Italian officer in command of invading and later keeping the peace on the Greek island of Cephalonia. This captain was charming, quick witted, musical and, I'm assuming, handsome. Afterall, famed beauty Pegalia couldn't even resist his charms. This is an odd book but I liked it. World War II seems to have an endless influence on authors and this is yet another story of another people in another place that gave me yet another perspective on the great war. This doesn't feel historical, really, because of the quirkiness of the characters and narration, which almost took on a fantasy tone, but maybe that how the Greeks really are. I really am a romantic because my favorite part of the story, by far, was the romance between Corelli and Pegalia. The story offers much more - description of music (it is part of the title), wisdom from Pegalia's father, Dr. Iannis, folklore, Greek history and geography, Italian history, notes on friendship and, yes, the cruelties of war. It also has one of my favorite quotes about love. I've quoted it before, back in December (can you believe how far behind in book s I am????) when I actually read this book, but I'm going to post it again. I love it.""Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day or lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body...No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being 'in love', which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it, we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossom had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two.""I'm so glad I read this.

I read David Ebershoff's The 19th Wife first, and as much as I didn't like it, I had to admit that it was well written. Weaving a modern day murder mystery in with the history of Eliza Ann Young, the nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, was well done and interestingly paced. However, after reading The Lonely Polygamist, I decided I could justify my dislike of this book because the former handled the subject matter so much more honestly. The news portrays real life polygamist leaders as the very scum of society. Warren Jeffs, an actual religious leader of a polygamist community or church or theology, made headlines a few years ago by becoming a fugitive after trying to force a young teen to become his umpteenth wife. The government swooped in and the whole thing quickly unraveled into a huge mess. The answer of what to do with the children, the women, and others who had committed no crime, was never answered. The government and news media were much more concerned with handing down the moral verdict that what these people do is bad, bad, bad. Maybe it is. It's not something I would ever want to do. But Ebershoff didn't just tell a story, he tried to sell his side of things, and as a result, The 19th Wife felt caricatur-ish and biased. His descriptions implied everyone who lives or lived this lifestyle is selfish, violent, vain and a sexual misogynist. I even felt like their teeth might be rotting in their very mouths. Blech. Likewise, when fictionalizing actual historical figures, he took quite a bit of liberty with their motives and desires. Maybe all historical fiction authors do this, and maybe I should squirm more often than I do, but the way he portrayed Brigham Young and other early leaders of the LDS church felt vindictive. To just make up letters and journal entries that seemingly support his version of history, and explain in the author's notes afterward that, while completely fabricated, they have the ""flavor"" of things he's read in his research doesn't sit well with me. I realize that's the influence of my own bias, but how is that right? For me, there are more important things than a well written book. Sure, Ebershoff is a fine author and knows his way around adjectives, narration and settings, but in my opinion, he cared too much about being right and too little about being honest....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Nov 2010,"Nov 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2586771-the-19th-wife

WhFor some reason (pride, previous disappointment, too many spoilers), I struggle to read books that have already been read and adored by the masses. When Unbroken was released, I was well aware it was the current book du jour but all the buzz was positive and so I bought it with as much anticipation as others, figuring I’d beat most to the punch and before my curious apathy towards popular books could set in.As more and more read, finished and gushed about this book, the further and further down my “to-read” list it went. If the current novel I was reading hadn’t been so horribly boring, Unbroken might never have been read. Thankfully, for my own enlightenment and spirit, the dust was shucked off and one more fan of Louis Zamperini’s story of enduring the unendurable was made.This book can be easily compartmentalized into four separate sections: the pre-war character development of Louis Zamperini, his struggle to survive on a life raft in the Pacific Ocean, the atrocities and depravities he witnessed and suffered as a prisoner of war and post war life. Even though I felt each of these four segments of the book had its own start, middle and end, Hillenbrand does a fantastic job of creating a whole story, never failing to tie the narratives together or jolting the reader out of Zamperini’s point of view. This feat alone is astounding when considering the vast amount of data Hillenbrand includes. She meticulously details his family life and childhood starting with his Italian heritage and rebellious youth in Torrance, California, the statistics and races of the 1936 Summer Olympics, all kinds of facts and figures from the US military, Japanese war history, the post war religious revival and interviews with a war criminal known as “the bird.” It’s a lot of information! Nevertheless, she weaves each well-researched nugget effortlessly into an incredible story about a man’s indomitable spirit and ability to survive unimaginable horrors, both physically and emotionally.At times, I didn’t love it. Early on, I felt strongly that I was listening to the memoir of an old man recalling past events of his life with those infamous “I walked to school uphill in snow both ways!” kind of glasses. Louis’s childhood scraps seemed a little too extreme, from jumping out of a two story building and walking down the street at the age of two, to beating up every kid in the neighborhood. Frankly, I didn’t like young Louis very much. His delinquent behavior wasn’t at all endearing to me. I understood early on that Hillenbrand was including this information to support his later ability to survive but it seemed forced....planned even.Even when the author wrote about Zamperini, Phil and Mac's 47 days spent on a life raft, I thought, “How is there this much detail? These men were starving, delirious and sun stroked!” and yet it never feels foggy or hallucinatory. The days seem definite instead of blending into each other. Daily moods and chronicles of events are almost perfectly recalled. I don’t know how this part of his story was researched but when I read it, I was a bit skeptical because it’s all so incredible. Sharks leaping out of the water at him! Albatrosses caught with bare hands! Japanese zeros shooting from the sky at them!And then I thought, “Give it a rest, Lucy! This man spent 47 days on a life raft in the Pacific Ocean and survived to tell the tale! He can remember whatever the heck he wants to remember.” I’m not saying that I don’t believe him. I do. What I realized later is that combined with his fame earned from his Olympic glory and being erroneously labeled killed in action, he had more opportunities than most to have his experience recounted and recorded. He also proves throughout his later life to be exactly the kind of man to punch an attacking shark in the face. He’s really something.Like most other readers, the degradation he suffered as a POW was hard to read. At my core, I believe in the goodness of people. War seems to make people forget who they are and some of the guards at his prison camp don’t seem human at all. I traveled to Thailand a few years ago and spent some time seeing what has become known as the Death Railway, including some museums that contained pictures of the POWs forced to build it. Because of this, I could visualize the bony bodies, filth and cruelty described by Hillenbrand and lived by Zamperini. It should be unimaginable. I thought Hillenbrand did an incredible job to not only write about the conditions and events but to also draw conclusions about what happens to men who are treated as less than human. She writes, “Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it even in the face of extreme physical hardship can hold a man’s soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it. The loss of it can carry a man off as surely as thirst, hunger, exposure, and asphyxiation, and with greater cruelty....degradation could be as lethal as a bullet.”It felt unexpected when Zamperini, who had thus far seemed almost Indiana Jones-esque in his ability to survive anything, faltered from this very degradation once the war was over. To me, the psychological injuries and Zamperini’s very honest battle with his war demons, were the crux of this book. More heroic than any of the many brave and remarkable accomplishments of his existence was how he dealt with his PTSD. Because, contrary to the title of the book, he WAS broken. And then he was not.I must also mention Hillenbrand’s own incredible story. As lots of ers mention, she became a success with the publication of her Seabiscuit memoir. I thought it fascinating that she first discovered Zamperini and became curious about who this man was while looking through old newspapers for articles about Seabiscuit. Because those articles were invariably in the sports section, she noticed stories about an up and coming runner named Louis Zamperini. She called him and an amazing friendship was born.Hillenbrand and Zamperini have never met. Hillenbrand suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and thus rarely leaves her home in New York. She has to strategically plan her days to have the reserves of energy to research, interview and write. Even with the popularity and demand of both her books, she has been unable to go on book tours to promote them. Lovingly, Zamperini offered to go in her stead.I think there is a level of understanding between the two of them that makes this book what it is. Without a doubt, Zamperini’s story is remarkable and awe inspiring. But, quietly and without any sharks or bombs, so is Hillenbrands. She understands struggle. She gets the power of mental fortitude. She lives her daily life as a prisoner inside a diseased body. I think she was able to tap into Louis’s struggle and write about it with his perspective because she is a survivor. She chooses to be unbroken.It’s all quite incredible.

In Faithful Place, detective Frank Mackey's past gets stirred up when the suitcase of his former girlfriend, Rosie, is discovered in the chimney of an abandoned house they used to meet in during a renovation. Heartbroken, he left their hometown and most of the relationships with his very dysfunctional family behind. Frank, whose whole life changed the night he assumed she bailed on their plans to run away together, has since been married, become a father, and, later, divorced. Now, he's determined to face his painful past and discover if something else might have happened that night. Maybe she didn't runaway to the big city without him. Maybe something much darker happened. Maybe Rosie never left town at all. French's skill, in my opinion, is to allow the mystery of the crime to take a backseat to the development of her main character. The clues are still unfolding and the whodunit pushes the plot along, but the breakdown of her protagonists - their fears, prejudices, motives and skewed perspective - make it a much more interesting mystery to read. In this particular case, I listened to the audio instead of reading and the addition of a Scottish accent in my head made it even more engaging.

In almost every chapter, there is a finding that doesn't make sense until the authors break down the data that shows that it does. It's a troubling book because it makes a very good case against ""instinctive"" parenting. Instead, what Po Bronson and Ashely Merryman state is that some of our best intentions produce the worst results in our kids due to our wishful thinking, bias, fads, our own personal history and old psychology. For instance, showing your kids episodes of Arthur and Clifford can increase cruel behavior and aggression. Praising your child for being smart may be harmful to his academic performance (even if he is really smart). Assuming children are ""color-blind"" and not talking about race may cause children to become racist. DVDs like Baby Einstein and other videos that claim to speed up language development or produce multi-lingualism can actually delay normal speech skills. Other chapters cover why less sleep is a significant contributor to childhood obesity and ADHD, why kids lie, why gifted and talented programs are flawed, why siblings really fight, why teen rebellion is a sign of respect (gah!) and why I wish there was a Tools preschool program in my area.I enjoyed reading this because it was eye-opening, relevant and also because whatever parenting myth was being challenged, the data supporting any new claim was thoroughly explained. It helps that Bronson and Merryman didn't back away from using all of the scientific jargon that usually causes my eyes to glaze over. Most of the time, the opposite happened and the empirical evidence presented was surprisingly accessible while the flow between narrative and research was smooth and convincing.It isn't often that I claim that something or someone changed the way I think.

Ever since that conversation, I've been more conscious about writing more generally, leaving out details that may spoil it for others who haven't read it yet.I will not be doing that here.In case that didn't make sense, let me put it another way.*****SPOILER ALERT******SPOILER ALERT******SPOILER ALERT******O.K. Then.So, two years of Katniss's life have passed in two days for me. I think the timing differences affected my reaction, but I'm not certain. I know what I wanted to have happen didn't happen and I'm surprisingly satisfied.Katniss is one messed up chick. She should be! Who would be normal after everything she's been through in two days I mean two years! First, the boy she thought she was pretending to love becomes a Capitol hostage and is clearly being tortured and she realizes that she loves him! She had glimpses into this self awareness before, but now that he's not there to depend upon, now that she might never see him or touch him or be loved by him, well...she can't be the girl on fire, the Mockingjay, the leader of the rebel cause without him. She has nothing to give. And Gale knows it. Gale, who should have been so much better developed in this book because Peeta was out of the picture for most of it and Gale and Katniss had time and opportunity and instead, Collins gave me detailed descriptions of mashed turnips and propaganda ads. I don't know why she could allow Gale to react - to get mad or jealous or passionate or funny or...anything. He was just (speaking in a robot voice) ""I am Gale. I love Katniss (though won't ever do anything about it). I am a hunter and a fighter."" Blah. He was much more excited about his communicuff than he ever seemed to be about Katniss. The author kept writing about how deeply Katniss felt about Gale and how deeply Gale felt about Katniss without ever really giving them opportunities in the plot to show it. And if she did, like when Gale was tortured (although I think that was in the other book but they are all running together in my mind so bear with me, people!), she dissolved any tension she created as soon as I turned the next page. Scene over. Conversation over. On to describing another costume or meal in full and lengthy detail. I had high hopes of being tormented by who to choose but there was no question about who Katniss should be with. Well..that's not exactly true. When Peeta was totally insane and trying to kill Katniss because he had been programmed to, Gale did look like the better choice. But the totally boring, safe better choice. Now that I've gotten past the bizarre love story, which actually does have depth if you think about why she eventually chose Peeta (she wants to be with someone who can help her remember there is good in the world), I'll move on to what really impressed me with this book.It's scary. And confusing. And dark and horrible and violent and bloody and ugly.Just like war. I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was reading. Peeta tortured? Blowing up hospitals? Shooting strangers in the heart to keep your cover? Bombing children with parachutes that they'd come to rely on as being helpful? Not nice. Not fair. Not clean. It's disturbing and I totally get that it's almost too disturbing. We're not really used to authors introducing us to likable characters who have survived unthinkable government abuse, who stand in their hospital gown, showing off their underwear and sarcastically saying, ""You don't want some of this?"" who finally gets to marry the love of his life, and then kill them off in a horrible manner. Inconsequential characters who mean nothing, yes, but not ones so young, beautiful and deserving of a long-overdue bit of happiness. More than that, the adults are totally untrustworthy. Katniss's mother, who the author thankfully kept true to herself by abandoning her highly troubled and disfigured daughter, because her other daughter had died and she just couldn't handle it. Haymitch, who returns to his alcoholism the moment he can. President Snow, who totally reminded me of Lord Voldemort. Probably all the mentioning of his snake-eyes and how he smelled like blood. President Coin, who never seemed to understand what the rebels were fighting for and wanted power more than change. I'm not sure Young Adult fiction needs to paint all adults as totally selfish and calculating, but it's fair to represent some that way. It wasn't a perfect book. The ending was confusing and I had a really difficult time visualizing the assault on the city. Each time a ""pod"" was mentioned, I pictured one of those heavy boxes they put in front of houses that are getting built or remodeled. I don't know why, but that was in my head so when the author said, ""pod"" this or ""pod"" that, and black ooze was coming out, or nets or crazy white reptilian mutts, they were coming out of this totally out-of-place metal box. It was very disorientating. I knew I was lost, so never went back to find the original description, but I have no idea how they got to the Capitol. One minute, they were shooting a commercial and then it was non-stop survival mode action until Katniss witnessed her sister get blown up and literally felt herself on fire. I don't think she could have ended it differently and remained honest to her original premise - that there are far worse things than death. Because of the set-up of the story, writing it in a trilogy format, she had to escalate the conflict. A violent, but contained, story of killing and death would no longer do. What were they all doing there and for what reason? The anarchy, distrust, and flat-out fear of having no control over your own safety has to be messy. And Collins made it so very messy. I'm not sure there needed to be an epilogue. It was nice to know that Katniss and Peeta had a future. It was refreshing to see that life was not perfectly swell now that the nasty war was behind them. They struggled and coped and fought for happiness as best they could. But, in my opinion, that's the real sunset. So, reading about it, I felt like saying, ""Tell me something I don't know."" I would have been angry had the epilogue been written any differently. I think that's about it. Another book to remind me that should the world ever become this horrible, I really, really just want to go out with the initial bang. I worry I'm not a survivor at all. I don't think I could do these things. Any of it. Eat squirrel or fight to the death on live TV or take down an evil president. But, maybe I could. I'm not saying I could be Katniss. But, maybe I could be that tiger lady and hide the really brave people. All I'd have to learn to do is eat raw meat and purr.

I finished Hunger Games Friday morning. As soon as I finished, I cleaned the kitchen's breakfast mess, swept the floor underneath the table, took Henry to speech and then opened up Catching Fire. With some off and on reading throughout the day, I managed to turn the last page close to midnight. Anytime an author can get a reader to read two of her books in less than twenty-four hours, she is doing something right. Without a doubt, she has created a fascinating world of survival and intrigue and although I found myself a little more irritated with predictable characters and the necessary repetition of basic plot lines to get obtuse or forgetful readers up to speed, I kept turning the page. What in the world is going to happen?I thought for awhile that Collins would be forced to abandon her Hunger Games premise. After all, this was Katniss's story and Katniss had survived the games. What now? Oh...that. I was disappointed in a plot twist whose kink didn't take the story to a new place but, instead, returned it to an old one. While I cared because I was invested, I was a little tired of the game. It may have been because I had just left the games hours earlier, instead of the year both the book and real-life intended, but my heart wasn't as into it. The description of the arena didn't fit inside my head as easily, with the clock format and hourly disasters in pie shaped areas hard to picture. Like Katniss, I kept trying to see it in a bird's eye view, which removed me from the setting. I couldn't get in there, on the Island or in the jungle like I did with the cave and trees and lake in the first book. However, I loved getting to know Panem better. Where are these other districts and who are the people who live in them? How will a rebellion ever occur if they have no means of communication?

Obedience to a government who can change the rules on a whim? Torture? Poverty? Life without your loved ones?

It's even better when the new perspective comes attached to a compelling story.Room, by Emma Donoghue, could claim to be about a number of things. I'm going to be one of those annoying ers who promises that the novel is best read with as little foreknowledge as possible, which is definitely true in this case but only for about the first fifty pages. Unfortunately, that means I also have to keep my mouth shut about the other three-hundred that follow, but I think the lack of p is worth it. Ultimately, what I think Room is about, and what it as a novel does best, is deliver a unique lesson about perspective. Those first fifty pages (or so) have our five year-old narrator, Jack, talking about objects and his surroundings and schedule in a room in a way that doesn't really make sense. Until you know the reason why, it's almost difficult to read because...well...that's not how we talk. Then the question becomes, ""Why?"" Why is this boy's perspective so different than mine? Where is he? What is he doing there? As the answers are divulged and the more recognizable backstory is presented along beside Jack's, the author challenges you to stay with Jack and his point of view. His incredible experience allows each of us readers to break down some common, everyday occurrences, or even what could be considered general truths, and really examine their validity. Donoghue does an amazing job of keeping a realistic vibe while describing a sensational story. The attitudes and actions of most of the characters are fascinatingly predictable, both in a good and bad way. In other words, I know these guys. They represent me and my world. However, because of Jack, there is more to consider. If my world doesn't make sense to Jack and Jack's world doesn't make sense to me, is one superior to the other? Due to the premise of the plot, the answer to this question, this time is yes. Obviously yes. Jack has suffered from not being a part of my world and as he adjusts, he'll understand that. But Jack was happy in his world. Perhaps he wouldn't always have been. Circumstances being what they were, it's fairly easy to assume that would have been the case. It made me think, though. My world seems pretty ideal, particularly because I am an American, white, and middle class. Doesn't the rest of the world suffer because they don't have all the same experiences and opportunities that I have? Isn't my world superior to theirs? I think of the women in the world who wear Burquas, or who have to wash their clothes by hand or even those who can only have one child as dictated by their government. Surely my reality is better than theirs. After all, I can wear whatever I want in public, I have a front loader that cleans a load of clothes at the touch of a button and three charming boys who delight me. I think those other women couldn't possibly be as happy as me with those limitations placed upon them. Maybe that's the case. But maybe not. Probably not. After all, happiness is a state of mind. Heck, there's been enough literature, movies and facebook status updates to highlight that money (or nationality or race or any number of things) doesn't make us happy. We make ourselves happy. With one child, or twenty, covered or uncovered, by hand or by machine. Our happiness is only dependent upon our ability to choose it. Ah, I digress. This isn't about me, or the world, it's about Jack. It's about a little boy in his room who could choose happiness in large part because his mother gave him the ability by shielding him from the alternative misery. I like that thinking about Jack made me think about these other things, though. I like that even though the author wrote a story about a boy whose world was a room, writing about a room made me think about the world....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Nov 16, 2010","Sep 10, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7937843-room

For someSometimes, not always and not really all that often, I read a book without reading the book jacket summary or anything about it on Goodreads. For some reason, perhaps the small print on this small paperback, I simply relied that it was a favorite of a friend of mine, was reportedly funny (I love funny books) and its title and author seemed British. It's a horrible and undoubtedly untrue stereotype but there is something inherently more ""classy"" about a British comedy compared to an American one. Why in the world I assumed Connie Willis was a British male I have no idea, but it turns out SHE is American, born and living in Colorado and is a major science fiction author. These realizations set me back a bit when I learned that To Say Nothing of the Dog involved time travel, a whole lot of details about historical wars, literature I had not read and an exhausting, book long search for a repeatedly described bird stump that I still could never accurately visualize or imagine because I have no idea what a bird stump is. It was set in Great Britain so maybe I need to add to my flawed sterotype that brits put things weird and ugly things for birds to land on inside their great cathedrals. Whether this adds to their class or humor, I have no idea.Regardless of my ignorance, I still found this story to be complex, engaging, confusing, entertaining and very, very funny. I loved the characters - extreme and one sided as Willis portrayed them. It's not a particularly easy book to read and I admit that reading a few summaries would have helped a great deal in my ability to get into this book at its beginning but I'm glad I read it.

In the United States (and I believe Australia and New Zealand) it is called Someone Knows My Name. In Canada, the book is known as The Book of Negroes. As soon as I had this information, I was curious as to the why Lawrence Hill used two different titles as well as discovering which title was a better name for the book. Early on in my reading, Someone Knows My Name was the clear front runner. As Aminata Diallo describes being stolen from her parents at the tender age of eleven, and marched with others from her homeland to the coast of Africa as part of the slave trade, she writes about hearing someone she had befriended on the journey exclaim upon seeing her upon the slave ship how good it felt to be see ""someone who knows my name."" The inhumanity of slavery is often portrayed through beatings, branding, and rape but to thoughtfully include a moment when a man laments the theft of his identity is a powerful lesson that the cruelty of slavery is not limited to physical abuse. This is something Aminiata realizes at a very early age and eventually has to teach to powerful men and women from England as an old woman. The name Book of Negroes doesn't surface until after Aminata leaves her first experience as a slave in South Carolina and New York to join a group of men and women heading to Nova Scotia, Canada, who have earned their ""freedom"" by serving behind British lines during the Revolutionary War. The Book of Negroes is an actual historical document, of which copies can be seen in several libraries in both the US and Canada, listing the names, descriptions and backgrounds of those former slaves who traveled to Canada with the promise of land and better opportunities. Because Aminata was noticed by several people throughout her life as being highly intelligent, she had learned to read and write and, in the novel (not in actual history), was asked to work as a scribe to create The Book of Negroes. As she did this, and listened to the various stories of those who, like her, longed for freedom, she mentioned how enlightening it was to understand that her story was no more horrific nor unusual than anyone elses. Each and every slave's story was extraordinary in how they became a slave to how they found themselves there, in New York, seeking a better existence. At this point, The Book of Negroes title surged ahead of its competitor. The story continues on, however. Not really plot driven, unless you count Aminata's quest for freedom a plot, in which case there is never really a central conflict or climax, but several repeated throughout the novel, the real potency of Someone Knows My Name is its believability. I believed each page of the book. I loved Aminata. Not because she was perfect but because she felt real. By some standards, her experience as a slave was not nearly as terrible as others due to the fact that her ability to read and write afforded her opportunities and experiences, not to mention respect from both the white and black communities, that most would never have. But Aminata's own grace and eloquence highlighted why there is no such thing as above-average bondage. In the end, Someone Knows My Name wins out because this is an individual story about what it means to be human. With its historical depth, remarkable characterization and significant moral weight, this is a book I consider a benefit to literature. I'm certainly glad to have read it....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 18, 2010",Sep 2010,"Aug 18, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/875441.Someone_Knows_My_Name

In almost all cases, I will avoid reading poetry. So, when my mother-in-law lent me an autobiography of an LDS female poet, Carol Pearson, whose marriage to a gay-man ended when he left her and the church to pursue a gay lifestyle but who she eventually cared for as he succumbed to AIDS, it took me a few months to work up the courage to read this book. While it does contain some of her poetry, which includes several things I've read before, it is mostly an easy to follow chronology of her life and how certain things came to be.It moved me. Pearson, who obviously has a way with words, does a remarkable job evoking sympathy for a man who appears on the surface to be an undeserving of the emotion. Charismatic and full of life, Gerald Pearson is the man Carol falls in love with. When he tells her before they are married that he has had intimate relationships with men, she naively doesn't understand that he is gay. All I can say is that it was during the sixties and that lifestyle was obviously much less talked about and understood than it is today. She reasoned that he had sinned but had repented and by being married, all would be well. A whole lot of heartbreak later, all is not well, but Carol finds within herself an ability to love Gerald as she believes Heavenly Father loves Gerald and while she never really accepts his lifestyle or approves of it, she always continues to love him.

I've never seen the movies (either the old Disney version or the recently released version with a disturbing Johnny Depp on the cover) but I don't live under a rock so I knew Alice as a girl with blond hair who wore a blue and white dress. But, who was this white rabbit that seemed so concerned about being late? Why was Alice constantly getting bigger and smaller? What did the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts, not to mention TweedleDee and TweedleDum have to do with anything? I really didn't know.For example, did you know that Alice In Wonderland is not, in fact, a title used for Carroll's story at all? The story, I believe, that most people associate with that title is actually a combination of two stories, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass. After trudging through the first story, I couldn't bear to attempt the sequel (which, apparently introduce the characters Tweedledee and Tweedledum. I am thus still ignorant). There really seemed to be no point.With only half the tale read, I still have no idea what, if anything, it's all about because this is, by far, the strangest story I have ever read. It's not funny. It's not scary. It's just really, really bizarre. For something classified as children's literature, none of the characters seem to have a purpose, even a simple one such as to entertain. Alice seems confused and a little bit angry most of the time and is constantly trying to leave whatever situation she finds herself in, usually by eating cake to alter her size. I'm sitting here scratching my head wondering for what purpose any adult would even present this story to a child. Don't get me wrong. I'm not anti-quirky or anti-fantastical. I think, oftentimes, those mediums can be wonderful conduits to showcasing the human condition. Not so here. There is nothing to learn and nothing to teach. There is nothing to enjoy. It's absurd frivolity.Maybe the argument is that it's pure whimsy (shouldn't whimsy be more fun?). Or that it's Lewis Carroll on a drug trip (this gets my vote). Or, for those who are really stretching, that Alice In Wonderland provides an extraordinary example of logic (really???) Any of these, if true, seem unable to support the staying power of this book.

Andrew Olson explains upfront that it is a misconception most people have that the Willie and Martin Handcart companies are one in the same. They are not. Their tragedies were the result of the same early storm and much of the same mistakes in decision making, but they were in two separate places along the trail and had two different experiences and rescues. For that reason, he tells the stories individually, the Willie being the first half of the book and the Martin finishing the second half. They are similar in that most of the members of the companies had similar backgrounds. Poor European converts and returning missionaries all eager to reach Utah and convinced that their faith will see them there. It was hard for me, emotionally, to finish the Willie story and begin again with the Martin. Instead of interweaving the timeline, he starts and finishes each one to completion. So many names and wretched history after another made it difficult for individual names and experiences to stick. Still, some did. I read this in preparation for a Youth Pioneer Trek and was so much better prepared from doing so.

It is also loaded with fragmented sentences. I'm a casual writer myself and champion the effect leaving a subject or verb or both from the beginning of a sentence can have. Keeps things from being redundant and words from being overused. Simply illustrating my point:) So many incomplete sentences, concentrated together paragraph after paragraph, however, made the flow of the page very noticeably choppy. For a time, I let these things irritate me. As I read about the unconventional monk, Corrigan from Ireland, who spends his seemingly futile ministry giving hookers a place to use the bathroom and taking old people out for joyrides in his beat up van, I wondered if McCann was only interested in the underbelly of society. I assumed from the title that his book was going to be about the world spinning, or, in other words, day to day life. Surely, there are lives whose everyday isn't filled with drugs, or pimps or acts of manslaughter or grief from the death of a beloved child. Surely, somewhere, someone is doing laundry, exercising, cooking a spaghetti dinner and speaking with less profanity. Eventually, McCann's spinning world came into focus and it was exactly the beautiful thing I believe day to day life actually is: a friend helping a friend, a stranger doing something heroic, beauty and light forcing its way through the cracks of the chaotic and mundane. With the real life event of a man walking across a wire between the two World Trade Center towers in 1974 as a stunning backdrop, McCann shows how the much more ordinary things, even ones labeled as hopeless, weighted as weary and burdened with ugly, supply the meaning to what we all must endure: life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 26, 2010","Jun 09, 2010","May 26, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

If that's not something that interests you, read on.Yann Martel, author of Beatrice and Virgil as well as the bestselling Life of Pi, once again uses animals to tell a story. There are many stories within stories, however, and Beatrice, a donkey, and Virgil, a howler monkey, are not characters in the book but rather characters in a play that the protagonist, Henry, receives in the mail from a local taxidermist. It matters that Henry, a Canadian and an author who has written a wildly successful novel using animals as characters (yes. I think it's autobiographical on purpose. It feels very Jonathan Safran Foer-esque), is living in Germany with his wife to escape the frustration and apathy he felt following the rejection of his next book, a flip book that combines both a novel and essay about the Holocaust. When they ask him, ""But, what is it about?"" he feels misunderstood and a little bit persecuted. Martel forces the same question to his readers in this very quirky book. What is it about? Certainly, it is about the Holocaust. But it's more than that. It's the problem with writing about the Holocaust, the motivation to write about the Holocaust and the responsibility to write about the Holocaust. Who should? Who does? Who gets to? When a writer writes about a writer writing about writing, it can seem very circular, but I think Martel does an effective job to get his many points across. There are times I wished he had been more subtle. Several of his explanations and story-lines felt like being force-fed and I, for one, would have appreciated being given a little more responsibility as a reader to figure things out. But I liked it because it does what good fiction does: it tells the truth by making something up...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 21, 2010","Jul 30, 2010","May 23, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7176578-beatrice-and-virgil

This, an attempt to dramatize one of life's great questions - what if? - is bad, in my opinion, because it seems Anita Shreve couldn't pass up a chance to write a book full of gimmicks over one whose plot could stand on its own two feet.

So, why can't I happily recommend this book to everyone I know?One word: polygamy. I don't know how different readers might react to a book devoted to this uncomfortable subject. Such a highly charged topic creates an immediate bias because most readers will automatically feel either defensive (for LDS folks, we kind of wish this part of our history would just go away - even if our own beloved ancestors practiced the controversial doctrine - along with all of the fundamentalist offshoots that consistently tarnish our modern day image ) or smug, because clearly all polygamy - past, present and future - is evil, gross, atrocious and barbaric and any story about it is bound to portray it in all of its villainous glory. After all, how else could a story about a man who marries more than one woman go? Well, Udall surprised me by catering to neither group. His hero, Golden Richards, is a bumbling, unattractive and abundantly hairy man who rather haphazardly falls into the polygamous lifestyle. From his childhood to his adult life, he sort of just lets things happen to him and four wives and twenty-eight children, a struggling construction business, and three homes with not enough bathrooms later, he realizes he is not a happy man. He's lonely in the midst of a very chaotic life. The book has several narrators which each give an interesting perspective into how a life such as this might be. One of Golden's wives, his youngest, gets several chapters and feels unhappy because she's not MORE involved in the gigantic family drama. With only one daughter from a previous marriage, she feels left out among the sister wives, and all but forgotten by her husband.Another view comes from Rusty, the son of wife number three, whose mother is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Alone, tormented by his many, many siblings, he gives the book its much needed comical edge. I wouldn't want a son like Rusty, but his antics sure made me smile. I'm not saying I approve of a family dynamic like this, or excuse it as being an acceptable variation of what I consider the very bedrock of our society. But, a good novel is one which allows me to see, feel and be something that I mostly likely never would otherwise.

While it seems unfathoIn I'll Know you by Heart, Kimberly Job writes about the complexities that arise when temple covenants are broken due to abuse. While it seems unfathomable to me that the abuse described in this LDS fictional romance is even possible, I know that it occurs, even within the bonds of a temple marriage.Stephanie Roberts has all but given up trying to be happy. She craves stability but never seems to be able to predict what will send her husband into an irrational rage. When a spaghetti dinner displeases him to the point that he punches her in the face, as well as her sixteen year-old son who attempts to protect his mother, she finally realizes that she has to leave. Throughout the book, I vacillated between feeling frustrated that Stephanie wasn't a little more proactive about getting her abusive husband out of her and her children's life and appreciative that Job wrote what is likely an honest account of the difficulties that really exist when ending a marriage, especially one whose history is filled with control and manipulation. Interwoven into Stephanie's story is Jared's own story. Jared, a recent widower whose own marriage was a far cry from happy is now raising his four year-old daughter on his own. As both characters struggle to deal with the ramifications of single parenting, Jared and Stephanie's lives intersect and the stirrings of attraction become both a source of worry and hope. I admit to being a romance enthusiast but I think romance as a subject matter is difficult to do well in literature. Real romance, anyways. The entire time I was reading, I admit that I was cheering for Stephanie and Jared. I can't help it. When someone writes about attraction and falling in love, I swoon. On the other hand, I also couldn't help feeling their relationship and interactions were being over simplified. Romance....people...it's all very complicated in real life. While the author certainly included a complicated and burden heavy romantic plot, the character's behaviors and motivations didn't always seem to match either their earlier choices or what I had been led to expect from their descriptions. I think the author uses a Saturday's Warriors technique to explain that both Stephanie and Jared felt drawn somehow together, like they knew each other from way back when in the spirit world, but I'm not sure. The title seems to support the idea, but since there is no vision or revelation, only a short dream sequence that happens during a coma, I am merely hypothesizing. I recognize that I am hyper critical of LDS fiction because it seems that as soon as a character seems human and flawed and recognizable as someone I might know, the great gospel sweeper seems to come along and get rid of all the bad stuff, leaving only the shiny and good. It's a nice message, but most often, the mists of darkness stick around while we figure out all the hard stuff. When I get to the end of a story like this, I wonder, ""What if the nice in-laws hope for the best for their son's new girlfriend, but really wish he'd find someone that didn't have the emotional baggage of someone who has lived through seventeen years of physical and emotional abuse?"" Or, ""How can these two people not have some serious intimacy issues after being married to who they were married to?"" I know..I just need to enjoy the story, which is really quite interesting. But still, I need things to feel real. While the characters were given obstacles and struggles, which is real and expected, many of theirs felt so big and dramatic that the effect for me was that they felt less real. I do appreciate the message that our Heavenly Father loves us and that he wants us to be happy. I appreciate the inclusion that there is a Savior who is willing and able to heal our pains. To get those kinds of messages from a book, I can see why people enjoy reading LDS fiction. It is uplifting.

Ida Mae Babbitt is the perfect Relief Society President. Ready at a moment's notice to help any and all that fall within the boundaries of her stewardship, she has the time and the resources to be that person, the one that seems to have a limitless supply of how-can-I-help-you. Before serving with my own relief society president, who would give Ida Mae a run for her money, I never would have believed that someone could put this amount of effort into a calling. Now that I've seen it done, Ida Mae seemed like a perfectly believable, refreshingly real character. Having her narrate the story, complete with her own flaws and reasoning, gave the story a snappy, humorous edge. While I truly enjoyed and believed Ida Mae, none of the other characters, except perhaps her crusty counselor, Arlette, who is always knitting an ugly pair of socks, felt real. Her young nephew, Ren, who was central to the idea of enabling his aunt to cross the line from caring Relief Society president to spy due to his interest in technological gadgets, felt especially weak. Whenever he spoke, I didn't feel like it was something a pony-tail-wearing-ear-pierced-twenty-year-old-college-drop out would say. He was just too nice. Too...communicative. My logic needed him to be more withdrawn and confused and much less eager to hang out with his aunt and her middle aged counselors.Still, the writing is solid. Tristi Pinkston, the author of Secret Sisters, does a good job moving her story along and keeping the main plot active. There are a few times when Ida Mae attends to some other RS business that isn't necessary to the main spy plot, but instead of taking away from the momentum, it actually lends itself to develop Ida's character and the town of Omni, where the story takes place. My only real grievance, unfortunately, has to do with the main premise of the story: the spying. No matter that the story is intended to be unlikely and humorous, I could not get over the fact that a relief society president put a surveillance camera in someone's home. I was ready to go along for a farcical ride, but after reading, I felt like the story would have been equally as humorous had the spying been limited to middle age women hiding behind trees or sitting on benches with rain coats, dark sunglasses and hats. I wanted the spying to be much less....well...disturbing. Each time the story mentioned what information they were getting from their ""bug"" on the kitchen refrigerator, and later from another camera they secretly planted in the living room, I imagined the inevitable embarrassment that would arise when the realization that what you thought you were doing in the privacy of your own home, that thing you would NEVER EVER want anyone to know about, came to light. You know, the times that you make up the lyrics to your own musical and sing them loudly. Or what about when you hear your cell phone message alert go off right after you get out of the shower and walk out into the kitchen to get it without any clothes on because no one else is home. Or what about the private talk between husbands and wives. All of those completely acceptable things become mortifying when you add the fact that someone is secretly watching you. And I can't even imagine the havoc and discord that would happen within a ward and community when it became public knowledge that someone in a position of trust did something like that. Oh, I know it's fiction. I get that defense a lot. It's fiction! It's fun! Don't take it too seriously. I know that. But, I have never thought labeling something as fiction means the rules of life no longer apply. In fact, I believe what is funny in real life translates into what's the most funny in literature, and unlawful surveillance placed inside the sanctity of someone's home isn't funny. Like I said earlier, I would have liked it a whole lot more had the spying been more of the old fashioned and less technology dependent kind. Sure, they would have still been breaching the scope of their calling by spying at all, but I think the end result would be a much more easy to digest comedy. I believe this is the first in what will become a series of Ida Mae Babbit books. As I'm a fan of Ida Mae, I'm glad she will continue to serve in her best-of-intentions way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 29, 2010","Apr 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7869462-secret-sisters

I've listened to the Harry Potter books while traveling in other people's cars, but due to my strong dislike of talk radio, sports radio, and any kind of monologue in general, I have shied away from listening to one person read aloud to me. A long road trip forced me to reexamine my prejudice, however, and I downloaded two books from itunes, one being Shutter Island. Consider me converted. Before I knew it, seven hours had passed and I was embedded into Teddy Daniel's conspiracy theory, walking along beside him as he sneaks around the island, searching for the clues he believes Rachel, an escaped mental patient, has left for him. He convinces his partner, Chuck Aule, that there is much more going on at Shutter Island than any of the good doctors would believe. Because it is set in the early 1950s, Teddy's suspicion that the psychiatric hospital is really a front for experimental surgery on the brain patterned after the psychological and surgical experiments the Nazis performed on the Jews during the second world war, the rocky Shutter Island, home to a hospital and prison for the criminally insane is completely plausible. The only nagging concern I had while listening was that I couldn't figure out what was Teddy's motivation for exposing what really happens on Shutter Island. I didn't buy what the author was feeding me: that Teddy was determined to discover the truth because he was a dedicated US Marshall doing his job and sent there on assignment to discover a missing patient, but his secret reason was to find and kill the arsonist he suspects is now a patient on the island who set fire to the apartment building he and his wife lived in, killing his young wife. I mean, o.k..it's a motive, but for the risks this guy was taking, it seemed like a weak,and extremely lackluster one. Then, everything twisted and it turned into one of those stories where the story you thought you were reading wasn't the story at all. Instead, clues you didn't even know were clues were telling the real story, that all fit together at the end. I love stuff like this! Unfortunately, there is a ton of foul language. Lots. The doctors swear, the US Marshalls swear, the patients swear, the orderlies swear...it's pretty rampant.But I still loved it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2010","Mar 13, 2010",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/6322733-shutter-island

Just last weekend, I saw firsthand how my sensitive child was unable to participate in an activity until his younger brother went first, showing it was safe. And it wasn't just that he was unsure or scared for himself. The entire ordeal of watching his brother stressed him out because he was much more aware of all the possible ways it could go wrong. It was really quite something to watch. I consider myself sensitive, so I do empathize with my son and hope to be a better parent to him.

She has a way of explaining a complex idea or lesson in a simple, but not at all dumbed down way. Lowry's story of a young girl living in Denmark during the Nazi occupation, and trying to understand who the Nazis are and what their presence means does just that. When Annemarie Johansen's best friend, Ellen Rose,who is Jewish, moves in with her family and pretends to be her dead sister because her parents are forced to go into hiding in order to avoid being ""relocated"", the questions that arise about why the secrecy is necessary becomes a perfect first exposure to a young reader not experienced with the brutality and horror of the holocaust. Lowry doesn't shy away from any of the fear, cowardliness, bravery, anger, deception, confusion, or strength shown by those who lived through this dark time in history. However, she unfolds the story through the eyes of ten year-old Annemarie so the story is appropriate for that age group. I think this is the very best of young adult or children's literature.

I recognized the title as it showed up as ""to read"" or rated by someone on Goodreads. It was even recommended to me by Amazon.com as something I might enjoy based on what I've recently looked at online (which is helpful but kind of creepy if you think about it). Even with all those nudges and advertising, I felt little desire to read this book. I can't even claim to have any good reason. Truthfully, I had no idea what it was about. The little bit I had heard merely warned me that the vocabulary was advanced and I might want to have a dictionary close by while reading. I may not be a master of language, but I wasn't worried that it would be over my head. So, that wasn't it.The cover was disenchanting. The blue is melancholy and the superimposed girl in pink with boots didn't please me. Yes, I suppose the weird cover may have been the problem. Well, that and the bizarre title. What is a hedgehog? Is that the animal Jan Brett uses in all of her illustrations? It sounds familiar and yet I'm totally unfamiliar with it. I have no frame of reference. Are they elegant?Turns out - no. That's just it. Nothing is as it appears to be. There are layers - with people, with relationships, with understanding. Perspective puts everything, even hedgehogs, in a different light.The description on the book jacket and from most s describe a book containing the philosophies and judgments of two cantankerous women: a twelve year-old genius, Paloma, who has already decided life has no meaning and thus decides to commit suicide and set fire to her family's over-sized luxury four-thousand square foot apartment on her thirteenth birthday, and the building's fifty-four year-old concierge, Renee, who disguises her intelligence and understanding of art, literature and music because she is convinced there is no person willing to respect a member of her class with that amount of knowledge. She knows her place, or at least acknowledges what she assumes others believe it should be. Much of the book is unnecessary. While I found the writing to be engaging and the luxurious placement of lesser known adjectives, verbs and nouns delightful, most chapters are filled with Paloma's and Renee's lectures (you could say rant except most are written too dispassionately to be attributed to emotion) about all that is wrong with the world. The philosophies themselves are interesting to think about, though I disagreed with much of the protagonists' conclusions. The author, Muriel Barbery, who is actually a professor of philosophy, must have found writing the theories and ideas that envelop her professional life into as the thoughts of two fictional characters in a novel tremendously satisfying. Again, however, I don't think most of the narration is all that necessary to what eventually emerges as the central conflict: Renee's and Paloma's deep rooted unhappiness. It certainly develops their characters, as we readers are privy to their points-of view towards the world that surrounds them, but most of it is probably a bit of showing off by the author. Eventually, their stories merge and the plot becomes extremely satisfying as both are touched by the power of love and friendship. I found this theme of redemption through genuine feeling to be a powerful teacher. Both Renee and Paloma have seemingly plenty of tools on hand to create their own happiness - knowledge, privilege, security, access to beauty - and yet none of these things are able to permeate either of their hardened outer shells until Kakuro Ozo comes along. Because of him and his interest, sincerity and kindness, two lonely people finally get a glimpse into the world of what can be. And to think I wasn't going to read this! This book with the ugly cover and the abstract title was going to exist in the same world as me and yet, like Renee and Paloma, I was willing, even determined, to be untouched and unaffected. Thank heavens for the powers of bookclub - spurring readers everywhere to read things they might normally ignore. If you have the slightest inclination to intellectualize things - read this. If you have the tendency to judge - read this. If you want to read a testament that true beauty, real knowledge and what matters most is love - read this!

They both write best sellers that are poorly written and loved by Mormons! I'm not quite sure why Mormons love Vampire vs. Werewolf teen romances, but I don't think it's a fascination unique to them. Mormons love to support celebrity Mormons (there is a buzz whenever one of ""us"" is on any reality TV show) and I'm sure Meyers enjoys some extra numbers in her fan club merely due to the fact that she has that Mormon pedigree: a degree from Brigham Young University and living in Mesa, Arizona. Dan Brown, however, is not LDS, so the reasons why his books get passed around and talked about within our religion community must come from a different place. Again, his fan club is vast and certainly not limited to Mormons, but because his books are centered on religious conspiracy and lost ""truth"", there is a definite angle of understanding we mormons get because our faith began on the notion that truth had been lost, and a lot of the things that know-it-all Robert Langdon discovers jive with what we think. A lost truth supported by Masons that mankind has the potential through knowledge and ritual to become Gods? Umm...yeah. We got that. Of course we want to know why Dan Brown and Masons might think that too. So we read. I love his ideas but I hate his execution. I did not read Angels and Demons but The Lost Symbol is set up exactly like his popular DaVinci Code: each chapter ends with a da-da-da-dum cliffhanger sentence. Chapter after chapter, it started to feel juvenile, as if the only way the author believed his reader would turn the page was if he enticed them with a carrot on a string. Write a good story, Dan, and most readers will eagerly finish a book, no raised eyebrow necessary. As great as his idea for this book was, the conclusion was beyond disappointing. The big reveal was nothing at all. Hundreds of pages, torture, man-hunts, murder and ticking-clock code breaking all for nothing. Or nothing much. Just like The DaVinci Code, the things people are willing to die for are just not worthy of such fellowships and masquerade. It's like Brown spends the entire novel shouting, ""Guess what! Guess what! You're not going to believe this!"" and then whispers, ""I might know something. Maybe."" So dissatisfying.Throw in the fact that he repeats himself much too often (I started to roll my eyes every time he described Noetic Science....again) and used the words ""shaft"" and ""sex organ"" multiple times (don't worry, it isn't a smutty novel although Brown's unnecessary use of a thesaurus makes it seem like it is (""penis"" Dan.

At first glance, I actually thought this would be much appreciated lighter fare among some of my heftier choices. With only ninety-eight pages from start to finish, it's probably more accurately labeled a short story. Those ninety-eight pages, however, took me three weeks to finish.While it didn't actually take me a long time to read, this, as my evening companion, had me choosing almost anything else over reading. TV? Yes. Shoveling snow? Has to be done. Bejewled Blitz on Facebook? It's only a minute (the problem arises when one turns to sixty).When I actually managed to read, the narrative was impressive. Joseph Conrad was Polish and didn't learn English until he was twenty and working on a British merchant ship. Not only did he learn English, he mastered it. The vocabulary and description are both beautiful and complex. There are also layers upon layers of metaphor. Maybe too many layers. Everything was darkness. The water was dark. The forest was dark. The people, chains, moonless night, smoke, room etc. etc. were dark. It felt like a bit much. Sure, he had a thesaurus and used words like murky, black, shady but you still knew - he was talking about darkness. Got it.Upon finishing, I felt a tad superior mocking all the obvious symbolism, as if all of his dark references were the point. Then, I read a few s from people who clearly have had an English class or ten, and they were mentioning his hidden references to Greek mythology and other indirect allusions to more classics I have not read. Like I always do when I'm frustrated, I complained to my mother who assured me all those nuances are what make it a classic. She made me feel better about my classics 101 level of understanding and I'm more than happy to leave Heart of Darkness 403 for people with Greek minors. What made me like this book was the sense of accomplishment when the story was finished. Conrad, with all of his darkness overkill, does not hand this story over on a platter. The narration is tricky. Marlow spends the bulk of the novel speaking in first person, but, occasionally, you realize there is another narrator. It's the guy who is listening to Marlow and there's probably an important reason for that shift of responsibility. That, however, is covered in Heart of Darkness 201. I'm going to let it go.What made me dislike this book was the sense of ""what the heck?"" when the story was finished. Jay read this in high school (in high school, people!) and at one point asked me, ""So, have you been introduced to Kurtz yet?"" He remembered Kurtz, who, I admit, is often mentioned throughout the book. When he asked, I hadn't yet, but his and Marlow's awe while mentioning his name added to an overly-hyped sense of anticipation of Kurtz's contribution to Conrad's novel.Kurtz is hardly in the book. What he does, how he does it, where he does it all seem central to the book, but the details, those things that make sense of the rest of the plot, are never given. I know it has something to do with oppression. And racism. And evil. But, my naive little mind doesn't know how far to go. He dies saying, ""The horror! The horror!"" So, it's probably pretty bad. But I don't know! It's just all so....dark.In any case, I'm ready to move on. I'm embarrassed that this apparent high school level reading so kicked my tail.

I had just been invited to my very first book group, had just given birth to my second son, and had spent the three previous years learning to deal with my new ""big girl"" status. The book, though admittedly racy in several places, made me laugh out loud. I declared myself a fan and lived to regret recommending Good In Bed to too many people who could never appreciate its I'm-embarrassed-that-I'm-bigger-than-my-man perspective. Fast forward a half dozen years and several more Jennifer Weiner novels and I'm much less enthused about the author's latest offering, Certain Girls. Even though Certain Girls progresses the story of Cannie Shapiro, the heroine of Good In Bed, Cannie's character had become much less amusing, much more annoying and just as neurotic as ever. This time, however, Cannie is not the main character. Her daughter, Joy, who is about to be bat-mitzvahed, is. Although Weiner uses the multiple point of view narration technique by having Cannie and Joy alternate narrating by chapter, even when Cannie is speaking, it is about Joy - so it feels very much like Joy's story. And, guess what? Joy has some issues.Some of her issues I really appreciated and wish had been better explored. For instance, Joy really struggles with the knowledge that she was the result of an unplanned and an unwanted pregnancy. In this day and age when more and more people have babies without any commitment as a couple, Joy's inner dialogue opened my eyes to what is probably a hidden hurt in a lot of children of broken or never formed families. Joy's confusion is especially keen as her mother is in the process of actively trying for another baby with a husband she adores. Some of the other issues seemed too inaccessible to be of much concern to me. The book's plot heavily centered on the coming-of-age Jewish tradition of Bar and Bat Mitzvahs. Of course I've heard and seen these types of celebrations in a lot of pop culture, but I have never felt so...left out as I did while reading Certain Girls. It is very...er....Jewish. I have no problem with Jewish things. Love the Jews. But the book is billed, marketed and packaged as a much more mainstream novel. It could be except for all the heavy emphasis about Joy's, and all her friends, Bat Mitzvahs. I had no background to understand the cultural significance, or why in the world this formerly loving mother and daughter team were at such odds with each other over what I considered a fancy birthday party. Obviously, it is more than that, but I think it's more than a little presumptuous to assume that the lay reader should and would understand that. All of the exclusive Jewish references were a turn off to me. Lastly, and she seems to do this in all of her stories, the ending was just...too....much. Weiner is a funny girl. Humor is her strength. However, she can't seem to help hyper inflating the drama! It is never your every-day-run-of-the-mill-I've-been-there-too kind of upheaval. Instead, it's the ""Seriously? Who does this?"" kind of thing. While I warned myself to expect an unnecessary dramatic climax, even I couldn't have foreseen the ""huh? Why'd she do that?"" ending. Dumb. With everything added together, the result is a mediocre book. I didn't hate it but there was little to love either. I think I may have outgrown Jennifer Weiner as a storyteller. There are too many other books out there to read to give Weiner, or Cannie, for that matter, any more chances....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Oct 2009,"Nov 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/421549.Certain_Girls

Then, just as suddenly, everyone was going to the movie. And liking it! I wasn't tempted to do either, and felt a bit out-of-sorts being so out of vogue. Still, I knew I didn't care to read about a woman who had tried all of Julia Child's recipes found in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking."" Frankly, french cooking turns me off and besides watching Dan Aykroyd satire Julia Child on Saturday Night Live, I didn't really know much about the famous chef either. When this book showed up in my mailbox as part of a long-distance book club I joined, destiny laughed in my face at my attempt to snub a popular book. So I read it. Turns out, my first instinct was the right one.Julie & I (did you see what I did there? Huh? Clever, eh?), the woman who fundamentally hates republicans, seems to have little respect for a husband who amazingly seems to respect her, and who can't seem to formulate a sentence without flaunting her I-will-throw-in-the-F-bomb-anytime-I-feel-like-it mentality, would not get along. While we both like to blog, and probably both imagine ourselves to be a lot more important than we actually are, we have very little common ground. For some very undeveloped reason, she begins an obsessive journey to cook all of the hundreds of recipes found in Child's recipe book within the time frame of one year. Never mind that it means she will have to eat things she finds disgusting, feed meals to her friends, family and husband that they find disgusting, and spend money she doesn't have on ingredients she can't find - she apparently just has to do it!Lucky for her, her meaningless obsession turned into a lucrative book deal and even more lucrative movie deal. We should all be so rewarded for focusing the majority of our time and energy on something that benefits so few, if any. I think, however, that because her story got made into a book, and, crazily, a movie with huge movie stars, her experience was validated as meaning something. It changed her. I guess. Gave her something to proudly say she accomplished. I guess. Gave her free range to cuss and cuss at anyone who minded that she cussed. Definitely.O.K. I'll admit it - her tacky swearing in print annoyed me. Why in the world would someone writing a memoir, with time and a thesaurus and editors on hand, choose to use such a trashy and limited vocabulary in something that will last well beyond their own short life? I get it in novels. Some characters think and speak like that. I even get it in non-fiction. Hey, much of life is R-rated. But, in a memoir? In a I'm-a-pretty-funny-lady memoir? That's the word you want to use when you have time and plenty of alternatives available? In the end, I just wanted it to end. I wanted to know how and if all the eggs and cream and butter and bone marrow mattered. They don't. I was tired of reading about her messy and absolutely nauseating kitchen (maggots, people. Maggots.) I was really, really tired of Julie. Not Julia, because she's hardly in the book, but Julie. That last page, which took awhile to get to after a couple of cruel false endings, couldn't come quick enough. I still haven't seen the movie. I've heard it is better than the book. But, I'm weary and untrusting now. Meryl and Amy might manage to salvage this story, but I'll never know because I'm not going to succumb a second time.

After all, it's not like I know Elna Baker, author and comedienne living in New York City. So, why would her memoir about balancing her doubts with her faith within her sparsely-populated Mormon world have me feeling all kinds of righteous indignation? I can only compare it to the feelings that arise when listening to someone else complain about your own family. Oh, no you didn't! Only I get to rant and whine and poke fun at our flaws and imperfections. You can sympathetically nod in understanding, but there is no speaking. There is no voicing of your own opinions. Honestly, even though I don't know Elna Baker, the fact that she is mormon, and I am mormon gives us a common bond stronger than most outsiders would realize. While she made a decent effort to describe some of our positive, like the strength she receives from her parents, her family and her faith, her expose and hatchet job on some of the negative, poorly understood and sacred felt like a betrayal. Who is this girl anyways? How did People Magazine get wind of her book? And why is she telling the world that she let a guy from work she didn't even like touch her boobs because of a bet? O.K. Those three months might not have been enough time. On one hand, I really enjoyed this book. Baker is funny, smart and real - all qualities I admire and appreciate. The early chapters of the book are filled with a light, self-deprecating humor that I find appealing. Although it's not all sunshine and roses as she describes a humiliating (but really, really funny) awkward moment with her high school crush, struggles with her weight and the feeling of loneliness when you're the one that's not quite like the others, her attitude and ability to laugh make her a heroine any reader wants to cheer on. On the other hand, however, there are so many things that really bugged me about this book - from its premise to ultimate purpose. Why did Elna Baker write this book? To make money? To further her career in comedy? Does she really struggle with her faith, as she claims, or is that a ruse to excuse some pretty bad behavior? I can't figure it out because by the book's end, Baker herself still seems unable to figure it out. I'm not faulting a person for questioning her childhood faith, nor do I find the circumstances Baker finds herself in to be all that unusual (except for being propositioned by an unnamed Warren Beatty-esque celebrity in a bar. That was weird). Enjoying the attention that comes from being considered attractive by the worlds' standards is very natural. Wanting to have sex with someone you are attracted to and, moreover, really like, is pretty normal. If her point was that mormons have hormones too, then she made it. And made it. And made it.I hate to punish Baker for publishing her experiences and feelings, because, like anything author, she has that right. But, with her title and blanket statements about what we do and don't do, believe and don't believe, she managed to lump the rest of us mormons into her book as well and I, for one, didn't hire her to be my religious ambassador. Her apathetic attitude towards honesty annoyed me. She ""ha ha""d it by saying she likes to say, ""Yes"" whenever she can, but when her ""yesses"" land her on a cruise ship, making motivational toasts because she yessed her way up the corporate ladder, I actually call that lying. Call me boring and no fun, but I do. And, Elna, guess what? You forgot to mention that mormons aren't supposed to lie. You frequently pointed out all our other ""thou shalt nots"" (drink alcohol, smoke, have sex before marriage, have dances that are actually fun) but somehow, that whole ""Be Honest"" slipped your mind. So did honoring your mother and father. Really, apologizing to your parents before the book even starts for using the F-bomb seven times doesn't actually make it better. Oh, I had so much more I wanted to say, but I'm tired and waiting for three months has blurred a lot of details. Read it. Don't read it. It doesn't really matter much.  But, if you do read it, please know that the vast majority of mormons I know, even those that are single, don't spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about becoming a God or Goddess. We're a little weird, we make mistakes, sometimes really big ones, but most are basic, decent people who are trying to do our best to follow the commandments we believe our Heavenly Father gave us, even the super dorks who seem to find their way to dance after dance after dance.I hope Elna finds her place. I hope she uses her obvious light and talent for good. And I hope that when she does eventually wear lingerie, at the right place and at the right time, that she wears it as its meant to be worn and not how she describes it in her book.

One of thEarlier this year, before my goal to read twenty classics was set, I told myself that 2009 was going to be the year that I tried new things. One of those things was to read - not watch, not hear about - but read a Shakespeare play.My parents, who have his full works on display on shelves in their living room, suggested I start with Romeo and Juliet, because it's the most familiar and would be the easiest story to get used to his language. If this is his easiest, then I'm in trouble.Reading Romeo and Juliet ranks only slightly easier than reading a novel in french. I have enough background in french to recognize many verbs, most pronouns and my vocabulary is probably that of a 1st or 2nd grader, so a lot of the time, I can get the gist, if not the actual meaning. Sort of like, ""He is ....something. Or....They went.....somewhere."" O.K. So I don't read a lot of french (but I wish I could!) I understood a lot more than that of Romeo and Juliet, but probably a lot due to the fact that I've seen Baz Luhrmann's movie where they speak the dialogue set in a modern day setting. Do you remember Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes? I love that movie! It's really the only movie I like Leo in. That scene, right after he kills Tybalt, after Tybalt had killed Mercutio - I loved his raw emotion! Oh..wait. I'm ing a book. Hold on.See, this is what I did while I read. I'd read, remember the scene and then understand what was going on. I'm not trying to paint myself as stupid, but without help, whether in visual form or from someone who can give a little background or definition to some of the forgotten or unusual vocabulary, Shakespeare is hard to understand. The edition I read had footnotes and I used them. They definitely helped and by play's end, I felt like I had read it. Not skimmed it, but read and understood it. Mission accomplished!In addition to the actual play, which isn't very long, I read a half dozen pre and post essays written by experts in the field of Shakespeare. Covering topics such as his own biography (men are never as good as I wished they were - even Shakespeare himself), the debate about his authorship, the source of Romeo and Juliet, the nature of trajedies and what the stage set-up would have looked like in Shakespeare's day, I felt at the end of all my reading that I had taken a hearty class about Shakespeare. Of course, I would much prefer the interaction you find in a class with a teacher, but I proudly admit to being educated by reading this. I'm better informed and now hold knowledge that I think will benefit me in life. Shakespeare's plays aren't only entertaining, but the phrases and plot outlines are used and recreated everywhere. For instance, did you realize The Lion King is an adaptation of Hamlet? As helpful as the movie adaptations are (I love Hamlet with Mel Gibson, Much Ado About Nothing with Emma Thompson and Henry V with Kenneth Branagh. I even like a more modern retelling like 10 Things I Hate About You (The Taming of the Shrew)), I think toiling through the language of Shakespeare is worth the effort. Hard to understand? Yes. Lacking the emotion that comes with the intended acting? Definitely. But sometimes, you need to put the scripture readers down and pick up the scriptures. The stories are nice and important, but getting the spirit from the original source, along with all the text, will remind you that even four-hundred years ago, the same prejudices, ignorance, mob mentality, rivalries, young love and 20/20 hindsight existed. In Romeo and Juliet, he just used a different and more extensive vocabulary to describe it all.I think Shakespeare performed a great service by commemorating 14th and 15th century life through plays. By doing so, he connected generations of humanity....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 08, 2009","Oct 10, 2009",,School & Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/768005.Romeo_and_Juliet

This was a book I was reading with Seth, and my one-chapter-a-night reading pace became too slow as we approached the book's exciting climax. As I read the final chapters aloud, Seth sheepishly admitted that he had read ahead on his own and already knew what happened.

I'm curious to learn how the story continues, but months have passed, and I haven't followed my son's example.So...maybe some of my enthusiasm for the series came from my nine-year-old. It certainly seems that way. I do recommend this book and its Fablehaven family to the young advanced reader. The plot and language are complicated enough to challenge and entertain most. The lessons they learn about obedience, trust, commitment and honor are ones any parent can feel comfortable with.

His is a name attached to great legal precedent much like Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade. Sadly, I recognized the name but didn't really know his story - only that it involved slavery. Shame on me. Mark L. Shurtleff, Attorney General for the state of Utah, admits to becoming fascinated by Scott's case while in law school. Years of personal research, in addition to his studies, motivated him to write an incredibly thorough account of who Dred Scott was and the events in his life that led to his infamous case before the 1857 United States Supreme Court who decided by a seven to two majority that persons of African descent were not citizens of the United States. Included in their opinion was that the black man, whether freed or slave, had no right to legal recourse in Federal Court, and that the Missouri Compromise, which allowed slaves who became free by traveling to states where slavery was illegal to remain free, was unconstitutional. In short, Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that a black man was not a man and had no rights. Wow. While a summary the Scott v. Sandford case might easily enough be described in a paragraph or two, the hows and the whys of this case cannot. Shurtleff, befitting his profession, gives justice to Scott's story by putting it in context. Who was Roger Taney? Why did his former owners, the Blow family, support his bid for freedom when they themselves didn't free Scott before selling him to John Emerson? Who was the Sandford in Sandford v. Scott? Knowing who these people were in relation to Scott is important but understanding their own histories and backgrounds, and the life events that placed them in Scott's trajectory certainly fuel Shurtleff's hypothesis, along with many others, that this case, and the fallout that stemmed from it, were directly responsible for electing of Abraham Lincoln as our sixteenth president in 1860. He certainly convinced me. When asked to  Am I Not A Man as part of an online book tour, I asked the senior editor of the publishing company what kind of feedback she was looking for. She replied, ""Honest feedback."" That I can do. I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. From the book's beginning, Shurtleff can't seem to decide if he's writing a novel or a biography. Being the novel lover that I am, I felt frustrated each time Shurtleff left Scott's character to write in legalese, give a US history lesson or, worse, sermonize with hindsight. I just wanted him to pick one style of writing because the transition between the novel and biography, and even, sometimes, a legal textbook, didn't work. It felt choppy and detracted from the overall quality of his writing, which was really good. While I can't say the problem worked itself out, I can say that I cared less about it as the book continued because I genuinely wanted to know what happened next - regardless of style. This is an important story to know and I am a better person for knowing it. Dred Scott's legacy not only comes from the equality he helped bring to all men regardless of race, but it also includes his shining example of how mankind should be: patient, true, forgiving, humble, loyal, curious, full of hope, full of charity and trusting in his creator to endure to the end. I cheerfully recommend it to anyone with a desire to better understand our nation's history and the struggle of a slave AND man: Dred Scott. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 16, 2009","Oct 04, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6697292-am-i-not-a-man-the-dred-scott-story

According to the cover, this is the story of an actual woman in history who rose to become the pope while living in disguise as a man in the 8th century. Never having heard of the book, or the historical figure who was the inspiration behind it, I looked forward to reading something that stretched me.Almost immediately, I found myself disliking the book. I'm not sure why, but I can't deny the eye rolling or negative comments that found their way from my pen to the page. Things were not looking good. Joan was obnoxiously smart and good and quick to understand and everyone else around her, save a non-religious priest and non-religious midwife, were superstitious, ignorant or, like her own father who was a priest, just plain mean. It is the black and white of it all that drives me crazy. Surely Joan (later to be known as John) had a bad habit. Surely her father had some redeeming quality. It couldn't all be beatings and head shavings, could it? Why, yes it could, according to author Donna Cross.Whenever I read about the dark ages, I'm frustrated with the lack of...well...humanness portrayed. Were people fundamentally different then? Life obviously wasn't good. No one could read. The catholic church and aristocracy were corrupted and made life miserable and dangerous for anyone not protected within its sphere. All things considered, labeling the time as ""dark"" is probably better than the centuries deserved.Still, any existence must make room for some goodness. It's impossible to extinguish entirely, I believe. Its scatterings must have been found in more than a handful of people. All of those people who couldn't write, couldn't leave records - I bet some of them were good. In books like these, however, they are always relegated to the background, chanting, ""Witch!"" or taking their kids to see the local hanging. I simply can't understand that atmosphere.Back to the book, Cross more than allows Joan to be good. More accurately, Joan hovers around saint level. She is everything to cheer for and nothing to root against. Which makes me wonder.I'll try to not ruin anything for future readers, but according to the author, there are historical facts upon which the story is based. While discounted by the catholic church as mere anti-papal legend, Cross asserts there was a pope referred to as John that legitimately shows up in some histories but not in others due to attempts to cover-up the scandal. In the histories that exist, this Pope John was only discovered as a woman when ""he"" miscarried after falling off a horse on a public street.From there, there is only conjecture of how this could happen. To become pope, she must have been learned. She must have had an education, which was forbidden for girls during this time. She must have had help infiltrating the male world. Lastly, she must have had sex in order to have a miscarriage.Cross's Joan is noble and brave, always trying to do the right thing, and only becomes pope because she is so smart and good and the good people put her in position to thwart the bad people from gaining power.That's one possibility.I kept going back to the ""facts"". The woman who would become pope was a known liar. She pretended she was a man. She was also pregnant. Hmmmmmm. Maybe, just maybe she wasn't that...good.It doesn't really matter, but the characterization of her and her lover, who was equally brave and good, bothered me enough to keep me from liking this book. But, it is not without merits.Cross does a really good job of placing the reader in the dark ages. It felt like the year 900. The lack of opportunity for women was horrific. The injustice of the courts was maddening. The threat of a viking attack and need for fortification were all aptly defended.If you love historical fiction, this is probably right up your alley.

And then there are booo-oooo-oooo-ooks! (That only makes sense if you remember Ellen DeGeneres guest judging So You Think You Can Dance. Even then, it might not make sense, but it's what's in my head so I'm going with it) This is a booo-oooo-oooo-ook! Dostoevsky (which is an incredibly fun name to say) uses the backdrop of murder and family discord to delve into the much deeper topics of love, human morality and the existence of God. When it's good, it's very, very good. There is a section of the book when one of the Karamazov brothers, Aloysha, writes his mentor, the Elder Zosima's, history and testament of God's love towards mankind. It is beautiful and faith building.When it is bad, on the other hand, it's pretty awful. Not the writing exactly, as Dostoevsky was clearly using tactics and technique when writing certain characters, but more of the experience of reading the writing. It was tedious! Dimitri especially, the Karamazov brother Dostoevsky uses to highlight the tortured soul of the morally confused, was exhausting to read. As the author used a lot of conversation and the character's speech to progress the plot, the chapters when I had to stick with Dimitri, and his angst, and woe-is-me dramatics, repeating himself over and over but only when he wasn't interrupting himself with another thought, got on my nerves. As soon as I'd get used to Dimitri, he'd switch to Ivan, or Fyodor Pavlovich, or Smerdyakov, or Grushenka. Each time, I'd have to find a new rhythm. Needless to say, I found reading more than one chapter at a time difficult. As a result, it took me FOREVER to finish this book.So, it leaves me with this question: If a good book is so inaccessible, is it still a good book? Does a famous book's readability factor into its greatness at all? Again, the writing itself isn't inaccessible. Dostoevsky has a very casual and even comic tone to his prose. It's the flow that's the problem. Constantly jumping around from character to character, in time and perspective. At the book's end, with over a hundred pages left, the narrator announces the outcome of the murder trial. He then spends the next sevently-five pages writing the closing arguments for both sides of the trial. Why? Why tell me the verdict beforehand? I'm sure there is a reason, but I certainly don't know it. The end ties it all together but I felt worn out and not at all triumphant when I finished. Mostly, I felt relief. I want to love it, because I loved parts and because it's a famous book about really big ideas and wouldn't I look smart if I read it and got it and loved it? Whew. Deep novel.

The boy must be the One, right?Well, of course. He is. Little Peekay is sensitive boy. He gets, at an unusually young age, that some things matter and some don't and like any decent literary hero, the things that matter to him are the good things in life. Truth. Dignity. Honor. These virtues seem to come to him naturally, because his family life is sadly lacking. His mother is a negligent born-again who tears him away from the only mother he's ever known - a Zulu who talks to him, unlike his own blood relatives, and teaches him her ways. His love for her is a theme that carries throughout the novel.Which brings me back to the idea of the ""One."" This nurse-maid also becomes a ""One."" As the story follows Peekay throughout his life in a harsh South Africa, colorful characters all take their turn being powerful ""one""s - or influences in Peekay's life. Peekay is the tie that holds this goodness together, but through him and with their collective help, that one became many and the many became one. It's a beautiful idea and masterfully told by Bryce Courtenay.If you read it, you'll fall in love with Peekay, his boxing mentor, Hoppie, Doc, and even a chicken, Grandpa Chook. You'll also learn a lot about boxing and the struggle between the Afrikaners and English as well as their mutual mistreatment of blacks in their country.

They don't really follow the same thought, so I'll just explain them separately with no attempt to connect the two. First, some background. Set in the future when time is measured in AF (After Ford), the inhabitants of the Brave New World are all created in-vitro with a process that creates multiple divisions of a single egg, producing sets of identical people. These groups of embryos are then determined into a class (Alpha-Epsilon) and while gestating in their test tubes, exposed to stimuli that will condition them for their lives. Each group is taught that every class is important to for the society, as a whole, to work. For example, Epsilons, the lowest form of human, are not allowed to fully mentally develop so that they will never challenge their positions doing mundane menial tasks. Alphas, on the other hand, are considered the very best of society, and are developed in order to fill the most most important roles: researchers, lab controllers, songsters, writers etc. In other words, those who live in the Alpha world are conditioned to think and be creative, but only in a manner that is deemed acceptable, as we understand by following the troubled Bernard Marx and Hemholtz Watson, who are both aware of the danger that exists should their unorthodox thinking be discovered. Promiscuous sex, drug use and euthanasia at 60 is also encouraged in this futuristic utopia. What I noticed right away was the obvious lack of agency. My own beliefs put a supreme importance on agency, opposition or as John the Savage (the protagonist who was raised outside of ""civilized"" society) the ""right to choose unhappiness."" By creating a world where ""Everyone is happy"" it is easy to see that no one really is. Sure, there is no disease and everyone is beautiful and there is no one who has less or more than they can use or enjoy, but their dependence on soma (apparently a safe hallucinatory drug) to keep things running smoothly indicates a false existence. I kept thinking, ""This is Satan's plan!"" (which, I have to admit I sometimes think when I hear socialists talk about making things ""fair""). As I completed the book, however, I had another disturbing thought. When the citizens make comments that replace ""God"" with ""Ford"", I wondered if Huxley had really created a new world or simply replaced our current acceptable morality with a different, more shocking one. Instead of families being the ideal, the idea of a mother actually giving birth, nursing and caring for her young was considered obscene - pornographic really. But...there was still the idea that pornography or obscenity were undesirable and to be shunned. It was just the matter of what was being shunned that had changed. Likewise, the ""everybody belongs to everybody else"" mantra to encourage promiscuity instead of monogamy is just a flip of what we consider decent. The alternative was considered dangerous and anti-social, but only because different morals were considered the norm. But, I don't believe we live in an anti-agency society, so Huxley's Brave New World can't really be that similar to our own. I don't think Huxley was satirizing our own moral conditioning so I'm pretty sure I'm wrong about that one....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 11, 2010","Sep 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World

While I think that many times a book deserves to be disliked for those very reason, some books, and I'm including The Awakening in that category, aren't meant to be liked. Rather, they are meant to expose part of the human condition.The Awakening tells the story of a young married mother, Edna Pontellier, living a privileged life in Victorian Age New Orleans. She has all the advantages life has to offer: beauty, wealth, hired help, healthy children, devoted husband and an entire summer to vacation at the beach but exists in an emotional fog, neither happy nor unhappy. When she falls in love with Robert, a man who is not her husband, she ""awakens"" for the first time. She goes on to act consciously for the first time in her life, choosing to abandon her husband who she does not love, let go of her children who she only seems to remember if she is actually physically looking at them (then she thinks she'll explode from love for them), and eventually commits the ugly act of adultery. I get that these are not good choices to make but what resonated with me was the way Chopin had her own them. Edna decided that she would rather have a real life than merely a neat one just as all women (and men) must eventually choose between. That does not mean that a real life cannot be neat. This character could just as easily ""awakened"" and chosen to devote herself to her family in a way that she never really had before, develop a relationship with her husband and run away from the temptations that will cause pain and humiliation to her family. In this case, she doesn't, but I appreciate the author highlighting the need to live a genuine life - fully awake....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 27, 2010",Aug 2010,"Sep 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58345.The_Awakening

Its main protagonist, Dagny Taggert, is a woman ahead of her time who understands how to successfully run a railroad. Her brother, Jim, heads up Taggert Transcontinental in appearance only and focuses most of his limited ability making deals with Washington that essentially cripple his own railroad and other big businesses and make Dagny's job as Vice President of Operations more and more burdensome. He and others do this out of jealousy, frustration and a feeling that letting those who can, do, isn't fair to those who can't or won't. The essentials of fiction are present: characters, plot, a setting, conflict, motive and moral, but each is so narrowly defined and controlled by the author that her philosophy, Objectivism, becomes the main focus. Her characters are presented as ""good"" or ""bad"" with nobody, not even secondary characters, anywhere in between. Rand defends this style saying she doesn't use average people as her characters. O.K. I'll go along with that. Except, after awhile, none of these people seem real. None of them have personalities, only goals or agendas. The ""good"" guys are always rational, always decent (even if they pretend to the world that they aren't) and always, always right. The ""bad"" guys are always irrational, snarky, slick and shrill. All of the ""bad"" guys refuse to take responsibility for any action and won't until they are assured someone else will, whereas the good guys never pass the buck, and there is no room for compromise. Ever. There is right and there is wrong. Black and White. Moral and immoral. Good and Evil. Capitalism and socialism and never the twain shall meet. Moreover, in a style that seems ostentatious nowadays, Rand rarely passes over an opportunity to declare her beliefs without using a tedious monologue. I was interested, truly, in learning more about the author's controversial declaration that man must be selfish in order to be good, but to shovel it to me in sixty continuous pages via John Galt's hijack of the radio waves towards the end of a very, very long book, isn't very neatly disguised fiction. That's an essay. If she did happen to use the much easier to digest format of conversation between two characters, the majority of the time it was structured as questions and answers, with the answers short and perfunctory, creating a feeling of barely tolerable boredom. The book's overall feeling was one of repression and hopelessness. No one, not the good guys or the bad guys, were ever happy. For me, this is a seriously flawed approach to persuade anyone about anything. Man's search for happiness is...well...what life is all about, isn't it? Rand kept telling us, over and over again, how that happiness is to be achieved, but to devote eleven-hundred pages to tell the story of weary capitalists who could be happy if everyone else would just get the hell out of their way isn't exactly the way to seek out convert capitalists. Overall, I cannot subscribe to the philosophy contained with the pages of Atlas Shrugged because I don't believe it actually leads to happiness. I think it leads to a productive economy. Oh yes, I whole heartedly agree that capitalism feeds the world. As Atlas Shrugged implies, if the government didn't interfere with the copper industry's production, they would be able to produce more copper at less cost to sell to steel manufacturers who could then produce cheaper steel to sell to the automobile industry and railroad industry and airplane industry and on and on and on. As Rand states, the freedom ""to make money"" not to have it handed to you or taken from you or passed down to you from generation to generation is one of the things that has made America great. However, only one side of the story is told here. Rand assumes that people with great minds always have the best motives. Selfish as they may seem, they merely want to do what they do best without interference but without harm or malice to anyone else. Sadly, I don't think this is true. I think history has shown more consistently that instead of a lassez-faire economy leading to virtue, more often that economy allows those with power to become corrupt. Rand unfairly highlights that tendency only within the ranks of the evil socialists who want to take any power and ability away from their productive rivals but never addresses what happens when a producer or businessman uses pure capitalism for his or her own evil purposes. Still, it felt eerie to read about all of the laws and government positions created to control the economic market during this novel's fictional setting. Just today, I read about the financial reform bill that President Obama signed into law that will protect American consumers from the selfishness of Big Banks. The following article on the page was how the administration extended jobless benefits, in effect promising millions if not billions of dollars to those who are not working to be transferred from those who are. I'm not kidding, those articles would have fit into Atlas Shrugged with perfect context, not changing a single thing. It does make one wonder how much additional strain our humongous government, with all their agencies and bureaucracy, puts on yours and my pocketbooks. Because we pay for it all. The goods and the government making sure those goods get to us fairly. Finally, I'm not sure how to balance politics with belief. The things Rand mocks are notions of humanity, sacrifice, fairness and love. She claims to view them in any lens besides that of justice and what a person has earned is not only wrong but evil. To love someone who has not earned our love is not love. It's giving in to the looters. To have compassion for someone will less ability is to support the looters. She made those qualities laudable and easy to digest because those in her story who did not produce, or in other words, the ""bad"" guys, were schmucks. Mothers, brothers, wives, children -- it didn't matter. The complained and expected a free ride, every one of them. Of course it was easy to declare that they didn't deserve it. But I believe otherwise. I am that schmuck who believes that faith, hope and charity matter. Sorry, Ayn. I'm not even going to start about how retarded the love stories were. Pluh-ese. All of those men in love with the same woman but totally ok with who she eventually chooses because they love him too and who cares that they all still are sexually attracted to her and her to them. It'll all work out because their kind of love, love of industry and work, is all so pure and rational and.....no...I can't go there. It's too ridiculous.This is not a mediocre book nor is it bad or great. As a work of fiction, it is rather dull. On the other hand, as a look into the ramifications of punishing those who make our economic world spin - merely because they make money doing it - it is seriously eye opening. Its unflinching confidence about how the world does, can and should work secures its place as a classic, for both those who love it and for those who hate it....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 14, 2010","Jul 21, 2010","Sep 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged

Several have clocked in at over a thousand pages, such as this one, but this is the first whose ending came too soon for me. I loved it so much I wanted more. Let me tell you why.First and foremost, Gone With The Wind has multiple levels. I adore books that successfully pull this off. For example, should you want a simple romance (although there is nothing simple about Scarlett and Ashley, Ashley and Melanie or Scarlett and Rhett's romances), it's there. Want a coming of age story? You got it. Need social commentary? Yes. Want historical and geographical insight? Chalk full of it. Isolate this story into any of these genres and you've got several versions of a good story. Combine them all and you have a classic masterpiece. In short, it's really got something for everyone: man, woman, and teen. I think that's why the movie was/is as successful as it is. It gives bits and sometimes more than bits of most of these levels that make it accessible to nearly everyone. In fact, it is more than fair to say that the movie is an excellent and accurate adaptation of the book. The skeleton and many of the muscles are left completely intact. Characters were cast pretty near perfectly to the author's description and the dialogue remains mostly unchanged. However, much like the details of our skin and features make the man, the unabridged inclusion of the area's Civil War history, deeper character development, and more realistically nuanced plot of the book make the complete package a stunning model. The fact that Mitchell wrote such a multi-layered book would have made me an ardent fan all on its own, but the fact that she drove along her story with main characters so fabulously flawed and unlikable (but not bad) undams my inner gush. I mean, she takes this absolutely shallow and conceited girl and gives her strength and determination. Which do you cheer for? Those qualities aren't supposed to be combined! Ahhh, but they are so you have to root for Scarlett O'Hara to succeed because you need something or someone to win within that collapsing society, even though you know she, on principle, deserves to fail because she cheats. She lies. She throws decency asunder. But she survives because she's willing and morally able to get her hands dirty. I still can't decide if I'm meant to like her or hate her. Then comes Ashley who is profoundly more developed in the book than the pretty gentleman character we see in the movie. Ashley is an ideal Southern gentleman. I found it interesting that even Southerners didn't appreciate his fondness for books, music and ideas. Even to them, his refinement as a man was less desirable than had he preferred to drink and hunt like the majority of his land-owning peers. For those who don't know, Ashley is the man who Scarlett becomes fixated with as a young woman and idolizes to the point of fantasy to fuel most of her motivation. Unlike Scarlett, Ashley cannot adapt either to the war or after the war. For me, he is the face of Gone With The Wind. A man with no marketable skills, he loves his wife but lusts after Scarlett, a distinction the very surprisingly sexually naive Scarlett does not understand (I say surprising because she was so quick to pick up on other areas of...er......business matters). I really did enjoy Mitchell using their frustrating relationship to highlight the contrast between Scarlett and Ashley, in both their motivation and understanding. With Ashley comes Melanie, his sweet wife, who is a good soul. Melanie IS the kind of character you love to root for because she is smart and good and kind. But with her good qualities comes a noticeable lack of strength. Not moral strength, for the author gave her plenty of that, but her physical weakness kept her from becoming an idealized caricature instead keeping her withing the realm of possible. At times, Melanie seemed...well...too good to be true but then the author would have her help bury a burglar Scarlett murdered or lie to the police about the KKK (which seems so sympathetic in this story) or ultimately confide that she knows her husband can't take care of himself. Finally, there is Rhett Butler who, in my opinion, is the most faceted character but least understood. Rhett, who regularly behaves badly, but for seemingly different reasons than Scarlett, mocks the values of his fellow Southerners. He admires the scruples of Scarlett, who beguiles him with her temper tantrums and spoiled nature and continuously encourages her to be her worst self. Unlike Ashley, he freely admits his lust for Scarlett but her naivety again plays a role in that she never acknowledges those feelings within herself and consistently rebuffs his advances in favor of her childlike affection for Ashley. Rhett woos and woos, and in turn becomes the one person Scarlett can turn to for help, but it's never without strings attached which makes liking him complicated. Was he just one of those men who only likes the chase or is there a deeper, kinder, more misunderstood person beneath his devil-may-care surface? Mitchell certainly hints at this and Rhett is often portrayed as one deserving sympathy, but this side of him is never quite exposed so I don't think the reader can ever be entirely sure who Rhett Butler is. I shouldn't have written ""finally"" because there are many, many more interesting and wonderful characters to flesh out this story. The slaves, the neighbors, the other husbands, the relatives. Even the settings become characters as I became acquainted with Atlanta and rural Georgia in a way I never have before. All of their stories make Gone With The Wind what it is: a fully developed voice for the side of history that usually doesn't get one - the side who lost. There you have it. A losing side, characters behaving badly in an era and part of the country I have no ties to and I loved it all. I felt it all. I saw it all.

Of course, this is the case, but I was surprised by how well the musical captures the essence of this amazing book. Unlike a lot of screen adaptations, most of the essential elements of the book remain intact for the play. Because I was already so familiar with the plot (I have seen the musical five times, maybe more), I felt my attention gravitate towards the familiar parts of the story and, in turn, felt almost impatient when the narration turned towards the unfamiliar. As a result, I can't decide if I'm glad I knew the story as well as I did, for I felt my spirits rise each time I recognized a favorite scene and could sing along in my head (and sometimes out loud), or if my repeated exposure to the musical hampered my ability to fully enjoy the added dimensions of Hugo's complete masterpiece. I had been warned and was therefore prepared for the famous tangents concerning Waterloo, the description of the streets of Paris and the essay on the benefits and drawbacks of modern sewage systems. Perhaps because I was anticipating these sections, they seemed... separate, somehow from the rest of the novel. It's not just these three sections, but I felt Hugo used two styles and two different voices to write Les Miserables. There were the character sections of the books, where conversation, description and conflict moved the plot along and then there were the essay sections when the author seems to say, ""Hold up, I want to explain something first before moving on."" And then he would. For pages and pages and pages. He explained what he thought about capitalism and socialism, crime and punishment, religion, monasteries, war, forgiveness, mercy, death and more. I think i could turn to any page in the book and immediately tell if Hugo was in explanation mode or story-telling mode. In my eyes, they didn't blend. Both were interesting, although I admit to preferring the storyline, but I didn't always feel like I was reading one complete story. It took me a month to finish reading and I can't say, like my husband and many others, that this is the best book I have ever read. Without a doubt, it is one of the best stories about morality, justice and mercy ever conceived and written. But I don't feel like I got more of what makes Les Miserables so great, with all of the extra stuff. More information, more depth, more characters, more background, even more story - yes. But more feeling? I don't think so. At least I didn't feel it. But, that may be the result of a long month talking.It feels weird to write as if the book disappointed me. It didn't. I loved it.

It's fabulous.My problem in writing a  is wondering what, if anything, matters. Did Dumas write this for pure entertainment? If that is the case, then the novel is an out of the ballpark success. Drama, intrigue, suspense, revenge and subterfuge all craftily woven together that make every one of its twelve-hundred plus pages worth it.However.If this is supposed to be some great lesson in morality, particularly about the existence of God, the effects of vengeance or revenge, or even the great balance between justice and mercy, I think there could be some bones to pick.Before I pick, I must admit to wondering if reading the book was even necessary. I am a fan of the James Caviezal as Edmond Dantes movie version and for the first couple hundred pages, felt the few differences between the movie and book were inconsequential. Of course, as is always the case, there were more details, more depth to the characters, but the set up was the same. Edmond was a stand-up guy, engaged to his beautiful Mercedes and happy and lucky in love and life. Then, jealous rivals and a situation of unfortunate coincidence remove him from his simple bliss and he spends the next fourteen years locked up for made-up crimes without any possibility of recourse or explanation. It nearly drives him insane, until he meets a fellow prisoner who, mistakenly thinking he was digging a tunnel to escape, digs a tunnel between their own two cells. As the passageway enables them to enjoy each other's company, the elder prisoner spends years passing on his vast knowledge to his eager student, eventually including information about a mammoth undiscovered treasure. All that is left is for Edmond to find a way to escape, collect his treasure and decide what he wants to do with his freedom and fortune.All of that happens as the movie explained it to me. It is clever in the movie and just as clever in the book. At this point of the story, however, the book becomes a maze of plot development compared to the movie's much simplified stroll-down-a-lighted-main-street approach. I liked the maze. I appreciated Dumas thinking I could handle the maze. Because, let me tell you, it gets a little disorientating throughout the last eight-hundred pages, or so.Now for the picking - I have heard that this is a great story about revenge. Certainly, that is true. It is a great story. And it is about revenge. What is unclear to me is if the revenge is great. I don't think so. I'm not sure we're supposed to think so.Something that always bugged me about the movie was how Edmond, or The Count of Monte Cristo, got all of his revenge and then, when everyone was dead or ruined, he had a change of heart and could get back to the business of being a good guy. Well......yeah! When everything is going your way, being forgiving and kind and compassionate is not a very hard thing to be.The book doesn't go quite as far in making everything hunky dory for Edmond in the end, as there are a few unforeseen consequences he didn't count on bothering him when he set out to ruin those who ruined him, but neither book nor movie bothers to really ask the question if Edmond had the right or responsibility to become the Count of Monte Cristo; if he could have received the peace he deserved without spending over a decade playing a covert, and, might I add, one-sided, game of chess. Of course, had he taken his large fortune and settled into the quiet life of a fisherman, there wouldn't be much of a story:)The other thing that make the story even more unlikely is that all of the original characters still seem to be connected. Sons are marrying daughters, everyone lives in the same town, and everyone associates in the same class-level, which happens to correspond nicely with The Count's own unlimited wealth. Again, I concede that without this set-up, the revenge would have taken even longer to enact. Having everyone's story interact made the fall-out go down like an intricate design of dominoes. It took a long time to set-up but once the initial push was made, everything came crashing down.I'm so glad I read the book. Instead of scratching my head about whether or not anyone, even someone grossly wronged by evildoers, has the right to seek vengeance, I will simply enjoy the time I spent learning about the unstable french government surrounding Napoleon's reign, the dazzling style that The Count of Monte Cristo infused into everything he did and, yes, some head scratching about who was who....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Sep 2009,"Sep 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo

I am not fluent in Cub Scout-ese) is retelling a folk or tall tale that is part of our American heritage. The examples given are Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill etc. but my nine year-old is on a reading whirlwind and wants to earn as many AR points (earned from taking tests about books he reads) as he can by the end of his trimester. I had the grand idea of him reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with me and killing two birds with one stone (is there a less violent idiom that means the same thing? Can't think of it right now so the brutal imagery will remain). I checked out an extra copy at the library, fully intending to give him the copy I bought for my classics challenge but after reading the first few chapters, I decided to hold off giving him the book until I finished reading. Even early on, it seemed inappropriate for someone his age.I understand the controversy. I do. Mark Twain wrote a brilliant novel considered by many to be THE Great American Novel, in its strength of characters, use of dialect, plot, social impact and overall theme: racial injustice. His work deserves every accolade it has received and probably every criticism. How can you tell someone who is offended by the use of the N-word not to be offended? Especially when Twain uses the word as frequently as he does, well over two hundred times throughout the novel.Does it make a difference that most of the utterances are made by Huck, a boy who is racist only because he is ignorant, and not out of hatred? Does it make a difference that he uses this word because...well...it is the only noun he knows to use in regards to a black man? Does it make a difference that he continues to use this insulting word even after he decides to help Jim, a black man, escape to freedom? For some readers, like myself, it does make a difference. While I find the word loathsome, I have no history that makes it personally offensive. Others, however, see any use of the word as unacceptable regardless of the story, history or lesson. Similar to other heated debates, I doubt either side will be able to convince the other. The extraordinary power of Twain's novel is that he creates a protagonist, Huck, that is simultaneously extremely naive and wonderfully thoughtful. His naivety allows most of the adventures of the story to take place. Huck, though thirteen and more world wise than most, believes and does what most people tell him to do: Miss Watson and her Baptist beliefs, his mean drunk father and his litany of verbal abuse, Tom Sawyer and all of his playful foolishness, and the frauds who call themselves the Duke and the King when they force Huck to play a role in their schemes and scams.Huck's thoughtfulness, however, is what gives The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn the moral weight which makes it so great. When Huck decides to help Jim, a black man, gain his freedom, he does not make his decision because he thinks it's the morally right thing to do. On the contrary, Huck knows from all his upbringing that it's wrong. He accepts what Miss Watson declares will be his fate in Hell, a fate earned by breaking the law and stealing someone's rightful property (Jim) as well as simply deciding he'd probably rather be there because it sounds like more fun, because he unwillingly and inadvertently loves Jim, a runaway slave who over and over again risks more than his illegal freedom by sticking with Huck Finn through adventure after adventure. It is Jim who eventually teaches Huck, a young boy who has every single reason in the world to put himself first because no one else is going to, what love really means. It is also Jim, a black man not even considered to BE a man, who shows Huck what it means to be human. I loved this book. I hope my son will read it....someday. But not right now. He needs time and experience in the world to have the necessary frame of reference, not to mention the patience for all of the written vernacular, Twain requires his readers to have. Because as important and moving and fun as this book is, it is obviously not for everyone, especially my own naive and thoughtful fourth grader. Not yet.

No. Even that part, the part he got wrong, I liked.Which made me wonder.Who is this book for?Christians?Obviously. We love this stuff. Having a smart guy give smart reasons to explain why Christianity makes perfect sense feels...smart. It sits well, if you will. Many, if not most, of his arguments were things I had not previously thought about in terms of why I believe there is a God and why I believe that Christ was our Savior, and to have them explained to me with both his brilliant circular logic and then the helpful and much-easier-to-follow analogy, filled my believer's bucket.But I don't think Lewis prepared these addresses (Mere Christianity is actually a compilation of radio addresses he delivered on the BBC during the Second World War) in order to simply preach to the choir.Because Lewis was a former atheist, I believe he felt strongly, especially during such a major conflict as the war which included in its causes a fight against evil, that the world needed to understand where our morality comes from. I think he was motivated to convince the masses that goodness isn't something we choose because it makes the world a better place or because our parents taught us the golden rule but rather, we choose it because God is real. Christ is real. And the possibility to become like them is real. So, what about the others? How would a non-Christian respond to Lewis? It's hard for me to say, because, while I think he's very convincing and right quite a lot of the time, there are times throughout the book where I think he's wrong. I think he's wrong because I have been taught something different and I believe that to be truth instead. It's difficult for me to not take that one step further and assume that others who have been taught something else might thing he's wrong in even more places.This inability for me to claim the book as all right is a stumbling block. I want to be able to say, ""Read this. He makes the case for Christianity."" But I'd have to add, ""However, I think he's a little off about the Godhead."" Lewis, himself, frequently cites his own reasoning as guesswork. I admire his ability to say, ""I can't be sure but this is how I think it works."" If he had done that with the Godhead, I'd probably be a lot more at ease with my reaction to the book but he doesn't. He's pretty firm about how God begat Christ, which makes him his ""Son"" although they are the same being, just as a cube can be made up of more than one squares but they are not separate from the cube. They are the cube. God is God. All of Him. I'd continue to explain the Holy Ghost but it gets a little confusing. My belief that they are three different beings is so much more clear to me. Still, it is what it is. A fascinating and articulate justification forChristianity.

In fact, I may as well say it. It's bad. Abel, a member of the aristocratic class of Venezuela, flees to the uncivilized jungles after a failed coup. Because he is able to pick up languages easily, he learns to communicate and eventually live among several different indigenous tribes. Just like any great guest, he spends his time wowing them with his guitar, waits for his meals while he hangs out in his hammock and laughs at their silly traditions. Eventually, driven by boredom, he explores a cursed part of the forest where he eventually meets an unusual girl unlike any one he's ever seen. She seems able to talk to birds and snakes, climbs trees and appears to live all alone in her ""green mansion."" Most interesting to Abel is the paleness of her white skin, noticeably different from the savages (his words) that inhabit this area. Rima, as she is called by a spanish speaking man who raised her, is the last surviving member of an extinct tribe. How she came to live with him is more complicated than I care to explain, as William Henry Hudson unravels her origins in an excruciatingly slow discovery, but suffice it to say that when Rima and Abel fall in love, it spells doom for both of them. While there is the romance, which is actually unsatisfying because it follows that melodramatic pattern of 19th century romanticism where there seems to be no passion accompanied with the unexplained devotion, this book is really more about the forest than the girl. Hudson uses most of his words to describe every tree, every vine, and every undergrowth. It becomes ridiculous to think that he is really including these mind-numbing descriptive details in his explanation of his tragic past to his friend. In addition to the superfluous language, the book is unforgivably racist and outdated. I kept wondering why I was being less forgiving than I was with, say, A Town Like Alice, which also exposes its age with its no longer acceptable prejudices. All I can say is that Alice at least redeems itself with its other, better qualities. Green Mansions doesn't.

I knew it had a great opening line and an oft quoted last sentence. But the stuff in between? Nothing. I didn't know the two cities were London and Paris. I didn't know it was about the french revolution and class warfare and sacrifice. All of that intellectual blindness came in handy as I was able to read and react to this novel without its fame interfering with my opinion. If I take the dazzling name ""Dickens"" away and judge it on its own merits, I'd say I liked this book very much but with reservations. Characters who do interesting, noble or even bad things aren't great characters if you don't know or care why they do them. None of the players in Tale felt like real people to me. Charles Darnay, while good and true, was too good to be true. Same with Dr. Mannette. His unjust incarceration only felt unjust because Dickens told me it was so. Not knowing anything of his nature, until very close to the end, made it hard to cheer for his recovery when he was so dramatically ""recalled to life."" In fact, most of the character's motivations, including Sydney Carton's ultimate act of love, were given too late. I don't know if the slow character development (if any) was part of some great Dickensian strategy, but his flat characters did little to embellish the peaks and valleys of his very thoughtful story.Characterization flaws aside, I can't deny the timelessness of A Tale of Two Cities. While very obviously about the french revolution, including colorful references to tri-colored sashes (I had a Les Mis song or two in my head), red caps and blood soaked guillotines, I felt Dickens knew then that the themes of retribution, injustice and class distinction were applicable for any group, family, or country at war with itself. Even more than the memories of my own country's more familiar (to me) Revolutionary War, or even its Civil War, Tale invoked images of Town Hall discontent over health care and the angry chatter found in comment sections online. Hate, in any form, is never flattering. Dickens seemed to agree with this, and I felt it was fair of him to portray both sides, the aristocracy and peasants, as part of the problem. The book's tone at the beginning makes it clear that Dickens sympathizes with the powerless and poor. He exposes and ridicules the flaws of both France's and England's legal systems and both's inability to adequately administer appropriate justice. However, he doesn't stay in the working class's corner for long, as he's soon disapproving of their blood lust and anarchy.Amazingly, anger, fear, and injustice are not really what this book is about. Instead, each negative is counterbalanced with love, friendship and selflessness. It was, in fact, the best of times AND the worst of times. Pretty much like today. Or, any period of time, if you think about it. Because light always pushes away darkness.Dickens ends his famous tale by focusing on the better part - the positive. In Carton's own dying words, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.""You can't end a story much better than that....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 08, 2009","Aug 03, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1953.A_Tale_of_Two_Cities

An eighteen year-old aspiring writer sits in her dilapidated castle kitchen, and writes by candlelight with her feet in the sink (or at least what I pictured as a sink) and begins what she calls and experiment in speed writing. She is mindful to include all sorts of details so you can imagine the determination she applied when describing her mood, her environment, and herself. I was so excited to continue reading.While she, Cassandra Mortmain, remained charming, I will admit that I finished a little disappointed with the overall scope of the novel, only because everything did not turn out the way I wanted it to. I'm not sure what I expected as the novel reveals early on that it's not your run-of-the-mill coming of age story. The characters are all so, so beautifully flawed and eccentric. All are capable of good and bad behavior and all are enjoyed all the more for it. Rose, Cassandra's older sister, is beyond inept and at 21 solely relies on her beauty to step away from her family's poverty that she loathes. Her father, a famous author of a one-hit wonder now suffering from a severe case of writer's block, cloisters himself away in a part of the castle where he spends his days doing crosswords or reading mystery novels, but absolutely nothing to provide income, food, or clothing to his wife and three children. This is done without malice, mind you. The children aren't prisoners or locked away in an attic a la a V.C. Andrew novel, but rather, they seem to somewhat accept their fall from grace (they were once quite wealthy after the success of their father's novel)in fine form. His wife, the exotically beautiful Topaz, is not the children's mother but rather their step-mother, and frequently communes with nature in nothing but tall black boots and earned fame earlier in her life as a portrait model. Even stiff Stephen, their handsome servant who works for nothing, is utterly believable as a devoted, but not very interesting beautiful person. I loved all of them.When two brothers from America inherit the estate and become the Mortmains new landlords, the escapades begins. All events are captured by Cassandra in her journal and her voice somehow combines the genteel English sensibility of a Jane Austen romance with the comic misunderstandings of the TV sitcom Three's Company. Together, the reader is provided with surprising twists, laugh out loud moments and plenty of fodder for frustration. I'm not sure it counts as important, or groundbreaking, as some classics do, but I Capture the Castle is full of characters who deserve to stick around for years and years.

Even with its respectable five-hundred and forty-eight page heft, I didn't want to put this book down. The Forgotten Garden begins with an unnamed girl playing a hiding game on a ship. A few pages later, a girl named Nell is turning twenty-one and her father reveals to her a devastating truth: she is not their daughter. He discovered her standing alone holding a small suitcase which contains a book of fairy tales and an extra dress on the wharf where he worked when she was only four years-old. While it's not exactly a mystery, because the reader is never quite sure if a crime has ever been committed, wanting to learn who Nell is, who she was before she arrived on a different continent, alone, and without knowing her name is a strong motivator to keep reading. Morton doesn't hand over her clues upfront, however. Instead, she weaves the story of Eliza Makepeace, the author of little Nell's book of fairy tales, and Nell's own granddaughter's, Cassandra, story into Nell's quest to rediscover her lost identity. Most of the time, I enjoyed the weaving. It's done so subtly, like coming in and out of dream sequences, that, unlike some other books that use this technique, I didn't find myself wishing to be back in one story and out of another. I will say, though, that hindsight has made me wish certain plot holes were filled and left wondering why other information, that now seems superfluous, was included. Also, I was a little bit disappointed with the character development. Instead of really getting to know Nell, whose story this might have been, Morton instead chooses to use Nell's sense of loss to pose the question: what influences our sense of identity? How do we become who we are? Is it our name? Who our parents are? Is it who we marry or the status of our socioeconomic level? Is it our talents, or fame or careers? Is it our tragedies? Yes. All of them or none of them depending on what we decide matters most. If you enjoy stories that transport you into Victorian England, have a touch of romance, the pull of mystery, the weight of history as well as a few revealing fairy tales, you'll probably love The Forgotten Garden....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"May 22, 2010","Jul 22, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3407877-the-forgotten-garden

Lisa Genova’s Still Alice is not my first exposure to Alzheimer’s disease. I noticed with sadness the withdrawal of President Ronald Regan's visibility. I’ve read and watched Nicholas Spark's The Notebook (which probably doesn't count). And while I’ve thankfully been spared watching any members of my immediate family suffer, I have watched a beloved former neighbor and friend forget and withdraw from our shared memories. It’s horrible. And this book doesn’t pretend otherwise, for the person afflicted or for the witnesses to the affliction.Alzheimer’s, which deceptively rhymes with “old timers”, is the most familiar face of dementia but, like probably most, I didn’t really understand the beginning, the progression or the variety of this cruel disease. Genova, with her very heavyweight Harvard Ph.D. in neuroscience, is a reassuring author as I felt like she had the capability and authority to write about early onset Alzheimer’s in such a personal and informative way. It wasn’t until about halfway through the book that I realized that Still Alice was not a first person narrative. It felt like it because I knew what Alice was thinking, how she was feeling and wasn’t given that view into any of the other characters. But, suddenly, the “she’s” and ""hers"" appeared heavy and often and I realized that I wasn't inside Alice's head but, instead, was hovering around Alice with the benefit of someone telling me exactly what her dark-curly haired fifty year-old self was experiencing. As I’m not an author, I don’t know what goes into the decision about who the narrator will be. So many books these days seem to pass the narrative baton from character to character, each one getting to express their own voice with their personal “I”s and “me’s, instantly creating intimacy. While I think it would have been interesting to glimpse into Lydia’s motivation, Anna’s drive and John’s inner conflict, I was glad that our time was spent with Alice. There is only one brief departure from Alice to John and I’m not sure why. Except for that one irregularity, I appreciated the continuity of Alice’s experience.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a character change so much throughout a book but still seem grounded to the original character. While the author provided straightforward visual samples of Alice’s decline with her less and less detailed (and eventually wrong) answers to a series of five recurring questions throughout the book, I believe the evolution of the relationship between Alice and her youngest daughter, Lydia, was the better barometer. Even as she lost more of her intellect and memories with each subsequent page turn, Alice didn’t stop being Alice. Ahhh….there’s the title. She’s Still Alice. In her impassioned speech at an Alzheimer’s conference, Alice asks, “When will I no longer be me? Is the part of my brain that’s responsible for my unique ‘me-ness’ vulnerable to this disease? Or is my identity something that transcends neurons, proteins, and defective molecules of DNA? Is my soul and spirit immune to the ravages of Alzheimer’s? I believe it is.” While certainly less obvious, Alice is there at the end. Not in her office at Harvard University. Not at the lectern, confidently guiding students with her professional expertise, and not as an opinionated mother and wife voicing her unfulfilled expectations, but there. No one is tiptoeing through daisies, and everyone is forced to sacrifice, but this novel showed how one family coped and adjusted to loving someone with Alzheimer’s. More importantly, it showed with candor and tenderness how one brilliant woman/wife/mother/daughter/sister/professor/friend/researcher/mentor/author/reader/person fought an unwinnable fight. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jul 23, 2009","Jul 22, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2153405.Still_Alice

Epic in nature like Steinbeck and Stegner, Verghese creates a truly memorable saga about forgiveness, family and death. While not the merriest subjects, Verghese treats them with such depth and variety that at the end of the hefty 560 pages, you have been treated to an uplifting story - the kind you can sigh about when finished.Sister Mary Joseph Praise, while traveling with a fellow nun by ship on their way from India to an African mission where they are told they are needed most, becomes the ship's nurse after most of the passengers, including Dr. Thomas Stone, become ill with typhoid. While she successfully revives Stone, her companion does not survive, making Sister Praise's future uncertain. Both Stone and Praise leave an impression on each other as Sister Praise's trajectory eventually lands her next to Stone as his assistant at Missing Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is the setting of Missing Hospital (really Mission Hospital, but it soon becomes its commonly mispronounced name) that allows the book's many wonderful characters to develop.Foremost of all these characters is Marion, one of the twin brothers born from a secret love affair between Thomas Stone and Mary Joseph Praise. Praise dies during childbirth and Stone, tormented by his loss and confusion, disappears. Marion, and his brother, Shiva, are raised by two fellow physicians at Missing - Hema, an Indian OB/GYN and Ghosh, an internist turned surgeon after Stone flees (he's literally ""cutting for Stone"", which is just one, and probably the most obvious, of the title's many meanings) raise the boys as their own until one brother betrays the other and Marion leaves Africa for New York to be trained in America's very different world of medicine.The story can be complicated, with heavy doses of medical jargon that make it seem less accessible than it actually is, but plowing through all of the surgical details, even the sometimes uncomfortable female anatomical references (there is a lot of OB/GYN talk so if the words vulva, labia or vagina make you squirm, this might not be the book for you) is worth it. Like all great epics, the middle section can be heavy and slow-going, but the development is necessary to make the end as great as it is.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Jul 2009,"Jul 08, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3591262-cutting-for-stone

Written in the form letters the boy's mother writes to her husband after their son's crime, the unwritten question posed throughout the novel isn't what happened but why it happened. As the mother re-examines her own behavior towards her husband, her pregnancy and her son, we readers are allowed to weigh our own opinions about whether it was nature or nurture that turned Kevin into a sociopath. On one hand, I felt like the author, Lionel Shriver, did an incredible job in allowing her protagonist, Eva Katchadourian, to be the kind of flawed but not evil mother who you want to blame but aren't quite sure if you should. She is so obnoxious with her love of the world but not of her own country, the good old US of A. Really, she's a snob but not one void of sympathy. Her own mother suffers from agoraphobia and can't leave her apartment, which might explain Eva's need to travel. When she discovers an aversion to pregnancy and how little natural affection she has for her son, her nurturing, or lack thereof, seems the obvious reason for Kevin's issues. Except that Kevin is hard to like, let alone love. Even as a baby, his personality was harsh and irritating. Of course, we only know Kevin through Eva's eyes, but his behavior and lack of sensitivity certainly lend credence to the side that Kevin was simply wrong in the head. Always was. On the other hand, I felt like this entire story, idea, and presentation was incredibly manipulative not to mention insensitive. Sure, we are all wondering how something like mass murder in a high school by a high school student can happen. Who are these kids and how do they become so evil? I'm not sure creating a fictional character and having him reference to actual events and actual people, like Eric Harris and Dylan Kelbold with disdain and mockery is tasteful. I felt uncomfortable. Besides that, some of the scenes are downright squirmworthy. What made me most uncomfortable, however, was something Kevin told his mother on one of her monthly visits to his juvenile prison. During one visit, he defended his behavior by stating that not only do we need people like him to do things like he did, but we want him to as well. After all, the rest of us just sit around, doing nothing but watching and reading about what other people actually do. In other words, he considered himself a do-er and the rest of us simply spectators. As I was doing just that, lying in bed and reading about a horrific event instead of living it, I wondered if he was right. By reading books like this, was I, in actuality, encouraging horrible behavior? I've since decided that that isn't true. My friend, Amy, helped put words to my thoughts when she defended a book about rape. She wrote, ""We read about awful things because by reading about them we can understand them without having to experience them. Or we read about them because we experienced them and are searching for commonality, for someone else's experience to erase the loneliness of our own. We read about the ugly, dark things in the world so as to understand how people overcome them, so we can see courage in the face of trouble and hope set against despair. We read so our empathy may be doubled. Ignoring the awful things that happen doesn't make them go away. Ignorance make them more awful. Keeping the dark things in the dark gives them more power. Shining a light on them takes it away. Choosing to read brings that needed light.""Yeah. What she said. Although I don't think We Need To Talk About Kevin is even close to a ""must-read"" it is an interesting, non-scientific look at what creates a sociopath....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Sep 2010,"Jun 20, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80660.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin

Then, it arrived via package as part of this mail exchangeI read this a few months ago and this  has been sitting in the to-do pile for months. Then, it arrived via package as part of this mail exchange book club and I just finished re-reading it today.I can't say it improved the second time around, but I did gain an appreciation for the importance of remembering this lost story now told that I didn't really grasp the first time.Sarah's Key takes place in Europe, France in particular, during World War II. I know there are probably hundreds of details about this war I still have no knowledge of, but I was surprised to have never heard of the Vel d'Hiv, or Velodrome d'Hiver, a round-up of French Jews by the French police in July of 1942. Thousands of men, women, but mostly children, even those born in France, were taken out of their homes, sent to the Vel d'Hiv, which was an arena used for biking events, separated from their parents, then sent to French concentration camps before most were sent on to the Polish concentration camp, Auschwitz.Sarah's Key is really two stories. This first is Sarah's historical one, with a thoughtful third person narrative following her nightmare as she loses her brother, her parents and her childhood in a heart wrenching nightmare. The second is a misused melodrama involving an American journalist, Julia Jaramond, living in France with her French husband and daughter, reporting on the 60th anniversary of this lesser known event in French history. All of these chapters are written in a tiring first-person and ultimately consume the historical story once the character's lives cross.For me, it's hard to separate my appreciation of what I believe the morale of the story to be: to never forget past horrors so that we'll be less likely to repeat them, from the journalist's I-don't-love-my-husband-anymore banality, especially when Sarah's story all but ended with 100 pages left. The author forced me to wade through her modern mama drama to get Sarah's experience, and by so doing, completely overshadowed the more important story.If you enjoy different angles concerning the Holocaust and historical fiction about this time period, you might like this.

The book might not be a prize winning, heart soaring, profound thinking sort, but the tension and lure of what happens on the next page keeps me coming back for more.I assumed with the good s and attention The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was getting, it would be something I would enjoy. I did not.I open mysteries/thrillers with open eyes, knowing that most contain dark subject matter. Murder is usually involved. Crimes are usually committed. Lives are usually in peril.This book, however, took the darkness and dank to a whole new level. None of the characters were likable. Of course, you expect some characters who live in the underbelly of society to have unappealing lifestyles, but normally, there is a protagonist or detective, or someone...anyone, to cheer for. Hope for. Like. Even just a little.I found no such character in this story. Stieg Larrson's novel opens with Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist (I know...yawn), whose career is on the rocks after he is convicted of libeling a well known financier in his small, liberal magazine. In order to save the magazine, and to earn some money during the time when he won't be working, he accepts an unconventional offer from Henrik Vagner, a former corporate mogul, to investigate the thirty year-old disappearance of his niece. Charming (or distracting, depending on your mood) as the Swedish names are, Mikael is a yucky guy.He sleeps with his boss, who happens to be married. His daughter is all but forgotten in his exciting world of kronas (that's money). While he's living on an isolated island during his investigation, he sleeps with a lonely fifty year-old woman. And then, when he finds help in the deeply troubled, but brilliant Lisbeth Salander (hint...she has a dragon tattoo), who looks fourteen but, thankfully, is of legal age, he sleeps with her too. And he's the good guy, folks.I admit, Lisbeth is a fascinating character and her chapters were the most intense, by far. A victim of the system, she has no respect for societal rules because they had no respect for her. Still, as interesting, scary and sad as she is, I still couldn't root for her. It would be like cheering for Hannibal Lecter.With no redeeming characters, I was at least hoping for a knock-my-socks off plot. But, the mystery surrounding Vagner's niece is murky, impossible to solve on my own because the people in my life are not complete psychopaths. If the main characters are seedy, the secondary characters are heinous. Double yuck.Add the confusing Swedish culture, towns, money and names, and I didn't enjoy reading this.

I have cake and eat it all the time. Too frequently, in fact. But that isn't my point.I do understand its intended meaning, however. I've seen it written instead, ""You can't eat your cake and have it too,"" which really clears things up (the two desires are mutually exclusive. Choice and sacrifice are obligatory), but, I doubt the saying will ever change. And if I say it the way I like it, I'll just be accused of messing it up, blasted creatures of habit that we humans are.When Elizabeth Strout wrote Olive Kitteridge, it appears she couldn't choose between eating the cake or having it. To explain, you need to know something about the book, which, I should do regardless because this is, after all, a book . Olive Kitteridge is a compilation of short stories that are sometimes strongly, but more often loosely, tied together through one character, Olive Kitteridge. The book is roughly chronological and whether in the periphery or forefront, Olive's abrasive and direct personality stand out. She and other inhabitants of Crosby, Maine, lead outwardly ordinary lives but with Strout's masterful story telling, their motivations, vices, guilt and hope are all achingly uncovered. It's really something, the way she captures the natural man (or woman) on her pages.Imagine, for the sake of the above allegory, that Olive Kitteridge is a cake. She is the title character. She is the foundation. Olive all alone, however, is boring. She needs decorating. She needs a plot and supporting characters and conflict and all the eye-dazzling fondant that makes you take notice and want the actual food - the cake underneath. In other words....she needs a novel. I wonder if Strout started dressing Olive up, and saw that she had so much going on that her cake looked like a hot mess so she licked off all the icing, hoping, I suppose, the naked cake left behind would be enough. Unfortunately, and perhaps because I am overly fond of icing, I noticed its absence. As enjoyable as each short story was, Olive Kitteridge needed the icing and the icing needed Olive.While I applaud Strout's idea, which is brilliant, entire chapters felt disappointing and unproductive because Olive's presence was so minimal. At times, the thought crossed my mind that Strout had some of these stories written beforehand and once she came up with Olive Kitteridge, and her idea to assemble stories containing Olive together in a book, she threw in a few of her other favorite short stories, briefly mentioning Olive as a 7th grade math teacher or down-the-street neighbor so that they earned an ""Olive"" label. Like drinks that claim to be 10% fruit juice. Not near enough juice but that's another analogy for another day.For a book to connect so...haphazardly, was unsatisfying. Even though each chapter had the structure to stand alone, I felt preoccupied with Olive. When was she going to enter the story? How did this person know Olive? Olive, Olive, Olive. It was distracting.I understand and even agree with the book's critical acclaim because the premise is unique and clever. Strout's writing is superb and certain chapters are undoubtedly engrossing. But what am I supposed to do with an unfrosted cake? Eat it or have it? Without the frosting, I'm not sure I want to do either. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"May 16, 2009","May 08, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1736739.Olive_Kitteridge

That's how I felt after reading The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks by E. Lockhart. On its shiny teenybopper romance quartz surface, the book appears to be a fairly short young adult fictional novel about a prestigious prep school and the cliques and social hierarchy that exist there. But, underneath its surface, there is an impressive amount of philosophical gold. Frankie Landau-Banks starts off her sophomore year at Alabaster with the same mindset she had from her freshman year. She has a nice group of friends, but not too many, she gets good grades, has a crush on a cute senior and obeys her overprotective mother. Over the summer, however, she morphed from an awkward fourteen year-old into a stunning young woman, and the changes in her physical appearance are quickly noticed and appreciated by the rich, beautiful and powerful crowd at her school. As she is drawn into a world where opportunities seem endless and consequences invisible, Frankie develops an appetite for that lifestyle and begins to challenge the unwritten rules that threaten to keep her away from it. I suppose one can think of this as a pro-feminism rah-rah tale, but I think it's more about personal agency and empowerment than gender. Certainly, Frankie is female therefore most of her why-can't-I's had to do with the exclusion she felt from not being allowed into the all-male secret Basset Hound society, but the scope of the novel goes far beyond what girls can and cannot do. The idea of the panopticon - or the idea that people follow rules because they never know who may be watching - is such a delightfully profound concept cleverly disguised as teenage peer pressure. Of course, there are a lot more rules to follow and a lot more angst about what people think about you if you don't follow certain rules when you're a teenager, but that ponopticon doesn't go away upon completion of high school. Most of our lives are controlled by it - for good and bad. Without it, there would be anarchy and with it there is integrity, but, as our young protagonist points out, it usually brings fear, limits and status quos too. Should you desire, when you finish thinking about what you do when no one is watching, there are a lot of ideas about feminism to consider, not to mention nepotism, reverse psychology and the possibility we are all puppets being controlled by secret societies. Or, you can simply enjoy Frankie's delightfully fresh coming-of-age story. I loved cheering for her.

I cannot gush enough about this book.The Help, by Kathryn Stockett, follows the lives of three women living in 1962 Jackson, Mississippi. Two of the women, Aibilene and Minny are black, hired as help to wealthy, or trying to appear wealthy, white families. Eugenia, or ""Skeeter"" as she is called, is a white woman recently graduated from Ole Miss University and trying to become a writer. She is what probably most of us are, kindly ignorant of the world around her. Raised on what her mother embarrassingly still refers to as a ""plantation"" she lived in an environment with all the privilege and prejudice you'd expect from a southern belle. Living at home again, Skeeter doesn't quite fit in anymore among her friends, who are all married with children.When a feminist editor from New York rejects one of Skeeter's submissions, she includes with that rejection the advice for Skeeter to write about what disturbs her. It is while playing bridge with her friends, and she becomes aware of her friend, Miss Hilly's, crusade for every home to have a separate bathroom installed for ""the help"", to contain the germs blacks carry that whites are more susceptible to, that Skeeter realizes she has found her subject matter.Skeeter is the least developed character of the three but she is the means in which this uniquely uplifting story can be told. Without Skeeter, who at 22, finally and lonesomely comes of age, The Help would simply be another shocking look at the racial inequality that existed still so recently in the South. It is Skeeter's character, and her ambition to write a book that matters, that strips Aibilene's and Minny's blatantly mistreated, funny and irresistible characters out of their perfectly pressed maid uniforms and into each of our lives.I don't want to give away too much about Abilene and Minny, who became women I loved. They mattered to me. Aibilene, especially, is so vividly written, that her voice, her mannerisms... her unguarded moments... took solid form in my imagination. More than anything, I wanted her to thrive. To triumph.As rich as this book is in both characterization and plot, its real accomplishment is that it encouraged me to examine my own prejudices. Racism has always been a frustrating topic for me to think about, as has sexism. My mind has a hard time wrapping around the idea that there was a time when educated people - enlightened people - sincerely believed that any race or gender was superior to another. It seems our spirits must have always had the capacity for understanding that this could not be so, but The Help showed me how such beliefs are possible.Stockett, a southern white woman herself, exposes this possibility with an experienced sympathy. Using a variety of characters, she demonstrates how many Southerners in this particular chapter of our nation's history weren't racist because they were mean-spirited or elitists, but because tradition and bogus science had supported their belief. Foolish traditions, yes, but they were able to be easily convinced that a separate toilet was not only desirable but necessary because they lacked scientific understanding about germs and contamination and genetics. They only thing available to counter such painfully offensive actions was personal reflection and, perhaps, their consciences. More so, and what was really eye opening to me, were the attitudes of ""the help"", and how their own actions and attitudes were also heavily influenced by tradition and fear - as much so as their white counterparts. Whites, with control and power, dosed out injustice after injustice that was defended by their fear and blacks adjusted to the degradation based on their own learning and fear. Minny was taught by her mother how to behave as a maid in the home of a white woman - what to say and do and how to say and do it. She also experienced first hand the consequences of breaking with that tradition, being fired and blacklisted and unable to provide for her family. The difference between what excuses the fear as loathsome or imaginable was the availability of recourse. Blacks had none. Or very little.I must believe, as a human being, that there is something inside each of us that witnesses the value of our souls. However, blacks, then, had even less access to understanding and knowledge than their white peers which left them with little other than their own consciences as proof of their worth. How frustrating to be human whose freedom is limited by the understanding of others. It made me wonder which of us are like Miss Skeeter, Miss Hilly, Aibilene or Minny. Are we currently kindly ignorant, arrogantly holding all the answers, quietly giving the best of ourselves with what society allows or protecting our vulnerability with a tough outer shell?Perhaps, we are all of them, at different times of our lives, progressing at our individual rates of enlightenment and courage. As Skeeter explained, ""Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, 'We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought'.""Amen.Now, go read this book!...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,not set,"May 15, 2009","May 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4667024-the-help

I thought I was getting To Kill A Mockingbird but with innocent Japanese detainees in camps during World War II instead of an innocent black man detained for rape in the south. It had the requisite small town setting with a few violently ignorant residents. It had the naive daughter narrating the story with a do-the-right-thing-even-if-it's-unpopular father as her hero.

I don't know if the author, Sandra Dallas, was trying to write a copycat novel or purposely veered off track, but Tallgrass quickly fell far from the Mockingbird tree. The characters were boxy and predictable, the plot stretched too thin with an unrelated murder mystery (was I supposed to suspect the Japanese in the nearby camp? Because I didn't. The author never develops the suspicion for the reader with Rennie as the narrator) and the dialogue feels unnaturally scripted.Mostly, I felt disappointed because Dallas didn't write enough about the Japanese camps. Its existence around the Colorado town of Ellis is placed so far into the background of her story, that having it as a part of the story's setting actually seems unnecessary.

Because I did not enjoy this for hundreds of A definite labor of love, this is the kind of book that I can blame when I suffer and finish a bad book. Because I did not enjoy this for hundreds of pages. Hundreds. I'm glad I was patient.Sea of Poppies begins with Deeti, an Indian woman, harvesting her opium crop in her small Indian village with her young daughter. While working, she has a vision of a large ship - the kind she has never seen nor imagined, ultimately revealed as the Ibis, a former slave trading vessel. She immediately returns to her home and draws her vision, including the occupants of the ship. This sketch foreshadows the rest of the novel and is the bone that Ghosh throws his readers to stick with it. Even though the characters, who are complicated, fleshy and the kind you want to bravely endure with, are separated and seemingly unrelated for much of the book, it works. It works because Ghosh had a vision of an epic story and didn't allow himself to cater to the impatient reader. The variety of his characters voices, who range from an ignorant villager, to an Indian Raja with Americans, English and Chinese stuffed in between, are so delightfully unique, that I felt I was witnessing the spectrum of an 1830s India I didn't know I was interested in. This is historical fiction at its best.There is a good-sized chunk of pages at the end of the book full of the unique vocabulary Ghosh uses. It's a vernacular that has an Australian feel, or pirate or...something that I am not familiar with. Truly, there were whole sentences, nay, paragraphs that I skimmed because I knew that I didn't have the patience to decipher their actual meaning. Instead, I read it a la The Jabberwocky, hoping I'd pick up the gist through its surrounding context. However, if you happen to be more patient that myself, the author offers the opportunity to painstakingly look up each word. If that's your thing, then, good luck.If the story has an Achilles heel, it is the budding romance between several of the novel's characters. Considering Ghosh's patience in other matters of his story's development, I was surprised and disappointed that these particular scenes were so rushed over. However, the rumor is that this is merely part I of a planned trilogy, so, perhaps that flaw can still be remedied.Difficult, interesting, historical, rough, and not for the faint of heart, I have to admit to enjoying this wildly complex book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,May 2009,"Apr 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1330324.Sea_of_Poppies

None of the sex is written gratuitously, nor is most of it very romantic, but the author must have figured that most people have sex and have issues with sex in their lives, and part of Ramsay's experiences or thoughts, center on his understanding of this act at various stages in his life.

Barron's attempt at including actual history, and unfortunately a documented genetic mystery, doesn't work.

Unless you consider multi-race family drama, parental expectation, adoption and inheritaWith a title like Run, I was expecting an action packed plot. Unless you consider multi-race family drama, parental expectation, adoption and inheritance conflict action packed, the title is a tad misleading.Tip and Teddy Doyle, African-American biological brothers, are adopted into a upper class Irish-catholic political family in Boston (their father, Bernard Doyle, was the current mayor of Boston when the adoption took place) when Teddy was an infant and Tip was only eighteen months old. Their mother, Bernadette, who bears a striking resemblance to a family heirloom Madonna statue, longs for a large family and adopts the two boys to add to their family which includes one biological son, Sullivan.Bernadette dies when Tip and Teddy are both young, and the results are tragic for Sullivan, who is old enough to feel replaced in both his father's attention and affection by his younger brothers. The story fast forwards quickly to a time when Tip and Teddy are college students struggling to break free from the influence of their doting father. Both are uninterested in pursuing a career in politics, a life-long wish of Bernard Doyle. Tip, whose passion is the study of fish, decides the Jesse Jackson lecture he attends on a cold, winter night, is the last of its kind he will attend with his father and following the lecture, tells him so. Following their argument, he steps into the path of an oncoming car, only to be pushed out of the way by a woman he does not know, but who is curiously familiar with his own life. The woman, Tennessee Moser, is seriously injured when struck by the car, but manages to limit Tip's injuries to a broken foot. While the ambulances rush the woman to the hospital, the woman's 12 year-old daughter, Kenya, is left behind with the Doyles where discoveries and new relationships begin.While Patchett's writing does stand out as beautiful, her ability to create characters with more than two dimensions seems limited. Bernard Doyle is every father with good intentions but with a little too much zeal. Tip is serious and rigid, Teddy is unreliable but sensitive, Sullivan is a lost cause, Kenya is the always-good girl and Tennessee is the poor, torn, struggling to survive black mother. Always. None of the characters are really allowed to break free from their pigeon hole, and the story, while interesting, suffers from the character's predictable behavior.Ultimately, I found this entire book to be much ado about nothing. Some of the interesting themes I mentioned above were exposed, but none were developed enough to warrant serious thought. I'm left wondering what the point was. That we're all running away from our destiny? That we run to cope? That we should run faster away from moving cars? I'll never know, but I do know, thanks to another epilogue, that everything turned out nice and tidy in the end....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 03, 2009","Mar 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/80566.Run

Perhaps because I already had the phrase, ""Balm of Gilead"" in my head when I started this fine novel, I was so happy that it had religious overtones. Reverend John Ames is a preacher for the Congrationalists in Gilead, Iowa and dying from a heart condition. Re-married much later in life, after his young wife dies in childbirth along with their infant, he writes his history and thoughts to leave with his young son, who, at seven to his seventy-six, will have few memories of him and none of him as a younger man.After finishing Gilead, I think it should be everyone's charge in life to leave a written history including sentiments, stories and wandering thoughts for posterity. Of course, most of us won't put words on a page like Marilynne Robison has John Ames put words on a page (so pleasantly meaningful), but the value will come from the experience. I couldn't help but feel the pleasure Ames had in his memories. Of course, because death loomed in his future, it was tinged with sadness too. After a lifetime of baptizing babies, counseling individuals and feeding his flock, Ames appreciates the treasure that is his family. The pride and joy he feels as a father is palpable and that father/son bond, as distant their ages may be, brings to mind other father/son relationships: his and his athiest brother's with their own father, his best friend, Old Boughton, with his son and namesake, John Ames Boughton, his abolitionist grandfather and his pacifict father, and several well-known examples from the bible. In reality, this story is a re-telling, in many ways, of the prodigal son parable only with a lot more digression. But, it's more than that too.Filled with symbolism, quotes you'll want to remember and a message of love and forgiveness, Gilead is exactly the kind of book I love to read....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Apr 20, 2009","Mar 06, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/68210.Gilead

I resent the whole idea of getting information from people who are in the business of selling it. I don't know what the alternative would be, but still....it seems like a conflict of interest.On top of that, there is the issue of bias. We all have it. I'm not sure it's possible to communicate without it. So, when it's somebody's job to write/talk/share about an issue, I don't believe anyone is completely able to leave it out. It's a lot more obvious to detect when your own bias stands in opposition. I can't read Arianna Huffington or Ann Coulter without some serious eye rolling, but Peggy Noonan? I think she's brilliant. I think she's fair. I can't see her bias as easily, but I'm sure that's because I agree with her, most of the time.I must agree with Dexter Filkins too because I had a very hard time detecting any bias in his book. The Forever War doesn't give a chronological time line of the war on terror, or even a history or reason for the conflict up to this point. Instead, the book's focus is much more narrow. Using small snippets from his observations, conversations and the various situations he found himself in as an American journalist living in a fundamental Islam dominated middle east, the war takes its own shape without much molding from the author. Through Filkin's reporting, the war is viewed from many various perspectives. The Taliban's, Afghani women, American soldiers, American politicians, American ambassadors, Iraqi Sunni's, Iraqi Shiites, Kurds, hardliners, moderates, families, women, children. Iraqis as gracious hosts. Iraqis blind to American goodwill. Iraqis determined to keep their country in chaos. Iraqis as the neighbor or friend you wish you had.As he sometimes traveled under the protection of the US Forces, he was able to observe their behavior too. Like their Iraqi counterparts, soldiers and military leaders ranged from the truly valiant, noble even, to complete jerks. But, because he told individual stories and reported moments in time as they happened, very few of his reports are tinged with the burden of hindsight or the sensationalism that I so loathe. It's incredibly present. A snapshot with words.Filkins manages to keep himself out of his reporting most of the time as well. Even when he's part of the story, such as when he runs in shorts that he knows bothers Muslim modesty, it's not about his running or even his legs, it's about the Iraqi guard's humor, generosity and discomfort. When he's not part of the story, his presence is hardly noticeable. For example, he doesn't editorialize an interview with an Iraqi jihadist. The emotion, that spills out of the pages is one of the jihadist's single-mindedness and hatred for the infidels, not of Filkin's response. No apologies. No excuses. When he's interviewing a 19 year-old American soldier from Pearland, Texas, the pages fill with the soldier's optimism, hope and unquestioning obedience to his superiors, not Filkin's east-coast, Harvard educated sensibilities.Sometimes, the book becomes more than raw reporting. Sometimes, Filkins allows his own confusion and conflicting emotions to tell this story too. Like the time he gets lifted into an angry anti-American mob, and his certain soon-to-be death, but before any harm befalls him, he is pulled back into the safety of his car by his Iraqi driver. Gratitude for one Iraqi and fear of another. Conflict.If there should ever be required reading on the present day conflict in Iraq, The Forever War should hold a place at the top of that list. While it is a book that no doubt Filkins hopes will sell, I don't think he's trying to sell a view of this war to the left or to the right. Instead, like a meaningful piece of art, he captures what war is - past, present and future: hope, corruption, fear, courage, sacrifice, weariness, destruction, honor, death and change - all together.

Instead, when he meets Schmel, a Jewish boy his own age sitting on the other side of a fence, he sees a potential playmate who, for a reason he's never quite curious enough to find the answer why, wears striped pajamas and lives behind a fence.I wanted to like this.

I think he may have been trying too hard to be clever and the result is more distracting than anything, not to mention confusing to the young audience he's supposedly writing for, as the correct titles are rarely used. I think it has a place in young adult literature. It narrates the disconnect between the world of a privileged Nazi family and the horrors of the concentration camp with the sensitivity required for young, innocent readers. It's not really Holocaust light, but it is definitely Holocaust junior. Because of this, I was less jolted by the predictably tragic ending than I probably should have been.

Strangely enough, Katy was murdered in the exact same woods where Ryan and his two best friends were victims of an attack during their own childhood, an event Ryan has no memory of even though his friends were never found and he was found clinging to a tree with blood in his shoes. Of course, Ryan goes ahead and declares himself emotionally capable of handling this case, while simultaneously keeping his connection to the area hidden to the rest of those involved. Eventually, he does tell his partner, Maddox, and French uses the remainder of the book to erode Ryan's sanity and eventually Maddox's confidence.My two main problems with Tana French's novel is that 1) the big reveal is tainted with smugness (the author actually uses the words, ""I fooled you, didn't I?"" when the revelation wasn't all that hard to guess) and 2) there are too many distracting loose strings left untied at the end.

Her genius, I believe, is that she doesn't waste her time recreating the wheel. She has her story and it is an experience of Indian immigrants who struggle with their new American identities. It's important to realize that it's not THE Indian immigrant story. Obviously, not all experiences are them same. Surely, they don't all live in the Boston area and go to Harvard. Perhaps some of their mothers weren't as accomplished at making Bengali meals. Perhaps, some of them even had more than one sibling and if they did, they actually liked each other. This, however, isLahir's story and changing those things around doesn't seem to be the kind of variety she is interested in.Her variety can be found as she alters the protagonist's characterization and conflict. She never abandons her theme of loneliness but with a trill here and some counterpoint there, she manages to create a beautiful, independent story each time.

For the rest of Florens's life, she struggles with feelings of abandonment even as she lives in relative comfort with her new owners, Jacob and Rebekka Vaark. Vaark only accepts the young girl as payment because he knows the kind of man the Portuguese is and feels that taking her away is an act of mercy. Childless himself, after he and his wife's three children have died in the harsh 17th Century early American conditions, he even feels having a child around their home will be a good thing for his grieving wife.The reality of colonial America takes shape through the voices of Jacob, an ambitious Dutch settler seeking out a better life that becomes actualized when he is able to build a large home complete with an iron fence, his wife, Rebekkah, who escaped her own bleak future as a woman in the filthy, poverty stricken streets of London before being sent to American to marry Jacob at age 16, Lina, a Native American whose entire tribe was wiped out by smallpox and was taken in by some Presbyterians, Sorrow, who was raised at sea and isn't fully sane, Florens, who falls in love with a free black man who works for Jacob as a blacksmith, and eventually Florens's mother, who fully explains her act of mercy at the book's end.Morrison does not coddle her readers with easy transitions between her narrators throughout the story.Many times, I felt lost and annoyed that such a beautiful book was made what seemed to be more difficult to follow than necessary, and might have given up on it had it not been so blessedly short.

That is twenty-four years ago. When I was in high school, Harold and Maude was considered a classic (is it still? Creepy.) and it was only twenty years old. So, I think The Prince of Tides safely falls into the Modern Classic genre.Secondly, they made a movie out of the book. I know that movie adaptations from books aren't required to stem from great books (I may be referring to the last book I ed - Julie & Julia) but a book has to have some kind of staying power to attract the powers that be in Hollywood.Lastly, the title was familiar. Given, I like to read as a hobby and have thus spent a fair amount of time perusing titles in libraries, bookstores, and online sites, but I had read, seen and heard the title The Prince of Tides long before choosing to read it. I was curious. I wanted to be ""in the know.""That's not to say I had any idea what it was about. For some reason, I think I had mistaken the movie adaptation (which I have never seen) with Cape Fear thanks to some unexplained ability of my brain to remember Nick Nolte was in both movies, and thought it was a kind of psychological thriller. Tides....Capes...hey - I'm from Montana. Those nouns aren't exactly part of our everyday vernacular. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that it was more of a family drama, the kind that makes you appreciate your own, non-psychotic family.The Prince of Tides follows Tom Wingo, a disgraced high school English teacher and football coach, spending a summer in New York visiting with his sister, who is hospitalized following another suicide attempt, and her psychiatrist who convinces Tom to help his sister by meeting with her and revealing their mutually troubled childhood. Tom's sister, Savannah, is a famous poet and during her breakdown, shouts out a string of incoherent words and phrases, which her psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, writes down. Convinced these exposed words are really memories at the root of Savannah's psychological troubles, Dr. Lowenstein asks Tom about each of them, triggering a series of narrative flashbacks that unlock the secrets of Tom and Savannah's childhood in South Carolina, along with their older brother, Luke, and their mismatched parents who, like many a parents, had no business raising children.What I loved about this book was the outstanding narrative. Tom is smart, and Conroy allows his thoughts and memories to be beautifully worded and vividly described. Tom also has a biting, sarcastic wit that keeps the dialogue and conversation interesting and enjoyable. Unlike a lot of characters, I believed that Tom could be. He is your basic good guy, whose life is falling apart and isn't sure there is a whole lot he can do to fix it. The reverence he has for his beloved South, flaws and all, is felt in his descriptions of its pungent smells, rich soil and overly-polite manners. Susan, on the other hand, is a perfect contrast with her New York point-of-view and high brow lifestyle. Their disdain for each other's choice of where to live allows Conroy to not only narrate the South's beauty, but to defend it against the perceived superiority of its Yankee neighbors.I also loved the depth that came from having multiple conflicts. There's Tom's marriage that is imploding, his stalled career and lack of plans to do anything different, there's Savannah's illness, the forbidden attraction between Tom and Susan, Susan's troubled marriage to a world famous violinist, her angry and aloof son who wants to play football instead of the violin, the anger between Tom and his mother as well as the constantly building tension that is a result of the controlled disclosure of a painful past. What keeps me from loving this book is its raw violence. I simply cannot adore a book that makes me cringe. The scene that is eventually described at the climax as the source of most of their dysfunction is so brutal, so horrible, that I actually wish I hadn't read it. It's like pornography - it imprints on your brain whether you want it to or not. Unfortunately, whenever I now think of The Prince of Tides, in spite of it having multiple scenes that are much, much more pleasant, I think of this horrible day in their lives. Perhaps that was the author's intention. Perhaps the fallout from it - failed marriages, death, fear, repression and an escalating mental illness - and the limited ability of those involved to put back the pieces - is what this book is about. I like that they try. I appreciate that the human spirit always strives to repair itself. But, in this case, the horror overshadows the recovery. I can't love that.I am glad I read this book. I am even more glad that I was able to read without Nick Nolte or Barbara Steisand in my head while I did so. Neither seems to be appropriately cast as the characters of Tom and Susan, and I'm glad I only had the book cover to suggest to my brain that these actors were actually the characters, instead of a whole movie to cement their faces to the names. I enjoyed it a lot more imagining Susan to be the attractive, tall, leggy dark-haired psychiatrist the book described and Tom not having that sun-beaten look that Nolte has.The Prince of Tides proved to me that it deserves its modern classic status. With an epic story and unforgettable characters, Conroy surprised me with his beautiful language and powerful testament about what the human spirit can endure....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Nov 2009,"Feb 06, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16735.The_Prince_of_Tides

We each take turns reading aloud and when the hour is up, we mark our place for the next week.Our group, which contained five boys and myself, read The Hatchet, a book about 13 year-old Brian Robeson, who survives in the Canadian wilderness for months after the airplane he was traveling in to visit his father crashes - in large part because he has in his possession a hatchet given to him by his mother.I was very impressed with those 8 and 9 year-old attention spans because, after the initial crash, which is quite exciting, the book moves at a snails pace. There are lots and lots of details about Brian building a shelter and the process in which he finds food (from berries, eggs, fish to finally game meat) and Brian's own inner dialogue about what his fate will be. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the author, Gary Paulsen, uses a technique of repeating emphasis words regularly throughout paragraphs that the boys were able to pick up as a unique to that author writing style. It was so fun to discuss those kinds of things with these bright boys. Paulsen also included plenty of vomiting, diarrhea, animal attacks and other bits of danger to completely hook his young readers.I admit to being a tad worried about the theme of divorce and The Secret (which turned out to be that Brian saw his mother kissing another man in a car), but was relieved to discover that it wasn't the emphasis of the book and even my sheltered and innocent son seemed able to handle these mature ideas.I'm not as sure girls of the same age would like it, but The Hatchet was a hit with my 8 year old.

I've been aware of them for awhile, even buying the first two books of the series for my nephew's birthday last year, but once I heard that each installment ends in a cliff-hanger and the final book was coming out this summer, I decided to wait until I could have instant gratification instead of waiting months and months for a resolution. It's a dangerous thing, waiting, when the world seems caught up in doing something. Of course, there is the natural anxiety that comes when you feel like you're being left behind or not ""in the know"" but, even worse, there is always a risk of accidentally learning how the book ends when a book is as popular as this one is. Because that would have turned me off from reading these books forever, I diligently avoided reading any s of this book, or any of the sequels. All I knew was that this was a book about teenagers killing other teenagers for sport and survival. Huh. That description did not help me understand the mania surrounding this book. O.K. Perhaps that dystopian angle would appeal to its intended audience, teenagers, but why so many adult females seemed equally enamored was the real head scratcher. I get it now. We grown-ups love a good love triangle. And by good, I mean where two worthy and likable males want the same female. I'm not sure we'd be nearly as interested if one of the guys was a cad or two girls were after the same guy, because those are not nearly as enjoyable fantasies. But the oh-I-just-can't-decide-between-these-two-because-I-like-them-both-and-I-don't-want-to-hurt-anyone-and-they are-equally-attractive-and-devoted dilemma? Yeah...I'll take that conflict. I'm making it sound like Twilight, which isn't fair. It is so much better than Twilight. The romantic subplot, while present, is not the story's focus What is, is a disturbing and depressing look at what fear induces good people to do and how death might not be the worst thing a young person will face in his or her life. Katniss Everdeen, the strong and stoic sixteen year-old girl who volunteers to take her twelve year-old sister's place as District Twelve's tribute in the annual Hunger Games, realizes this very thing as dying would be a lot easier than illegally hunting in her district's nearby woods to feed her family or taking a young girl's life to preserve her own or defying a government with the power to take away her family's fragile sense of security.Although it has violent themes, none of the violence seems gratuitous. In fact, I was surprised by how little it disturbed me. Maybe it was the science fiction and distant future feel that removed my personal horror, but I thought the book worked both as entertaining story-telling as well as one containing an important message. We, the people. We, the people. When our leaders stop being part of the ""we"" and become the ""them"" the authority they hold shifts from being given to being taken. Panem, the futuristic society consisting of the all-powerful Capitol surrounded by thirteen isolated and subservient districts, is an us vs. them model. What is protection and what is tyranny? What is rebellion and what is doing the right thing? I enjoy a book that is not afraid of throwing around a little bit of moral weight.

James Caviezel.....mmmmmm-mmmmmm.I was always troubled by the the main character's motivation for revenge. In the movie, all ended well and good because the bad guys were really bad guys and it was very easy to cheer for the good guy. Again, I'm not sure Dumas wrote it that way, but since that's the way the movie goes, that's all I have for comparison.In Revenge, Ned's charmed life is destroyed when a few jealous school peers plant drugs on him. After he is taken to the police station, a note, entrusted to him by his sailing coach which he never opened and had yet to deliver, is found in his coat pocket that reveals the scandalous identity of a traitor. An investigator's desperate need to destroy the evidence sends Ned to an undisclosed insane asylum - for life.Ned has no idea how much time has passed when he meets the man who ultimately saves him. Referred to as Babe, this man unlocks Ned's trapped mind and memories and over several years, Babe unloads his knowledge and secrets to Ned. With that kind of mental training, Ned eventually escapes and his plot for revenge on all who wronged him begins.The author, Fry, allows the reader to doubt the fairness of Ned's plan for revenge. While I certainly was glad Ned was out, and wanted him to enjoy his new freedom, most of me wanted to see him be able to ""let it go"" - probably because the author wanted me to feel that way. In the end, I felt a bit manipulated by the author. He had obviously read Dumas's Count of Monte Cristo, and wrote the ""what if""s into his own. What if someone who hurt you did it accidentally? Like Ian McEwan's Atonement, Fry wants to know what someone who does something that ruins a person's life, but can't take it back, deserves. What should be their punishment? In my opinion, Fry ruins the subtly of those questions by creating a highly unlikely and overly sensational ending.

It felt embarrassing to have such a romantically embossed book in my hands) to its one-dimensional characters, the entire book reminded me of a heavyweight beach read. So....what should get a ""nice summer read""  instead trips me up for weeks, unable to write anything about this book and a dozen others because I'm forced to question my reasoning. Why do I feel so bad about being critical of this book? Mostly, I think it's because many friends and readers I know love this book. But, I also think my stupor of thought is a result of a former self once being able to love this book. My tastes have changed.It's frustrating, because I think the themes Pilcher wrote about are serious enough to do well. Inheritance, greed, sentimentality, playing favorites with children, staying in a loveless marriage, putting a relationship that never fully developed on a pedestal because it escaped the inevitable boredom, irritation, and complacency that all relationships eventually go through. These are things you don't usually find underneath a flowery cover. Overall, The Shell Seekers didn't feel wholly honest to me. The situations did have a semblance of reality. I imagine most of us would have some serious introspection if we discovered a piece of art we owned was suddenly very valuable, especially any art we owned that was created by a beloved relative. However, the characters, written as people who you should like (Penelope, Olivia, Richard), or who you should not like (Nancy, Neil, horrible grandmother and husband whose names I can't remember) didn't have motives - or at least any that I understood. It appears to me that Pilcher confused having the coveted flawed character with having bad characters. Just because a character makes bad choices shouldn't make them bad. I wanted to know why Nancy and Neil cared more about money than their grandfather's painting. Was Neil a gambler and in debt and needed cash? Did Nancy think her marriage would fall apart if she didn't continue to be the lavish bride that her grandmother turned her into? Why in the world would Penelope stay in her never-should-have-happened-marriage when the author has done her best to describe her as a free-spirit, raised by an athiest father and French mother who both could have cared less if she married the father of her baby or took a lover while her husband (who she hoped would either die or leave her for someone else) was at war, who placed a nontraditional value to things (wasn't that the point of the the symbolic painting? Most people would care to know how much it was worth. But not Penelope, who would rather garden and feed people large meals)? Why were Neil and Nancy so shallow and greedy? Because they were genetically like their father and grandmother (who were also inexplicably bad)? Why did Olivia get such a free pass from her mother? Why did we have to invest so much time with her in Greece with her old and linen-clad lover (who I kept imaging as Kris Kristofferson. Odd)? Was I supposed to really care about her gardener's epilepsy? So many more questions that have no satisfying answers because, once again, I don't think this is meant as a serious book. In which case, I'm being snobby and critical. Or it was meant as a serious book and I'm being picky and callous. Or snobby and critical. Take your pick. Oh my...this is such a bad book .

On the off chance I was wrong, I checked it out.Turns out, I knew very little. I had heard about the ""give choices"" aspect, but there were plenty of ideas that were brand new to me.Written by a child psychologist and physician, Love and Logic is a parenting philosophy that seems to use Zen techniques to avoid angry confrontations with children and teach them personal responsibility through natural consequences. To teach them, a parent must never dictate what that child must do but rather manipulate, er...help, that child to decide between two acceptable outcomes. If a young child has a tempter tantrum when you tell them it's time to leave, instead of physically taking over or allowing your child to turn the situation into a never-ending negotiation, you ask, ""Would you like to leave here with your feet on the floor or your feet in the air?"" Supposedly, the freedom to choose solves all problems.I don't disagree. I think there is much to be said about the dignity and responsibility of choice. I don't doubt that when run to perfection, the Love and Logic technique produces lovely, independent, resourceful children and more. The trouble I have is that it requires parents....me....to do our jobs flawlessly.I'd love to implement Love and Logic techniques into our home. Sadly, as one of the adults that is required to make this work, I am also equipped with emotions that do not always bring out the most mature responses. Sometimes, when my children are being unreasonable, I lose my patience. No where, and I mean no where, did I see a situation in where a parent was allowed to do that. Our emotions and subsequent response to each and every situation needs to be calm, neutral and delivered with a robot matter-of-factness. The line the authors give if unable to think of an appropriate response is, ""I love you too much to argue."" Huh.Another complaint I have with Love and Logic is that there doesn't seems to be a situation where the authors feel that the natural consequence wasn't the best consequence. If your child sleeps in, then they miss school. They can't bother you because that's not part of your day and if you need to leave then they have to pay for the sitter and they have to face the consequences at school for having an unexcused absence. In the very next chapter, the consequence for staying up late was being tired because you wake them up at 6:00 - no matter what. Wait. I agree that a consequence of staying up late is being tired the next day but what was that whole chapter about missing school?The authors explain these consequences as paying a price. They argue that the price for learning these things is small and affordable when our children are young and much more costly if they are forced to learn these things as teenagers or, worse, adults themselves. I agree, and would even let my children stay up late or ""pay"" for an unexcused absence, but when one of the authors (I can't remember which one) wrote about teaching his 12 year old foster son about being on time and telling him, ""I'll pick you up at 5:00 and will stay until 5:03. If you're not there then I'll come again at 10:00 and stay until 10:03. If you're not there then I'll come again at 7:00 in the morning."" The boy missed the 5:00 pick up and only came out from behind a wall as he was about to drive off at 10:03. Was he seriously going to leave a 12 year old out all night long? To teach him about being late? Yikes. That sounds like a call to CPS to me, not good parenting. While we have to teach and train, we also must keep them safe and a 12 year old is not equipped to stay out all night.Reading the book is just the tip of the ice berg. I find it ironic that the authors of Love and Logic bill this philosophy as ""effective and easy to learn"" but have also marketed the book into dozens of other, more detailed books, classes, movies, programs, websites and pamphlets. And, I don't think they are money wasted because as I have tried to apply what I learned from reading the book, I have found myself hitting all sorts of walls. It didn't answer all my questions and I need more information. That doesn't seem exactly ""easy to learn.""As far as reading goes, the book is well organized. The first half takes you through the step by step reasoning behind the theory. The second half is separated into dozens of ""pearls"" which address specific ""what if"" situations. Even with those dozens available, my own particular, ""what if"" wasn't included. I'd love to know how to effectively help my oldest son stop being so hard on himself. But there was no pearl on what to do when your child says, ""I'm an idiot."" when I point out something he misspelled on his spelling homework. Somehow, saying, ""I love you too much to argue"" doesn't seem like the best response.A great book club choice. This is a book that could be discussed all night.

It's supposed to be. Goodness knows I had a hard enough time getting a copy from my library, which, considering how old this book is (24 years!) is its own high praise for the book.Ender is a 6 year-old genius referred to as a Third, because he is an uncommon third child. Third children are extremely looked down upon (I suppose because of their carbon footprint - man Orson Scott Card was WAY ahead of the game there) and the book begins with the decision of whether or not he'll be placed in the military training school. They only accept the brightest to train to fight the Buggers (aliens who look and act like bugs and have already attacked Earth once) and both of Ender's older siblings had been tested and rejected. Ender is eventually accepted and the book follows the physical, mental and emotional toll placed on this young prodigy.I found the robotic prose strangely fascinating. Even all the details about legs tucking and zero gravity. That's not to say I followed it. No, I had no idea which way was up or down, even though I read enough times that ""the enemy's gate is down."" I'm not sure it mattered. I think the point was that it was confusing, most people struggled to understand it, however, Ender not only understood but mastered any environment he was placed in quickly. O.K. Good enough for me.I know this is a series, whose other books I have not yet read, but I'm trying to decide if this book is beloved on its own merits or if people gush because the rest of the story clears so many things up. Because, truthfully, there are a lot of holes as a stand alone story.Much time and space in the book is lent to Ender's equally brilliant brother and sister's intellectual war waging. As willing as I was to let my confusion about gravity and the battle box descriptions slide, I was much more frustrated about the poorly explained government situation. What were they trying to change? For what purpose? Because they could? Because brother Peter was so bad? Because sister Valentine was so good? I found this entire sub-plot poorly explained and distracting. Perhaps it's necessary later on in the series.Still, I was thoroughly entertained. As frequent as the battle scenes occurred, I surprisingly enjoyed all of the details - who was doing what and who was moving where. Of course, I loved the morality questions too. Was any of this fair? No, but did that matter if their actions saved mankind? All sorts of ""The End justifies the means"" situations and arguments.I should probably feel embarrassed that I didn't see the end coming. With that kind of naivety I'm not sure if I'm an ideal science fiction reader or should stay away because I don't have the kind of mental acumen to keep up.

The first novel I read of his was part of the Myron Bolitar series and I so seriously disliked Myron and his sarcastic ways that I dismissed Cobens' books completely.Then, a long airplane ride forced me to reconsider and I found myself enjoying his Tell No One. Smart, complicated and a likable protagonist (a far cry from Myron).No Second Chance falls between the two ends of the spectrum, but closer to the good end. As I've learned is his usual set-up, his protagonist, a plastic surgeon named Marc Seidman, is a likable, clueless, and willing-to-do-anything-to-find-out-what-happened-because-he's-got-nothing-left-to-lose kind of guy. In this case, Seidman's beloved baby daughter has been kidnapped, his estranged wife murdered and he himself shot and left for dead. When the kidnappers call and demand a ransom, he bungles the exchange and fears he's lost his chance to recover his daughter forever.Contrary to the title, he does gets a second chance. In fact, I think he gets a third chance. I know. I don't know what Coben was thinking with that title. Because the book is almost all about the second chance, which happens fairly early on in the novel and it's also when the plot gets nice and murky.Coben plays the role or part-time philosopher several times throughout the book and allows his narrator to pontificate his version of truth. From his observations of the rich to other virtues and vices, Coben tends to moralize his characters. I also loved the many twists and turns and was really satisfied with what I thought was the ending. But then he twisted it again and the ending became something different. Then he twisted it again and I wanted to call him up personally and say, ""Sometimes, less is more, Harlan!"" I'll concede that I didn't see the final end coming, but it's not as satisfying because it rests on pretty much every single person Marc knows ultimately being a complete psychopath.I'll continue to pick up these books when I need to unwind and read a page-turner that lets me escape....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,Feb 2009,"Jan 05, 2009",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43927.No_Second_Chance

It mOne of my favorite things about keeping track and ing the books I've read is that doing so pushes me to read things out of my comfort zone. It makes me want to tackle the classics. Much more often than I used to, I pick up a work of non-fiction - a genre I used to happily skip over. In other words, I'm much more aware of what I read and a lot more choosy.Death Comes For The Archbishop is a book I chose because it is a classic. Willa Catha's name was mentioned somewhere, and I gritted my teeth in the knowledge that there was another famous author I'd never read. Call it pride, but I'm desperate to claim that I read literature and not just novels.As much as I wish I could say that I loved it, I didn't. Truthfully, I thought this book was really quite boring. If I were to rank what I consider most important in terms of what I like in a book, I'd say characterization sits at the top, followed by the story's morale/scope, then plot and lastly prose. I think Willa Catha and I may be complete opposites because prose definitely ranks at the top of her list.Her writing is beautiful- colorful. She describes a New Mexico that is perfectly vivid. I've seen those pinks and browns and peaches in her rocks and hills. I've driven past the absurdly continuous mountains. I've seen the sagebrush and cacti and old mission architecture. She nails it. But I needed more than a pretty setting to stay interested.This book follows two Catholic priests from Europe who struggle to adapt and nurture the faith of their parishioners in a newly formed diocese in New Mexico. There is no plot, exactly, except the experiences, challenges and progression of age of both Bishop Jean Marie Latour and his faithful companion, Father Valliant. Neither characters are developed enough for me to commit to their life and their sacrifice. I appreciated the early setting and the descriptions of this rough new territory, but neither Bishop Latour nor Father Valliant managed to convert me.I can see how someone with a love of the New Mexican landscape would love it, though....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Jan 2009,"Jan 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/545951.Death_Comes_for_the_Archbishop

It is about the special double-vision you get when you are standing with one foot in each place. It is about the family you make and the family you came from and locating, navigating, and finally celebrating the place where they meet.""The first line of the prologue sets the tone by announcing, ""The most important thing you need to know about me is that I'm George Corrigan's daughter."" By the end of the book, there couldn't be a truer statement. I admit that my own parents and siblings are still an important, almost daily part of my life. Yet, I am in the throes of my own chaotic family, filled with a husband who probably wishes I focused more on ""us"" and three little boys who rule my world. This is my existence and until I read Corrigan's description, I would never have given it a label. Now that I know about it, I think it's perfect. Of course! The middle place! Why didn't I think of that?Although this is Corrigan's personal memoir about dealing with breast cancer in her thirties with two young daughters while simultaneously worrying about her father's own diagnosis with bladder cancer on the other side of the country, it never feels like non-fiction. The author is able to focus her writing on the story at hand and although there are plenty of times she veers away from the given chronology, each side story adds so much depth to her characters...real people in this case, that you're always glad for the detour.I finished the book quickly, charmed by her Irish/Catholic family and with an almost jealous wish I had written this. Of course, I don't wish for the cancer stuff, but I loved the format using a present day reality intermixed with childhood stories full of memories including my brother and sisters and parents, who, I've learned since becoming an adult, are human beings independent of being my ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". Of course, my story wouldn't include any vulgar language, this book's only flaw, in my opinion. As much as I wish the occasional curse weren't in there, so that I could freely recommend it to any reader, it is there and she makes it so. On purpose. It's part of her. So, although I probably should have, I didn't really mind.There are several parts of the book that had me laughing out loud, but the most memorable to me is the author's thoughts on having a large family. Her description on having four children - AP Parenting is what she calls it, made me long for one more. Being academically competitive, I agreed with her reasoning and found myself wanting AP credit! Once I finished the book, however, and removed myself from her middle place, I returned to my own middle place and realized how good I've got it with my three.I really liked this.

Wanting to After I'd heard so many great things about this series, I went ahead and bought the first three books for my eight year-old for Christmas. Wanting to know what the hype was about myself, Fablehaven became our bedtime story for about a month (because we didn't read it every night. Not because it is that long).Kendra and Seth are left with their grandparents, who seem mysterious and distant to both children, while their parents go on a cruise. After their grandfather shows them to their filled-with-toys attic bedroom, he explains the rules about where and where not they are allowed to go. The yard is o.k. but everything beyond the yard's hedge, including the barn, is strictly off limits. Kendra and Seth begin exploring their fascinating surroundings which is filled with beautiful butterflies and exotic plants. Seth, naturally curious and not particularly obedient, breaks the boundary rules first. Kendra, the elder sibling, comes to her brother's aid. Grandpa Sorensen, very disappointed, gives them an ultimatum. Break the rules once more and they'll be forced to stay in the attic for the remainder of their stay.Of course, they break the rules once more which forces their grandfather to explain the reason for the rule. Fablehaven - his estate - is dangerous. It is a refuge for mystical creatures who are mostly cunning and selfish. Now that they know what to expect - Kendra and Seth's grandfather opens their eyes to their magical surroundings by having them drink special milk.Brandon Hull creates an interesting world full of fairies and satyrs, witches and naiads. Kendra and Seth, complement each other as brother and sister, giving the readers an acceptable balance of obedient and mischievous. Think Hermione and Harry, only not nearly as smart.My very first observation was that the vocabulary was really advanced for a novel geared for children. At first, I paused after each of the most obvious thesaurus-driven words, wondering if my two sons (ages 8 and 6) knew what each word meant. My oldest usually did (his brother usually didn't care) but I think it's because he's good at understanding context, not because he has a particularly developed vocabulary. I certainly wouldn't have thought of using some of the words the author chose. I don't know if he wrote that way to show off or if he really thinks in those terms.In spite of the vocabulary, or because of it (I still haven't decided it I find it pompous or educational) I enjoyed reading this with my son. I don't think I would have enjoyed reading it on my own, however. The chapters are choppy and most of the time, the book's purpose seems to be to lay the groundwork for a future, more interesting story. While there is a loosely woven plot that comes to a climax at the appropriate end, most chapters start afresh, having little to do with the previous one. Instead, new creatures or features of Fablehaven are explained and Kendra and Seth find themselves in one predicament after another.While not fully developed, I do think Kendra and Seth are interesting characters. The adults who live at Fablehaven, on the other hand, Grandpa and Grandma Sorensen, and the caretakers whose names presently escape me, are so flat face dull for such an interesting place that none seem to understand that they see magic everyday. Magic!Whatever I thought, the boy who the books were intended for absolutely loved them. He sat staring off at the wall, mesmerized, night after night, and begged for another chapter as I put the bookmark in place. He talked about Kendra and Seth in the car and wondered aloud how things would end. After seeing how much he enjoyed the book, I almost wish I were eight again.As my son would give it five stars (although I wouldn't let him) and I'd give it two, I compromise in the middle with three. It's not a perfect rating, as it doesn't really represent either of our views. We've already started the next book in the series. Time will tell if I like it any better than its predecessor.

I can't ignore the fact that Curtis Sittenfeld (a woman by the way. I didn't look at the picture in the book jacket and had a male author writing this in my head for well over half the book) creates one of the most interesting and well-developed characters, Alice Blackwell, for a novel that I have read in a while. The creepy part of that is she modeled Alice after Laura Bush, flagrantly so, and I'm left feeling it's all unfair somehow.I've always enjoyed historical fiction. I've given high praise to authors who seem able to ""resurrect"" actual historical figures and infuse life into them by placing them in dynamic relationships and creating a voice with conversations. Perhaps the historical figures need to be dead before writing about them, because when Sittenfeld takes the same liberties with Laura Bush, fictionalizing her actual history, I'm left with is disgust at Sittenfeld's disregard for her privacy, her public position not to mention the actual truth and have a very strong urge to dismiss this book as gossipy garbage.Sittenfeld must have expected reactions such as mine. From it's charged release during last year's Republican National Convention, the book has been criticized by many, mostly Republicans, as being salacious and untrue - two charges Sittenfeld herself agrees with. Well...maybe not the salacious part, but she certainly included enough sex to keep even the fluffiest of beach readers happy. Doing so didn't give the book an honest quality but it did manage to make it feel trashy. She tried hard enough to portray Charlie Blackwell as close to the general media's version of George W. Bush that the otherwise normal trash becomes a downright disturbing image. I wish I could scrub my brain.But not all of it is tawdry and in poor taste. Alice is so...real, in both her motivations and actions that if she were completely fictional my fingers would be tripping over themselves typing, ""just so real and complex. So full of depth."" As a result, I feel like a hypocrite for being so turned off. After all, are any characters truly ""made up?"" It seems to me that most authors use real life subjects as inspiration for their characters, so if the author acknowledges this, and even leaves that inspiration exposed and traceable, should they get less or more credit for being authentic?When I finished reading, all I wanted to know was, ""How much of this is true?"" Enough of the events in Alice's fictional life are documented facts in Laura Bush's own that it seems more true than it is. In an interview Sittenfeld gave, she claims 85 % of it is fiction. That only the major events in each of the book's four sections (accidentally killing a classmate of hers in a car accident during high school, being a librarian and meeting her husband at a BBQ, having a husband who bought a major league baseball team, and being married to the President of the United States) are true and everything else is speculation and ""what if""s.I guess that's fair but it still doesn't seem like it. For a book to be written about an actual First Lady, a human being entitled to the same dignity we all deserve and a woman who most of America holds in high regard (even the author herself admits that she's fascinated by her), and to speculate about private things like her sexuality, her commitment to her husband, an abortion and drug use, and dress it up as fiction to avoid being charged with slander and libel seems cowardly.The author claims her intention was not to expose Laura Bush but to write what life might be like if you happened to marry a guy who went on to become President of the United States. If she had managed to write that, and leave out her obvious bias for Laura Bush and against President Bush - she might have succeeded in writing something thought provoking and brave. While it may be thought-provoking, it certainly isn't brave...it's cheap and dangerous.

Regarded wideWritten by poet Sylvia Plath, this book garnered a lot of attention after Plath committed suicide a month after its initial publication. Regarded widely as auto-biographical as well as controversial because her mother opposed its release, Plath describes a woman's descent into depression with a fascinating coolness.As far as descriptive writing goes, this book does its job. Immediately, I was taken away into Esther's perspective...her fogginess...and her surrender to darkness.Even in the book's beginning, when Esther was still a relatively high functioning intern for a magazine in New York City, the writing matched her experience with a lethargic pulse. The exhausting night life, the confusing introduction into an adult world and the cattiness between ambitious and talented women are all tiresomely laid out.As Esther begins to doubt her qualifications for life beyond getting straight A's, that pulse slows even further as her inability to cope with the uncertainty following her internship sends her into a spiral of depression. The final step into her abyss seems to be the rejection letter she receives once home for a prestigious writing class taught by a world-famous author. Once that occurs, Esther stops sleeping and her mother unwillingly but with concern sends her daughter into the unfamiliar world of psychiatrists, mental institutions and controversial shock therapy treatments.She describes her depression as experiencing life as if under a bell jar. Suffocating, her awareness of her situation as well as that of the outside world is distorted and separate. Again, Plath's description is all perfectly rhythmic - only this time it feels like a record being played at half speed...the words blurring together like Charlie Brown's teacher.I loved the ending.

If there weren't so many great books written about this black mark of the world's history, I would ban myself from reading any books on this topic in the future. I hate that such a horrific occurrence is repeatedly used as bait for novelists.Bohjalian is a good author, though, and does a good job developing his characters, giving them interesting conflict, all the while threading bits of real history into his story that he obtained through diligent research. I'll give him credit for all of the above.However, part of me felt like Bohjalian decided this was going to be his one and only time to write about the Holocaust so he was going to put it all in one book. The details he gives about the atrocities committed by the German soldiers, the Russian soldiers and the desperate and destroyed left in their wake is so graphic, so skin-crawling brutal that it borders on gratuitous. Including as much as he does has the opposite effect from the one I imagine the author intended and his book almost becomes a WWII caricature. I'm not saying the things he describes didn't happen. No, he seems to have read enough journals and letters to give each horror story credibility, but to include them all -- in the same book, witnessed by the same characters in the space of about a year -- it made these disturbing acts of cruelty seem made-up. I feel it was a disservice to take someone's real life nightmare and diminish it by setting it alongside so many other nightmares so that they all seem somehow....less. Because that is what happens. The first description was like a punch in the stomach, the next a slap on the face and all the rest...swats on an already numb backside.As much as I wanted to, I didn't dislike this book. Bojahlian creates a complicated story about the fallout from ignorance, naivety, and privilege found among the rural aristocrats of Poland and Germany near the end of the war. Not forced to witness the daily disappearance of Jews and other minorities, the Emmerilich family was living in relative peace and prosperity, along with their polite relationships with the POWs helping out on their beet farm, until the ugly consequnces of their fuhrer's decisions found their way to the family's country manor, Kamenheim. Anna, The Emmerlich's teenage daughter, falls in love with Callum, a scottish POW, and convinces her parents to allow him to remain with their family instead of sending him back to the prison camps. As Callum and the Emmerlichs flee the approaching Russian troops, the blinders of this family's eyes are removed and they finally see first hand the destruction throughout their land. Along their west-bound journey, they meet and become dependent upon Uri, a young, vigilante Jew posing as a German soldier in order to survive. There is an additional, competely separate story involving a french, Jewish girl named Cecile who is trying to keep herself and her friend, Jeanne, alive while prisoners in a concentration camp that does eventually intersect with Uri and the Emmerlichs but not soon enough to be satisfyingThere are plenty of lessons to learn within the pages of this book, but I can't say that it is one I recommend. The author tries to write too many stories at once-- a romance, a look at Nazi sympathizers, stereotypes the Polish people had of Russians, allied prisoners of war, a coming of age story, the gore and sadism of war, Jewish resistance, Jewish survival and an unnecessary epilogue, to make this novel truly great....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Dec 20, 2008","Dec 02, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2017056.Skeletons_at_the_Feast

That experience taught me that Doig is in no hurry to entertain his readers. Rather, a lot like growing up in Montana, he rewards those who endure.With this in mind, I began The Eleventh Man, Doig's latest novel. Ben Reinking grew up understanding how the world of journalism worked as his father owned the local paper in Gros Ventre, Montana. With a degree in journalism from Treasure State University, where he was also a member of ""The Supreme Team"" 1941 championship football team, he enlists in the armed forces as a pilot. Before he is finished with his training, however, he is given an assignment a war correspondent for the Threshold Press War Project. When the war department learns that the entire eleven members of ""The Supreme Team"" are enlisted in the war, they propagandize the situation into a opportunity to create war heroes. Ben travels around, visiting his old teammates where they are serving and writes a regular column, spinning tales of bravery and American pride. While waiting for his different travel assignments, he spends his time at East Base outside of Great Falls, Montana. There, he falls in love with Cass Standish, a married female pilot in the Women's Airforce Service Pilot (WASP. There really were female pilots. I had no idea!)When his columns turn into obituaries as teammate after teammate falls, Ben is forced into understanding that nothing is fair in love and war.An interesting enough look at WWII, but there is something almost too planned about this book to make it satisfying. It's almost as if I could see his brainstorm page lying somewhere on a table - ""I'll have one guy serving in Italy. This guy in the Pacific. Another one in London and another storming Normandy. I need a few to be stuck in the states to highlight what went on here, though. I know...I'll put one guy in the coast guard and another will be stuck flying back and forth to Alaska where I can write up the Russia angle. To tie them all together, I'll make them all old friends....no...teammates! Even better. And one will know what's going on with everyone else and he'll mainly be in Montana so I can still write about the area I know best!"" A jaded opinion, but it felt that way.If you love all things WWII, then you'd probably enjoy this book as well. If not, then read Doig's other books instead.

While I understand the emotion contained in the line, I think a more accurate first line would have been, ""Last night, I dreamt of Rebecca again."" This is, after all, a story about the people who obsess about Rebecca: Mrs. Danvers, Max de Winter and the narrator.A woman narrator, who never acknowledges her own name (symbolically), withdraws into the shadow of her husband's first dynamic wife, the great Rebecca, who tragically drowned. Throughout the book, the second Mrs. de Winter interprets her husband's occasional melancholy and detachedness as somehow her fault - causing her to revert back into her own natural timidity and awkwardness in an environment where such qualities are regarded with disdain and impatience - particularly by Manderley's housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.I felt impatient with this second Mrs. de Winter too. What was her problem? ""Just be yourself!"" I wanted to shout while shaking her by the shoulders. After all, it was her own personality that shined when she met Max de Winters, the man she claimed to love, although I have to admit that I never personally felt their connection. To me, he was kind of a creepy, mysterious old guy.He turned even more creepy and mysterious when he brought his young bride to his beloved Manderley. From day one, he left her out of his intimate world and somehow expected her to handle the dramatic change from being the hired companion of a wealthy woman to being mistress of a wealthy English estate all on her own. The unnamed character is thus left alone and uninformed to solve the clues left for her: What was Rebecca like? How did she die? Why did her husband marry her if she was clearly nothing like this great woman?A-ha! A revelation I did not see coming makes sense of it all and then it turned into a book I didn't enjoy quite as much. I had liked the young woman's confusion and insecurity, even though I would find such behavior in real life irritating. I was enjoying du Maurier's depiction of the power of influence and the dangers of comparison.Rebecca was the best developed character even though she was dead throughout the entire book. I knew what she looked like, how she acted, what her motivations were and her flaws and talents. I even knew what dresses were included in her wardrobe and the kinds of menus she planned. Max de Winter's character was poorly developed. The reason for his initial infatuation and subsequent behavior is rashly explained. As a result, when the novel needed the readers to care about protecting him and ultimately grieving over his great loss, I found myself unmoved. It seems to me that du Maurier counted on the drama being sensational enough so that we readers wouldn't notice the discrepancy between his cool and detached personality and his confusing and erratic behavior. Mrs Danvers, on the other hand, was satisfyingly scary.An entertaining enough read, but the plot's collapse keeps it out of my own ""great books"" category....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 07, 2009","Nov 18, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/594139.Rebecca

Let's just get that out of the way so there is no confusion later on.Ken Follett describes a gloomy, dismal, nearly barbaric society whose citizens' greatest concerns seem to be their egos and their lust for power and control. He uses the building of the great European cathedrals as the impetus for his story; the magnificent structures were made possible through trickery, lies, greed, criminal acts and selfish ambition. Forget about the Glory of God...that's just history's cover story. But Follett's cathedral in Pillars of the Earth serves as much purpose as the hospital in the soap opera General Hospital. He focused much more on the personal drama, romance, and rivalry of his weak characters. This was historical fiction a la Daytime television.The story didn't even feel historical. Follett tried. He mentioned eating with a knife almost as frequently as the tunics his characters wore (Setting it apart from modern day. We no longer wear tunics, you know). But everything felt too modern - their speech, their attitudes, even their relationships. I read the mammoth 1,000 page story quickly but I can just as easily get sucked into Guiding Light. The plots are interesting enough...just mind-numbing and unlikely. For example, the Alfred-Aliena-Jack love triangle had my interest but then the high drama of Aliena's secret pregnancy followed by her truly unbelievable delivery (during the same time the ceiling of the cathedral fell....underneath the stone rubble....really?) along side Jack's odyssey was just too much. And could someone please just get kill William Hamleigh before he rapes someone else? (They don't. The reader is required to experience one too many grotesque acts by an inhumane man who supposedly fears hell. Once was MORE than enough, Ken. We get it. He's baaaaaad).Even if there is some historical truth to the background story - the difficulty in building a cathedral (oh yeah..remember that?), it is overshadowed by all the non-historical melodrama. I don't think Follett did that period of history any favors by making it all seem so salacious.Here Be Dragons does a much better job of storytelling the tumultuous middle ages.

I have a serious handicap when it comes to reading non-fiction and if I'm going to read a biography of someone, I wanted to read about someone whose life's details I had some...nay....any interest in knowing. An architect, even a really, really famous one, didn't meet that criteria.When it was selected as a book group selection, I waved my white flag and read it anyway. Say what you will about book groups, one thing I appreciate about the forum is that they tend to throw books in my path that I wouldn't otherwise read. When I end up actually enjoying the mandated book, I appreciate the selection even more.Loving Frank is part factual biography, part fictional novel featuring the life of Mamah Borthwick Cheney's as she fell in love with Frank Lloyd Wright. Mamah, a feminist, intellectual and suffragist, was married to safe, loyal but rather boring Edwin Cheney. The married couple were financially secure enough to keep a nanny, a housekeeper and eventually hire an up and coming architect to build one of his conceptually new ""Prairie Houses"". Financial and marital security did not bring contentment to Mamah, however, and when Wright intimately connects with her on an intellectual and emotional level during the building of her and her husband's home, a physical affair between the two quickly follows.What makes this story compelling and great discussion fodder isn't Frank and Mamah's relationship or their affair, it's the constant negotiating and justification the author forces Mamah to debate with herself and with the world about the honesty and integrity of romantic and self love. For Mamah, a person's own happiness super ceded that of any one else's, including one's children, although she admitted several times how incongruous that belief felt at times. When she found literature written by radical thinker, Ellen Key, her belief that she should be with Frank at the expense of everything else, because she loved him, deepened. I am left wondering when, if ever, a selfish act is the BEST act. As much as the pair wished it to be so, they did not exist in a bubble and their relationship had real and lasting consequences to the families they abandoned.If the moral debate is the actual gift of the book (and for me, it was), then the fancy wrapping and giant bow is the holy-cow-wow! drama and historically significant events that made up the life of Frank Lloyd Wright.

The conflict between settlers and Indians, the differences in standards of living, travel, family life and honor as well as the inevitable similarities. On the other, I was repulsed by the description of horror and violence, which I felt, at times, bent towards gratuitous. Back to the first hand, I learned so much about the Comanche Indians, their history and motives, and was impressed at the author's meticulous research that allowed me to feel connected to a people who were wiped out and who were also notoriously known as some of the ""bad"" Indians. However, my other hand is shaking its finger at the jolty story-telling St. Clair Robson uses to include all her research, abandoning major characters' narratives at times to include a minuscule point of view from an unintroduced and impossible to remember character. But, I loved the real life romance between Cynthia Ann Parker, who was kidnapped by the Comanche as a girl, and Wanderer, who later became a powerful chief and leader of his tribe. That love does not include the infrequent but present inclusion of Harlequin style romance writing as flashes of skin and color and texture of pubic hair was described.As it often happens after reading historical fiction, I wanted to know what parts of the book were real and which parts were made up for dramatic effect. A lot of it is actually true. Kudos to the author for that. While some license is taken with the timeline of events, particularly toward the end of the book when facts and points-of-views start to contradict each other, much of what happened to Cynthia Ann, or Nadua, as she is known to the Comanche, can be verified by eye-witnesses. Obviously, not her day to day life while living with the Comanche Indians, but the author uses other sources to fill in that story line.I guess I liked it. Sometimes I can't tell if I like or dislike something until I start writing and determine what my own bias is. I appreciate a glimpse into the Comanche way of life. I don't think the author diminishes their viciousness at all and it's still hard to understand how any human being could do some of the things that particular tribe of Indians were known to do, but, like any people, they had relationships and traditions and values, albeit different from those I know and have. Recognizing our differences, and understanding the whys and hows they exist, is the key to learning from our history, I think.

What I've been trying to figure out since reading it, is if I liked the book because I liked this story or if I liked the book because I liked the original.After much reflection, I believe I liked both. As most everyone probably knows by now, this is a re-telling of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Wroblewski doesn't even try to hide the attempt as he calls the main character's mother, Trudy (Hamlet's mother was Gertrude) and the evil uncle, Claude (Hamlet's evil uncle...Claudius). Some of the other mirrored characters were more disguised but most were there. And if you know the story of Hamlet, you understand that a son goes nearly insane trying to prove his beloved father was murdered by his uncle, who sinisterly and without remorse takes his father's place in both profession as well as in his mother's affection. It's a known tragedy and the ending is not happy. No apologies.I can handle an unhappy ending. However, I think at Sawtelle's end, the author thought his book would become a tragedy if he simply ending everything as horribly as he possibly could. I felt sad, bad and mad compared to the more desperately ironic tragedy of Hamlet's demise. Furthermore, even though I knew the bad stuff was coming, I stopped expecting it because Edgar was just a kid. A mute kid. A mute kid responsible for beloved dogs. You don't write kids and dogs in despair without some kind of silver lining in modern day books. You just don't.I know it seems like I'm spoiling the ending but I don't know how you separate The Story of Edgar Sawtelle from Hamlet and I can't be blamed for including spoilers about Hamlet. Because the skeleton of Edgar Sawtelle's plot is not original, I don't think Wroblewski gets credit for it. Shakespeare does. Sort of like the movie Clueless with Alicia Silverstone. Cute movie. Funny. But it's really Emma: Jane Austen's brainchild.Wroblewski does get credit for making Edgar mute, a brilliant angle to writing the young and confused protagonist's inability to effectively communicate. In that, he created a unique Hamlet character that managed to be separate from the original. I believed in Edgar Sawtelle. I believed in his innocence, his loneliness and why he runs away. The author also gets credit for its stark midwest setting and the fantastic dog characters, which certainly creates an effective emotional response. You absolutely believed that those dogs loved Edgar without condition, particularly Almondine, an ability which seems lost to most human relationships these days.In the end, I think it's a good book because Shakespeare is a genius and created an interesting plot and Wrobleweski didn't ruin it with his modern interpretation and more than competent writing.

The main character is Rick, a 30-something year-old man who thinks his marriage to Carol is beyond repair but the lessons he leanrs about forgiveness can be applied to any struggling relationship. Using two Old Testament examples, Abigail and David (which, embarrassingly enough, was a story that was previously unknown to me) and Jonah's mission to Ninevah, Rick's grandfather guides him like a Greek philosopher to new understandings about sin, blame, forgiveness and peace.I hesitate to give you the conclusion. I guess I'm being as annoying as Rick's grandfather (and, believe me, he was plenty annoying even as a kind of guiding angel) who wanted Rick to figure out for himself what the the scriptures were teaching instead of simply telling him the big ""ah-ha!"" but those conclusions are powerful.

I really enjoyed it.It's only flaw, in my opinion, was that sometimes the essays felt overly essay-ish. It's not like I want the authors to dumb their writing down, because their writing wasn't difficult to read or hard to understand, but sometimes...only sometimes...I felt the superfluous descriptions of leaves, food, weather, etc, etc was added because they were English majors going for the ""A"" instead of mothers writing for mothers. That's all.This would be a GREAT book for any young mother, any mother who ever was a young mother, any woman who one day hopes to be a young mother. In other words, this would be a great book to read for any woman. I'm sure some men would even like it too.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,"not setJul 27, 2022","Nov 06, 2008not set","Oct 17, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4609795-the-mother-in-me

Apparently, Amy Bloom is a successful short story author and Away is her first attempt at a novel. Unfortunately for us readers, Away, while a novel's size in length, does not contain a novel's size plot. It has lots of side stories and a sort of light at the end of the tunnel to get you to keep reading, but a journey is not a plot and I found myself weary of the main character, Lillian Leyb, and her journey to find her possibly alive daughter, Sophie.More than that, I found Lillian's character, the one and only consistant character from beginning to end, to be underdeveloped. I knew the kinds of shoes she wore, but I was given very little information about her personality. Did she enjoy being a mother? Did she love her husband? Does she want to be an American? The author writes her as extremely motivated without detailing her motivation. It's frustrating.Her story begins as she looks for work and opportunity as a newly landed immigrant in New York City during the 1920s. Destitute and alone after the murder of her family in Russia, there is a coldness and lack of feelings to her actions. She seems to believe and act upon the philosophy that a desired end justifies any means.Again, the story flounders because Bloom never really tells us what end Lillian wants. For the first 100 pages, she seems to merely want security but not necessarily happiness. When she receives news of her daughter who is possibly alive and possibly living in Siberia, the story suddenly changes and her sole desire is her daughter. The story's dramatic change from an immigrant's survival guide to a not-without-my-daughter drama doesn't work. The stories aren't really necessary tied together and the novel unravels into a series of short stories - none of which are particularly enjoyable as they each describe Lillian among the morally bankrupt as she impossibly attempts to find her daughter.The delays and harships along the way (and along the way I mean from New York to Siberia via Alaska) have an almost circus-like horror to them. Any one of the situations Bloom puts Lillian in, starting with the massacre she witnesses while still in Russia) would be enough to defeat the strongest of women - if not kill them. Add to the implausibility of Lillian's survival the lack of background development to even care that mother and daughter are reunited and Away becomes a very fragmented and unfulfilling story....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 20, 2008","Oct 01, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/217086.Away

With that kind of attention, I just can't help myself. I loved it. I really loved it. I even cried at the end, which is so, so rare these days (unless I read Nicholas Sparks who always seems to get me at the end with his overtly emotional drama. Blast him.).Charlie Gordon is a thirty-two mentally retarded man with an IQ of 70. He works as a janitor and errand boy in a bakery and considers his life good and happy because he has lots and lots of friends. He is aware, however, of not being very smart. He thinks if he can learn to read and write properly, he'll be smart and able to understand and participate in what everyone else is talking about.When an opportunity to undergo an experimental surgery as part of a neuro-psychological study to artificially increase intelligence arises, he happily signs on. He can't wait to become smart.Algernon is the name of a mouse who has reached unprecedented levels of intelligence following the same surgical procedure. Charlie, the first human subject, mirrors Algernon's success and reaches levels of intelligence far beyond what the doctors behind the study are capable of understanding. Alongside his increased intelligence are emerging emotional capabilities, such as romantic feelings towards women, and troubling memories he was previously unable to remember or understand with his lower IQ, about his childhood and friends.The entire story is important and poignant. The author, Daniel Keyes, includes part of Plato's, The Republic, to begin the story. Plato writes:Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderment of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den.I don't know if he read Plato's words and then wrote this story, or if he serendipitously found it afterward, but it is the perfect prologue. As Charlie adjusts his sight from living in the den of his limited mind to the brighter light of understanding, the growing pains the rest of us have had years to adjust and become accustomed to, are uncomfortable and awkward.Likewise, at the peak of Charlie's intelligence, when he viewed the world around him in the brightest light possible, Charlie understands the flaws of the experiment that those who developed it were unable to see. With that understanding, the tragedy of watching him lose his grip on so much knowledge feels overwhelming.As far as being commonly banned, I have no idea, at all, how this could be. The only thing even mildly questionable, to me, is Charlie's struggle to come to terms with the negative sexual conditioning he received from his mother as a boy. As he begins to express the feelings he has for women in general, and specifically towards Alice, a woman he loves, he struggles to understand, beyond theoretically, the complexities of the male-female relationship. While these situations are included, I actually think it's a critical part of the discussion of light and dark. Perhaps not for middle schoolers, but definitely for those of us who live with our own conditioning and judgment.I highly recommend reading this. Even if you know you've read it long ago for school, read it again as an adult. And then test your own eyes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2008","Sep 26, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18373.Flowers_for_Algernon

My brain simply doesn't appreciate its intended purpose - creativity, imagination, fantasy. Instead, I wonder, ""What's the point here?"" Sometimes, there is a point, but I think with Ronald Dahl, the focus is placed on the magic and if there happens to be a story in there somewhere in it..so be it.I borrowed it from the library because it was on the most-commonly-banned-books-in-America shelf and I wondered how the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory could upset so many modest American readers?I still don't know. Unless there is some upsetting symbolism that went way over my head and would be sure to go over the head of its intended audience, I don't understand how this book could offend anyone but mean, crusty old aunts who don't love and take care of their orphaned nephews.That being said, I wish I loved this non-controversial story, but I didn't. I thought it was overly strange. Strange in a did-you-write-this-while-tripped-out-on-LCD? kind of way. Giant talking bugs. Living in a peach.

He didn't love it. Not because it was strange but because like most things he reads, the characters are magical and the plot bizarre. For him, it seemed almost standard fare. When he finished, he handed it back to me and I asked, ""Did you like it?"" ""Yeah."" That's it. No buzz.

When I passed by a shelf at my library that was full of the most commonly banned books in America, and found Slaughterhouse Five, with its distinctive ""V"" embellishing the front cover in plain view, I thought to my rebel self, ""Perfect.""On any given day, I'm going to be an opponent of book banning. If any one person has a problem with a book, I fully embrace that person's agency to not read, never read, and with as much influence as they believe they have, persuade others to do the same.ban1 /bæn/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[ban]- verb - banned, ban·ning,1.	to prohibit, forbid, or bar; interdict: to ban nuclear weapons; The dictator banned all newspapers and books that criticized his regime.2.	Archaic.a.	to pronounce an ecclesiastical curse upon.b.	to curse; execrate.Waaaaay too extreme an action for this book, and, really, for any book. Notice the sentence in italics used above. Notice it contained the word ""dictator"".Banned or not, I found Vonnegut's part memoir/part novel about free will and war in general, but the bombing campaign against Dresden, Germany during World War II in particular, to be extremely provocative.The plot is not your straightforward, everyday war novel plot. Rather, Vonnegut puts his character, Billy Pilgrim, an unambitious and fearful optometrist from New York, in the war and makes him the unwilling companion of a psychopath. As Billy becomes ""unstuck in time"" and later abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, the novel takes several unexpected twists.It sounds weird, which it is, but not overly so. Somehow, even when describing the Tralfamadorian's ability to see in four dimensions, their ability to see everything that has ever happened at once but their choice to concentrate instead on any one moment of their lives, the hands that comes out of their bodies pointing straight up and their telepathic communication, it doesn't seem like a gimmick. Not only does it provide comic relief to a horrific subject matter, but it also allows Vonnegut to write a parallel perspective - perhaps his but probably more what he thinks the masses believe. As Billy Pilgrim narrates each scene, he does so with this Tralfamadorian understanding of time. The atrocities he faces in the rail car that takes him from France to Germany as a POW, the complete destruction and death of a once beautiful city and the execution of a good man are written with the matter-of factness and reality that would have been impossible for him to describe in detail otherwise.I think part of the uproar, if there still is any, is over its age appropriateness. I know this is required reading for a lot of high school students, and while I think a mature and interested reader could appreciate the opinion Vonnegut attempts to give form to, the language, description and attitude of the book could easily offend many a student and parent.It would be a hard thing to be an English teacher and give a ""required reading list"" to your class. You want to choose books that create discussion and trigger thought, which this book certainly does. However, just as I feel no book should truly be banned, I equally feel that every reader should have a choice as to what they read. But then, how do you have a class? I don't know.As Billy Pilgrim famously says, ""So it goes."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Oct 08, 2008","Sep 26, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five

Now, of course, I have no idea how I missed it. Ella Minnow Pea. LMNOP. Obvious. So obvious I wonder what else I missed. Such a clever title. Such a clever book.Ella Minnow Pea resides on the fictional island of Nallop, off the South Carolina shore, where all the residents are brought up in reverence of syntax and language. The founder and most celebrated resident, Nevin Nollop, was the author of the well known keyboard practice sentence, ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" When the letter tiles creating this celebrated sentence beneath his statue begin to fall off, the self-righteous and clearly brainless members of the governing council take it as a sign that Nollop, himself, wants the usage of these letters to terminate. As a result, they ban all future use of the fallen letters. First ""z"" gets the ax, followed by ""q"" and ""k"". The residents of the island face severe and, frankly, far fetched punishment if the banned letters are used in writing, speech or music.As the book is written through letters between friends and family members within the community, the reader witnesses first hand the difficulties in communicating without all of our precious 26 letters. Yes, we need our ""z"" and our ""k""s, uncommon as they may seem. Life without the letter ""d"" is no life at all. End scene.In spite of all of the author's cleverness, which is bountiful, I found this novel lacking. The author, Mark Dunn, brilliantly uses the English language in its most advanced form. While I'm sure I'm exaggerating, (but since this entire book is a satire, I feel it's appropriate here) I think at least 10% of the words throughout the book were words I had never seen nor heard before. Dunn either has an intimate knowledge of English vocabulary or an extremely thick thesaurus at his disposal. For language lovers, I've no doubt this book would be a delight.For story, character, plot and reality lovers, however, the story isn't quite as accomplished. The author's not very subtle dig at organized religion as a vehicle for the blindly obedient to carry out the wishes of non-existent tyrannical beings got on my nerves. Likewise, the characters were so poorly developed that I was never quite sure who the letters were being written by or to whom they were being sent. As their relationships with each other was never the point of the book, however, I let it slide.Ultimately, this is a show-off book about language but not one that really entertains or matters, because the story isn't funny, romantic, endearing, sad or slightly plausible. Just very, very clever....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,"Oct 30, 2008","Sep 26, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16200.Ella_Minnow_Pea

Both catalog the difficulties and triumphs of living in remote areas. Both are historical. Both have a strong and engaging female protagonist who are in love with a man responsibly tied to a piece of land. Neither are fluffy Harlequins but make that pit in the bottom of your stomach churn with romance.In short, I loved it. A Town Like Alice follows Jean Paget, a Scottish woman who was raised by her parents in Malay (now known as Malaysia), returns to work there as an adult and ultimately finds herself trapped there as a Prisoner of War when the Japanese invade the Island during World War II.Her captivity is accurately described as horrible, with starvation and long marches from town to town killing many women and children. But, it also shows that unique ability of women to nurture, even in the most degrading situations. When she meets Joe Harman, an Australian ringger (cowboy) and fellow POW, he tells Jean about his home and work near Alice Springs, a bonza town in the heart of the Outback. The two extremely lonely and isolated characters become friends. Eventually, when Joe steals five chickens to feed the sick and hungry women and children, Jean is interrogated and punished until Joe confesses and is later crucified by a cruel Japanese leader.The story's narration is directed by an elderly British attorney, Noel Strachan, who is put in charge of a trust Jean's uncle leaves her. Even with the narration in his control, most of the story is told through Jean sharing her memories to Noel. Eventually, I found Noel's involvement and third party perspective very satisfying, mostly because it allowed the author to cover a greater amount of time without seeming overly jumpy.The book was written in 1950 and feels like it at times. The attitudes of segregation and thoughtless caricatures of minorities creates feelings of discomfort and embarrassment.However, it's not done with malice, and the story isn't about racial barriers at all, so I didn't find it offensive. If anything, it allows a glimpse into an unapologetic view that most white people probably had at the time - which is actually an interesting glimpse on its own.I appreciated this book - for its less frequently told story of female prisoners of war and for its celebration of the human spirit....more",Notes are private!,0,51,2,"not setJul 27, 2022","Oct 15, 2008not set","Sep 22, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/107301.A_Town_Like_Alice

On his way to their country home, he crosses path during the night with a mysterious and troubled woman wearing all white.Her appearance begins to unravel the secret of Sir Glyde, whom Laura Fairlie eventually marries.

He's a talented author and uses several different voices quite convincingly to tell this story.I appreciated the book more from a historical standpoint than its storytelling. While I found the first two-thirds of the book to be intriguing the climax of the story unfortunately happened with several hundred pages still left for the much less fun wrap up. Oh, several things still needed to be figured out for us readers to be completely satisfied, but, in spite of Collins putting Mr. Hartwright in danger a few times, the book became a little too comfortable and predictable. I knew the smooth ending was coming, but it took a long time to get there!I'm glad I read it, though.

After the war, a young female British author, Juliet Ashton, finds herself unwillingly on a book tour to promote her book, Izzy Bickerstaff Goes To War. She's tired of the war, tired of writing under a pseudonym and tired of trying to be funny and lighthearted about such a horrible topic. Unfortunately, her mind draws a blank when it comes to knowing what else to write about. All of this information is delightfully given through amusing letters to her editor, Sidney.While on tour, she receives a letter written by Dawsey Adams, a native of Guernsey, who has stumbled across her name written in a book by Charles Lamb. Seeking more information on this author, Juliet and Dawsey begin a correspondence that soon involves a dozen or so members of what is known as the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.The letters include information about the conditions during the War, zany character sketches that Island life seems to be best at producing and an emerging story that Juliet eventually realizes is her next book topic. To gather more information for her book, she decides to travel to Guernsey to meet these people she has come to know through letters face-to-face.I have to include one fabulous quote. It perfectly captures the nerves that come along with meeting someone that you ""know"" but not in person, for the first time. In this day and age of internet friendships, her description made me smile.""As the mail boat lurched into the harbor, I saw St. Peter Port rising up from the sea on terraces, with a church on the top like a cake decoration, and I realized that my heart was galloping. As much as I tried to persuade myself it was the thrill of the scenery, I knew better. All those people I've come to know and even love a little, waiting to see -- me. And I, without any paper to hide behind. Sidney, in these past two or three years, I have become better at writing than living -- and think what you do to my writing. On the page, I'm perfectly charming, but that's just a trick I learned. It has nothing to do with me. At least, that's what I was thinking as the mail boat came toward the pier. I had a cowardly impulse to throw my red cape overboard and pretend I was someone else.""In spite of it's long and confusing title, this is a book I happily recommend to everyone. It's charming, uplifting, well written, funny, clean, historical, romantic and, best of all...a very easy read. I've read a few disparaging s that attack the book for being World War II fluff or not an accurate representation of what a female author in 1946 would sound like in letters. To them I say...fiddlesticks. If you want the nitty gritty of World War II or a proper British tone, have at a long list of other books already available.If, however, you want to jump into small-town life on Guernsey, remember the thrill of letter writing, and enjoy a collaborative ""na-na-na-na-na-na!"" at resident busy-body Adelaide Addison - read this book!

With that kind of eager anticipation, I delved into this book, finishing it in two days.Daniel Sempere and his father own a rare bookstore set in post Spanish Civil War Barcelona, where they have lived alone together after his mother died in his early youth. When Daniel is ten years-old, his father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, to choose a novel in its midst to take care of and insure against being lost forever. Daniel chooses a book entitled The Shadow of the Wind, written by Julian Carax. He begins reading his new treasure that very night and, completely engrossed, finishes it by the next day.Determined to find more books written by Carax, Daniel soon learns that the book and its author are surrounded by shadows. For years, an unknown person identifying himself as a character in Carax's book, Lain Coubert, whose name means ""The Devil"", has been collecting all of Carax's books wherever they are and burning them. When he learns of Daniel's ownership and subsequent inquiries, he corners Daniel on the streets of Barcelona and warns him of what will happen if he doesn't hand over his copy of The Shadow of the Wind. To preserve the endangered book, he once again hides it in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and continues his quest to find out what happened to Carax.The language throughout the entire novel is truly beautiful. I remember at one point, early in the novel, the author casually using the word ""nib"" in place of pen and thinking, ""This is a translation?"" The prose can be really fancy at times, but as the characters' lives are surrounded by great books, it doesn't seem out of place or pompous to use these less familiar words.The plot is complicated and well developed. I honestly didn't know who the bad guy burning all the books was until the guy I thought it was was killed. The pace fantastically pulsed and the mixture of romance, suspense and history were all tastefully woven together.With that gushing aside, I found myself a little disappointed with this book. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting, but I know it was more than The Shadow of the Wind offered. I fear my disappointment is a result of the classic case of having too high of expectations.My main disappointment involves the characters, their motivation and their perspectives. There are many characters throughout the book, past and present day, and there was one I absolutely fell in ove with, Fermin Romero de Torres - Daniel's hilarious, enthusiastic, and unbalanced sidekick. His humor and methods of getting things done gave the story a very necessary comedic lift. Besides Fermin and probably Daniel's father, however, who isn't even very well developed, the rest of the characters had me wondering at their extreme behavior.It begins with Daniel, at age ten, when he becomes obsessed with beautiful, older and blind Clara, a woman who, thankfully, is not equally infatuated with Daniel. Clara never seems to possess any quality, other than being blind and requiring being read to, that warrants Daniel's unwavering love. I didn't understand his motivation to become so completely romantically devoted to a woman at such a young age and I don't feel like it was explained, either. He simply was. Until he caught her in flagrante delicato with her piano teacher. And then he wasn't.Almost all of the supporting characters do extreme things or are punished extremely for doing normal things. Every woman who has sex the first time gets pregnant. Every father of said daughters tries to kill the impregnator. Every friend of a boy who falls in love ends up hating his friend. There is just a lot of insane people. It's all very dramatic. Which makes for an interesting story, but not altogether very likely.There is also some perspective problems. Frequently throughout the story, Daniel unravels Carax's past by listening to Carax's peers recall their memories. Each time, the person remembers things that they could not have known. They weren't there. Looks or words between a couple. Promises made in secret. It happens with Carax's boyhood friend who becomes a priest. It happens again with Penelope's, Carax's love interest, nanny, and again with a woman who worked at the company where Carax's books were published. By the end, this flagrant abuse of recollection bothered me. As interesting as Daniel's first person narrative was, if more information was needed to fill in the holes, an omnipresent third person narrative seems more honest and appropriate.Sadly, this is what I do when books fail to meet their expectations. The imperfections glare at me and I mention them - even when a book is really good. And this book is really good. It just fell short of its hype....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2008","Sep 16, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind

What a thinker! Like a talented photographer, TolstoAt the conclusion of Karenina's 800 plus pages, I add my name to Tolstoy's long list of admirers. What a thinker! Like a talented photographer, Tolstoy has an eye for realism and his writing inside the heads of his characters is perfection. For a book where nothing really happens (besides wealthy people hanging out in various places...and a few people dying) to still manage to have such a fascinating effect on readers takes a certain kind of genius. So many times, while reading, I thought to myself, ""Nothing is happening. How did Tolstoy get away with writing this and why are we all convinced it's one of the greatest novels of all time?"" Continued reading converted me, as it has the masses, but it reminds me of an old movie, where the story stands alone, without being propped up by special effects and dramatic music. It's good - naked. These are my take-away overall impressions. But, there were some very frustrating moments that happened along the way. Sometimes, my eyes blurred as I waited for Levin, a wealthy land-owner who has no understanding or appreciation for insincerity and falseness (characteristics that run rampant among his aristocratic peers), to finish his conversation with the peasants or friends about farm management. The amount of time Tolstoy dedicated on a Russian painter living in Italy, and his opinion about art and technique and style seemed wholly unnecessary to me. Almost like Tolstoy introduced the portrait, knowing he'd need it later in the story for contrast, but couldn't simply write leave it at that. Instead, he had to include whatever obscure experience or knowledge he had about art too...throw it into another character. I felt, a bit, like I was being taken on a ride.Obviously, I am a modern reader, and need my greatest-novels-of-all-time written modernly! Imagine, me...little reader from nowhere, thinking, ""This Russian guy needs an editor!""I include the critical thoughts along the way, because I don't think I'm alone in thinking Anna Karenina is, perhaps,a little bloated. However, bloated or not, this is an incredible, incredible book. Embarrassingly incredible. Like, how in the world does Tolstoy see the ridiculous inside everyone's head? How does he know how insecure a man like Levin is - a man, who from the outside, appears to have everything? How does he understand how a woman can be instantly irritated and irrational from something that her lover has said, or...more frequently, has not said? It's not only the realism that makes this book famously good. It's the artful way he makes his case against falseness. Through one of his dual protagonists, Levin, he cleanly paints his case with soft, muted colors - conversations, thoughts, and actions - that reflect,ultimately, a very likable character. Levin does the right thing, usually thinks the right thing - so his thoughts are beautiful, enjoyable thoughts. If Levin hates falseness - well...I will hate falseness too!Then, on a canvas located directly beside the pretty picture, he paints Anna, with dramatic boldness - including the vividness but also the awful, the disturbing, and chaotic result of a woman, who, every bit as passionately, hates falseness too. Whereas Levin is ultimately rewarded for his inability to accept hypocrisy, Anna, a woman we know isn't really bad, but who makes choices that aren't sympathetic either, is punished for it.It may seem bizarre to  a book named Anna Karenina and only now mention her. I was surprised that this isn't more her book. Her story, along side Vronsky's, is certainly the most intense and tragic, but the novel's overall point isn't limited to her infidelity, or about her choice to leave her husband and child (which is what I thought it was going to be about. Even my husband, when he saw I was reading this said, ""Oh. Reading the adultery book, huh?""). In fact, it's about a group of Russia's aritocratic upperclass, and their motivations and justifications about the way they live their lives. Their stories are all tangled together and each of their decisions and actions create shock waves throughout the group. Tolstoy shows how, even within a privileged group such as this, where access to information, money, justice etc., supposedly is the same, how differently they think and choose to behave. There's the brilliance. I read a quote from another famous author who said that if the world could speak on it's own, it would sound like Tolstoy. Exactly.Thousands of s have been written about this book, and I certainly have nothing new to add, but, if you have hours and hours of spare time or a penchant for 19th century Russian socioeconomic exposés or simply enjoy the thoughts of a great mind - read this book....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Sep 15, 2008","Aug 26, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/152.Anna_Karenina

What if no topics were off limits, no person's feelings or privacy taken into consideration, no personal flaws purposely left unmentioned in order to be protected from ridicule?You would probably write exactly like David Sedaris.To actually write like David Sedaris, however, you'd also have to be intelligent, impeccably attentive to details and most importantly - uncommonly funny. With that winning combination, Sedaris's unencumbered writing creates a truly fascinating look into his life and way of thinking.Take, for instance, a neighborhood family that supposedly doesn't watch any television. You've know them, or at least heard about them. But have you hidden yourself in bushes outside their house watching them at night? Sedaris spied on this family with fascination, watching them interact at the dinner table during the evenings and feeling sorry for the absence of television in their lives. After watching one of their children at school being left out of a joke that made reference to a TV show, Sedaris writes, ""It occurred to me that they needed a guide, someone who could point out all the things they were unable to understand. I could have done it on weekends, but friendship would have taken away their mystery and interfered with the good feeling I got from pitying them. So I kept my distance.""Then, when this same family showed up for Trick-Or-Treating the day after Halloween, Sedaris expresses what must be universally believed: ""Asking for candy on Halloween was called trick-or-treating, but asking for candy on November first was called begging, and it made people uncomfortable. This was one of the things you were supposed to learn simply by being alive, and it angered me that the Tomkeys did not understand it.""The subject matter varies wildly from chapter to chapter, but each contains Sedaris's hilarious spin on what would probably appear to most outsiders, nothing to write home about. Although there are several uncomfortable chapters that touch on situations involving his homosexuality, his willingness to expose himself, and, I suppose his willingness to expose his loved ones, give his writing an important and appreciated perspective. It's so enjoyably honest! I mean, he writes about going through the Anne Frank House while simultaneous apartment hunting and wanting to live there because it's ""cute."" Totally irreverent. But when he talks about ripping out the wood stove so that the fireplace would be the focal point and thinking the attic, with its charming dormer windows, could be his office...it ends up being really funny.The best chapter for me was called Six To Eight Black Men when he describes in laugh-out-loud detail the Christmas traditions in the Netherlands. Of course he begins the chapter by pointing out some of the more unusual local gun laws in various states of the USA, mentioning as an interesting fact that in Michigan - blind people are allowed to hunt...alone. As the chapter nears its end, and you wonder what the two stories have to do with each other, he finishes by sharing his thoughts while sitting in a Dutch train station. ""I couldn't help but feel second-rate. Yes, the Netherlands was a small country, but it had six to eight black men and a really good bedtime story. Being a fairly competitive person, I felt jealous, then bitter. I was edging toward hostile when I remembered the blind hunter tramping off alone into the Michigan forest. He may bag a deer, or he may happily shoot a camper in the stomach. He may find his way back to the car, or he may wander around for a week or two before stumbling through your back door. We don't know for sure, but in pinning that license to his chest, he inspires the sort of narrative that ultimately makes me proud to be an American.""Funny, funny stuff....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Sep 2008,"Aug 26, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10176.Dress_Your_Family_in_Corduroy_and_Denim

While I was holding the tissue to my hemorrhaging nostril, a mean-spirited girl, whose mom had already picked a fight with my mom because I didn't invite her daughter to my birthday party that summer, commented loudly to the rest of the class, ""I bet she was picking her nose!""I still remember the humiliation I felt as several people started chanting ""nose picker! nose picker!"" Humiliation remembered, 22 years later, even though mixed with that memory is a sixth grade full of good friends, a wonderful home to go home to, and eleven, equally drama-free years preceding it.This memory of mine was triggered last night after reading this short book (only 144 pages) and I was left wondering what Ellen Foster would categorize as ""humiliating"" from her eleventh year, twenty-two years later.Eleven year-old Ellen's entire family existence is the very definition of dysfunctional. Alcoholic and mean spirited father. Helpless, sad and sick mother. Cruel, angry and spiteful grandmother. Ellen finds a way to survive in each and every situation she unwillingly finds herself in, without any friends to lean on for support except a young black girl named Starletta.Confused by the racial segregation and stereotypes that, while no longer enforced by law, are still enforced by popular belief in the South, Ellen observes a loving family in action while spending time with Starletta's family, her hippie art teacher and husband and later with the woman she calls her ""new mama"" - a foster parent.Even though it created some frustration for me when normal details, like the names of the story's supporting characters, were left out, the author, Kaye Gibbons, never veers from her narrator's eleven year-old perspective. We readers are never privy to the background story of her parent's eroded marriage, the subsequent abuse and health problems, or what Ellen's world looked outside of Ellen's own view. It is Ellen's story, and she tells what matters to her - holes and all.We stand by and watch Ellen going to more than her fair share of funerals, being made of fun of for her dirty clothes, uncombed hair, and crazy father who shows up for school drunk, holding money and shouting, ""I'll pay you for it!"", being forced by the court to go live with her grandmother who makes her go work the fields picking rows of cotton alongside her other ""niggers"" and then, finally cheer for her as she learns what it means to be loved and safe.Honest, tragic, triumphant and heartbreaking - if only Ellen knew that she was supposed to be heartbroken, this is a fantastic glimpse into a young girl's horrifying world and how she fights to find a better one....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Aug 28, 2008","Aug 26, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/277397.Ellen_Foster

I don't believe I've ever read about any other author who has sold as many books as she has, but has also been as harshly criticized as she has been. As likely as it is to find someone who stays up all night to finish her books, it's just as easy to find someone who hates her writing, hates her characters and pretty darn near hates anybody who reads her books.As in most areas of my life, I am a Stephanie Meyer moderate. The right makes me shiver with their extreme obsession and devotion and the left gives me a head ache from all the eye rolls I'm forced to do after reading overly critical s.Breaking Dawn brought the Twilight series full circle for me. I'm not even going to bother with a recap because if you don't know what it's about by now, then you can't possibly care about what I'm going to write. I excuse you.With all my up-to-date hindsight, I can say that I really enjoyed Twilight, was disappointed with New Moon, was slightly confused and cared less about Eclipse and thought Breaking Dawn did a satisfactory job of tying up some of the more important loose ends.Finally, finally....Bella gets to have sex with Edward. Phew! I'm so glad Meyer got it over with at the beginning of the book instead of drawing it out for another 500 pages. She writes it modestly, honestly and kept it what all married sex should be....private. I could say more, but suffice it to say, I appreciate Meyer keeping it real. The passion was there, the awkwardness and anxiety ever present, but most importantly, the love and fun were there too.Like a lot of readers, I found the ""Jacob"" chapters boring. I have never felt the connection between Bella and Jacob and only believed it because the author kept telling me, again and again and again, that they had one. So they had one and it felt even more unbelievable and creepy after Bella was married. Considering the ending and the birth of Edward and Bella's baby, Reneseme (worst baby name ever, I believe) I understand the need; we need to believe Jacob's devotion to Bella and live through his own confusion over it, in order not be completely disturbed by Jacob's subsequent devotion to Reneseme. Still, it didn't make for great reading.I really liked the end. I liked the happy ending. I liked the other vampire characters and the description of their cool gifts. I liked that the good guys won. That is young adult literature. Good triumphs over evil! Stand up to the bully! Work together and accomplish the impossible! Mostly, I liked Bella being a vampire. Finally, she was comfortable in her own skin and it actually made her likable. Perhaps, Meyer meant to have Bella annoy us readers through three long books so that we could see the improvement when Bella makes the transition from mortal to immortal, although I doubt it. Meyer is a genius at writing conflict - not characterization.My greatest complaint was that Edward never got back to being Edward. I'm going to have to accept the character she gave me in books 2, 3 and 4 and forget about the interesting and better developed Edward from Twilight, who has never reappeared in any of the sequels. Oh well.Oh, and the word, ""Ugh"". Nothing screams false like an angry teenage werewolf feeling frustrated and shouting, ""ugh!"". I'm not promoting obscene language or anything, but...really? Ugh?

Humans struggling to remain human take desperate measures to hide and survive. Melanie Stryder and her younger brother, Jamie, both human, are discovered stealing food when another rogue human, Jared, discovers them. Jared and Melanie form an intense bond and the three become a tight-knit family. When Melanie is discovered by a Seeker, a member of this alien race whose main purpose is to discover, catch and transform any remaining humans, her body become inhabited by a soul who goes by the name of Wanderer. Wanderer struggles to control Melanie's being as flashes of Melanie's memories, feelings and urges all complicate the normally peaceful process. Eventually, Wanderer chooses to leave her peaceful peers and, using Melanie's memories, discovers where Jared and Jamie are now hiding with other human rebels.First of all, this book should never have been given the title The Host. The host is Melanie and this is not Melanie's story. It is Wanda's (the name Wanderer is eventually shortened to). Melanie is a strong character and certainly influences the direction of the plot, but as Wanda is developed more and more, and establishes her own relationships with supporting characters, the conflict, climax and resolution all focus on Wanda and her journey. Call it The Wanderer. Or The Soul. Or The Beautiful Shiny Centipede-looking thing.Secondly, the entire story was too long. Wanda, separate from Melanie, falls in love with another human, Ian. But she looks like Melanie and is influenced by Melanie's feelings so she's attracted to Jared. Jared hates Wanda, because she essentially killed the woman he loved. Except that she looks like Melanie. And he is attracted to Melanie. Ian falls in love with Wanda, and her gentle altruism, and becomes convinced he'd be attracted to Wanda regardless of what form she takes - even her shiny centipede form. I don't think so, but Ian was one of those good-all-the-time-guys so...I guess. Ergo conflict. Jared-Melanie-Ian. Jared-Wanda-Ian. Wanda-Melanie-Ian. Wanda- Melanie-Jared. I found this love triangle storyline interesting and complicated. Unfortunately, it was too drawn out alongside several other different story lines, including Wanda's life being in danger from angry humans, Wanda's realization that her species was wrong to eradicate human beings, descriptions of Wanda sleeping on hard dirt (again and again), the angry Seeker who inexplicably won't go away, the plot to get medicine, the plot to get food, the plot to recover other humans, the plot give Melanie her body back and on and on and on. I think she was trying to convince us, through Wanda's realization, that it's great to be human. Hello! Who do you think is reading this? Kind of preaching to the choir. By its end, I was tired. Overloaded with perhaps interesting, but too much, information. The idea of sequels makes me shudder.If it sounds like I'm Stephanie Meyer bashing, I'm not. I think she comes up with unbelievably original ideas. I simply don't like how she tells them. I think her stories are better suited for movies, or - if she would really, really try - shorter books. There should be a really good reason to justify publishing over 600 pages and this doesn't seem to have one. Except that all parties involved must have known that based on the Twilight series success, this book would sell like hotcakes. Why not make it heavy and charge more?In the end, this is an average book. Not awful but not great.

Laine Tavish, formerly Elaine O'Hara, has changed from being the talented young thief working alongside her father, into a respectable antique shop owner in a small, close-knit community. When an accomplice of her father's runs into the street and is killed by a car right in front of her antique store, and is later discovered to have been a part of a 28 million dollar diamond heist, her safe new world no longer exists and she must decide, who to trust and if she's really Laine or Elaine.Throw in a romance with the sexy insurance detective,Max Gannon, an all-evil-all-the-time bad guy, and some safe sidekicks, and you have the first part of the story.The second half, is set in 2059 where life is pretty much the same, except for the frequent mention of 'links and people going ""off-planet"". A quarter share of the diamonds was never recovered from the half-century old theft, and when Shannon Gannon, the granddaughter of Laine and Max Gannon (awww...they stayed together!) writes a book about her grandparents and the diamonds, someone seems to think Shannon, herself, must have the lost diamonds and murders the woman house-sitting for her. When another murder connects the two, detective Eve Dallas sets out to find the murderer, and perhaps the diamonds as well. I don't know if it was the two-book-in-one that didn't fit, but both stories seemed rushed, simplified, and predictable.

But it's not going to sound like it.Once I began reading, I couldn't put this book down because the writing is intimate - very conversational - so I felt like I was reading a lengthy, but funny and interesting, personal letter from my best friend. I admit that I was disappointed with de la Santos's too frequent and flippant use of the F bomb because the other language she uses is so enjoyable. She's a poet, after all, and can string together some really pretty words. I suppose her defense is that it went with Cornelia's conversational tone, and, like many people nowadays, Cornelia casually peppers her everyday language with vulgarities, but I felt like it took away from a book that was on track to be great.If the unnecessary language was strike one, then the overly tidy ending was strike two. Love Walked In begins when Cornelia Brown, a pretty, 85 pound 31 year-old woman obsessed with old-style Hollywood romances and working in a Philadelphia coffee shop, meets Martin Grace, a Cary Grant look alike who changes her life forever after he walks into her cafe. Cornelia's story, told in a funny parenthetical filled first person narrative, alternates with eleven year-old Clare Hobb's, who describes her increasingly desperate situation as her mother succumbs to manic depression in a much more direct third person (I mention the different voices because the change really is noticeable and, at first, a little disconcerting). Cornelia and Clare cross paths halfway through the book.It doesn't feel predictable until it is. There were so many plot twists throughout the first two-thirds of the story, things not going the way you'd expect them to, that its tied-up-in-a-pretty-bow ending didn't feel right. It's a good ending in that everyone's happy and everyone wins (at least the characters whose relevance still matters by the end) , but happily ever after isn't always the best way to end a story.I AM glad I read it.

Although I'm sure I learned about him in my required history classes, and I've been to Mount Rushmore, I can't say that I knew much about him beyond the fact that he was a Rough Rider, a president, a large man, that he created the idea of a protected national park, and that he supposedly said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick."" I also suspected that he was related, somehow, to FDR, but never bothered to find out exactly how.After reading River of Doubt, Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey, I can happily announce that I know much, much more about this phenomenal man. Like he's actually more closely related to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was his niece. But, don't let me fool you. This book isn't a biography of Teddy Roosevelt.Instead, Candice Miller, a National Geographic contributor, details one incredible year of his life - the year he decided to travel to the Amazon and risk all to charter a 600 mile previously unknown river: the Rio Duvida or River of Doubt.Miller doesn't limit her writing to being a travelogue. Instead, she carefully sets up the background story and motivation for his trip. Roosevelt had just lost his bid for a third term as President of the United States and in his humiliation, agreed to an acquaintance's suggestion for high adventure.The year was 1912 and the Amazon and it's many tributaries remained mostly unmapped and mysterious. Roosevelt was an advocate for ""the strenuous life"" so taking a year to rough it in the jungles of Brazil was not a big stretch for him personally. In spite of his own willingness, a man of his status and prestige does not just travel to the Amazon anonymously. His trip included a pre-adventure diplomatic tour through South America - a continent containing several countries who strongly disagreed with his foreign policy while president. It also included a large entourage in an attempt to ensure for this important man's safety.For a non-fiction book about a dead president, a jungle and river I've little desire to explore and a country I've never been to, I was sucked into this drama. Miller is an excellent writer and the story unfolds in a very readable way. There was no textbook or even National Geographic feel to it at all. The only time I got bored was when she included information about the Amazon's soil or the properties of sedimentation on the river. Both were absolutely necessary to completely understand the present dangers, but, still....soil. It's not very sexy.Highly recommend.

In spite of her beauty, Kitty finds herself unmarried at the age of 25 and losing her place as her mother's beloved when her much younger and less attractive sister, Doris, becomes engaged to a baron. Embarrassed by her sister's superior match, desperate to leave the disappointed glare of her mother and panicked that another decent offer won't come her way, she says ""yes"" to Walter Fane, a bacteriologist working in Hong Kong, whom she barely knows.They marry and she accompanies him to Hong Kong where she finds herself bored, ambivalent and unmoved by her husband's love for her. Quickly, she falls in love and begins an affair with Charles Townsend, a handsome, suave politician who, like her, views life as a shallow thing to be lived as selfishly as possible. When Walter discovers their relationship, he coldly gives her an ultimatum: accompany him to inland China where there is a cholera outbreak or he will cause a scandal and divorce her (this was written in 1925 when an affair such as this would, indeed, be an actual scandal) unless Townsend will agree to divorce his own wife and marry her within the week.Predictably, to all except Kitty, Townsend's true colors appear and he disappoints her. Disillusioned and actually afraid of her husband who she believes only wants to kill her, she travels inland and her deeper, more understanding, more aware life begins.The title comes from the English poet, Shelly's, sonnet, ""Lift Not The Painted Veil Which Those Who Live/Call Life."" I love the multiple layers found throughout the book that stem from its title. There are several descriptions of reflections on water, camouflaging the death and disease of the village condemned by cholera with scenes of light and beauty. As Kitty is a front-row witness to death, she observes the veil that lifts when life leaves a body several times. Most poetically is her own veil, lifted to experience a life so different from the superficial one she had expected.I hate that I wanted the Hollywood ending (apparently...there actually IS a Hollywood ending. The book was made into a movie and I hear it gave the story the satisfying ending I didn't even know I wanted until it didn't happen). Seriously, why do I feel disappointed? Maugham writes a fantastic portrayal of a shallow woman developing into something more. I suppose I wanted her progress to have an effect beyond her own awareness. I wanted it to fix her marriage, alter her relationship with her sister and parents, and finish the relationship with her adulterous lover for the right reasons. Eventually, Maugham allows those things to happen but not at a pace which allows Kitty to avoid loss, pain and humility. Once again...why do I feel disappointed? Those consequences are truths and I appreciate and respect truth. Maugham unflinchingly writes Kitty's growth as a woman as it would have realistically happened.But, it's a gritty reality....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Dec 10, 2008","Jun 05, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/99664.The_Painted_Veil

Andy and Louisa do, in fact, face these obstacles, but it is never the focus of the story. In fact, were it not for a few flashbacks to medical school, there is no mention of these two main characters together in the same chapter, much less the same plot for the first 200 pages. Andy does his rural, family practice medical thing in Kentucky, which seems a completely unnecessary setting to me (unless the far fetched and wholly irrelevant ending was somehow important to the story of Andy and Louisa's journey....which it is not), and Louisa returns to her polygamous community to realize that her eyes have been changed to the situation around her after eight years of living away from it.Sure there are a few wistful thoughts, memories and even dreams about the other, but the reason for their attraction, or friendship, is never explained. Andy thought she was beautiful, in spite of her plain, long ankle length dress, and crowning glory long hair, but apparently pursued a relationship with her because she was so smart and he wanted to study with her. (????) The reader is never given any information about Louisa's feelings towards Andy. There is simply an assumption that because she spent time with him, she fell in love with him. The hows and the whys are not worth mentioning, I suppose. Without that development of their relationship for the readers to hold onto, I didn't yearn for these two to be together. As their stories don't actually intersect in the story until page 197, a little yearning would have been nice. But, that doesn't seem to be the point of the book.The thing I liked most about this novel was Jensen's humanistic portrayal of polygamous families. It's always troubled me that the media, pop culture and even the mainstream LDS church portray them as crazy, mindless followers without any thought or choice about their lifestyle. Jensen shows a side of their families and individuals who honestly believe what they practice, and that they do it for the same reason a lot of us do whatever it is we do - because we think it's what God has commanded us to do. I also appreciated the look inside their culture...from the need to protect themselves from outsiders to the organizations of their households. Considering the current events going on in Texas, it adds a deeper understanding to the story. But, that doesn't seem to be the point of the book either.It isn't all sunshine, however, and as Louisa's eyes are opened to the real problems of their community (abuse, incest, birth defects, depression) she becomes a target of opposition to the community - particularly to the Council of Brethren, who seem like old, scary, mean men without a compassionate bone in their bodies. Again, this black and white portrayal of the community's leadership seems too clean and villainous to be true. Surely, there are some members who are able to be something other than completely dogmatic. It doesn't matter, though, because, once again, this conflict with Louisa does not seem to be the point of the book.In the end, I'm not sure what the point is, or was supposed to be. Andy and Louisa seem more like conduits for the author to expound on the quirks and habits of rural Kentucky and polygamy than actual characters. The part of the story where they are actually together and communicating and conflicting only warrants 40 or so pages. Then the story jumps tracks and heads off in an entirely new direction - one I won't mention because it will seem like I am ing another book. I felt like it was a different book.I guess I feel mostly disappointed because I didn't get the story I was promised. I didn't get Andy and Louisa's story.

So superb that if this story were to be turned into a film, the movie would be awful. Dull. Banal. In fact, I think the film's interpretation would be a commercial and critical flop because people would think it was so cheesy and predictable. But...when read, the characters are so real, so satisfyingly flawed that I didn't care about Ed, Marv, Ritchie and Audrey's mediocre lives and stunted emotional maturity. Zusak writes Ed so convincingly and with enough honesty that I hurt when Ed hurt and felt a little giddy with each of his successes. I don't know any actor that could ""emote"" Ed's depth, especially when he seems so simple upon first glance. Sometimes (o.k....most of the time in my perfect world), you need words and an author that knows how to use them, to really know a character. The book begins with Ed, Marv, Ritchie and Audrey, four hapless young 19 to 20 year old friends, lying flat on the floor of a bank while it is being robbed. Following some rather entertaining bantering, Ed becomes a very unlikely hero after he uncharacteristically foils the bank robbers escape. The chapter is perfect. The setting is vivid and with limited prose, the personalities and relationship between the four friends is immediately drawn. Following Ed's heroics and subsequent attention in the press, Ed receives a mysterious playing card, an Ace of clubs, with three addresses and different times of day next to each. Ed realizes, with a little help from two thugs who break into his apartment and threaten him, that someone is watching and waiting for each message to be delivered. After he figures out what to do at each address, the ace of diamonds is delivered, with an even more mysterious message. Because Ed has to figure out what the messages are and who to deliver them to each time, the story has a suspense/mystery feel to it, even though most of Ed's missions aren't scary or dangerous (notice I say most. Some of the messages are downright ""Aw, shucks""ish, but he also has to figure out how to stop a drunk who rapes his wife every night and eventually does it with a gun. Not exactly Hallmark material). In spite of my love affair with Zusak's writing, which truly has me gushing, the plot is flawed. Preceding the book's lame-before-I-understood-and-even-lamer-after-I-understood ending, I couldn't help but think while reading, ""who would do this?"" Who would act on coded messages on a playing card, without contacting the police, without knowing how or why or when or who? It wasn't as if Ed was some super sleuth. His James Bond/Ethan Hunt make-over seemed a bit of a stretch. I simply didn't believe that Ed, in his 19 years of living without confidence or ambition, would even act on the first card. How did Ed, who cannot tell the girl he loves how he feels, or his mother to be nice, suddenly have the nerve to hang out with an elderly woman pretending to be Jimmy, her husband who had died in the war? The leap seemed too great. Buying an ice cream cone for a poor single mother, yes....I could believe that (although I have to admit that each time the message was this simple and and easy to deliver, I wondered, ""who is bothering with this elaborate ploy?"" Kind of a lot of brou-ha-ha for icecream/lights/telling your friend to get a job. From it's ending, I get it. Zusak is. He is the messenger and the book is his message. He created Ed and Ed's story because he wanted us to know, whether great or small, we should help each other. More than that, we should be the kind of person who is willing and available to help each other. Because by doing so, we help ourselves. Fine and great, but by inserting himself into the story, after writing in such a typical, fiction-like manner, the whole book became kind of space age. I guess I felt duped. The strength of the book came from Ed being so real, but the author took that away from me by the end. I felt...manipulated. I mean, I didn't realize I was reading the Wizard of Oz. At least that book had flying monkeys and talking lions. Bad ending.

This whole book has a romantic, old-west feel that immediately snagged me. Even though I had already started another book, the opening chapters of So Brave, Young and Handsome swept me up and into its narrative.It begins with a former postal worker, Monte Becket, painstakingly trying to write 1,000 words a day to produce the follow-up to his first surprisingly successful debut novel. His son and his wife patiently wait for him to finish but Monte knows, deep down, that he doesn't have what it takes to write a second book. With a need to distract himself from his failure, he befriends his mysterious neighbor, Glendon Hale, and accepts an invitation to travel to Mexico with Hale as his old neighbor seeks forgiveness from the wife he left behind years before.Hale turns out to be a wanted man using an alias, and much like Peace Like A River, the story - while beautiful and not in a hurry to get anywhere - turns into a bit of a hunt as Hale evades capture time and again from an old nemesis.In the end, the book has a little bit of everything. Romance, adventure, crime, art, philosophy and a not too shabby tale of friendship.

It's even harder to write about.If Everything Is Illuminated had to be categorized onto one shelf, I'd assign it a spot alongside other books about the holocaust. Or maybe about love. No, it's about friendship. Scratch that...it's really about loneliness.Whatever it actually is about, Jonathan Safran Foer seems to be too odd of a man, and definitely too odd of an author, to define the book or narrow its focus. The minute the reader does, Foer changes the tempo and direction of the book. Sometimes, the stories of cruelty are cover-your-eyes horrible. Sometimes, the situations are uncomfortably obscene. Sometimes, the story and characters are folklorist-y bizarre. Sometimes, it's modern-age hilarious. A lot of the time, it's furrow-your-brow confusing. Everything definitely did not get illuminated for me.With broad, sweeping strokes, I'll attempt to give a basic summary of the book. A young 20 year-old Jewish man, whose name also happens to be Jonathan Safran Foer, travels to the Ukraine in an attempt to track down a woman in a photograph named Augustine, who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. To help him, he hires a tour guide/translator named Alex, whose English appears to have been mostly learned directly from a thesaurus. The nouns and verbs he chooses are almost always slightly off, but kind of, sort of close, and the reader is forced to translate almost all of Alex's narrative into actual English. Part of the book is written as letters from Alex to Jonathan as explanations for his translations and editions. Some of it is what the character Jonathan Safran Foer writes as his novel (after his return from his trip) and some of it is narrative of the actual trip, given by Alex. When the parts are put together as a whole novel, the reader is forced to be quite patient and thorough to finish the book actually understanding all of what happened, and even more willing to be content with its loose ends that will never be tied.While Alex's broken English can certainly be funny, it slows down the pace of the novel (because it's impossible to read it fast) too much. Thankfully, his conversational skills do improve and his letters to Jonathan towards the end are much more accessible. Additionally, because both Alex and Jonathan are young and male, there is quite a bit of sexual humor that turns out to be quite harmless, and even slightly endearing, but still makes the overall effect a bit R-rated.There are so many characters to keep track of and I'm not exactly certain if I figured out who was who and if they mattered. Ultimately, I think most didn't matter because, again, I think the take-home message is meant to be about the horrors of the holocaust and how good people can do bad things. If not, then I missed a whole lot.If you do attempt this book, read it patiently. It might help to read it as part of a group effort. Then, perhaps if you're able to talk it through and everyone brings their own understanding into a collective whole, everything about this novel might actually BECOME illuminated....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,Jun 2008,"May 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/256566.Everything_is_Illuminated

The narrator follows Miguel Lienzo, a Portuguese Jew living in Amsterdam during the 17th century, who had escaped the Inquisition and now trades future commodities on the Dutch stock exchange. Miguel has lost all his fortune in the sugar trade and is currently living in his brother's damp basement, but has recently been introduced by an independent and ambitious Dutch widow to a relatively unheard of commodity: coffee. However, the Ma'amad, a ruling council of Jews, forbids all Jews from meeting with the Dutch in public (only one of many, many outlandish rules), which forces Miguel to create an intricate web of deceipt to carry out his ultimate goal of cornering the market and creating a European coffee monopoly, an act which would ultimately would make him a very, very rich man. Ethics questions abound throughout the book as Miguel, the Ma'amad, the Dutch and all of society manipulate the rules in order to accomplish their own personal goals. At what point of these manipulation does the line of morality get crossed?My husband liked the book because it contains a thriller-like tempo in regards to trading futures. Yes, I did just include the word ""thriller"" in a sentence describing economics. Who would have thought?Well...David Liss did, and it sort of works. He manages to write the desperation and anxiety exchange trading involves, and even manges to write about the complexities of such a market without being overly technical or vague.

Although, after reading some of the other s of this book, I'm not sure anyone ing this book has yet, so I'll just add my own bias to the pile.Marcus Luttrell, a Navy SEAL, writes a first person narrative of his four member covert SEAL team's failed Operation Redwing mission: to take out a high ranking leader of al Qaeda, protected by members of the Taliban, in the remote and forsaken mountains of Afghanistan. The mission, attempted during June of 2005 and risky to begin with if everything went perfectly, turned into a bloody retreat as their location was apparently leaked to the Taliban by some unarmed goat herders Luttrell and his team mistakenly, or rightfully...depending on your ideology, set free after the goat herders stumbled onto their hidden location.Luttrell and his SEAL teammates faced 4 against 100+ odds against a heavily armed, better positioned Taliban army and the results are disastrous for the SEALs. Within 24 hours, Luttrell turns out to be the sole survivor and his injuries and position give him little chance for rescue. Days later, dying of thirst, his legs destroyed from a grenade explosion and from seven miles of crawling, he is found and protected by an independent and stalwart Pashtun tribe who refuse to hand over Luttrell into the hands of the Taliban. With their protection, Luttrell is eventually able to send out an emergency beacon picked up by the US military and is later rescued by an elite team of Army Rangers.Brave and physically fit as Luttrell is, elite as the Navy SEALs are, courageous and patriotic and confident as his team was...Luttrell does not give this story, or his team, the justice they deserves because he fills his book with so much personal bias, so much political and military rhetoric, and much too much tangent-flowing-pat-on-the-back-extraneous-information that this story of survival and valor is weakened to the point of failure. He failed to share his story in a neutral, matter-of fact way that could appeal to the masses, instead choosing to propagandize it to those who already agree with his personal political philosophies. The entire book reads like a Toby Keith song.Recently, I was watching What Not To Wear on The Learning Channel and after a woman's boss told the video camera that she didn't feel like she could send her employee to certain meetings because of how she dressed, Stacy and Clinton told their victim that her clothing should never have a negative impact on the workplace. Neutral or positive....yes...but if her choice of clothing was hurting her opportunities for progress and promotion, she needed to change how she dressed for work.Both for its perspective and understanding about the sacrifice and heroism those asked to defend our country display - this is an important story to tell. Unfortunately, I feel like Luttrell's choice of voice is like this woman's personal choice in clothes: it may be exactly what he thinks but how he tells it is not very helpful and perhaps even harmful. The writing was poor to distraction. According to the cover, there was a co-author involved but the writing felt so juvenile - it read like a high school, or worse, junior high school essay. First hand accounts of history are, of course, invaluable, but a grown-up story should be given the benefit of grown-up writing.Beyond that, I lost track of how many times Luttrell veered off track his story of survival. Whether it was the detailed account of exactly how extremely physically fit Navy SEALs are through rigorous training is (his Bud/SEAL training fills the first 2/3 of the book), how liberal, unfair and anti-military the mainstream media is, personal stories of his family members and childhood, or the unnecessary repetition of military procedures and his personal racism, (I found his stereotypes of the Arab people disconcerting, particularly after Afghan men risked their lives, and the lives of their entire tribe, to protect and help him) this book ended up having too many objectives than the one the title claimed: the story of Operation Redwing and the fate of the SEALs who gave their lives to the cause.Not ever having served in the military, nor knowing many people who have, I can only imagine the indoctrination that must occur to train and prepare soldiers for battle. Luttrell clearly believes certain things to be so but that does not necessarily make them so. The laws protecting human rights given in the Geneva Convention, the criminalization of torture, humiliation and harassment of an enemy, rules of engagement - all, according to Luttrell, written by a bunch of liberals in suits - might seem misplaced and unnecessary in Luttrell's mind, who has a Machiavellian belief that in the military realm, the desired end should justify any means. However, history has shown that without checks of power, mankind is notorious for disregarding human life. I'm not saying those rules and regulations make his job easy or fair, because, just as he complains, too many of our enemies do not abide by these same rules. He contends that unless the members of the military are given free-rein to do ""whatever needs to be done to win"" we will lose not only this war, but any war.Maybe he's right. I don't know. Maybe he should have killed those goat herders who he believed betrayed their location. Maybe the coalition guards in Abu Ghraib had every right to humiliate and treat their prisoners like animals and slaves for the sake of their own morale. Maybe the only real way to be patriotic is to believe your country is stronger and tougher than any other. But I hope not.I hope there is room for a little humanity in the world. I hope, like that Pashtun tribe in Afghanistan, there is room to do the right thing regardless of the guns pointed at you. I hope there are people everywhere who do the right thing because it is right and not because there is a law against doing something else that is wrong. I did not get the sense from Luttrell that in his world of war games and war, he believes many human beings are capable of doing the right thing. Except, of course, Americans and only if those Americans happen to be from Texas, think Bush is the greatest commander-in-chief ever or members or relatives of members in the military. Otherwise, those actions are a surprise and perhaps even an anomaly.Luttrell may be brave, tough and patriotic. He may be highly trained, confident and a finely tuned warrior.But....I hope, for my own sons' future, that he is wrong....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 30, 2008","May 07, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/711901.Lone_Survivor

It seems to me that the market for fictional stories of the war, especially the persecution and massacre of the Jews, has been saturated.While The Book Thief surprised me by being completely fresh in its story telling, The Kommandant's Girl, stuck to the conservative game plan and told a familiar and unimaginative story.To be fair, the book is set in Poland, not Germany, and the story is based on a real life event the author discovered while doing her research in Poland.Emma Bau, a newlywed whose husband has escaped to help the resistance movement, finds herself in the Jewish Ghetto living with her parents. During one night, she is awoken and smuggled out of the ghetto and set up to live as Anna Lipowski with her husband's non-Jewish aunt. At a dinner party one evening, Emma/Anna meets Kommandant Georg Richwalder, a high ranking Nazi party member, and his attraction to her leads to his hiring her to be his assistant. As his assistant, she is expected to and in fact, wants to, help the resistance by acting as a spy whenever she can. To Jenoff's credit, she attempts to give her characters depth by allowing Emma/Anna to become attracted and attached to the Kommandant, understandable considering the short length of her relationship with her husband, and considering the kind of man Kommandant Richwalder appeared to be: fair, hard working and heartbroken from his wife's earlier suicide. As their relationship progresses, she is ultimately asked to betray her marriage vows and use her relationship with the Kommandant to gain urgent information for the resistance.The story is interesting and even well told (except for the end when the author tried to tie up too many loose strings for plot purposes), but that interesting and well told story has already been done. Many times. Unfortunately for Jenoff, whether this particular story is true or not doesn't make its telling any more consequential.

The FBI, embarrassed by her, but unwilling to dismiss her gift, moves her around from town to town to solve difficult homicide cases. The trouble is, since she can only see what the killer sees, she doesn't usually know what the killer looks like, unless he or she happens to look in a mirror.

As a result, she has made mistakes in cases before, making her crime solving skills a liability.All this I can handle. The premise is interesting enough. What makes this book subpar is that the author goes a step too far in making odd Bernadette into a crazy, ridiculous, way-too-unlikely-to-be-real character. Besides that, the reader knows who the killer is very early on in the book, so the chapters describing her visions are unnecessary - the narrator already took us there.Anti climatic with a far fetched ending, I can't recommend this one....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 13, 2008","Apr 15, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/359243.Blind_Spot

It's theme of ""one small decision can change the future for generations"" isn't the mind boggling concept the literary world thinks it is. Of course our decisions change the future. Duh.The author, Penelope Lively, attempts to connect three generations of women, grandmother to granddaughter, through art. The art mentioned was significant to Lorna, a woman raised in a pre World War II upper middle class family, because she chose a completely different life than her parents by marrying an artist and choosing to live a simple, old fashioned way of life in a humble cottage in the country. Matt and Lorna's are simplistically happy, in spite of their poverty, until Matt is tragically killed in the war, leaving behind a young daughter, Molly. While Matt's pieces of work become quite valuable later on and periodically appear in the lives of his daughter and granddaughter, the appearances seem to be nothing more than a prop gimmick and not as consequential to the life decisions Molly and Molly's daughter, Ruth, as Lively leads her readers to think. These ""twists of fate"" she often produced for her characters instead seemed to me to be much more likely the result of their unorthodox childhoods.Consequences is a decent book with very good descriptive writing, but even that doesn't make up for its weak plot.

I have a nephew who has been diagnosed with Asperger's and a brother and sister-in-law who constantly seek balance between his way of seeing things and their own understanding. I found myself asking my sister-in-law the question, ""Do you think he needs a cure?"" Who is to say? Robinson made clear in his book that while he has learned a great deal about appropriate social responses through trial and error, he still finds them unnatural and really, more to the point, unnecessary. What is normal? How much of life's successes are social? What parts of our own personalities should be fixed? I mean, I can't imagine an enjoyable existence where we are all the same.But, if Asperger's Syndrome falls on the Autism Spectrum, and we observe those with the kinds of autism that render them completely unable to connect to the outside world, certainly we feel they miss out on opportunities for relationships and meaningful experiences. Certainly we would choose a cure, if there was one to be found. So at what point of the spectrum do we intercede?These are simply the questions that I had after reading this book.

Amy M. recommended this to me, although I don't think she described it as her favorite. Just a book she had read a long time ago that she remembered loving. Having never even heard of it before, I pulled out my super reading powers and gave it a whirl.First, this is NOT an easy read. The edition I checked out contained more than 700 thin pages of small print. Second, it's historical fiction about a time in history I had no prior knowledge of - 13th century England and Wales. Lastly, there are many, many characters to keep track of, most with unusual names and many being interrelated.All these difficulties aside, I really enjoyed this story. At its heart is the love story between Llewelyn, Prince of North Wales who later became known as Llewelyn the Great, and his bride, Joanna, the illegitimate daughter of England's King John. Its development and conflict anchors a story that is forced to span war after war after battle after skirmish after war. Really, these ancient leaders never stopped fighting.The title, Here Be Dragons, describes a map making technique used long ago. When map makers had limited or no knowledge of certain areas, they wrote, ""Here be dragons"" on the area with drawings of the mythical creatures to describe this unknown danger.Both the Welsh people and the Norman-french, who currently held the English crown (really, it's all very interesting) were suspicious of the other and held strong prejudices against any of its citizens. The marriage, which could have and should have brought about peace between the two nations, only put Joanna, who loved both her Norman-French/English father and eventually her charismatic Welsh husband, in the middle.After I finished reading, I spent a good deal of time researching the accuracy of the facts presented in the book. Many, if not most, are true. Obviously, the fiction comes from the interplay between characters and description of feelings, which can't ever be wholly known, but I think the author did a great job of infusing historical figures with life. The struggles over choosing heirs and the family feuds that any transfer of power creates, were believable and likely.Most importantly, when applying this history lesson to our current times, I realized human nature doesn't change much...even eight-hundred years later. The names of the countries may have changed but we still believe there are dragons over in the unknown. We still use power and ignorance to fuel our wars and pride and wounded egos to justify them.Will the human race ever grow up? Time with continue to tell.

Like many wonderful books, it should be included on some list called""Great Books That Are Boring"". As this was my first attempt reading Dickens's fiction ( also to be considered semi auto-biographical) and I was surprised by how much I loved it but even more surprised by how much I hated it.Charles Dickens is my kind of guy. He's funny (tons of humorous parenthetical details that add so much to the story) and he's wordy. In the earlier parts of the book, I found myself thinking, ""Finally! A truly funny author! Why have I been assuming I have to read Jennifer Weiner or Sophie Kinsella or even David Sadaris to get a laugh? Dickens is funny!"" He also really knows how to paint a scene. From the food to the positions of the characters in a room to someone's smell to how they are feeling, Dickens leaves no detail out. This worked great for me...until I got bored. Then, I felt irritated and impatient and simply wanted to know what was going to happen. Enough with the side comments! Enough.The story begins with young Pip (thus nicked-named due to his Christian name being Philip Pirrip), a young orphan of seven, being brought up by his cruel older sister and her husband, Joe Gargary. One evening, Pip finds himself in the marshes and is cornered by an escaped convict, Magwitch. With the threat of losing his life, Pip helps the convict escape by bringing him a file he found among blacksmith Joe's tools along with some food. Pip continues in his simple, lower-class lifestyle until he is asked to entertain an old,wealthy spinster, Miss Havisham, and her haughty adopted daughter, Estella. It is through this encounter that Pip learns about the finer things in life and begins to aspire to be a gentleman.His life is suddenly completely changed when he is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that he is to become a gentleman, on behalf of an anonymous benefactor. Assuming this benefactor to be Miss Havisham, and that she did this to allow for a future marriage between himself and Estella, whom he has fallen in love with, he adopts this lifestyle in both thought and deed. This transformation perversely changes many good qualities about Pip and in addition to the refinement and education gained, he also gained an attitude of pride and snobbery.In the end, when his ""great expectations"" are destroyed, Pip is left with a decision about what kind of man he is to become without the fortune he anticipated having. The themes, attitudes and moral lessons in this story are timeless and what makes Great Expectations a classic.While Dickens's wordiness gets in the way of the story at times, his gift of weaving life lessons into a narrative ultimately makes it worth the effort.

The book is divided into two parts: Franny's shorter section and a much longer section devoted to her older brother, Zooey. Franny Glass, the youngest child of the fictional upper class New York family, breaks down after spending the weekend with her pretentious boyfriend, Lane. Lane seems to be the face of everything she decides to be wrong with life. Pretense, insincerity, knowledge without wisdom, and ego, ego, ego contrast drastically with a book she stumbled upon in her brother Seymour's room about a pilgrim who discovers how to pray unceasingly.

Yes...I'm quite the sleuth.) I'm unsatisfied by the big reveal and don't believe it brings the book the resolution it needs.The Double Bind weaves the classic The Great Gatsby into the tragic story of a girl trying to recover mentally and physically after she was brutally attacked by two men while on a bicycle ride through a forest in Vermont. When a homeless man dies at the shelter she works at and leaves a box of photographs of the rich and famous from earlier decades, she becomes obsessed with figuring out the mystery of who he was, especially as some of the photographs have links to her own childhood and one mysteriously of the day of her attack. As she loses herself in this homeless man's mental illness and history, she starts to lose her own frail grasp of reality in her tightly controlled world of work, love and friendship. I wish I had the energy to go back and see if the author is really consistent with his story. My memory doubts that he could be, and I have lots of ""but what about""s rolling around in my head. But, I have to hand it to him, he got me. This reminded me of The Thirteenth Tale in its rhythmic uncovering of the past and surprise ending, but it's much more brutal and much less polished.

First, my husband brought it home from the library and told me, ""You should read this."" The author is a radiologist he works with whose name I have heard and seen on his many radiology textbooks. Unfortunately, we have rather different tastes when it comes to book choices and both of us have been burned by this seemingly harmless advice. When I read its description on the inside jacket, my inner ump cried, Strike Two! It's a non-fiction, inspirational church book.Why that's a strike, I have no idea. I only know I have a hard time getting through books like this. They invariably seem redundant and turn into a really long relief society lesson in my mind. Always a good message, but rarely anything I haven't heard before, or even thought of before. Yes, it's always good to have reminders, but when it comes to reading, I'm usually in too much of a hurry to trudge through a message book. I know. I have a serious failing here.This book was in no danger of striking out, however, after I read the first two pages of the introduction. Anne Osborn Poelman's voice is clear, intelligent, interesting, funny and honest. I was completely drawn into her story and finished this short book within a couple of hours. Very, very enjoyable. Oh...I'll just add one more very. Very!While this book was published 13 years ago, I wish it were more well known amid reading circles today. How applicable this book is to my generation! Or to any church member of any age. The thing I admired most about it was the fact that a highly intelligent professional woman didn't intellectualize her faith. In fact, she explains incredibly reasonably how she lives by an almost opposite principle, which she calls The Simeon Solution. Simeon was a High Priest briefly mentioned in the New Testament who had been promised by the Holy Ghost that he would meet the Messiah. Much later in life, he is prompted to go to the temple and sees Joseph and Mary there with the Christ child, knows that the promise was fulfilled. (Luke 2:29-32) By this time, he was very old, and must have lived an entire lifetime on that brief bit of knowledge or inspiration he had earlier in life. How easy it would have been to doubt his faith after years and years of waiting. Most of his peers did. Many ridiculed anyone who believed in something that they certainly did not know ""for sure"" would ever happen - the coming of a Messiah. But Simeon remembered the promise he had from the Lord, and recognized its fulfillment. Similarly, Anne Osborn Poelman realized her faith was much like Simeon's. During a lively discussion of faith during a dinner party, questions were directed to her curiously wondering how she can justified being a member of a sexist faith that ""withholds"" the priesthood from women. Her answer, with some support from another guest at the party who helped put how she felt into a concrete idea, is the basis of the book. It's called the Simeon Solution. So simple, yet so easy to dismiss. It's about having a testimony that the Lord fulfills his promises.

Hinckley. Her book, No Doubt About It, is truly one of my favorites. I love her strength. I love her leadership. I love her honesty. However, I did not love this book. It seems beyond sacrilege to not love a church book, especially one with such a message, although I do admit to loving many parts of it. Her masterful references to scriptures, appropriate analogies to really drive a point home and self-deprication are spot on, as usual.But, there is a judgmental tone throughout the book that left a slight unpleasant feeling afterwards. For instance, there is a part of the book where she is talking about our power and being powerful (I know...shocker) and mentions a young adult (or young woman. I can't quite remember) coming up to her after her talk to thank her for her message and how touched and motivated she was. All Sheri Dew seemed to notice was how the girl was dressed. Apparently, her dress standards weren't as stringent as a 50 year old woman and I felt sad that she pointed it out in her book. It made her story...less. Yes, bring up modesty and all of its power, but don't do it that way. Judging someone without their knowledge is never fair. I just didn't like it. There are a few more instances, one involving overhearing other women at her workplace (which, I assume, is Deseret Book) discussing an Oprah show and her interrupting by quizzing them on how it compared to a certain General Authority's talk on the subject matter. Of course, they didn't know, or couldn't remember and she and felt disgusted by these women for not knowing. Maybe it's my shameful knowledge that I wouldn't meet her standards that has me feeling judged and combative, but there is a slight tinge of rancor throughout the entire book. It isn't solely uplifting, or encouraging. At least, not without pulling some others down along the way.Lastly, she refers many times to some extremely difficult circumstances in her personal life. It's always vague and always...unhelpful. I feel like, if you're going to use something as an example, explain it. Don't dance around it. And if you don't want to share, don't. Only sort of, kind of, hinting of your problems isn't really sharing them. Obviously, there is much good stuff.

Beth is struggling through Thanksgiving with her family after just leaving her husband who suffers from Bipolar disorder and quit taking his medication. By its middle, I had changed my mind. Tina seemed to be every character in a Jack Weyland novel. She does bad things and bad things happen to her. As I turned the last page, I loved it again. Wait a minute. This is it. These are the stories of families trying. Some of their tales are quite extraordinary.I don't generally read much LDS fiction. I find the stories usually a bit too tidy and my most important qualifier for really good literature is that it be honest. A lot of time, LDS fiction can be fluffy. Yes, there is usually some necessary conflict that involves the bad character doing bad things. By its end, however, the punishment usually fits the crime and when a miracle is in order, it rarely fails to show up.I saw a recommendation for this book on Blog Segullah and it got such rave s from some seemingly picky readers that I requested it from my library. It's brand new and I was the very first person to check it out. If you consider where I live and what kind of book it is, you'll agree that it was a special moment.At just under 200 pages, this is the kind of book you can easily read in a day or two. I started it last night and have had a hard time putting it down. Bound on Earth follows the Palmer family through many generations, though not chronologically. The chapters bounce around in time and between family members, a writing technique I'm not always super fond of. Part of me thinks it's a shortcut, to eliminate the tricky transitions that progress a plot. But I also admit that as a reader, it can work well to experience multiple first hand narratives; it makes it much easier to get the ""BIG"" picture. And this is a book that is all about the big picture.What is marriage? What is family? How do they survive? Do our trials break us apart or bind us together? Hallstrom doesn't cut corners with heartache. The situations she puts her characters in are vividly real, so real that I felt like I knew these people. I do know them. They just have different names.If you're wary of LDS literature, give this a try. If you are looking for a great book to read with your ward bookgroup, this is your book.

I only like the BBC version, with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennett. While there are parts of the newer, shorter, harried, and nuance free Hollywood version I enjoy, like the supposed-to-be-prettiest-sister Jane, who is actually much prettier than the actress in the BBC version, every time I've watched it (which, I grant, is only twice), I feel angry afterwards. First, Kiera Knightly is NOT Elizabeth Bennett. Elizabeth Bennett does not smile a ridiculous smile showing her bottom teeth all the time. And she is not flat chested. I mean, come on....we're talking about the girl who woos Mr. Darcy. With those low-cut gowns in style, I'm guessing there was a little bit of oomph necessary to catch his eye. That and a pair of ""fine eyes"". Mostly, though, the entire movie is rushed. The actors spit out their lines in Gilmore Girls fashion, important scenes are entirely cut out, and then two minutes are devoted to watching Kiera Knightly spin on a swing. Frustrating.Anyways, my point is (and I do have one), that there is only one good movie adaptation...and it's six hours long and only strays (and not really even strays, just leaves out a few minor details) slightly from the book. So, when the main character in Austenland, Jane, loved this movie as much as me, I knew I could appreciate her.32 year-old Jane, single and relationship challenged, is obsessed with Mr. Darcy...the dreamy Colin Firth who walks across his magnificent grounds in a wet shirt after diving into a pond (you know the scene). The Colin Firth...I mean Mr. Darcy, who beams at Elizabeth while she's turning pages for his sister, Georgiana, at the piano (you know this scene too). After her rich great aunt comes to visit her, and subsequently finds her two-disc DVDs hidden behind a houseplant, Jane is surprised when she receives a call following her aunt's death from the probate attorney. Instead of money, her aunt leaves her an all expense paid for trip to an exclusive British resort, where Jane will spend three weeks living the Regency period lifestyle in an attempt to fulfill, and also hopefully expunge, her Darcy obsession.I found the beginning of this book to be annoying. Jane is too nervous and melodramatic and not all that likable. For starters, I have no idea why anyone would be ashamed of owning Pride and Prejudice. Houseplants? Please. I'm thinking of fashioning my set up with a chain and wearing it around my neck. See? I'm a true fan.However, the three weeks she spends at Pembrook Park, a Netherfield/Pemberly-esque manor with servants who can't speak to her, empire wasted gowns, gentleman that are actors (or are they?), turns about the room, walks on the grounds and a ball are simply fantastic. The situations are entertaining, the plot pleasantly twisty and the ending satisfying.Shannon Hale writes a light-hearted fantasy romance that is sure to please even the snobbiest Jane Austen fans. As a warning, do not expect a Jane Austen book. While Hale does a fair job mimicking some of the dialogue, the novel is thoroughly modern and much less subtle. It is a romance...therefore extremely unlikely to be true. Regardless, when I turned the last page, I had a smile on my face and said, out loud, ""That was fun!""...more",Notes are private!,0,335,1,not set,"Feb 18, 2008","Feb 27, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/248483.Austenland

I thought it was about a girl soldier that was burned at the stake because she dressed up like a man.This story is so much more complicated than that. This is a story about faith, courage, revelation, miracles, pride, power, corruption, martyrdom and enduring to the end. This is a story that is so astonishing that most should be thoroughly schooled in its details. It is very inspiring. In short, Joan of Arc's story could easily be found in any set of scriptures.I find it interesting that Mark Twain wrote this book. He, a man of little to no faith and disdain for those who practiced it, clearly loved and admired Joan. Twain's familiar wit and satirical prose are all but absent within these pages. Instead, he writes as a man named de Conte, the fictional page and scribe of Joan, thus allowing himself to write with his own adoring perspective, without having to actually be Mark Twain. He called this the ""best of all his books"" and no doubt felt that way after a result of twelve years of research. As there is plenty of historical data available about Joan's life, including the full transcript of her trial, I have little doubt that this is a very accurate representation of her life.On one hand, I like his choice in narration. As Joan's friend and scribe, Twain's de Conte manages to allow the reader to witness Joan's life from his own memory, a memory that included first hand accounts of most of Joan's life. And although his biting wit is extremely toned down, little glimpses are seen here and there through the telling of personal side notes.On the other hand, the narration allowed the book to frequently become overly sentimental. Louis de Conte oft wandered away from the main story line to regale a story of the Paladin, or La Hire or his attraction towards Catherine de Boucher. In addition, I lost track of how many paragraphs were lent to remind the reader, once again, about Joan's saintliness. I feel it was unnecessary and writing it, over and over again, gave the book a ""dumbed down"" feel (which really is quite silly because this is NOT an easy read - I should have been grateful for any dumbing down). I think the caliber of her person, as well as her righteousness, were made obvious by her very actions, by her charity and by her speech. To point it out so often was overdoing it and eventually wore down my good opinion. I have a hard time loving a book that bored me at times.That being said, this is an incredible book about an even more incredible historical figure. I could write and write about how much I loved Joan and her goodness, about her persecution and how much her story reminded me of Joseph Smith's. There are striking similarities, down to the resigned knowledge of their own endings. But they knew what they knew, they knew God knew what they knew, and they could not deny it. With their knowledge, they accomplished great works and forever changed the course of history. Read for yourself and become smitten with the power of a seventeen year old girl who became commander in chief of all the armies in France...because God told her to do it.Thank you, Amy. I am so much more enlightened because you sent this to me.

I can't believe people have life experiences like Ishmael Beah. Ishmael, a 27 year-old refugee from Sierra Leone now living in New York City, left his home with his brother and some friends to practice a new rap routine in a neighboring village. He was twelve years old. He never saw his home or his parents again. Rebel forces attacked his village, killing most, and causing the rest to flee.Without a home to return to, he and his peers managed to spend several months wandering from village to village but eventually, as they were old enough to be mistaken as soldiers themselves, they became objects of fear. Left starving and hiding in the forests, Ishmael and his group were eventually captured and forced to become soldiers.A boy whose favorite thing was to perform rap songs for people was suddenly cutting throats and shooting anyone that moved. He became a drug addict, as higher ups encouraged the boys to swallow white capsules and sniff cocaine to ""give them more energy"".Years later, he was fortunate to be chosen by his lieutenant and UNICEF workers and was enrolled in a rehabilitation unit. It took him eight months to fight the drugs out of his system and to turn into a child again. His agony and nightmares about what he had done are intense. He was only fifteen years old.When the fighting moved from the villages into the city, Ishamel knew that he could not become a soldier again. Earlier in the year, after he had completed his rehabilitation, he traveled to New York to represent UNICEF and the youth in Sierre Leone at the UN. From this experience, he contacted one of the women he had met in New York to ask if she would be willing to allow him to stay with her if he could get out of his country. Amazingly, he managed, got to New York and has since graduated from the UN's International School and graduated from a university.What amazes me when I read books like this, because I don't really enjoy them, is how deplorable certain areas of our world really are.

We worry about losing zero percent interest for credit cards and avoiding trans fat, while other people in the world literally watch their best friends get blown up.

Abbie's story begins in 1854, Originally published in 1928, Beth Streeter Aldrich uses this novel to create a fantastic female character, Abbie Deal. Abbie's story begins in 1854, when she is eight years old and at the start of a three week journey, traveling with her family by wagon from Illinois to Iowa. The fact that I grew up listening to pioneer stories from this era made her voyage very vivid in my mind. I could see the sacks of flour falling out of the wagon and floating in the river and the oxen slowly pulling all the families' possessions along a bumpy buffalo trail. The story ends in 1926 with Abbie's death at the age of 80. The face of America changed dramatically between those years, and Abbie's life changed alongside it.Part pioneer story, part pride of Nebraska lesson, part farming tutorial, part commentary about marriage - Aldrich ultimately uses Abbie Deal to explain the choices and sacrifices that faced a 19th century woman, or more specifically, a mother.Perhaps Abbie Deal's selfless mothering is the source of my distress. I've always felt I've lacked in this arena and while I've tried really hard not to compare myself to my friends' and siblings' styles of mothering, I found myself forlorn with the realization that I was no Abbie Deal. Abbie was a natural mother. She postponed her dreams of becoming a singer and learning how to paint the prairie's sunset to follow her husband, Will, to Nebraska at the end of the Civil War.Originally, she postponed these dreams for the sake of her husband, who needed to carve his own way in life away from his father. Later she postponed them because there was no money or opportunity and every ounce of her energy went into building their home and farm and caring for her young children. Later yet, she postponed them because her children grew and had dreams of their own that required any extra time or money she had saved. Finally, she abandoned them altogether because her talents had left her. Her voice had faded from non-use and her fingers were gnarled and knobby from years of work. In the end, all she was left with was her good name and the pride she had in her children's accomplishments.Thus started the deep, stabbing pain in my chest. This kind of story, really...the universal story of motherhood, always leaves me feeling a little ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"". Abbie gave up everything of her own...her talents, her time, her figure (I can really relate to this), her life...for her children. The feminist in me resists....even feels slightly miserable that we women are expected and praised for being noble and altruistic, but void of personal achievement. The mother in me, however, wipes away a tear as I watch life from back stage instead of front and center, but wholly gets that my family is THE point. I get to clap and cheer and know that my efforts made this grand production possible.Throughout the book, Abbie does women a great service by allowing herself to wonder ""what if"". What if she had married that other boy who wanted her but who she didn't quite love, the one whose wife now wears all those fine clothes? What if she and Will hadn't moved to Nebraska and avoided suffering through drought and grasshoppers and blizzards? What if she had kept at her singing...developed the talent that everyone acknowledged she had? What if, what if, what if? What if I had? What then? Is the prize for the correct choice happiness?The fun in discussing this book would be hearing the strong arguments that defend both ends of the spectrum, and all the shades in between. Today, we lucky women choose the shade that fits us best. Do we like how we look?Abbie Deal chose motherhood but the story did not romanticize her choice. Abbie's story included every distracted husband, every sick child, every annoying friend and every moody child.

A Newberry award winner for juvenile fiction, I can hardly criticize such a loved book. Sadly, I did not read this when it was meant to be read, as a youth struggling to know it's more important to do the right thing than to fit in with what everybody else is doing.Important, worthy lesson, but after reading two young adult novels this week with very similar themes (does this happen to anyone else? I always seem to inadvertently read books in ""themes""), I feel there is something lacking when an adult reads young adult literature. Innocence, perhaps. It's too simple. The protagonists don't fit inside the story. They are almost always ahead of their times and privy to understanding that their peers don't seem to have access to. Where did Kit come from? Barbados, yes...but possibly from the 20th century as well? As modern readers, we have the hindsight to see and learn from the foibles of our ancestors and their limited understanding, but the author gave this sort of vision to Kit immediately.I don't know if this is ever argued (and why am I arguing, didn't I promise not to?) but part of me feels like there is an anti-obedience theme in this book. Kit is almost always disobedient, and her disobedience always turned out to be the right thing to do. Because it's young adult literature, everything turns out fine in the end, but there is a difference in doing the right thing and doing what you want to. This is a much deeper discussion to be typed out here, and I won't blaspheme this good book any more.

She notices Raven being beaten by townspeople as she and her husband ride into town on their wagon. While waiting for her new husband to finish getting drunk in a tavern outside in the rain, Raven approaches her bleeding, hungry and scared. Not at all intimidated, she offers him food and their unusual friendship begins.Fortunately for her, after two days of not quite so wedded bliss, her husband falls from the thatched roof he is repairing and is killed. This leaves her free to develop her friendship with Raven, discover that he cannot hear, and begins her quest to teach him how to communicate by using signs. I found this troubling. Surely he was not the first deaf person in all of Europe. I didn't know why they found him so scary.Set in medieval Europe, when witchcraft was feared and those with birth defects were considered evil, Marnie saintly and stubbornly teaches the young man ""hand talk"". When the townspeople (apparently all uncharitable and bad) see her using hand signals to him, they are convinced she is a witch and has put him under her spell.I understand why these books are written. Yes, I suppose I can apply the moral of the story to our own day and recognize the universal lesson that just because people are different doesn't mean they are bad. Unfortunately, I think I'm too cynical for some young adult fiction.This book was too simple and the characters entirely too boxed in. Marmie, is always selfless, always determined, always fearless and always right. The other characters were ignorant, mean and sneaky. I just don't enjoy the lack of subtlety. Few characters should so easily fall into a good or bad category as every single one is (or should be) flawed.I think there are better books out there that tell this story better.

A few weeks ago, my mother sent me an email which included a beautiful quote from this book. It was about being a writer, and my mother was paying a compliment to me in regards to my dedication to blogging. Interested in reading the book where the quote came from, I found myself reading about a very bright girl whose world collapsed around her as she struggled through her elementary school years with an undiagnosed learning disability.Samantha Abeel was a bright, precocious and highly confident young child. Her memories of Kindergarten and first grade are of being in the top of her class and proudly so. She knew she was known as one of the smart kids and did her best to live up to her reputation, even as she inwardly began to realize that sometimes, particularly during math time, she had to fake it.As her school years progressed, and she couldn't keep up with her peers in math, and she couldn't admit that she had no idea how to tell time, she turned inward in humiliation and depression, while secretly praying that the difference was merely because she was special and wise, and not at all slow.After many unfortunate delays and misdiagnoses, Abeel was finally diagnosed with a math and sequencing learning disability known as dyscalculia. Throughout her schooling, Abeel realized that although she couldn't understand the rules of grammar and had a hard time spelling, she had a gift for words and poetry and channeled her gift into a skill of writing. As a ninth grader, she, with help from several teachers and artists, published a book whose name was later changed to Reach For the Moon. While it gave her confidence and success, she still drifted into social isolation and depression throughout high school and later, college.Reading about her change, her isolation and fear, made my heart pound as I thought about the possibility of any of my own children suffering in this way. Particularly Henry, as we continue to worry about whether or not his speech will come or if it will be a continual battle for him throughout his life.The faults I have with this book lies in its slow, repetitive pace. As the story begins with her memories as a kindergartener and ends with her graduating from college, it's got more than enough ""space"" for her memoir, the sort of book usually reserved for a later time in life. Additionally, Abeel frequently transitions the style of writing from autobiography to memoir, which sometimes works but often times feels incredibly jarring. It's like she's a narrator to her own memories, but without first giving a warning to the reader to ""fade to screen"".Aside from that, I think this would be a valuable and worthwhile book to discuss. From our current education model to the causes of depression and its treatment, I think many women, mothers and friends could relate to its material. I also think it would be a good book to recommend for older children with learning disabilities or their peers.And, now, for the quote that started it all, which is actually quite relevant to her own story, but also a beautiful passage for anyone who enjoys writing.For an admissions essay to Mount Holyoke College, she writes:Sometimes on winter mornings, I try to see myself in gathered wrinkles, my dark hair forsaking me to silver. I try to see my hands traced by blue veins and my eyes in vintage brown. I try to see myself a little bent, a little withered. I close my eyes and see me all in white, all in gray, draped in the webs of age.Oh, I will ache a little and have one of those chronic coughs. I will sit in my chair and pull at curtains that reveal a window etched with white doves of frost. Then, maybe just then, I will know what I was and who I am. I will know all that I took and all that I gave.It is here that I want to be a messenger, a courier of everything I've gathered. I want to tell my grandchildren of the games my friends and I would play. I want to pass on the legends that creep around us. I want to tell them of the sand dunes and of the lakes. I want to tell them of the many ghosts that look fondly upon them. I want to say that I have made a difference. I want to give them the world through my eyes.However, for now, my center, my sense of self, my purpose is yet unclear to me. I see it like one sees a fish in a river, only silvery flashes of fin and tail. Never seeing all of it at once. The journey to discover these things lies ahead. When I am in the November of my life maybe then I will understand my June. I do know that I want desperately to understand what I don't, and give the understanding of what I do to others.Perhaps one day, after I have sunken into the shadows, my granddaughter will read one of my poems to her daughter, or show her a book that I collected, maybe even pass on one of the stories that I told. Then, there in that moment, is all that we can ever hope to be. That one little niche in time, when what we gave, or passed on, is given again.I could never say it quite so well, but this is what I hope too....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Jan 20, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/284495.My_Thirteenth_Winter

The first half isn't quite as good as the second half but definitely still a five star book, in my opinion. Here it is, only February, and I don't know if I'll be lucky enough to read a better book this year.I only recently heard about The Book Thief when a friend mentioned it on her blog. She and several others gave it such a strong  that I looked it up here on Goodreads. I was a little dismayed when I learned it was set in Nazi Germany, because, well...I wasn't sure what else could be written about that time that hadn't already been said, and said well by many different authors.I'm so glad I didn't let that thought stop me. This is a quirky book. The narrator is Death, and death isn't a very typical story teller. There are these abrupt bold statements centered throughout the pages when Death feels further information is necessary. They bothered me at first because I couldn't get into my normal rhythm. And, sometimes, his little side comments seemed slightly irreverent. Wait, books don't do this. Not books about the holocaust and Nazi Germany. But this book did, and once I got used to it, I loved Death's little insights.My favorite thing about this book is it's fairness about one of the most unfair times in human history. The unbelievably complicated situation that the German people were in, their motives, their fear, even their ignorance is not necessarily defended, but explained. Their story is told through Liesel, a young girl who watches her brother die on a train as she is being taken to live with foster parents. After her brother is buried, she snatches a book left in the snow called, The Gravediggers Handbook. Unable to read, she hides the book in her bed until her gentle and loving foster father finds it and uses it to teach her how.It isn't really about the Germans and the Jews....it's about our human instincts to survive and our race towards death. Death has a really interesting perspective, which lends itself to many quote worthy statements.. His viewpoint (and I'm just assigning gender to him, I'm not sure he actually does) is a troubling one, a compassionate one, an irreverent one and one that left me sobbing tears onto the pages at its end.While I think this book is suitable for every reader, those easily offended might be troubled by some German profanity. However, in my opinion, not only is it necessary and relevant to the character's communication, it's in a foreign language...which doesn't really count.I'm grateful this book crossed my path.

Clever, poignant, informative, inspiring, heartbreaking, interesting and historical, Brooks takes Louisa May Alcott's famous Little Women, and writes a parallel story about their father's experience during the same year. Little snippets are taken from Little Women, and it's as though you can see that famous play happening in the background in each scene. Sort of like Wicked and The Wizard of Oz, only more serious and important. After all, Peter March wasn't out flying on a broom, he was trying to serve the Union troops in the United States own Civil War.Brooks bases Peter on Alcott's own father's journals, just as Alcott based her Little Women on herself and her sisters. Bronson Alcott, and his fictional representative, Peter March, are part of the intellectual elite who reside in Concord Massachusetts alongside their contemporaries, Walden, Thoreau, Hawthorn and Brown, who each make an appearance in the story. Idealistic abolitionists with Quaker leanings, March leaves his family to support the union's cause to end slavery and finds great conflict between his inner values and his outward actions.Brooks writes exclusively in the first person and as a result, I, the reader, was able to understand Peter March as he was, as he wanted to be and as he failed to be. He is a fantastic character. My only complaint with the book is that she abandoned Peter for a few chapters and wrote as Marmee, his wife, when he lay sick with fever. She eventually returns to Peter's voice, which gives the story the resolution it needs, and while Marmees' thoughts are equally moving and necessary, it made the ending a little choppy.Despite that lack of continuity, I enthusiastically recommend March.

It is:""any simple and unadorned melody or air.""I appreciated this book more than I liked it. The author, Kent Haruf, writes with a vividly clear but simple prose about a small town in northeastern Colorado, a couple of hours from Denver, whose occupants struggle with their choices, their relationships and their opportunities.Kind of a universal story, honestly, but in this setting - so sparse and empty - Haruf managed to develop characters that I felt like I knew. Perhaps it's growing up in Montana, where there are small towns to spare, but his book had a realness to it that felt uncomfortable to me. I had teachers like Tom Guthrie. Men who taught because it was a job, not because they were particularly suited for the profession. I was aware of girls like Victoria Roubideaux, young and troubled (in this case pregnant), misfits from the small town core.There are many characters throughout the book, some better developed than others. Tom Guthries' sons, Bobby and Ike, who want more than either of their parents are able to give them. The McPherson brothers, old bachelors who live alone on a farm. The teenage redhead, who frightens me and makes me angry until I realize he mirrors the attitudes and behaviors of his own parents. Maggie Jones, who is the poorest developed and thus the most likable. As the book approaches its halfway point, their lives start to intersect rather than orbit. Even as the intersections begin, lives aren't drastically changed or made better. There is some growth and a hint at tenderness, particularly when the old McPherson brothers take in Victoria, who is alone and pregnant at 17.When I finished the book, I snapped it shut and shouted, ""Why do I read stuff like this?!"" Days later, I still feel melancholy about Holt, Colorado and its inhabitants who seem to have so little going for them.As frustrated as I was by the end, because there was no resolution of conflict, no great triumph or lesson learned or bridges crossed, I can quietly nod ""well done"" to the author for staying true to the apparent purpose of his book.

This truth is applauded, awarded and revered by most, as he a champion to the poor, the honest and the brave. It isn't until two men come to town, his own nephew, Fred ""Bootie"" Tubbs, and Ludovic Seely, an ambitious Australian aiming to launch a new magazine, that his title of truth-teller is challenged.I didn't think the book jacket's description adequately described the book. The story is complicated and at times, parts of it seem irrelevant to the whole - particularly Julius's part. In fact, as I read this immediately after Plainsong, I couldn't help but think it was the same story only in a much glitzier city with much glitzier characters. The book matters only so far as the characters matter.At its end is New York's and America's tragic 9/11. Most of the character's trajectories are altered by this event. Except, perhaps, Murray Thwaite - the actual emperor - whose existence remains mostly unchanged.The subject matter can be ugly, the characters pompous and infuriating, but the book still sparkles because Clare Messud writes the satire so convincingly. Claire Messud is the person in the crowd (although you have to assume this is her own crowd she's shouting at) watching the parade declaring, ""But he's not wearing any clothes!""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Dec 24, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3648.The_Emperor_s_Children

The first tragic flaw of this book is that neither characters are in the book.In a nutshell, George takes her last book, With No One As A Witness, and writes a very, very long book with all the background for the criminal in that book. Yes, it humanizes the criminal. Yes, it paints a stark and awful background to the horrors of poverty and neighborhoods that breed crime. But the book becomes part of the horror as it goes on and on in its detail about the ugly.In the end, there is no beauty to save it. I was just glad to be done with it.

I read this at a friend's suggestion and I'm glad I did. It's true that history changes depending on who wrote it because this book has a very different feel than the Bushman book on Joseph Smith I read a couple of months ago. I think Emma Smith must have been a force to be reckoned with. She was a strong, opinionated, independent woman at a time when those characteristics in a female were much more rare. I would truly love to have a chance to talk with her. From accounts given in this biography, she was a very charitable being, a doting mother and well educated. Someone the prophet loved and a person whose good opinion he strived for. What frustrated me when reading this, however, were all of the second hand accounts of her life. She didn't keep a history or a journal and the only time her voice is heard is in her letters. Her later years, when she fell out of favor with the Utah saints, were tainted by reports of missionaries traveling through Nauvoo with an interest in checking up on her. She had no desire to be checked up on and seemed to make an effort to appear unfriendly and changed from the woman many of them knew and loved.So much of this book deals with polygamy. I honestly don't know if I would have reacted any differently than Emma if put in her situation. I guess I'm glad I don't have to find out. It's interesting to me to see polygamy come up in the news and entertainment. As church members, we find the practice appalling because it is against the commandments....now. We distance ourselves from the fundamentalists who show up in the news and make comments about how they are NOT mormon. But it was a commandment at one time. Emma couldn't get her heart or brain around it and upon the death of her husband, felt she needed to distance herself from the leadership she knew would continue the practice she found so abhorrent. Others, like her, fell away from the church or were ex-communicated due to misunderstanding or unlawful engagement of the practice. Today, the opposite is true. And it boils down to faith in a prophet. Did Joseph Smith receive a revelation about polygamy? I believe he did, although I'm not convinced the early church practiced it perfectly or understood it. Did Wilford Woodruff receive a revelation to stop its practice? Again, I believe he did. Emma was so close to Joseph that she must have witnessed so much of the man as well as the prophet in him. She was convinced that he was deceived regarding the revelation of polygamy...that it was not from Heavenly Father. But the twelve, most importantly Brigham Young, saw otherwise....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Nov 2006,"Dec 17, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/596364.Mormon_Enigma

Now that I'm actually finished reading it,While reading this book, I think I recommended it to about every person I had a conversation with about it. Now that I'm actually finished reading it, I have mixed emotions. I'm not left with the feeling I wanted to have -- the triumphant ""Praise To The Man"" feeling. But I do feel grateful. Grateful for Joseph for the questions he asked, for the organization he established and for those early saints and their willingness to believe in what had to be SO hard to believe. Grateful for its continuation and the clear heads of the 12 apostles who didn't let the chaotic end of Joseph Smith's life translate into a chaotic religion.The book serves its purpose - narrating the history of Joseph Smith's life. The author, Bushman, seems neutral throughout most of the book. He acknowledges early on that writing a true history about Joseph Smith is an almost impossible task. Defenders of his reputation write from the perspective of believers and disregard any story that finds fault with him. Other biographies are written by non-believers or former believers who have to discount any inspiration he claimed to have. Bushman, a believer but historian, writes Joseph as a prophet who made mistakes. I think that it is a fair assessment.I started this book a bit nervous about what I would discover. I have never read much about him other than what the church publishes. The only bad stuff I had ever read was on the internet when I'd be searching for a primary sharing time idea. Googling can be dangerous. As I'd start to read, a sick feeling would start in my stomach and I would immediately stop. That was a road I didn't want to go down. I already knew most of the rumors but there aren't many ""safe"" answers to those questions in church literature. If you are not a church history scholar, chances are you don't know the real history of Joseph Smith. From primary on, we are taught his teachings, his testimonies and recalled versions of his early history. We are given a man who was a charismatic, beloved leader. A man who loved children, had a playful side and willing to suffer any amount of persecution to bring about the full restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. After reading this book, I think all of the above descriptions are true. That doesn't seem to be a rosy, post-mortem memory of a man. But he was not perfect and he didn't always do things perfectly. There seems to be two ways of interpreting his mistakes. Either he wasn't a prophet and and the mistakes were a result of a fanatic with the idea of creating an empire and failed due to lack of experience and implementation skill or he was a prophet and tried to carry out the will of God without a full understanding of the revelations at that time. At least that's my interpretation. The revelations he received were not all neatly understood and laid out to him like they are to us in the Doctrine and Covenants. They came and he wouldn't always recognize immediately its meaning or purpose. That's what was the most enlightening to me -- the setting that the prophet was in. What was the feeling and atmosphere during that time? The mood of the people, the religious frenzy, the political climate? Reading this book really helps a person understand the mentality of all involved from the early followers of Mormonism to his persecutors. I'm relieved that after reading this book, my testimony of the prophet is not shaken. The stories of the ""bad stuff"" did not shake me. In fact, it helped me to understand the prophet even more. I finished this book tonight and I feel melancholy. I hated the frenzy at the end. There was such intense hatred in such normal people. I ache for Emma and her suffering, isolation and loss. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious about Joseph Smith and when and why he did the things he did....more",Notes are private!,0,115,1,not set,Jul 2006,"Dec 17, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/236609.Joseph_Smith

I really enjoy McEwen's writing style and 90% of this book had me reeled in. But the climax of this book is so mind-blowing retarded that it loses any recommendation points from me.On Chesil Beach is a story about Edward and Florence. Two educated and good people, they marry as virgins due to their own personalities and also the expectations of the current times (the story takes place in 1962.) , McEwen effortlessly drifts between the thoughts and backgrounds of his two major characters. It's as if you get to be both characters for a moment.This dance of thoughts between characters weaves between about a two-hour stretch of real time on their wedding night. All building up for The Marriage Act.When it goes horribly wrong, the book falls apart. The book jacket exclaims, ""A story of lives transformed by a gesture not made or a word not spoken.""Puh-leeze!O.K...here's a spoiler alert. Do not read this if you are going to read the book and hate all pre-knowledge about a book.I'll try to be tactful, but remember...they are married and they were both virgins. So, this isn't really a ""naughty"" book, only an attempt at describing an awkward situation between two people who love each other but lack the depth of communication expected and needed between most people at that level in a relationship.Basically, right before the moment of consummation, he is so excited by her touch that he unwillingly finishes too early. Way too early. It disgusts her and she runs out of their room and onto the beach.He is angry and heartbroken and disappointed as is she.They finally confront each other with their own feelings and have a fight. Not an extraordinary fight. Not even an extraordinarily cruel one. But things were said in frustration and embarrassment.And then she leaves. He goes back to their room after her and she is gone. Their marriage gets annulled and the story fast forwards about 40 years (but only for Edward. The reader gets no future knowledge of Florence except from a newspaper  that Edward reads.)I suppose it could happen. But McEwen attempts to dramatize communication, and how what is said or unsaid can alter events (pretty much a universal rule, I think) and he ruins a perfectly good story with a highly unlikely and disappointing ending. I didn't believe it. Or, if it did happen, then it was unnecessary and ridiculous.Sorry if I ruined it for you, but I so enjoyed Atonement and the appropriate consequences of THAT ""what if"", that this story, in subject matter and result, gets a big thumbs down from me....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Dec 12, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/815309.On_Chesil_Beach

For starters, I bought the book at an airport in Taiwan, which meant it didn't have a due date which meant it took a backseat to many books that I didn't have the luxury of reading whenever.Additionally, because I've heard so much about this book already, I almost didn't want to read it at all. I've heard that it's depressing, that it's not as good as The Kite Runner, and that it's basically a novel about the brutal treatment of women in Afghanistan.You know when you read a book or see a film that has had great s and you finish feeling disappointed because it didn't live up to the hype? My experience reading this book was the complete opposite. I loved it. I didn't feel the message of the book was one of brutality or depression, but of hope and the toughness of the human spirit.There are plenty of awful scenes to lend credence to its reputation. While the story's time frame spans thirty years, the main focus of the novel are two woman, a generation apart, whose lives cross as they become the wives of the same man, Rasheed. The elder, Mariam, was born to a servant woman out of wedlock and is raised in banishment, ignorance and eventual rejection during the years the Afghani government was controlled by the communists. She finds herself forced to marry a much older man after her mother commits suicide. Laila, fifteen years younger and raised by intellectual parents, enters the marriage under much different circumstances. Alone after a bomb destroys her home and kills her parents, and pregnant by her childhood love who has fled the country, she marries Rasheed in a desperate attempt to save her unborn child.The writing engrossed me. Much like the Kite Runner, Hosseini magically puts the reader in the city, neighborhood and house of his characters. Much to his credit, I found myself torn between wanting to yell at Laila to hush up, so that she'd avoid another beating, and kicking Rasheed myself, because he is a despicable brute.Mariam, one of the most tragic characters in literature, makes this book what it is; a story of love and strenghth. She, who didn't have an easy day in her life, allows herself to be touched by the love of Laila and her children. In return, she performs the ultimate act of love and saves a family.I appreciate Hosseini's portrayal of a part of the world that is under so much scrutiny lately. Afghanistan, and the city of Kabul where the story takes place, have a long history of wars and occupations which result in a great chasm between different ethnic tribes, Islam, economic classes and gender. Hosseini uses this novel to tell the story of Afghani women and the hardships that face them with each regime change.As a woman, I feel blessed to have been given confidence and opportunities. I truly cannot imagine what it would be like to live under the conditions the women in this book live under. I am grateful to be born to the family I was born to and in a country which allows me to live the kind of life I choose.Miram and Laila didn't have the opportunities or support that I have. And yet they survived. They endured and they reached out to others, despite their circumstances. In this, Hosseini redeems all of Afghanistan by showing these two women's humanity. He shows that in a place whose beauty was written about in a 17th century poem, where ""One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs and the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls"" is a city that can become illuminated once again....more",Notes are private!,1,1452,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Dec 04, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns

She still plays a part, but now as the sidekick to Will, a new character who is a giant ""young adult fiction"" stereotype (in search of the father he never knew while protecting his mother from bad guys and seems to be gifted in the combat department). I don't remember the writing being bad in the first book. I thought it descriptive and unique and thoughtful. Not so, in The Subtle Knife. Pullman changes gears and loses focus. There is a lot more going on and none of it is developed well. I stopped caring about the characters and their goals.I think these books had great potential. There could be a lot to discuss with adolescents (not young children...at all). The nature of the soul, the natural man, the costs and benefits of religions. All appropriate things to discuss with youth ready to question and discover on their own.Pullman takes that conversation away with his lack of metaphor. It becomes impossible to argue, ""I think the dust means this."" or ""what do you think The Authority is for Pullman?"" when he throws his opinion at you with real life Christian beliefs. It's inappropriate and unfair. Write a fantasy or a satire or a parable if you want to. Other authors have done it...and done it well.Pullman didn't.I won't be reading the third book....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Dec 04, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/119324.The_Subtle_Knife

Polygamy. Holy Wars. Visions. Revelation. Line of succession. All legitimate things to think and worry about, but they seem to completely ignore the important things that Christ taught while on earth. Say...something like....blessed are the peacemakers. And loving our neighbors. And repentance, hope, forgiveness, charity and love. I think until we master these, the mysteries and promise of further knowledge is a long ways away.Kraukauer argues that religion, particularly the history of the LDS religion is prone to produce extremists who do more harm than good. Much like that of Islamic fundamentalists, the religion's history is one of violence and secrecy.I can't say he is entirely wrong. I do think there is a propensity for believers to fall into extreme behavior. However, while Krakauer believes it has something to do with the doctrine or leaders, I believe it is entirely due to opposition.Good things - the best things - are perverted the most.Religion, a means to learn about and worship God. And yet, so much evil, so much harm throughout history to His children has been brought about by its name. I don't believe any evil has been done by those truly devoted to God. I really don't. It has all been done by those influenced, knowingly or not, by the great deceiver, Satan. I think those who don't believe, like Krakauer himself, find it awfully easy to find fault with faith, with religion, because they focus and magnify the imperfections of man. He translates it into an imperfect or non-existent God, which is easy for him to do. He has the proof. Look! This man murdered his sister-in-law! That is no God I believe in. Well, Jon, neither do I.In fact, every single one of his sources was a dissenter or apostate...as if they had the inside track to truth. Shading, innuendo, rumors and hearsay are all given as proof and fact of corruption and deception.While I'm not naive enough to think that the LDS church has no black eyes in its history, I can't admire a critic who presents only one side of a story. Krakauer commits a real blunder by limiting the story of faith to people who claim none or have an extremely warped sense of it. And he certainly didn't provide justice to my cousin's story.Brenda Lafferty's story was a story about the LDS faith. Of goodness. Of kindness and strength in helping her neighbor. Of a willingness to stand up to evil and unholiness.

Instead, it took about a month by ship, train and horseback) so honoring either and especially both requests piqued the interest of the piano tuner hired for the job, Edgar Drake.Through letters and official Army documents, the history and complicated situation of the British Empire in Burma is told. It's not the most entertaining thing to read, but the familiarity of some of the landscape and people sucked me in.There is a story and plot that is worthy of its own discussion about complicated motives, allegiance and destiny, but the thing that impressed me the most was that this was written by a young man, out of college and taking off a year to study Malaria along the Thailand/Myanmar border, who wrote this before going to Medical School. Me thinks the boy has a bright future!I'm not sure who to recommend this to. Anyone interested in Burma's history, for sure.

Very matriarchal and southern, the story is character driven although the natural progression of time throughout the story lends itself to a plot of sorts.The narrator is the granddaughter of Charlie Kate who begins telling the story when her grandmother would have been dating her grandfather. Charlie Kate is one of those before-the-times, tough, natural healers who does what she wants when she wants. She follows her calling in life and begins her career as a healer who practices medicine in a rudimentary way without any formal training. When she saves a black man from a bungled lynching while traveling along a road, she receives a railroad watch, a tin of excellent snuff and an easy-life charm ( which was ""the hind foot of a white graveyard rabbit caught at midnight, under the full moon, by a cross-eyed Negro woman who had been married seven times"")as payment and thanks.While nobody would look at her life as easy (her husband leaves her, she is constantly dealing with the poor, uneducated, neglected in her medical practice, her daughter ignores her advice and is trapped in a bad marriage) her no-nonsense view of life makes it seem pretty enjoyable. She loves her daughter and granddaughter but her big hang-up is that she doesn't trust men.Margaret's, the granddaughter, and Sophia's, the daughter, stories progress as Margaret's narration travels through time. I don't think Margaret gives us her name until the last few chapters. It's as if it isn't her story yet, and since she continues to only observe, we readers don't need it.I liked this book quite a bit. I got a great feel for southern mystical medicine, the difference between classes and the feel for what it might have been like for southern women during an interesting time of history (up to World War II).But mostly, I just liked Charlie Kate, Sophia and Margaret.

I don't need happy endings to enjoy stories and think romantic tension might just be my favorite source of conflict in a novel. Here, Emily Bronte created a complicated saga of love, class and marriage, however, hers included tempestuous, and some might add incestuous, relationships, abuse, despair and a very non-happily-ever-after ending (though, some might debate that. The really unhappy people were all finally dead by the story's end, which, I suppose, is a step up from their miserable and often times, sickly, existence). I guess I'm not sure what makes this well known title such a favorite among so many, other than it is beautifully written and perhaps a break from the mold of what was being written and published at the time. I suppose there are some who may love it for the very reason that it is filled with angst and misery. Her sister, Charlotte, had success with Jane Eyre, which is also excluded from the happy-happy-joy-joy plot club, but even that story, with its insanity, door scratching, fires and blindness had some characters to root for. Perhaps Emily and Charlotte had a friendly wager on who could write a more tragic love story?What am I talking about? Wuthering Heights is NOT a love story. If any of these characters felt true love, which is often accompanied by a sincere desire to sacrifice one's happiness for that of another, then I missed it. Instead, Wuthering Heights might just be the model for modern day soap operas where everyone says they love someone, when they aren't too busy plotting their demise and stealing their recently back-from-the-dead sister's baby. Wuthering Heights reminded me of Melrose Place - everyone is flawed and everyone is out to get everyone else. While I am a huge fan of the flawed character, Bronte's seemed overly flawed. What were Heathcliff's redeeming qualities? What in the world did Catherine seem in him? Did he make her laugh? Was it lust? Shared history? I'm assuming the attraction was due to having so much in common as Catherine, at one point, exclaimed, ""I am Heathcliff!"" Even with their many, many, many available flaws to choose from (selfish, violent, cruel, vengeful), none of the main characters demanded my loyalty. Am I supposed to root for Catherine and Heathcliff or feel sorry for them? I will say I enjoyed the nanny's point-of-view and narration. Now, there's an honestly flawed character! I loved how she passed off any responsibility, even as she was present to witness, and most of the time, allow, all of the bad behavior. What Bronte did in Wuthering Heights was masterfully describe obsession. Heathcliff's inability to move beyond his first experience with love, with his adoptive sister, Catherine, is what drives this plot and all of its madness. It's not a healthy look, but certainly well crafted. From the description of Wuthering Heights and its proximity to rocky moors and miserable weather, to the dark and cold setting of the house itself, at no point does this story rise above its intentional bleakness. At least, I never felt any rays of sunshine. This will not find a home on my shelf of favorite fiction, but I hope by reading this classic, I can benefit from understanding the frequent literary and pop culture references to Heathcliff and Catherine....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Oct 2009,"Nov 04, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights

In fact, this is the first C.S. Lewis book I have ever read other than ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe."" Of course, being LDNot my usual read. In fact, this is the first C.S. Lewis book I have ever read other than ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe."" Of course, being LDS, I have read and heard innumerable quotes of his from articles and talks. We are a C.S. Lewis loving society. I read this because this book was chosen for the bookgroup I belong to this month. Dread is much too strong of a word but I admit that I wasn't really looking forward to reading this book. And it isn't because I choose to read fluff either. I like a deep novel. Perhaps intimidated is the closet description of what I felt. After all, if general authorities quote him, how readable could it be?Overall, I really liked this book. The text was easy to read and the story flowed. That surprised me. Not that I wasn't expecting Lewis to be a great author but this book is definitely not limited to advanced readers. It begins with an unnamed man in line for a bus ride to somewhere unmentioned. His fellow passengers don't seem to be the kind of people anyone would enjoy being seated next too -- each with an obvious character flaw. The bus takes them to what is described at first as obviously Heaven but we later learn is just the ""Valley in the Shadow of Life"" or kind of the intro to Heaven. The grass is too hard to walk on for the newbie feet and each who has arrived is greeted by an angel who pretty much tries to convince them to follow them into the mountains where the real Heaven lies. In Lewis's afterworld, there are many who see what Heaven is like and decide not to be there. It is too hard or too different than what they want it to be like. They don't want to be different from who there were on earth and can't understand why they must let go of certain characteristics.I think my favorite paragraph in this book is when this unnamed man's angel tells him, ""...There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, ""Thy will be done,"" and those to whom God says, in the end, ""thy will be done."" All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. To those who knock it is opened.""Isn't that great? There were many moments in this story that I wanted to get out my highlighter pen and get busy. It was a very quick read: it only took a little over 2 hours to read. Of course, if you want to get serious and really ponder it would take much longer. But I read it like a novel...wanting to get a sense of the whole story. In that way, it was a bit disappointing. He doesn't do much creating a whole story as he does put a narrator in to eavesdrop on different peoples' first experiences with Heaven. When that person was clearly past convincing he moved on to the next ""ghost"" struggling. In the end, the book floundered a bit (I can't believe I am actually using that word in critiquing the great C.S. Lewis but then again....it is my blog!). His angel leads him on and eventually he sees a big chess table and suddenly real experience, time, space and all that is into question. Just for the last chapter, mind you. I found myself being a bit Sethesque and thinking, ""what the..."" something about lenses and visions and dreams and eventually he woke up. So we never were able to see what Lewis's deeper Heaven was like. And he scolded him to not report this experience as anything more than a dream. His angel says, ""....see ye make it very plain. Give no poor fool the pretext to think ye are claiming knowledge of what no mortal knows. I'll have no Swedenborgs and no Vale Owens among my children....He has forbidden it"" I guess in Christian theology, there have been experiences where visions were to go untold. It just didn't sit well with me. And that was the end. He woke up. To what end for this man? Did it make him better? More ready for the glory of God? I don't feel that unanswered question was necessary for the story....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Jul 2006,"Nov 04, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17267.The_Great_Divorce

And this is the rough draft.I've spent the last day trying to decide if I loved this book because I'm sentimental. The author, Irene NeA masterpiece. And this is the rough draft.I've spent the last day trying to decide if I loved this book because I'm sentimental. The author, Irene Nemirovsky, was a Russian Jew who wrote this while living in occupied France. A respected author, she had married Micheal Epstein who had also fled Russia when the Bolsheviks revolted. They had sincerely adopted France as their home country, converted to Catholicism and were the parents of two daughters. She began writing this novel while simultaneously experiencing it. She and her family had lived in Paris but had fled when German troops invaded the city. While most of the country was occupied, she moved to a French village and tried to survive amidst the new harsh laws concerning anyone of Jewish decent. She could no longer publish her works, could not cash checks, could not travel freely. Her life and freedom, as well as those of her husband and daughters were threatened daily. She had every excuse to be as frightened and as hysteric as anyone.Yet, she managed to write an unbelievably candid look at Frenchmen in their hour of need. Her intention was to write a five part novella in the idea of a musical symphony much like Beethoven's Fifth examining the behavior of people from different classes of society. She succeeded in writing two of the five parts: Storm in June and Dolce. Storm in June begins as rumors of a German invasion into Paris reach a frenzied level and characters decide whether or not evacuate their homes. The attitude, priorities and expectations vary greatly between the elite and working class. Desperation brings out the very worst in most, but not all. Food, gas, shelter - the basic needs of any person, become scarce and the desire to survive seems to super cede any desire to help a neighbor. Nemirovsky is an expert at exposing this without focusing on the misery. Instead, in her own words, she shows ""the prosperity that contrasts with it. . . one word for misery, ten for egotism, cowardice, closing ranks, crime. But it's true that it's this very atmosphere I'm breathing. It is easy to imagine it: the obsession with food."" Writing about the contrast is very effective. `What impresses me more is that Nemirovsky was part of this aristocrat class. She was privileged. To have the ability to understand at all the confusion and need of those without shows great compassion, I think.The second part of the novel, Dolce, is quite different. Rather than following several loosely related characters, she focuses on a small village adjusting to life with the German troop based there. Most of the upper class members of the village, farmers, land owners etc., had to house the officers of the German army at the same time their husbands, sons, and brothers were being held as prisoners of war someplace else. Nemirovsky manages to weave in a few of the characters from Storm into the story but the overall pace and feeling is much slower and calmer (ah....dolce!) The slower tempo and close proximity force many of the French to look at the Germans as humans rather than simply soldiers. Boredom resulting from the restrictions placed on the villagers, jealousy and greed as supplies and food are scarce for many cause tensions to run high. The most interesting part of this story to me was the relationship between Lucille and the German officer staying at their chateau all the while under the persecution of an unforgiving and pompous mother-in-law. How disappointing when this story ended and there was no more.Following the two stories are the handwritten notes written by the author. Plans for the third part to be titled ""Captivity"" were outlined and different story lines attempted. The realization that this was all a rough draft boggles my mind. They seem so....done and flawless. What a loss. After the appendix showing Nemirovsky's plans for the novel is another with the letters recovered from her and her family, acquaintances, editors etc. during this time period. The tone in these letters is so different from the tone in her notes for the novel. It's as if she was somehow push away her fear and trepidation while writing and thinking. Her personal correspondence, however, reveals that she was very aware of the danger facing her. Her last letter is written to her husband as she is being taken to a concentration camp. Following letters show the desperation of her husband, trying to find out where she has been taken and how she can be saved. then those stop as he is arrested and also taken to a concentration camp. They were both killed at Auschwitz.Her daughters were hid by a close friend for years until the war was over. Her eldest daughter carried around this manuscript in a suitcase wherever they traveled as a link to her mother and finally had it published and translated sixty years later.I don't think I loved this just because I am sentimental although I love it for that very reason. Independent of the author's tragic parallel story is the creation of something unique and special. It is as if someone was holding a mirror up to the French during the war but this mirror is alluring and beautiful, so much so that you can't help but pick it up and just gaze. But it's more than just a look at the French people during a specific period of time. It is also a timeless portrait of humanity. Highly, highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,299,1,not set,not set,"Oct 19, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43944.Suite_Fran_aise

Larry and Sid both have teaching jobs in the English Department at the university and Sally and Charity are both pregnant with similar due dates. The friendship between the four of them are instant and fully requited, and, as the novel begins with the Morgans visiting the Langs in their later years, obviously life long.The title of the book comes from a poem written by Robert Frost that goes:“I could give all to Time except-exceptWhat I myself have held. But why declareThe things forbidden that while the Customs sleptI have crossed to Safety with? For I am ThereAnd what I would not part with I have kept.”I regrettably admit that I don't usually understand poetry without someone explaining to me its meaning. I think...I think this has to do with the intangible but still very real benefits of meaningful relationships. That those benefits exist even after death. But I could be wrong.Like many, I assume, I long for that kind of meaningful friendship. One incredible thing about this book is that it adds to my longing without particularly making me want to BE a part of the book. The characters Stegner creates are so vividly real, I know...just know, that I couldn't be great friends with Charity. She's way too controlling. Likewise, I'd walk all over Sally. I need an equal sharer! Unfortunately, like almost every other character in the book, I don't have enough respect for Sid and Larry is much too full of himself to enjoy for long periods of time.While I don't want to be their friends, in particular, I still envy their friendship. I want something similar. Only I want that one great friendship to be with people that don't bug me.This book contains no great drama - no affairs or divorces, deaths or mysterious crimes - the journey of their friendship is compelling enough. He describes with such detail the universal jealousies, the generosity and benevolence of close friends, as well as the inevitable judgment that we make about others' relationships.It's more than just a story about friendship and marriage, however. The characters themselves are literary looking glasses, exposing our own ambitions, priorities, tolerance, vices, pride, loyalty and egos. If you enjoy literature, and don't need an exotic story but find satisfaction in honest reality, you'll probably enjoy this quiet gem....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Sep 2008,"Oct 19, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/373479.Crossing_to_Safety

After re-reading it this week, my 37 year-old self loves it even more. I wanted to read it again before I saw the new Baz Luhrman movie adaptation but didn't get around to it. I was surprised when I didn't adore the movie. I thought the marriage of a great book and Luhrman's decadent style would be perfect for me. I liked it well enough (I've loved his other movies: Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet) and really enjoyed the mash-up of an updated soundtrack with the elaborate time period costuming but there was something irritating about it all. I thought it was Leo DiCaprio's acting but after finishing the book, I don't think that's it. Instead, to my surprise, I think the movie overdid all of the parties in the beginning. Not that the parties weren't accurately portrayed and the indulgence and depravity present as described by Fitzgerald but the book was able to describe the parties and mention their frequency without having to place the reader in the tiring environment for long. Because, the book isn't only about the shallow excess of the era. It is about a great obsession. While I read, I realized how closely the dialogue of the movie matched the book but subtle descriptive words and Fitzgerald's absolute masterful grasp of phrasing was able to soften my judgment of all these ridiculous people and allow the tragedy of misplaced ambition to touch me.

If this sounds sacrilege, and you've never had this thought before, congratulations...you're probably not proud. But, pride is something I struggle with so his, ""Why can't you all just be more like me?"" attitude can be a stumbling block. But the thing to remember is, he was called of God, and although his personality might make me less wont to invite him to a party, his righteousness is absolute. And, ultimately, those who are called to be our leaders are meant to be followed. This means that the relief society president, who drives me batty (not my current one), still has the mantle of leadership, and it is my responsibility to adjust my pride so that I can learn the gospel. Laman and Lemuel, while probably slightly justified in finding their younger brother too much to take, allowed their pride to turn to sin, which resulted in the loss of the spirit. And thus, the second promise of the Lord is fulfilled, that ""inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. They didn't and they were. * the word ""durst"" is used quite frequently. * The lineage of authorship foreshadows the later-day church established by Joseph Smith. Nephi gives the small plates to his brother, Jacob, not to any of his own children. Sort of similar to how Hyrum's children were later leaders for the LDS church but not Joseph's own. I found that interesting. I wonder if there was an ancient RLDS church out there. * The allegory of the Lord in the Vineyard found in Jacob is profound and deeply relevant to our day. * There were some slackers that were handed the plates. * Race does not matter. The line between Nephite and Lamanite was so blurred throughout their history that it wasn't a matter of race. The distinction was between those who were lived the commandments of God and those who ignored them. The Nephites who turned ""bad"" were the worst of all. Those were some scary dudes. * I've often wondered why there are so many details of the wars. I'm sure there are multiple and deeper reasons, but I'm leaning towards Mormon just being really interested in it. After all, he was in charge of the entire Nephite army when he was only 16. I can imagine him looking through all the old plates and scrolls and loving all the details Captain Moroni, Teancum, Helaman and Moronihah left. It's a manly book. If only their wives could have been bloggers. * Sadly, the history is dictated by which war was in what year. I don't think their history differed from that of any other civilization. We mark time by our skirmishes and conquests. The peace and love that existed while Christ visited, and the effect his visit had for generations to come, stands in stark contrast. * The sacrament is sacred. Jay and I had a discussion a couple of weeks ago where he pointed out that taking the sacrament is symbolic of partaking of the tree of life. After reading Christ's words to his disciples, I absolutely agree. I think we endanger our spirits when we partake unworthily or even absentmindedly. * It truly matters who our leaders are. I found this discovery extremely apropos with the current change in leadership of this church, as well as the leadership of our country. It takes a wise, humble, and righteous person to effectively lead his people in peace and prosperity whereas a corrupt leader inevitably leads those who follow to destruction. Every time. * Being rich isn't the point of being prosperous. I think a great stewardship comes with becoming rich. It's almost a test to see how you handle it. I've been feeling covetous lately for a large home. You see these monster homes being built everywhere around here and it's gotten into my head that I must have one. Nothing less than 5,000 square feet will do! It's pretty clear throughout the book that those the Lord blesses with prosperity doesn't entitle them to get caught up with their money and belongings. The outcome is never good when this happens. So, I'm going to nip this feeling in the bud and hopefully do it before the riches come. (by the way, I don't think having a 5,000 square foot house is bad. But coveting one before you need it or can afford it certainly is). * Moroni was totally improvising at the end. He didn't know when he'd die so he just kept adding stuff at the end. And there is some really good stuff at the end! * The moral of the story seems to be repentance. The theme throughout is ""keep my commandments and you will prosper in the land."" but as no one does that perfectly, except my good friend Nephi (who, really I'm just envious of because he never seems to stumble...and who doesn't stumble???) the only way to do it is to repent...continually.The best part of this experience has been today. There is a certain famous verse, although when I read it, it wasn't a verse but merely part of the second to last page, where Moroni challenges the reader to pray with a sincere heart to discover the truth of the book. My greatest fear while reading was that I would feel exactly the same afterwards. I wanted to feel more, and an inner voice sounded off a worry about what I'd think if I didn't.I didn't know if I'd get the burning bosom. I wanted it, but knew I couldn't force it so I decided to fast the entire day and made arrangements with my sister to have her watch my children while I went to the temple. It was while I was driving to her high school to drop them off, and after I switched the CD playing from a mix to a Mormon Tabernacle Choir recording (I knew no burning would come from listening to Timbaland) that it came. Peace like a River started to play while I was going through the drive through at Carl's Jr. to get lunch for my boys and the melody and words ""peace like a river"", "" faith like a river"" ""hope like a river"", ""love like a river"" and I felt overwhelmed with such a spirit of joy and love for my Savior.That's it! That's it. There are wars, and rumors of wars, and corruption and sin and secret combinations and even total destruction. But with Christ, there is peace. And hope. And charity. The Book of Mormon boldly teaches us the commandments of God, and of His plan so that the faith, hope and peace can be felt.This book is true. It is not written by a genius of manipulation. By their fruits ye shall know them, and this is good fruit. It testifies of Christ and because it does, it uplifts the soul....more",Notes are private!,1,347,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Oct 18, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/323355.The_Book_of_Mormon

It centers around four siblings whose parents are killed in a horrible accident and the life altering decisions that were made in the aftermath. What really struck me, however, wasn't the ""oh, my life could have turned out this way had my parents not died"" idea but what the siblings, namely the middle sister, whose older brothers sacrificed much to raise her and her younger sister in their parents stead, assumed her siblings feelings or lives must be like because of their sacrifice.

There are dozens of topics within his books to discuss, enjoy and ponder, but he manages to twist and turn his story, so at its end, you get the Rubik's cube sides all neatly back to the same color.Like My Name Is Asher Lev, which I loved, Potok writes about a Jewish boy torn between his own genius and his orthodox father's expectations. Danny Saunders, a genius boy with a photographic memory, is destined to take his father's place as the community tzaddik, or spiritual leader of Hasidic Jews. To teach his son compassion, he parents him with silence, like his father did before him, and the only time father and son talk is when they discuss the Talmud, a Jewish book consisting of different rabbi's discussions of Jewish laws and ethics.But, the father-son relationship is only one side of the thematically complicated but narratively simple story. There is much food for thought about friendship (""You think it is easy to be a friend? If you are truly his friend, you will learn otherwise"") which Danny's father, Reb Saunders, tells the narrator of the story, Reuven Malter, and certainly proves to be true. There is a fantastic development about the Zionist movement, and the opposition within the Jewish community against Israel to be created after the second World War. There is an interesting, albeit outdated, flirtation with psychology and Freudism. And much, much more...especially if someone could simply live inside my head and answer back whenever I had a ""and what do you think about this?"" moment.I find that one of Potok's greatest achievements is his ability to narrowly write a story that happens in a close, sheltered environment about a specific religious belief, and have it easily apply to many different beliefs and situations. I found myself thinking to myself most of today about how this story, about a community of ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jews, has a lot in common with my current community. This place, where I live, has the broadest spectrum of believers/non-believers, practicing/non-practicing, ultra conservative/ultra liberal members of my own religion. The characters in the story are living and functioning in an almost self-contained environment. Their schools are Jewish. Their sports teams are Jewish. Their stores, hospitals, friends and neighborhoods are Jewish. The conflict is not ""us vs. them"" but ""old us vs. new or changing us"" and ""holier us vs. secular us"". They don't see the world around them.Ding, ding, ding!!!Like poor Reb Saunders had to discover by isolating his son from his best friend, and what David Saunders knew, but didn't have the courage to proclaim, good exists in all shapes and sizes and from all walks of life. It exists down the street, where perhaps the homes aren't matching brown stucco craftsman style. It exists at the other school. It exists in literature and areas of study and even at the church with the different shaped spire. There is goodness everywhere.This belief of mine is fundamentally different from Reb Saunders, who explained that each person is born with a tiny spark of goodness which is enveloped in a shell of ugly and evil. It is the responsibility of the parent, the church, the community to protect that spark, encourage it, feed it so that it can grow and expand to eventually fill the shell and push out the evil.While there is certainly plenty of evil surrounding us all, I think it only gets more bold and has more room to grow when we huddle around our goodness. It, goodness, is bigger than we allow it to be. We need to link goodness to goodness and charge down the street, all ablaze together.Kind of a tangent, but I love books that make me go off down one. I can't say this book is a favorite, because it didn't make me feel the way a book needs to, but I'm certainly glad I've read it and happily encourage anyone who hasn't to do so....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Oct 18, 2007",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/187181.The_Chosen

I can't tell you how many bad books I have finished hoping for a Potok-esque finish...moving depth that justifies the slow pace of his books. This was a book I had a hard time finishing. It was too easily put down and, to be truthful, I didn't even like this book until about 3/4 of the way into it. Now, I emphatically say that it is one of the best books I have ever read.There is so much to say about this book. Throughout my entire reading of it, I kept thinking the book was about ""this"" or ""that"", only to be surprised by realizing the subject matter went far deeper. At first I thought it was about an art prodigy; that a difficult path is taken when your child is special or gifted.It kind of is.Then I thought it was about the pain and awkwardness of being a religious Jew right after the second world war.Again, kind of.Then I thought it was like The Namesake and the struggle between parents and children and different generations.Getting closer.Ultimately, I think this book is about perception. What is honoring your father and mother and what is following your dream? What is tradition and what is truth? What is the better choice? What is the better life? Whose point of view matters?I experienced a lot of frustration while reading this. First of all, this book is about so many things that I either know nothing about or that don't interest me. For instance, Asher Lev is a art prodigy. As he is the main character, art - its history and technique - is a frequent subject matter. I know very little about art. It was hard for me to respond to Asher Lev's need to draw and paint. As a person without any particular passion, I had to take his word for it that for him, drawing and painting wasn't a hobby, or something he liked to do, but that it was who he was, an insatiable need that controlled him. That sort of passion would probably cause problems in any family but when you are a Hasidic Jew and the son of an important emissary of the Rebbe whose life work is to create safe places to teach the Torah to religious Jews throughout Europe, that passion tears apart a family.My second frustration is probably apparent by now. I know very little about Judaism. There is a no apologizes approach to Potok's description of Jewish life. Obviously a Jew himself, he doesn't write for the goyim (are you frustrated? That's the Jewish term for the Gentile. Yeah...I know. I had to learn it all too).There is a noticeable lack of emotion written about such an emotionally charged situation. Short, perfunctory sentences that made me feel as frustrated with the situation as I felt Asher Lev did with his father who did not get art. By the end of the book, I could appreciate it for the technique that it was. Asher Lev was the narrator and we experienced the story through Asher Lev. That containment of emotion, the abrupt conclusion of dialogue with his parents...that was his existence.It all builds up to this pinnacle of frustration, this burst of emotion that brings the most hurt to his parents although that is what his art is about...his hurt, his mother's hurt, his father's hurt. I actually cried through this part. I rarely cry. It's that good.An incredible book. An important book. A book, most definitely, worth reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,126,1,not set,Jun 2007,"Oct 18, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11507.My_Name_Is_Asher_Lev

I recall recommending it freely, only to I originally read this about five years ago when it was a super popular best seller and absolutely loved it. I recall recommending it freely, only to be chagrined later on with the realization that the book is really not intended for the sensitive reader. With my first reading, Niffenegger managed to ""smoke and mirror"" her way around the book's frequent crude language and descriptive love scenes because Time Traveler's plot was so incredibly original.After attempting a discussion with a friend who very recently read it, I realized most of my memory of the book was too faded for a legitimate conversation. I picked up the enormous hardbound copy at the library and quickly found myself escaping in the tricky time traveling romance and doomed love story once again. It really is such a fantastic idea and when I finished, I found myself still scratching my head in wonder about how Niffenegger got the idea for this book in the first place, and feeling slightly overwhelmed by its desperate ending.The smoke and mirrors weren't as effective the second time around, however, as I felt more offended by the crude language used by both Clare and Henry. I'm not a prude who regards all language as inappropriate, and think sometimes the character's background or emotional outburst warrants the feeling such language manages to evoke. But it felt really unnecessary most of the time. Clare and Henry are both such smart characters, so capable of better verbs and adjectives. Additionally, neither seems particularly rash or impetuous - so their casual dropping of vulgar words only seemed...vulgar.If you care about those things, you probably won't enjoy this book.

I know I loved it all those years ago, and have told countless friends and acquaintances to read it based on that memory of loving it but, if you want to know the truth, the details about the story have become...err....a bit sketchy.Oh, I remembered that it involved pioneers and a romance and a woman whose English skills improved with time, but beyond that, I was as clueless as the person who has never read it. Time and a poor long-term memory will do that.Following spring break, I went to the library to pick up some holds that had become available. As I looked at the titles, I realized that at some point, I must have looked at a list of recent Pulitzer or Booker prize winners and nominees because each of them had some kind of acknowledgment on their cover. I sighed at the prospect of only having these options in the forthcoming weeks. Nothing against prize winning literature, but they tend to lean towards the heavier side of life. And I needed a break from heavy.With books in my arms, I decided to browse through the shelves of fiction, hoping I might find something on the lighter side as a diversion. As I came to the ""T""s, I noticed the book Sarah's Quilt, which is a sequel to These Is My Words.At that moment, the only book I wanted to read was These Is My Words. Of course, the library didn't have a copy available, but the audio book version was on its shelf. 12 CDs and I left that library together.I imagined listening to the story in my minivan as I drove around from errand to errand, but was quickly reminded that although the story is ""clean"" it isn't really for young children. There are descriptions of some rather brutal happenings as Sarah Agnes Prine and her family trek from Texas to the Arizona frontier to become homesteaders. Indian skirmishes, dying children and men taking advantage of scared young girls kept my listening a private affair.I imagine most people who regularly listen to audio books have some kind of system that allows them to upload them to an ipod or something similar. My little ipod shuffle doesn't have that kind of memory, so I was forced to either play the CDs through my computer or listen to them on the portable DVD player we bought for our kids to use on trips. Again, I disliked the exposure of the computer speakers and after one disc, exclusively used the unwieldy DVD player.Portable or not, holding onto something the size of a large book doesn't lend itself well to getting much done. On day one, I reserved my listening to lying in bed before I went to sleep. But, as anyone who has ever read/listened to These Is My Words before, it wasn't long before it consumed my thoughts and I couldn't help but put the next disc in....and then the one after that.I did manage to iron a few things during one CD, but it was awkward. the cord of my headphones wasn't very long, and I found myself crouching next to the ironing board with my head bent in order to listen. In addition, if I was ironing a pair of pants and needed the entire board, I had to rig the DVD player underneath my armpit, and after a few times of the machine falling to the ground and pulling my neck with it, I gave up ironing:)Oh...I loved this book! The reasons why came flooding back into my thoughts. I love Sarah and her no-nonsense strength. I loved her honesty, as a daughter, as a sister and especially later as a wife. I love how she mothers. I love how she tolerates her circumstances, celebrates her victories and mourns her trials. I just loved her.Throw in Captain Jack Elliot and one of the greatest love stories in literature and you've got yourself the makings of a great book. No wonder I remember liking it so well.The audio version had its advantages and disadvantages. I liked the narrator. She had a drawl that influenced my speech and thoughts for days afterward. I found myself using the phrase, ""Fit to be tied"" when I became frustrated. I may have even said it out loud once. And I'm still hoping my mother-in-law didn't notice too much when I over-enunciated my ""r""s. I caught myself before it became too big a problem.The one minus was that she also narrated for Captain Jack. I don't care how great a voice you have, a woman's voice lowered to sound like a man's still sounds like a woman's voice. Every time she spoke Jack's lines, I thought, ""Nope...still you.""I am so glad I reconnected with this book. As soon as I finished, I ordered a copy off of Amazon.com, just so that I could have it handy whenever the mood strikes again. While certainly not ""light"" and definitely not ""fluffy"", I enjoyed Sarah's Prine's story of life in the Arizona territories during the end of the 19th century.

The main character of Goodnight Nobody is a harried mother of 3 under the age of 4 and feels like she doesn't compare with the mothers in her neighborhood. Nothing earth shattering there.The book was well written but has a very disappointing ending. Come to think of it, most of Weiner's endings are bad. It's as if she sets herself up as a comedic author and then attempts to end each book with a depressing, unresolved, facts of life conundrum. Um....I think I'll stick to more proven authors if I want to read about messed up, complicated home lives.I have obviously never met Jennifer Weiner but her protagonist in this book seems familiar. A smart, pretty but larger Jewish woman who always has a fantastic friend to lean on and a situation of unrequited like. Looking at her picture, her name and reading her bio, I'm going to venture a guess that this character isn't much of a stretch. Especially since she uses her in each book. But I really like her protagonist and I'll keep reading what she writes.Her title comes from the children's story Goodnight Moon. The part that says Goodnight nobody.

Lots of zingers and thoughts and comebacks that make you want to hang out with her in real life.Like most of Weiner's books (and I have read most of them now), she tends to create a melodrama in what most readers simply want to be a comedy. The conflict, which all books must have, blows up too much and makes the book lose its sparkle.

Levitt takes the principle of incentive and while most economists apply it to finance, he applies it to different social situations that are far more interesting to read about. For example, one chapter is titled, ""Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?"" His basic point is that behavior is caused by incentives: social, financial, moral. But it's not just talky talk. I read most of the latest John Stossle book and while I found a lot of his philosophizing interesting I thought some of his data and research was questionable. This guy, however, does not write to whistle blow, moralize, or convert. His sentences include words like algorithm, correlation, causality, equation, data, regression analysis and variables.

I don't have the expertise to identify the exact narration technique, but to have the narrator, Lyman Ward, not only share his beloved grandparent's 100 year-old history from his 20th century perch, providing both redemptive hindsight and worrisome foreshadowing when needed, but also his own story as an amputee with a debilitating bone disease bitterly protecting his lonely independence, furnishing the relevance and motive, is brilliant. I know many other authors must also do this. It's probably considered common by those in the know within the world of literature. However, I read a lot of novels and I can't think of a single book I've ever read that has done it better than Wallace Stegner in Angle of Repose. Angle of Repose dramatizes the life of Susan Burling Ward, a talented illustrator raised in an Eastern Quaker home, and her marriage to Oliver Ward, a kind, intelligent but tragically unlucky engineer trying to make a name for himself in the West. Through Susan and Oliver's first fourteen years together, the reader travels to mining camps in California, Colorado and Mexico, and eventually to pre-Statehood Idaho, painting an absolute masterpiece of American West history. Although Lyman Ward is a fictional character in a fictional novel, his passionate defense of the importance of history, could and should be well quoted by actual scholars in the field. Even his short but wonderfully persuadable argument against communal economics and relationships should be studied. They are that profound.But, as the narrator states, this is really a story about marriage. What allows certain couples, who universally tumble down life's uncertain slope together, to reach a point where the tumbling stops? For rocks and debris in the engineering realm, it's called the angle of repose. There is an eventual stillness, for good or for bad, when the motion or hurt or progress or momentum stops. Perhaps it is balance and harmony. Or, perhaps it is staleness, stubbornness and unrelenting grudges. I'm sure the meaning of ""angle of repose"" could be presented either way. I lean towards the calm, comfortable stability definition but maybe the stationary rocks aren't content with their quiet.I hope to return to this novel again and again. It's not a happy one. In many ways, there is a melancholy post-reading that I still can't shake. But, there is also a beauty in words, thoughts and vivid description that makes me clap for joy.

It's not meatless, exactly, but written as a fairy tale in the voice of a young princess so it's about as meaty as Chicken Noodle Soup. There are some worthwhile themes throughout the book. Ambition, gifts, honesty, work. The princess, whose name was blessedly shortened to Ani for most of the book, lacks the power of persuasion that her mother, the Queen, possesses. The author calls this gift ""People Speaking"" and while Ani doesn't possess that particular gift, she does possess the rarer, and less esteemed ""Animal Speaking"" and later ""Nature Speaking"" gifts. She can talk to swans, as a girl, and later, while in hiding when her lady-in-waiting pulls a coup during their journey to meet her betrothed, learns to speak to the geese she keeps. Ultimately, she uses these gifts, especially her ability to talk with wind, to restore her place as Crown Princess, leaving us with the lesson that we can rely on the gifts we possess to accomplish what is necessary. I think. At least, that's what I'm taking away from it. A la....To Thine Own Self Be True without all the fancy talk.Those elements create the fairy tale, as well as all the prince and princess stuff, but this felt surprisingly modern to me. There were times the dialogue seemed appropriate to the time of the story, but most of the time, I heard the voices of young, spoiled American teens in my head, especially when the ruthless Selia spoke.

But once I did, wow...there is so much beauty in words, landscape and life study to enjoy. A sweeping epic of a man's life from the early 1800s to the end of the century in the American South, Frazier describes the harsh realities of a young and sometimes immature government as it expands its territory and faces its own human rights abuses. He does this through the life of Will Cooper, a bound boy on his own since his eleventh year and a man who eventually becomes a Chief, a laywer, a senator, a Colonel and a vast land owner. His life is a lonely one, without family and without Claire, the love of his life. He compensates by devoting his life to the Cherokee and Bear, a clan Chief, who adopted him in his teenage years. While other clans are forced off their eastern mountain land to move west onto reservations, Will keeps them in their mountain home with his evasive lawyering skills which earns him much esteem but also much critism. In the end, he ends up nearly as alone as when the book began. Read this patiently. Enjoy its honesty and perspective.

At first, I was completely absorbed in the writing and Leo Gursky. I even told Emily this book might go on my list of Top Ten favorites. Oh, how I loved Leo's thoughts and his ""But."" and ""And yet."" sentences. So stretchy. Those frequently used simple sentences created a narrative of yearning and unfufillment that perfectly expressed Leo's character's disappointment in life.When it was Alma's turn to speak and disclose, I wasn't nearly so infatuated. Her thoughts and questions lacked the honesty and pain that the much older Leo was able to possess, which makes sense as Alma was only fourteen. Still, I persevered and even enjoyed the minute and slow discoveries she was making.This book is almost a mystery. The hows and the whys are confusing and it isn't until the end that the missing key is given which opens up the full heartache and confusion of all the characters. Unfortunately, by this time, I was much less enchanted with the entire story as I found way too many parallels with her husband's book that I had already read. They are both about Jewish people divided by a generation who come together through letters. They are both set in New York City with flashbacks to Germany during World War II. They both involve extremely precocious and unnaturally odd children who lose a parent and deal with their grief by setting out on an expedition of discovery. And they both end abysmally disappointing with dysfunction winning over true love. Sigh.I think I would have loved this book had I read it first or only. Sadly, both books feel tainted to me now.

This book came highly recommended, and once I started reading, I kept thinking I had already but couldn't, for the life of me, remember how it ended. Turns out, it only seemed familiar to me because it is based on a real life experience. In 1995, the president of Peru and many of his guests were taken hostage and held for months. Bel Canto is a fictitious story based loosely on those events.I only liked Bel Canto. I understand its appeal - the coming together of hostages and terrorists alike, but the writing was a bit too ethereal and romantic for me. SO much emphasis placed on opera, as if it's the universal band-aid. I know a lot of people that don't enjoy opera at all. In fact, a music lover myself, I'd have to admit that most of opera is an acquired taste. The hugeness of the voice, the strong vibrato and foreign languages take some getting used to. However, according to the author, there is no politician, businessman, servant or gunman that doesn't fall into a deep state of hypnosis when a soprano begins her song. I tend to think that perhaps the terrorist from a South American country, where musical tastes are a bit different, might not have been so cast under her spell, but I could be wrong. I've never thought of it as the only offered solace to a terrifying situation.Which leads me to the other thing that I find a hard time believing. Terrorists...with guns....coming through air vents into a vice presidential palace and no one seems particularly petrified throughout it all. Again, I think this was the author's way of romanticizing the event by leaving out the crapping of pants and desperate pleas for loved ones, but everyone was annoyingly contrite and calm, even the terrorists themselves, who seemed awfully nice and understanding. The end was appropriately tragic. I read a few s that described this as an example of magical realism, a genre I try and avoid so this labeling surprised me. Maybe all the lack of fear, suspended time and happy hostage household was part of it. The ending, while sad and tragic, satisfied my need for logic and realism. This event seemed to have a larger psychological effect on the survivors then the original hostage takeover. Whether or not that is realistic or not, I have no idea.I wish she hadn't written her epilogue. It was unnecessary and unbelievable. Sort of like how all doctors on a hospital television show end up as couples, as if there were no one else in the world to date or socialize with. (view spoiler)[I did not believe or think that Gen and Roxane belonged together...even with their personal losses (hide spoiler)].The book as a whole, however, is not void of greatness. The Russian cabinet member and his story of the box was poetic. Cesar's natural talent and love of performing made me cheer. And the inward look at most regarding their professions and priorities was very appropriate. All combined, it makes for an enjoyable, flawed book....more",Notes are private!,0,315,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Sep 11, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

I'd heard of the title, learned it was an Oprah's Book Club choice, and saw it at Sam's Club which inspired me to put a hold on it at the library, but I didn't actually know what it was about.For that reason, I was a little nervous when I read the foreward and the critic walked me through its rediscovery in the 60s (it was written in 1937) and subsequent controversy over its worthiness as a part of African American literature. Yikes. What's a white, middle class, northerner to do? I prepared myself to read with a sheltered caution.Honestly, I don't understand the controversy. I don't think it white washes over the ugly aspects of the south in the 1930s, but it also doesn't dwell on every injustice or the blatant unfairness of the times. It simply tells the story as is. Perhaps the African American community fears fingers and voices pointing to the book saying, ""See? It wasn't so bad? Your history isn't all oppression and misery."" If that is or was the case, I think its safe to say that while the Zora Neale Hurston's portrayal of African American history doesn't attempt the heights of horror of, say, a Toni Morrison novel, it also doesn't give the reader a rosy tinted view of their history either.The main character, Janie, is an African American teenage girl, raised by a grandmother who, while a slave, was raped and impregnated by a white man. The grandmother bore a daughter, Janie's mother, who, later, was also raped by a peer while in school, which left Janie's mother traumatized and uninterested in her baby. Left to be raised by her grandmother, Janie's childhood and rearing was old-fashioned and she was left with a limited understanding of the world, especially the male/female romantic relationship. Janie does have a vivid experience involving watching pear blossoms being pollinated by bees, which leaves her yearning for romantic love.Convinced by her grandmother that love can develop after marriage, Janie marries an older farmer who is looking for a hard working wife to help take care of his land. After a short amount of time, Janie realizes there are no pear blossoms there, and that this life does not make her happy. One day, while doing a chore, she comes upon a charismatic man named Jody, who dresses and acts like a free white man, much different than the other men she has been exposed to, and is on his way to live in an all-black community, Eatonville.Jody smooth talks Janie into going with him and she leaves the farm and her husband in search of her pear blossom. Unfortunately for Janie, this new opportunity doesn't present happiness either and after 20 years or so of marriage and being a trophy to her powerful husband who became Mayor of Eatonville, she finally becomes a widow and experiences independence for the first time. With that independence, she meets and marries the much younger Tea Cake, her pear blossom, and begins to understand and enjoy the inner person she always knew she was.The power of this novel comes from the phonetic dialogue which transports you to the black south, and the honest expose of the attitudes and expectations of blacks during this period of our country's history. I feel that Janie went through a great deal of growth and discovery and is an excellent example of the silent and dignified power women have and have always had, even when its ability to express itself is limited....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Sep 11, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37415.Their_Eyes_Were_Watching_God

AS Byatt was awarded the Booker Prize of Fiction in 1990 for her ambitious unfolding love story between two fictional poets from the 19th century,R.H. Ash and Cristabel LaMotte, and two modern day literary experts on their works and life, Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell, who uncover a series of unknown love letters between the poets and piece together clues that have been well hidden for over a century. Journal entries, poems, fables, letters, dialogue and narrative are all used by the author to progress the plot and expose the century old secret love affair. The fierce competition over discovery and possession of the recently discovered documents urgently drives the need to uncover the past. The result is not always easy to read. The poetry, for me, was especially difficult. Reading poetry, complicated poetry...not Dr. Seuss or Shel Silverstein, is like reading a foreign language that I only had one semester of in middle school. I can read it, pronounce it but simply don't have the patience, backround knowledge or vocabulary to comprehend it. Victorian era poetry is like mulitiplying that difficulty ten fold. And, many times, it wasn't a few lines or stanzas to muddle my way through, but pages and pages of subtle irony and word play about relationships or observations embedded in a poem about a garden or insect. That's the hard stuff. But the conversations about life, creation, religion, independence, gender, and language within a charged current of attraction and need had me on edge and completely absorbed in the story. The characters are impossibly fictional. Not being a poet or scholar of Victorian English literature, I had no idea that Ash or LaMotte were fictional. I knew the story was fictional, but I assumed the author took license with two actual historical figures. They are so real, so smart and their voices and thoughts so deep and detailed that it wasn't until I finished the book and googled Ash and LaMotte that I discovered their lives were limited to this book. The letters, the poems, the journals...each had their own tone and style. What a feat to accomplish in one book. No wonder it won such a prestigious award! Incredible fiction.

He wrote an interesting history of the development of the fair and a descent portrayal of Holmes and his frightening existence, but how he decided to throw them together into one book and title it so that the two seem related is too much of a stretch. They both happened in Chicago in roughly the same time frame but it's like writing about the Washington D.C sniper murders like it had anything to do with building the World War II memorial on the National Mall. They just aren't related. Some happened in the same city during the same time...but some didn't and I don't think one really had anything to do with the other. Well, it's not quite as random as that...but almost.I did learn a lot about architecture, and about the impact the fair had on America's history. That was fascinating.

I always answer that I don't have one; there are many books I love but they are too different to say one is superior to another.I have changed my mind. Mrs. Mike is my favorite book.A coming of age story set in the Canadian North in the year 1907, Katherine Mary O'Fallon, a young woman of 16, goes to live with her uncle somewhere north of Calgary as treatment for her pleurisy. There she meets Sergeant Mike Flannigan, a Mountie who has ""eyes so blue she could swim in them."" They are eventually married after a brief (but fantastically romantic) courtship and she follows him by dog sled to the arctic wilderness to live among the fur traders and Indians.I love this book for many reasons. Most importantly, as a book, it's my first love. Mrs. Mike was the book that made me realized how much a book could move and stick with me for years. I rarely re-read a book, but I believe I've read Mrs. Mike five times now. Each time, my stomach swoons when Kathy and Mike fall in love, I laugh when Kathy covers her daughter and Mike spanks Kathy instead, I cry when the unimaginable happens and I sigh as I close the book, thinking the line at the very end is one of the best ever written.Another reason I love this book is that it's based on a real woman's life who the authors met before writing the book. I'm sure it's juiced from the reality, but even the skeleton of the story is moving.I can't claim that it's the best written book. It is simple in structure, dialogue and description, but as I've read more and more over the years, and compare it to other literature, I believe the style matches the story perfectly.It's the kind of book I can't help but promise that anyone who reads it will love it. But I also know that with our diverse personalities and preferences, it wouldn't be true. Like a biased mother who adores her baby, I don't think I'd enjoy anyone pointing out the flaws of this book.

It's not obvious and her writing is much more broad in scope than this one classroom experience.In her defense, Huntley describes this book as accidental. It really is made up of her journal entries that she wrote without any intention of publishing. It wasn't until those receiving her emails initiated the book idea, and she was made an offer from a publisher, that she considered sharing her thoughts with the world. The result is a mixture of mundane, uncensored thought with truthful, personal insight. I am ashamed to admit that I had to research online about the whole Kosovo/Serb/Albanian conflict was. Of course, I had herd about Milosivec and his war crimes, but I didn't know how Kosovo related to Bosnia and Sarajevo and that entire region. It is hard to imagine, as a multi-generational American, how such intolerance and ignorance can exist in this day and age when the world is so much smaller. How can people still believe that races, or ethnicities, or religions as a whole, actually produce an inferior and worthless human being? This happened seven years ago, and they are still talking with so much generalizations! ALL Serbs, ALL Albanians, ALL Americans etc. Anytime a sentence begins with or contains an ""ALL"" I bristle. This kind of tragedy is what happens when we fail to see the individual spirit. Essentially, that is what Huntley much teach these young Kosovar Albanians. That while they have been oppressed and persecuted, they must adjust their thinking. And to accomplish that change, they must have the VOCABULARY to communicate with the world without violence. The book didn't have much to do with a Hemingway bookclub and I would have loved a more in-depth look at their discussion of the book and the parallels that Huntley ultimately draws from it, but I did end up rooting for Leonard and the Professor and her other students, which is why Huntley ultimately decided to go ahead and publish. She wanted us to know these individuals and understand the beauty of the Kosovar soul.

It's so rare that I read something thatI finished this last night and afterwards, I lay back on my pillow extremely satisfied just thinking about it. It's so rare that I read something that delights me from beginning to end. While there were a few turns on the journey that confused me and seemed to take the book in a different direction, his connecting all the characters, the stories and do it with profound meaning is nothing short of brilliant. And to do it through his own person history, and one of the oldest stories of the Bible only adds to his brilliance.I'm always surprised when I love a classic. Perhaps because there are a lot that I haven't liked, or merely tolerated, but this was a joy to read. The characters are so multi-dimensional and interesting that their stories and development become almost personal. Adam, Samuel, Lee, Abra, Cal, Aron, Kate/Cathy and even Liza were real for me. Their homes were real. Their towns were real. Best of all, the consequences to their actions were real.How do you summaraize East of Eden? It's a story about good and evil. But most of all, it's a story about choice. For me, the central part of the book was the realization made by Lee, Adam and Samuel when they were dissecting the story of Cain and Able and their offerings. In one translation, the Lord rebukes Cain's offering by saying, ""If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.""It was while reading a different translation that Lee, a Chinese servant, noticed a difference. In it, rather than saying ""thou shalt rule over him"" it said ""do thou rule over him"" They noticed that it wasn't a promise, it was an order. Such a difference got Lee wondering what original word different translations came from.After years of studying with Chinese philosophers and a rabbi, the consensus was that the original Hebrew word, Timshel, actually means ""Thou mayest"". Therefore, the bible does not order that man triumph over sin or promises that it will. It says that the way is open. For if thou mayest...that mayest not.Brilliant! Because that's what I think! Agency is so important to Heavenly Father that he allowed 1/3 of His children to leave him permanently. Of course we have a choice over sin.Steinbeck leaves the story briefly in Chapter 34 when he writes a short essay about the one story that exists. He says,Humans are caught - in their lives, in their thoughts, in their hungers and ambitions, in their avarice and cruelty, and in their kindness and generosity too - in a net of good and evil....A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left only the hard, clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? Have I done well -- or ill? In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influences and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world. We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.This is what his book is about it. Man's struggle over good and evil. In a completely human story, Steinbeck captured THE story with his characters and storylines. This is a book I happily recommend to anyone and will buy for my all-time greatest books library....more",Notes are private!,0,129,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Aug 24, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden

Buck, an American citizen who spent most of her childhood and much of her adult life in China, in 1931. It was awarded the PulitzeWritten by Pearl S. Buck, an American citizen who spent most of her childhood and much of her adult life in China, in 1931. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. I've heard much about it, mostly about a moment in the story when a woman gives birth and then goes back to work in the fields the same day, and have wanted to read it for quite some time.I think it's always intimidating to read a classic. They are usually reserved for English classes or intellectuals and I worry that my understanding won't be up to snuff. Here goes:The story begins on Wang Lung's wedding day. He is a peasant farmer, in China, who goes to the house of a wealthy farmer to pick up the bride his father has arranged for him to have: a plain, unattractive slave whose feet have never been bound and appear hideous to him. Large feet notwithstanding, he quickly learns to admire his hard-working and frugal wife. With their hard work and savings, Wang climbs up the economic ladder by being able to buy additional land to farm on. It's ALL about the land, in Wang's opinion. Land is forever. Land cannot be taken away.Sure enough, what I heard about birthing and returning to work in the fields the same day was true. O-Lan, Wang's wife, is this incredibly docile, unassuming woman. She's the kind of woman that made me feel like a slacker for sitting around reading a book. Or taking a few weeks off of going to church after having a baby. I longed for more O-Lan, but that wasn't what this book was about. There were moments when I saw her pain, when I understood that in this culture, no one really loved O-Lan, despite her humility and service. Not her parents, who probably considered having a girl a burden and sold her as a slave when she was very young, not her owners, not her husband, and eventually, not even her own children. Wang appreciated her but all his appreciation did was allow him to feel ashamed when he brought a concubine to the home.The beauty of the book, to me, was the irony that Buck skillfully weaves throughout the story. The rise and fall of the House of Hwang, where O-Lan was a slave, parallels Wang Lung's own story. It's the whole Nephite Pride Cycle! In fact, Buck's style of writing felt a bit like reading the scriptures. It was written dispassionately, even when writing about the character's passion. I also appreciated the Epic nature of the story. There is something to be learned from the successes and the tragedies.As much as I liked it, and I liked it very much, I wasn't completely smitten. I read some of the original s which led to the Pulitzer Award, and most of them focus on the groundbreaking honest look into China. Apparently, up until that time, China, or the Orient, was poorly understood and most of the stories about it were romanticized and mystifying. Buck wrote about the China she saw, the day to day work and customs, the glory of sons to their families and the disregard to their daughters. While many parts of the story transcends time, parts of it felt obsolete and simple. Kind of like the first of anything. An original...yes. Groundbreaking...definitely. But then other books follow suit and readers have a choice of style and characters. I've read several books before that tell the chilling tale of peasant life in China. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress and Snow Flower and the Secret Fan each detail the beauty, simplicity, horror and hardship of pre and post revolutionary China. Perhaps that exposure kept me from truly loving this story. Or maybe my expectations were too high.No doubt, some of you who did read this in a class and had the opportunity to dissect it with an instructor, see what I am missing. If so...please share.Until being convinced otherwise, my opinion is that this is a great book. Definitely a classic. But not one of my favorites....more",Notes are private!,0,67,1,not set,Sep 2007,"Aug 24, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1078.The_Good_Earth

I doThis series, written by Philip Pullman, was recommended during my reading rut by Anne and I have to say that I am so glad for her recommendation. I don't think I would have picked it up, otherwise, and this was highly enjoyable reading for me.The series is called His Dark Materials, and The Golden Compass is the first book in the series. In it, the main character, Lyra, an eleven year-old girl, is introduced. Also introduced is the idea of daemons, which, while never actually explained, I'm going to describe as a kind of soul for human beings. Each person has a daemon, which is an animal who is with its person at all times and sort of reveals the mood and character of their human partner. Childrens' daemons can change, and do depending on need and situation. Lyra's daemon, Pantalaimon, changes between a moth, when Lyra is trying to hide, a lion when she's trying to intimidate someone else, and everything in between. I absolutely loved the symbolism it provided throughout the entire story.Lyra is given an alitheometer, which is a truth telling compass that, through a series of needles, point to objects symbolizing the answers to questions she asks. No adult knows how to read it, and Lyra herself seems unaware of the great gift and power she possesses. Again, lots and lots of symbolism.While this is billed as young adult fiction/fantasy, and has all of the exciting story lines that would provide hours of amusement and discovery for that age group, this plot...this idea is so complex that any adult should enjoy it. The dark materials, Dust, is viewed by some in the Church as evil, only because it is misunderstood, and therefore to be removed and destroyed. Experiments have revealed that Dust surrounds adults, but not children, and a theory is proposed that it settles only when a person's daemon becomes permanent and cannot change anymore. To test their theory, the group of researchers funded by the church, kidnap children of the poor and experiment ""cutting"" away their daemons so that this process can never happen. The children are left soulless and all die from confusion and shock.Incredible analogies, fascinating settings and fantastical characters make this series one I look forward to reading!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Aug 24, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass

I'mI picked this book up two days ago to read the first page (I personally think you can tell a lot about a book from the first page) and was hooked. I'm in the middle of another book, which is a good book, but the jarring nature of the prose reeled me in. The first chapter is called, ""What the?"" which is exactly what I was thinking. I was instantly reminded of another great book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, where you actually experience the book as well as read it. While I wouldn't want every book to be written like that, because it's a bit like riding a roller coaster in the dark with strobe lights, it sure is fun every once in a while.Jonathan Safran Foer, the author, writes the tale of a nine year old boy named Oskar Schell, whose father was in the World Trade Center when the planes flew into them on September 11th. I think its fair to say that the boy becomes extremely troubled after his father's death, but with the unconventional childhood he had, it didn't take much to push him over the edge. His father was an atheist and Oskar wasn't raised to believe in an afterlife or heaven or that people have spirits.When no body is recovered, his mother buries an empty coffin and she and Oskar have this conversation: ""It's just an empty box."" ""It's more than an empty box."" ""Why would I want to spend eternity next to an empty box?"" Mom said, ""His spirit is there,"" and that made me really angry. I told her, ""Dad didn't have a spirit! He had cells!"" ""His memory is there."" ""His memory is there,"" I said, pointing at my head. ""Dad had a spirit,"" she said, like she was rewinding a bit in our conversation. I told her, ""He had cells, and now they're on rooftops, and in the river, and in the lungs of millions of people around New York, who breathe him every time they speak!""The book also tells the story of Oskar's paternal grandparents. The narration changes when both tell their own story. When his grandmother writes, there are no paragraphs and no quotations marks. Lots of odd spacing and most sentences get their own line. She's kind of crazy herself which you know by how she reacts when watching Oskar in his school's play of Hamlet and her conversations with Oskar. Oskar's grandfather...well...that's when you really see crazy. The author uses the most license with him and parts of the book are downright bizarre. Like the eight pages with nothing on them. Or when he starts to write smaller and smaller so that two entire pages are just dark black scribbles because some many words are on top of themselves.It's more than just tricks on the page, however. The story is really about grief and how Oskar chooses to grieve for his father and how Oskar's grandparents grieved after losing much of what they loved when their city of Dresden was bombed in World War II.When Oskar finds a key in an envelope with the word ""Black"" written on it inside a vase in his parent's bedroom, he sets out to discover what it unlocks. He goes about this by finding every person with the last name of ""Black"" in the five boroughs of New York City and spends almost a year going out on the weekends to ask Aaron, Abel, Amber etc. if they know anything about the key. A few interesting characters and stories get told through this storyline, but the real beauty of this book is how it made me remember and react to the horror of 9/11 again. You kind of forget....with the War on Terror, and the Iraq War and all of the stories that have happened during the last six years how horrible it was to watch those burning buildings go down on live TV. The last 14 pages of the book are pictures Oskar got off of a Portuguese web site that had a picture of a man who had jumped from the building. He put them in reverse order and you see this body in the air going up. The wish of a nine year old boy.This book is exactly what its title says it is. Extremely and incredibly written.

The first time she time travelled, it was an accident. She travelled two-hundred years backward to the 1740s and met the love her life, Jamie Frasier, a Scottish highlander. Their love story has developed through out each of the books as Gabaldon details the historical setting that surrounds them. In The Fiery Cross, the year is 1771 and the unrest and dissatisfaction of the colonists in the New World are humming. Even though the author uses almost 1,000 pages, the story progresses less than a year through time. That's an awful lot of information, in my opinion, without anything really happening to the characters. Jamie continues to lead, Clare continues to freak out everyone by practicing 20th century medicine in the 18th century, Briana continues to nurse (I couldn't believe how often the author had to point that out to us readers. Her breasts are hardened with milk again????) and Roger continues to be a complete fish out of water. In fact, I believe this book gets read solely because it is part of a series where the reader is already attached to the main characters. Separate it from the other books, and The Fiery Cross is unnecessarily wordy and quite dull.This book came out four years after the previous book in this series, Drums of Autumn. Four years. I finished Drums of Autumn only few months ago and I was constantly confused by the many, many unimportant names of characters Gabaldon throws at her readers. Who? Is this important?Turns out, not really. My theory as to why she bothers making it so complicated is that she is trying to convince the masses that these books are much more than fantasy romance, but legitimate historical fiction. She makes her point. Gabaldon clearly has done a lot of research about the living conditions, medicinal remedies, and political atmosphere of the pre-revolutionary war colonies. She included it all and then some. Lots and lots of digression about medicine that Claire Fraser would not have learned or remembered from her med school days. They do not teach microbiology stain techniques, or pathology to the extent that she would be the expert she always ends up being. Gabaldon seems to forget that Clare was a surgeon, and since she rarely gets to do surgery, the author flaunts what she's learned about medicine elsewhere in the book and always uses Clare as her medium. I find it annoying. Clare wouldn't know all of that stuff and making her some sort of superbrain takes away from the realness of her character. Why can't Claire just be wrong...or simply not know? She's pigeonholed her greatest characters. Jamie must be uberbrave. Claire must be ubersmart. Throw in some nookie a few times and you've got your book.This took way too long for me to read. It simply wasn't very interesting. Until, of course, the very end. Around page 920, she finally threw in some of her good stuff - the time travel stuff. Genuine conflict and not just a side story that takes you somewhere for 100 pages without a purpose.
