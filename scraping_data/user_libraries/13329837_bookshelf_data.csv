WhThis book made me so grateful for all the comforts of modern life…never lacking food or water, having warmth and shelter, my loved ones being safe. What happened to the Donner Party was absolutely brutal. And it felt like a never-ending journey filled with extreme physical and emotional suffering. I would not have lasted a day in these circumstances. These people were the toughest people I’ve ever read about. It is unfathomable to me how any of them survived. I was exhausted just reading about it.That being said, they also kind of did this to themselves. Greed, nativity and desperation led them to make poor decisions. They left too late in the year. They took a “short cut” despite warnings against it. And honestly, a lot of them were terrible people. They abandoned the sick and weak to die slow deaths. They treated the Indigenous people horribly. They treated the animals horribly. If I’m being honest, I was kind of feeling like they deserved what was coming. But it was so awful, no one deserves to die in such tragic circumstances. It makes me sad that they also just seemed to have a lot of bad luck, including tons of snow, taking the wrong paths, getting lost and trusting the wrong people. I didn’t particularly like that the book was supposed about a woman named Sarah, because it ended up just being about all of them. I think the author did this to humanize them and make their stories more meaningful, but it wasn’t necessary. I appreciate all the research that went into this and I learned so much about the Oregon Trail and the time period. If one thing is certain, Hastings should have been held responsible for this tragedy and imprisoned, but he just kept up with his schemes. While this was a very bleak read, it reminded me that the will to survive is an incredible force. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 09, 2023","Apr 12, 2023","Apr 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6033525-the-indifferent-stars-above

A standout feature is Ward's exquisite prose. The book is beautifully written, with lush descriptions of the countryside and a sense of atmosphere/mood that adds to the tension and suspense of the plot. Most of the terror in this book is psychological. There are some truly disturbing and dark themes running throughout. But I disliked other parts...mainly the characters. They were vividly written and three-dimensional, but some of their decisions made me so angry that it was unpleasant to read. I don't really enjoy books about cults and this was VERY cultish. It also dragged in places. I thought I was almost finished but realized was only halfway through!The big reveal at the end was kind of disappointing because I knew what it was going to be, but I still think it was well done, and enjoyed how it was executed. Plus, there were lots of other surprises I didn't see coming.A haunting, Scottish tale that includes a lot of Celtic folklore elements (like selkies and serpents) but also shows the darker side of human nature.

Such a fun history of magic and an interesting arg“If you don’t believe in magic, no magic for you!”This was the perfect first book for the new year. Such a fun history of magic and an interesting argument for magic actually existing.I think magic is just science that we don’t understand yet. We are still in our infancy in regard to our knowledge of existence, consciousness and the universe. We still know so very little about our world and scientists are discovering things that we never thought possible. I used to be a huge skeptic and believe in nothing, but it’s impossible to really look at our existence and no be awed by it. If you read anything about space or quantum physics, it’s hard not to be amazed by the complex universe in which we live.I think there’s a much bigger link between our minds/thoughts /consciousness and our reality than we realize. The observer effect and quantum entanglement prove this. And as out-there as this book is, it’s one of the more convincing texts on the subject and I believe some of what the author is saying. You could call some of it pseudoscience I guess, but science is about having an open mind and changing your views when you’re presented with new information. It’s not about stagnation and believing the world is the way it is because that’s what we’ve always believed. Any religion, scientist or person who tells you they have the answers should never be trusted, because no has all the answers.All I know is what I’ve experienced, and this past year I’ve changed my thoughts and done a lot of affirmations, meditations and visualizations. I’ve read a lot of books that changed the way I see the world and it’s completely transformed my life. Things happened that I never thought possible and that feels pretty magical to me. “The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.” ― Eden Phillpotts...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 02, 2023","Jan 02, 2023","Dec 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35805860-real-magic

Jenette’s life was rough man, and all we saw on TV was this bubbly, happy girl.

I just preordered it because it was the new Ruth Ware. Based on the title, I thought it would be about some annoying Hollywood socialite, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it took place at Oxford college, with some scenes in a cozy little bookshop.But as much as I liked the setting, it still didn’t make up for all the little things that annoyed me, the main one being Hannah. She was such an incredibly naive character that I found myself rolling my eyes over and over. For example, she asked why April was using ADHD meds when she didn’t have ADHD. Most students know why. But things would take her over a decade to understand. And we are supposed to believe that she was not only a college student, but smart enough to get into Oxford? And Hannah was best friends with April (a bratty girl who treated everyone like shit) for such a short amount of time, yet she acted they had such a deep, incredible friendship. And gave the impression that April was a good person.Then she would prance around trying to solve mysteries and stress herself out, which was put her baby’s life in danger. And she’d argue with the nurses about it!But the worst was that I knew who the killer was waaaaaaaaaay before Hannah did and it was so infuriating. I was always screaming, “DON’T TRUST ****!

It could have been so much more magical or exciting. She was also very passive and the other characters solved her problems for her. She had no hand in the climactic action of the book.I’ve read several dark Peter Pan retellings where Peter is more of a villain, and he’s definitely the bad guy in this one. But even in the original story, I never liked Peter. He was always bratty and mischievous, and I always rooted for Captain Hook, so I can easily make the leap to him being a predator.

There was a ton of information, but most of it was just about what Jim Jones did with his “church” and how it functioned. I didn’t find it particularly interesting, except for the fact that the Peoples Temple actually did some good things for the world before becoming corrupt.It read like a long article. I wish it had gone more into the psychology of Jim Jones and his followers. It was very emotionless for a book on such a devastating tragedy. But you can see how his followers were slowly pulled into this cult and manipulated, how it could happen to anyone at a vulnerable time in their lives. Jim Jones offered hope to the poor and downtrodden, which was exactly how he became so influential. I hate him and the people that stood by his side, even when they knew about his lies and manipulation.I could have skipped this one.

She takes a controversial “back and white” topic and makes it as gray as possible. Next, she pops a shocking, often tragic, event at the end and BAM, Jodi Picoult book. This one was worse than the others I’ve read. The characters were unbearable, except maybe Amelia. Charolette was insufferable and I didn’t have any empathy for her. She was so selfish, I wanted to slap her. Then the author felt the need to make Willow extremely intelligent and precocious, as if this would make her seem more like she had a right to live…as if just being a normal girl with a disability wasn’t enough. Amelia’s eating disorder side story felt poorly researched (you don’t have eroded pipes after just weeks of someone throwing up continuously). Amelia basically says she just wanted attention and they send her off to treatment and everything is fixed. That’s not how things work…It also drove me crazy how the book was written in second person addressed to Willow. Plus, Charolette was a cook, so there were elaborate recipes sprinkled throughout the book. It was obvious they were supposed to be metaphoric, but they were just boring and pointless. It was all very annoying. And the ending was just as ridiculous as the plot. I was so glad when it was over.I loved The Pact, and My Sister’s Keeper was okay, but I don’t know if I’ll read another book by this author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 24, 2022","Mar 28, 2022","Mar 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3720975-handle-with-care

The writing was great and had a dream-like quality about it. I enjoyed the literary tone and the slow-burn mystery.On the other hand, the characters felt too far away to feel any empathy for them. We didn’t really get to know them well enough to be sad/happy for how they ended up. And the mystery part of the story was very predictable…but that could also be because I’ve read so many similar stories and have a tendency to guess endings.The last 10-15% of the book felt off to me for some reason, like it didn’t quite fit, and as though the author were trying to invoke deep emotion in the reader, which I couldn’t feel because the characters weren’t fleshed-out enough.Lastly, I want to mention that I listened to this instead of reading it, and the narrator spoke in an extremely stilted/choppy style, so much so that I had to slow it down because it was hard to understand (I usually listen to books at faster speeds). I don’t think this was due to the writing, but maybe partly? I wanted to mention it.Anyway, this might be something you’d like if you enjoyed The Secret History, The Likeness, If We We’re Villains, or other books of that style. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 15, 2022","Mar 15, 2022","Mar 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50403527-before-the-ruins

I’m incredibly fascinated and disturbed by the amount of people that go missing in our forests and national parks.The author actually spoke a lot of David Paulides and his research and even said David was upset with him for how he portrayed some of the info in his book.This book hit close to home because I’ve lived in the states many of these cases took place, known some of the people involved, been to these parks, and the places they were discussed. Also, being a runner who loves trail running, this made me very uneasy.While I loved all the info, and knew a lot about the cases in this book, I feel like this was written more like a long article. It definitely wasn’t anything special in the writing department. It felt kind of all over the place with the other stories, but always came back to Jacob Gray’s case. I thought it was cool that the author actually went out on searches with the families and friends of the missing. But the one thing that impacted me most was the absolute love that Randy Gray had for his son, Jacob. This man went to the ends of the earth looking for him, remained positive, treated everyone he met with kindness. He is absolutely amazing and I wish his story could have had a happy ending.

Witches, dark academia, girls who read the classic horror works of Shirley Jackson and Daphne du Maurier, hauntings, a private school in the woods, secret societies, an unreliable narrator… For the first half of the book, I was vibing SO hard with the story…just absolutely loving everything about it! But then it lost a bit of steam about halfway through. It got more repetitive and far-fetched. And while I still enjoyed it, I liked it less as it went on.Like…this was supposedly a high school and not one staff member enforced any kind of rule. These girls drank nightly in the common room, smoked inside, had sex, and…ya know, occasionally committed murder…without any consequences whatsoever. It was laughable. This is also one of those YA books where the characters act more like they are college age or older, rather then teens. I almost wonder why this was written as YA. But that being said, I enjoyed it more than a lot of other YA out there.For whatever reason, I found the build up to be better than the ending. I was hoping for something more surprising and unexpected. It also could have been a lot scarier.But if you’re like me and enjoy slow-burn, academic stories with an atmospheric setting, you should definitely read this one....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 18, 2021","Oct 22, 2021","Oct 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50999821-a-lesson-in-vengeance

Jane was an interesting character, a girl who had major anger issues and loved books so much she ate them. Literally. The setting of rural Maine in the fall, made it the perfect autumn read and set the stage for all the spooky events that followed. I liked how a lot of the book focused on the grief of losing a loved one. It was discussed in a thoughtful way that many people should be able to relate to, I know I did. There were a few things that bothered me, like toward the end when Jane doesn’t understand a very obvious fact. And the ending was super abrupt, but I guess I kind of liked the ambiguousness of it. Not having all the answers makes it creepier.Overall, it was a short, spooky, atmospheric book that I really enjoyed....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 10, 2021","Sep 12, 2021","Sep 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358142-horrid

I started this around Thanksgiving and have been reading it ever since. I thought it would never end.When I first started the book, I was pleasantly surprised. I loved everything about it. And because I went into it without reading the synopsis, I was excited to find that it was about Dracula. In fact, this book felt very similar to Dracula by Bram Stoker.I loved the traveling, the history, Oxford, and learning more about Vlad the Impaler. There were stories within stories within stories.But I have to admit, it was sooo long and parts of it could be extremely slow. Occasionally, I would zone out and not really pay attention to what was happening. It dragged on and on and on. I think huge chunks could have been removed. If you’re looking for something with dark academia vibes and the history of Dracula, I’d definitely recommend this…as long as you don’t mind a very slow burn with lots of backstory and historical information.

Are there actually people out there who let their best friends control their relationships and, ultimately, their lives? Are their people out there who would cover up murder for a bff? I get that Emily didn’t have a lot of family, but she acted like Kristen was THE ONLY person she had. And Kristen was the worst. Anyway, I did appreciate how the author made me feel what it was like to be in Emily’s position and all the absolute dread and fear that came along with it. I felt constant anxiety throughout the story.But although this was entertaining, I wished there were more twists.

It was mildly entertaining and started out promising, but I hated all the people and was rooting for the monsters.Small spoilers ahead….Within two/three days of being stuck in a grocery store, there is a murder, suicides, a cult forming and a sex scene. Right…that escalated quickly. But the sex is what pissed me off the most. This guy leaves his wife at home, where she may or may not be dead but is definitely in mortal danger, while he is stuck at the store with his son. Within hours he finds himself intensely attracted to a woman and they go have sex in the office. Are you kidding me? Men are the worst. And then later when they all escape he doesn’t even try to save his wife. Wtf?????I’m honestly sick of reading stories about mediocre men becoming heroes.

She has such a way with words. But I know this won’t be for everyone. Many of her books explore VERY dark themes, but they’re often hidden at first, wrapped in girly, pink paper and glitter, in which the reader must remove to see the truth underneath.This book was the perfect metaphor for the ballet. Everything looks sparkly and beautiful on the outside, but inside there is pain, denial and heartache. Growing up taking dance, I’ve experienced a bit of that world.I’m not squeamish or easily disturbed when it comes to books, but I have to say there were some scenes that made me very uncomfortable, and my discomfort rose the further I got.

It’s a character-driven novel that almost reminds me of a warped Catcher in the Rye in a lot of ways. Jade is very strongly written, like Holden Caulfield. And a lot of the narration is a stream-of-consciousness type style.But if you love the horror genre, and slasher films in particular, you should definitely read this.I loved this book because of the way it explored trauma and abuse, and the way it used metaphor.Jade is such an odd girl, someone I probably would be afraid of in real life, but I LOVED her so much. Her dark humor helped her survive the world, and she was so lovable, despite how much she pushed people away.

She repeated herself ad nauseum and the foreshadowing was over-the-top. You could see the end coming a mile away.I think this was supposed to be a “girl power!” type book, which is cool, but all the men were ominous and creepy. The things they said felt very juvenile, like what someone very young would interpret as bad behavior. But then again, this was written for young adults. Unfortunately, it was laughably cliche. I also didn’t understand the main character’s extreme fear of men. There was no explanation or backstory for that.

Let’s start off with the fact that there is a serial killer murdering college students, and the killer just murdered Charlie’s roommate. What does Charlie do? She decides to get a ride home with a complete stranger. That’s right, a man she doesn’t even know...because she can’t wait for a ride from her boyfriend. In what world would anyone do this with a murderer on the loose????Then we find out Charlie sees movies in her mind when she stops taking her meds. She’s done this ever since her parents died and she watched movies to cope with the trauma. Okaaay, right. Are we talking schizophrenia or what? How are you even surviving at life right now, if you don’t even know what’s real, Charlie? Anyway, on we go into this story where everything that happens is absolutely ridiculous and extremely far-fetched.After thinking the guy giving her a ride is the campus killer, and being absolutely terrified that he’s going to kill her next, she suddenly decides to be brave, like a sassy siren from an old movie. She’s at a diner, a cop comes, she can finally get away from this guy, but suddenly she wants revenge for her roommate and she GETS BACK IN THE CAR WITH HIM. WTF?I’m sorry, Charlie, but you’re the dumbest character I’ve ever read.Then a lot of drama ensues and Charlie is kidnapped and it’s so unbelievable that I could hardly stand it. Then at the end, Charlie no longer sees movies in her mind because her life is “finally better than a movie”...because you know, mental illness just goes away when you want it to. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 08, 2021","Jul 08, 2021","Jul 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55628983-survive-the-night

I loved the elements of childhood imagination mixed with the dark and disturbing. It reminded me of another book that did this well, The Lonely Hearts Hotel. But it also reminded me of Peter Pan in a way.Mirrorland brought back memories of the games we used to play as kids involving pirates, dark forces and sailing the seas. It made me very nostalgic.It’s amazing how children can create magic in the most dire of circumstances.This was a VERY slow burn, and a bit confusing at first, but worth sticking with until the end.

Not a single thing in this story was plausible, even for fiction. It was just stupid. The first half was boring teenage school stuff, and the second half was a continuous gory bloodbath. There was absolutely no suspense. Was I supposed to care about all these teenagers that got killed when they were bratty, one-dimensional characters that only existed to be murdered?And the generational discourse was so annoying. I felt like I was watching dumb TikTok videos with Boomers and Gen-Z complaining about each other.My brain just zoned out for the entire last half because, despite way too much action, it was boring.

I guess that’s plausible (???), but I hated it. I also hated the writing. All the author did was list things off for the entire book or explain boring details about making crap (hence the title lol) and none of it was done in a particularly interesting or beautiful way.Then there were all these creepy religions, weird cults.

It was sad to know how much she struggled and yet inspiring to hear her speak so honestly about her mental struggles and the trauma she experienced.

I especially found the willpower budgeting part helpful, along with learning to change your actions to change your thoughts/feelings. And how we should treat mental issues like physical injuries, and attend to them right away and with the same care. I think this would have been even better had I read it when I was younger.

Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara did such an incredible job. But I feel like the book didn’t have the same magic to it.For the most part, it was dull and the characters quite unlikeable. Richard was horrid. Carol was pretty awful most of the time, and Therese was like a puppy dog that would do anything for Carol, no matter how she was treated.

It still was a bit irritating though.It’s a sad story of injustice and how badly people were treated for having a different sexual orientation, but I loved the ending. And I loved it even more in the film.

I mean, she was obviously a shady person and very unlikeable, but I don’t feel like she weaseled her way into the Speyer family like it hinted at.I appreciated how the relationships she had with men represented her struggle, Roux being her past life and everything that she was trying to bury and overcome, and Gideon being the new “American dream” life that she had longed for since childhood. One represented who she was and the other, who she wanted to be.She wanted that American life so badly that she ignored her nagging feelings of discontent and her growing suspicion that things weren’t right. In the end, she buried her past and moved forward with her dream, only to realize it wasn’t what she thought. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 23, 2021","Jan 27, 2021","Nov 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892388-white-ivy

But it does the book an injustice because it gives readers very lofty expectations, which, for me, it didn’t meet.I loved the premise of a Buddhist girls’ school high in the mountains. And I loved that the girls were obsessed with learning how to levitate. It was also interesting learning more about Buddhism and different religious practices.But it took me forever to get through this. The story just didn’t retain my attention. It was extremely slow and the daily lives of students didn’t interest me, especially because I didn’t like any of them. I also didn’t care about Olivia’s backstory whatsoever. The writing was good, but I only enjoyed the last 25% of the book.

But unfortunately, it just wasn’t that good.I’m new to the cozy mystery genre so I’m not sure how alike they all are or what to expect, but the writing felt elementary, the mystery wasn’t interesting, and the characters were irritating. There was almost no suspense at all.A lot of the book went on about coworker relationships and doing menial tasks at work. Which sucks because the setting was awesome and could have been so much more fun and interesting.I actually only finished this because I started it awhile ago. It had some fun Halloween vibes though.EDIT: I keep thinking about the setting and how cozy it was, so I will probably keep reading the series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 08, 2021","Oct 08, 2021","Sep 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34507290-death-overdue

I wouldn’t recommend it if you are struggling or easily triggered.What I liked about this book is that, although it did recount the teenage experience, it also showed how her eating disorder carried on all the way into mid-life and explained that she was still struggling. Too often we read about the teen girl’s experience and then it’s all wrapped up in a nice bow at the end “I got better and never struggled again” when the reality is that many people will struggle with the disorder throughout their lives and every single day they must make the conscience decision to choose recovery.I deeply related to this book as someone who has cycled between bulimia and anorexia throughout my lifetime. There is no magic pill to make things better. This wasn’t the most horrifying account of an ED that I’ve read, but it made me think over my own experience and how lucky I am to be alive and to have lived through the things I put my body through. I loved the end where she talked about the ED voice like a soundtrack and instead of deleting the ED voice, she could only turn the volume down and turn up the volume of the other tracks. The ED voice will always be there but it doesn’t have to be the loudest.I think there is always a danger in writing about eating disorders because often they seem to be romanticized, but that’s the problem. Eating disorders, like anorexia, seduce the suffers’ minds with lies and feelings of perfection and euphoria, so it’s almost impossible to write about these disorders without conveying that. But Susan was very careful not to share numbers or “tips” throughout her writing and I think she did the best she could while still expressing the way she felt....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Mar 2021,"Mar 05, 2021","Jul 31, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/52628185-empty

I hate how the police (and society in general) treat sex workers, like they’re not even human beingsThis is such an infuriating and frustrating case. I hate how the police (and society in general) treat sex workers, like they’re not even human beings, like they deserve what they get. They are one of the most vulnerable populations and the most likely to be murdered. Many women do it because they have few options. They often come from poverty, abusive homes, bad relationships, etc.So it makes me incredibly mad when the police seemingly didn’t care that much, and then botched the case. Or covered something up….There is no way Shannan wasn’t murdered. She was an escort who called 911 in fear of her life, in an area where they found the bodies of other escorts, and the police have the audacity to rule it as an accident by misadventure! I listened the the 911 call. Even if she was on drugs, she had the clarity of mind to call for help and run to neighboring houses. The fact that there are no suspects makes no sense. I would be furious if I was her family.I think there are multiple guilty people and I definitely think Hackett is partly responsible, at the very least, a huge liar.This was a (somewhat) wealthy community’s word against the word of escorts and impoverished families. Of course it’s still unsolved.Anyway, this book did a great job of humanizing the victims and delving into their lives, but there wasn’t a whole lot about the case itself. I wanted to know more, but because it’s unsolved, maybe they couldn’t share anything else.

I was close friends/roommates with three students that were at Columbine during the shooting. I remember my friend recounting that day and crying. She said, ""Dylan and Eric weren't bullied, they were just mean kids."" After that, she told me how everyone at school was constantly afraid, how they would drink and get high during lunch breaks just to get through the day. And the effects of the shooting lasted so much longer than the day they took place. My roommates were always going home for funerals of people that died in accidents or by suicide. It really did feel like Columbine was cursed. This book was the most in-depth thing I've ever read about the tragedy. I really enjoyed how much the author shared about all the victims and who they were as people. Cullen also debunked the myths that the media spread about bullying and killing jocks, and he treated the killer's parents with empathy and not blame. It's weird because so many shootings have happened since Columbine, but there is still a fascination with this one. So many killers have emulated and idolized Dylan and Eric and it's absolutely horrifying that we live in a society like this.I remember being a kid in school, learning that we are never safe, even in places that should be a haven from the outside world.
