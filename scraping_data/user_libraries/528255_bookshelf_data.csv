In all his novels he shines his own brand of lamplight on the beautiful edges of the average life. One of my students once asked me why Haruf is one of my favorite authors, why I've read all of his novels with such devotion, because, he said, ""Nothing much happens in them."" I told him I disagreed. Everything happens in them - he's like Richard Russo in the way he's able to capture how wide and challenging and full of heartbreak a normal life is...how each specific life is shaped by sadness and joy and love and loss.

I will be ordering all her other ones. I connected to this novel in a deeply powerful way, both because of her rich voice and writing but also because she writes with such clear-eyed observation of the human experience. I ordered The Interestings because for some reason I'm drawn to novels that examine friendship in the teen years, the choices we make in the teen years, and how these friendships and choices play out over a lifetime. Wolitzer does this for a group of six friends who one year at a teenage arts camp label themselves, ""The Interestings"" in that (sort of) ironic way teenagers do when they are ambitious and smart and have too much time on their hands, when their dreams still feel rich and full but they're a bit shy about admitting they're thinking about the future already (and that it scares them).This is a beautiful novel about friendship, love, ambition, about the arts, about what we loved when we were young and why this doesn't always translate to a fulfilling adult life. And it's also about how, when we let ourselves, we can decide to reinvent (or re-reinvent) ourselves should the need arise....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,not set,"May 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15815333-the-interestings

This book feels alive and wholly original, examining what it is to be connected while at the same time exploring the things that keep us separated.

I'm so grateful for that connection (because life, after all, is simply made up of connections). It's not just the premise that makes me think of MAX: a day in the life of a teenage girl who misses a flight, meets a boy, and has her life altered. It's also the sensibility of this book that I responded to - the sweet optimism of this novel that made me fall in love at first read. Hadley's had some pain in her life (a divorce) and she's dreading her trip to London for her dad's wedding to a woman she's never met, has never wanted to meet, after her dad abruptly left Hadley and her mother for a teaching job and new life in Oxford. However, Hadley misses her flight (a mere four minutes late) and winds up on a later flight where she meets Oliver, a boy who will change her. This novel acts as a reminder that love changes shape and it's our responses to those changes that dictate our futures. It's our attitude and view of things that paint the picture of our lives. There is a simplicity in this novel, and I mean that in a wholly positive way, because it argues for the sheer importance, the power, of optimism in our lives. And that's a view I fall in love with over and over again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 07, 2012",not set,"Jan 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10798416-the-statistical-probability-of-love-at-first-sight

It's the story of an ordinary boy who has an extraordinary day.For Max McTrue, life is not mysterious. He simply does what he’s told and that path has served him well, has been easy and free of conflict. He’s a good kid. 3.04 grade point average, plays football and baseball, has membership in a couple of school clubs. He’s not much of a blip on anyone’s radar, a fact he has wholly embraced for all of his seventeen years.  Until one winter day when all that changes.  That cold February 1st morning at Java Jewel, the café he works in before school, Max meets Clara Jane Ramsey. But Max doesn’t know any of this yet. In fact, he sees her only briefly and then goes to class where the only thing (he thinks) of interest is the fact that his student teacher in Senior English has opted to not wear a bra that day. Sitting in class, with three thick college application folders on the desk in front of him (college applications he has until five o’clock that day to mail), he sees Clara Jane out toward the baseball field, and for reasons he certainly cannot explain to himself, he raises his hand to ask for the pass, gathers his things, and joins her. Clara Jane is homeschooled and her family is on the last day of their motor-home stop through the small foothill town that is the setting of the novel. Max spends the day with Clara Jane (turns out, her lost dog is part of a treasure hunt her dad sets up for her as the “assessment” portion of that week’s studies). Along the way Clara Jane meets Emerson, Max’s best friend who is on Home Hospital for her allergies, has perfect SAT scores, and drives a converted ice cream truck that holds her archery equipment and a portable reading library of used titles. And then there’s Darcy, Max’s on again off again – he’s never quite sure – girlfriend, who puts a slight crimp in the clearly romantic tension that has been building. Clara Jane and Max explore each other’s own longings and trappings and ideas. About what it means to learn, what it means to love something, and what it means to seek something. Eventually, the three packets Max has been hauling around become an issue. Why doesn’t he just send them? The Liberation of Max McTrue is the story of a single, crucial day. After seventeen years of a lovely albeit noncommittal existence, Max grabs the reins to his own life.Check it out if you get a chance :)...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Dec 09, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/13181001-the-liberation-of-max-mctrue

His first novel Please Don't Come Back from the Moon is one of those novels I recommend to, well, everyone I know. My American Unhappiness is a different novel (love when authors evolve!); it's a bit more broad, a bit more seasoned, but it is still Bakopoulos' same observational genius and heart. I loved it so very much. It's the first novel in a long time where I simply had to stop and underline certain lines (okay, whole paragraphs) because I felt so connected to the sensibility in this novel. It was just so damn funny and heartbreaking. It's bursting with intelligence, humor and heart. Perhaps, though, what I loved most about it is that it is driven by this complicated mess of a main character (oh how I love me some messy main characters!) who in his intellectual pursuit of American unhappiness is spotlighting his own arc of unhappiness. Zeke is guilty of many things but perhaps the sweetest is that he is simply guilty of being a romantic in an unromantic world, a dreamer in a cynical, bleary world. I imagine him the wild yellow poppy in a sea of green. Well, okay, a sort of perverted yellow poppy with an alcohol problem and visions of grandeur. But still beautiful, still bright. And I loved Minn, his barista dream girl. Her defense of why working at Starbuck's *is* an extension of her major in anthropology and rural sociology is priceless. There is an incredible mind at play in this novel, one with a great love for the humanities, for what they mean to our country. Through Zeke (and his outlandish fantasy world) Bakopoulos explores the whole idea of what it means to need our lives to *mean* something. What does one's education *mean*? What is it for? I believe it's about creating a lens through which to view this ridiculous world of ours. Zeke seems too as well.As W.H. Auden said, ""The aim of writing poetry is to enable readers a little better to enjoy life or a little better to endure it.""

Also, I will just say for the record that some of the content was a bit, um, much for me. Some of the obscenity (and he does this for a clear reason, I think) was hard to read (a lot of sexual darkness in this book). I don't like to read about underbellies and there is quite a bit of raw underbelly in this book. So I would stay away for a few days and then come back. But I'm ridiculously sensitive so this was my issue. The thing about this book is that there is pure genius at play here. And genius is messy. It's complicated. It's hard to follow sometimes. But at the end of it, I was left thoroughly impressed with this writer and the little world he built that is really a bigger world than it appears (which is one of his many points so that was cool). I'm teaching Lord of the Flies right now in my English class so this was such a great pairing with that book - boys in a boarding school, power struggles, horrible behavior, bullying...it was a tie in for sure. Skippy Dies is told through multiple perspectives and I found myself more drawn in to some POVs (Howard's) than others (Carl's). Again, not a bad thing. Overall, though, this book was just full of lines I felt compelled to write down on sticky notes all over my house - always a sign of a good book (and great brain behind the book). Here is one of many jewels: ""Life makes fools of us all sooner or later. But keep your sense of humor and you'll at least be able to take your humiliations with some measure of grace. In the end, you know, it's our own expectations that crush us.""

I really like the teenagers in this book (though I would have liked to see one of the kids have a better relationship with their parents...but that wasn't the story Stabiner chose to write). I really liked the private school/public school glimpses and especially connected to the family of Nora, Joel and Lauren.

They put them on to impress the person behind them at the traffic light."" It reminded me of a private client's parent I had a looooooong time ago who told me, ""I really don't care where he wants to go, I want a Cornell sticker for my car"" (One of the defining moments for me changing my geography).

The voice is really unique and the scenes with Louis (the young gentleman) and Harrison (the extra man) are really like glittering jewels. Harrison is so much fun and I often laughed out loud while reading at some of their scenes. And it didn't hurt that Kevin Kline will be playing him in the film and is on the cover of my version as he is pitch perfect casting for this character. I loved how the tone of the novel, the ""young gentleman about Manhattan"" in the spirit of some classic novels, contrasted with the rather seedy nature of some of Louis' pursuits. Also, his sexual confusion was both dear and so very awkward. I really loved him and just wanted him to be happy - grab that transsexual and find love, young man!, I wanted to scream while reading. Still, I thought some of the, shall we say, 'sexier' parts of the novel actually went on a bit long. But I think that was just me wanting to get back to more scenes between Louis and Harrison.

Somehow, there's a radio station tuned just to us. These kind of books make me smile a bunch, mostly because so many of the observations from the characters are observations I've made, so many of the characters do things or think things I've done and thought. Nick Hornby has always been this kind of author for me. Reading his novels for me feels cozy and safe and I know I'll laugh out loud (something I don't take for granted much anymore). Nick Hornby, like Jonathan Tropper, writes broken, sweet and funny characters. They are real and ordinary. They are not large characters - no spies, no world-trotting professors or movie stars. Even his (former) rock star in Tucker Crowe is middle-aged and concerned with school pick-up and prefers reading Dickens in the quiet of his own home. Hornby, like always, has a cool concept but not a huge plot (for the record, I love that about him). He creates interesting, often down on their luck characters and then sets about making us love them not because they heal or do grand things but mostly because they muddle through and this, somehow, charms me. In Juliet, Naked, Hornby gets back to his musical roots (this one I loved in the way I loved High Fidelity all those years ago), but in this novel, there's a wiser, older Hornby at play. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 16, 2010","Oct 21, 2010","Sep 16, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6224826-juliet-naked

We find our own niche, our own story, our own loss, love, joy. McCann must have twelve different point of views and each is rendered pure and clear.

I watchThe first thing I have to say about this book is that I applaud this author, I admire her so much, for what she is trying to do in this novel. I watched her S&S interview and heard how she felt that so much of the fiction coming out of MFA programs were ""small novels"" - ""domestic"" - and how she wanted to write about something larger, something with more scope. This novel has been criticized for being too ambitious - too many characters, too many story lines, etc. But I think it's sad that ambition is something she would be criticized for as I think it's something she should be applauded for. A Fortunate Age was large in scope, it was broad and dealt with so many characters and so many stories and did, on a grand, level succeed as a portrait of my generation and some of our struggles - particularly in her setting of New York City. I do have to admit, though, that I've grown a tad weary of the ""New York is the most wonderful, complicated, interesting place in the world"" novel - I've mentioned that before in my s, mostly because I don't agree with that sentiment. But there is much in Rakoff's novel that is universal for those of us who moved to small towns, or other cities, or wherever. This novel was slow starting to me; I felt a bit lost at sea in it initially - though perhaps that was the way the characters were all feeling - but it took me awhile to get into it. Still, this is a complaint nowadays - no one is patient enough for novels anymore. And, I am really glad that I stayed with the book because it really ended up grabbing me and making me think and making me care about these people. I related to many of them and was certainly interested in all of them. And like any ensemble piece, I had my favorites and those I wish she'd spent less time on (but that's just because I would have liked an entire novel on Sadie - I loved her so much!) But I guess that would have been a small novel and that's not what the author wanted to do.Ultimately, I know how hard it is to write a first novel and I really think Rakoff is an author to watch - I look forward to reading anything else of hers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 12, 2009","Jul 04, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4052110-a-fortunate-age
