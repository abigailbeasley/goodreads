Not really to follow the story itself, but more to keep track of the characters. The basic gist of The Forgotten Garden is that you're following three different characters, in three different times, down one storyline.As fun, genuine, and engrossing as the book was there was nothing super remarkable about it. The characters, quite frankly, are typical and nothing special. The story, a bit different from what's currently out there, bordered on predictability - things meant to come as a surprise weren't very surprising. Morton's writing was actually really good at transporting you to the various locations we venture too. I felt she gave more life to the places and things rather than the people. There was also a certain fluidity that keeps the reader engaged.I think The Forgotten Garden is a vacation book. Something to take along and read on your downtime to relax even further.

That's the best way to summarize why I loved this book, and why, despite practically **spoiler alert** A true gripping, classic, gothic horror novel. That's the best way to summarize why I loved this book, and why, despite practically thriving on scary stories growing up, this still had me scared to turn my lights out when going to bed. It's not so much of a jump-out-at-you or gorey type of horror, it's,a s I've said, a gothic type horror with multiple tense moments and your imagination running wild. It's exactly what the characters are going through.You do have to give this book some time, though, when starting up. It's a very slow and gradual build up, full of lengthy, but beautiful, descriptions and narratives. In the beginning there's a lot more normalcy with just a tiny dash of the oddness that will later come in full force. The slow build combined with that normalcy creates the base a solid momentum to make the scary happenings absolutely terrifying. That's why I tell you to stick through the beginning, it will lend you a false sense of security, but fall into it if you want to actually be scared. Waters' flowing, realistic and steady narrative also lends a huge hand to the creeping fear and heart-pounding terror, because it makes you think and see this all really happening. To me, there's nothing scarier than the idea that something so creepy could very well be real.The only real downside I had with the book was that right near the end of the book the story sort of drifted and lost my attention. Thinking back on it now I could see it as Waters luring her readers back into that safe bubble they had been in at the beginning, thus allowing them to be completely caught off guard by what I'd call a second (and startling) climax. Still, it caused the book, which had built up such good speed, to lose that momentum. One thing I should warn some potential readers about, and this is where the spoiler I warned you about comes in (highlight to read): is that there is a rather unnerving dog death in the book. It is neccessary to the plot (at least in my opinion), but as an animal lover I was really, really disturbed by the situation leading up to and causing the dog's death. The death is far from violent, but it's the reason behind the death that could disturb you as much as it did me. I just wanted to give other animal lovers a heads up, especially if you can't even go near anything dealing with an animals death.If you're looking for a good, classic and creepy read The Little Stranger is definitely a book you should investigate. Let me reiterate, it's not a Stephen King type scary, nor is it a gratuitous violence type scary. It is a classic, Edgar Allan Poe, messes with your mind, bump in the night type scary. Waters perfectly captures that fear we all feel when we're home, alone in the house at night, and every dark corner holds something secret, menacing, sinister... a little stranger....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 11, 2010","Jul 16, 2010","Jun 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7234875-the-little-stranger

It's a touching, raw, emotional, true story that everyone should read. My critique for the book is not going to be about story or characters because I can't critique those. Rather this will pay closer attention to Ackerman's writing and presentation of these actual people and events.There was something about Ackerman's writing that just rubbed me the wrong way. I guarantee others have and will read this book and adore her style. She has a certain rambling disconnect at times. There were moments when the subject seemed to drift to something completely different mid-sentence. Sometimes she'd suddenly distance herself from the subject matter, not going into detail or further explanation, which was out of place with her typically staying right in the thick of it. The worst was really the rambling, though. For example, at one point she goes on for nearly two solid pages listing all the different types of bugs in this massive collection. Yes, maybe she was highlighting the enormity and meticulous care that went into the collection, but I found it unneccessary and took away from the story.Ackerman also went in the direction I refer to as ""embellished non-fiction"" where she over describes certain things like looks, thoughts, feelings, actions, etc. that we can't very well say happened for certain. She clearly has done extensive research and does her best to keep all dialogue straight from the actual person's mouth. But the ""embellished"" part clashed with the hard facts Ackerman provides the reader, disrupting the flow of the story slightly.One last odd thing was the slip then switch in the narrative voice near the end. It randomly goes from 3rd person to 1st person. I've seen (read?) it done in some fiction novels as a gimmick, but never in a non-fiction historical recount. Like I said- a bit strange.Honestly, though, all that stuff is nothing compared to the story being told. I was able to pass by all my qualms and issues with Ackerman's writing because I wanted to keep going. I don't know why we had never heard about the Zabinski's before and the amazing things they did. Thanks to Ackerman their story is now out at large for the world to hear and share.So ignore my critique, ignore my grade, and read The Zookeeper's Wife....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 30, 2010","Jul 03, 2010","Jun 30, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3302985-the-zookeeper-s-wife

Everything about this book was crafted in such raw reality no matter where you were in the book you saw it, felt it, smelt it, lived it. The characters were all real and utterly flawed, and their situations just as much. Honestly, there isn't really anything to complain about this book.I have to encourage you though: stick through the beginning of the book. It has a very slow start and can initially be slightly boring and long-winded, but stick through it, it's completely worth it in the end. The slow build up actually helped the story and helped bring the main characters to life. Someone asked me if the book was a true story or a work of fiction and I actually had to stop and think about it for a moment. Certain situations are described with such clarity and detail that I wouldn't have been surprised if they actually had taken place. And unfortunately with the bombing of England during WWII, it's pretty likely Levy didn't really need to stretch her imagination and writing. It's also unfortunate and frustrating to know that the racial prejudice rampant throughout the story is also very reflective of history.I can't say anything more about this book. Just that- it was amazing. Upon the halfway point I had trouble putting the book down. Levy's research, writing, characters, story, places... everything was brilliantly combined to create a unique and beautiful novel.

It combines the story of families affected by the Salem witch trials, with a historical, research-type mystery and just comes out with a fantastic, hard-to-put-down, fun read.The Salem witch trials have been told again and again and again, and as fascinating as I find them, a unique story about them is hard to come by. But Katherine Howe proved it can be done and takes the trials in a completely different direction. What if there were actual witches being persecuted? What if witchcraft is real? What if science and religion are both right? Katherine explores all of these questions and gives interesting, if not slightly far-fetched but fun, answers.The only slight flaw with the book was that it was slow to develop and then everything suddenly happens all at once and is finished really fast. I guess I felt there should have been a bit more from the end because we were given so much in the beginning. I also found that the supposedly mysterious antagonist was not a mystery and was easily found out before the big reveal. But other than that I found Howe's writing very enjoyable. Her characters were fairly well developed, her descriptions beautiful, the story well thought out and interesting, and her research and attention to detail very impeccable.Overall a fun and interesting read.

She hands them over to me giving me a brief summary of them and then her opinion. This one came with only the same summary and opinion of, ""It's pretty much what it looks like."" Basically, a classier, slightly better written version of your dime store romance novel. And it was that. There's nothing really to rave about with Mistress of Rome but there's nothing to criticise either.Quinn does a good job of transporting the reader to Rome and keeping them there. I didn't feel at all her writing was pushing too modern of an edge at all. And for the most part her writing was well done and polished, but again nothing to rave about. The characters were all right, most of them developed enough to keep you intrigued. The only character I did have a problem with, and also what I found to be the biggest problem with the book was our main villianess Lepida Pollia. She was one demensional and just mean to be mean and cruel. A main character thrown in there to create conflict and no other reason why. There were superficial reasons given for her cruelty, but no deeper meaning behind the characters drive for destruction. I like my villians to be well-developed, it always makes for a much, much more interesting story.I applaud Quinn for keeping the writing and tone of the novel classy. There were many situations presented that could take the story down a vulgar rode, both with sexual exploits and gratuitous violence, but she confronts each with sensitivity for a reader that could be easily offended, but indulge the reader that wants a little more. A careful balance that proves Quinn does have plenty of skill as a writer, and I think she can really only grow in her future works (this was her first novel).I'd consider Mistress of Rome a fun vacation read. Pack it in a suitcase, read a chapter or two on the beach or before going to bed after a busy day. It's not a book that requires a lot of attention or focus. Characters flit in and out, the writing is solid enough to follow, but not so intricate as to force you to think a lot. It is a generally good read, thus the C+ grade. Like I said, just nothing to really rave about. I will probably check out Kate Quinn again though.

Not just because it was so good, but because if I waited any longer she may not remember it amongst all the other books she's reading and then not be able to talk about it in nearly as much depth as she wants too. Thank you, Mom. Of all the wonderful books I've read this year, I have to say that this one has nestled into the top five.I was a little edgy at first, as I'm sure most people were and are about reading this book, to know that two out of the three main characters are black and the author is a white woman. Were their voices going to come across as unrealistic, stereotypical, and affected? Within a page my doubts were gone. Every voice, black or white, that spoke in this novel was a real person. Stockett's author's note gives the impression that two characters were based on her own maid growing up and our third leading lady was a reflection of Kathryn herself. But despite the real inspirations, there was still a lot of Stockett's own skill as a writer coming through to make these characters their own; fully developed and multi-demensional. Even bit players that graced only a few pages were real to me.Gripping is the best word to describe the novel. By the final chapters there was no way I could put it down. I needed to know what the final outcome for Minny, Aibileen and Skeeter was going to be. I don't think I've felt my heart pound and my stomach clench as much, even when reading an action book. The whole time I was placed right in the thick of things, and even though Stockett doesn't quite go into detail describing people and places most of the time, I could still see everything down to the last tea cozy in Miss Walter's house. She gives the reader freedom in seeing things the way they want.It's an upsetting read too. It's outrageous to read what blacks in the south had to live with every day. The segregation, hatred, laws, etc. What's so upsetting is that Stockett didn't have to make it up. All those laws and attitudes actually existed, and unfortunately still exist today. There will always be Hilly Holbrooks to varying degress out there, that we will still have to fight against. Speaking of Hilly Holbrook- she will be a new character to add to your most vile characters in existence list. We all have that list in our heads. And as much as you will hate her, she's one of the main things that will keep you reading the story.Actually, there are a lot of things that will keep you reading this book. From wonderful beginning, to exciting middle, to absolutely perfect end, this book takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions.

I trust my taste in books, so why not a fellow bookworm named Sam? It was better than good, it was great. Not at all what I expected there's not a book out there like this and I highly doubt there ever will be. Some books kind of come close with the absurdity rampant throughout the book, but while totally out there it's also very real which is what made the book.You question yourself being so devoted to following a character so... foul. Ignatius is not all that likeable. He has his okay points, such as he's intelligent, well-spoken and sticks to his guns, but everything else about this character is as disagreeable to everyone and everything as his stomach is to him. The characters he interacts with day in and out could be considered just as awful, but in comparison to Ignatius they practically come across as saint-like.Toole's approach to his storytelling is one of my favorites for authors to do and one I try (not always successfully) to emulate, and that's just letting the story tell itself. He doesn't fill it with character background information, or lengthy discriptions of places. If it needs it to enhance the story, he'll do it, but for the most part he leaves that stuff alone. Therefore the reader now has free reign over the story, imagining and picturing things the way they want to picture them. Toole's writing is also some of the most articulate, clever and witty I've read in a while. With another author a passage may illicit a small smirk, with Toole I was laughing out loud and then reading the passage to whomever may be listening nearby.I am now going to be leaving the book at home for my parents to read, and I'm going to tell you the same thing I've been telling them- this book is fantastic and a definite must-read.

It honestly was a fun, quick read for what it was. Unfortunately there was not much to the book...The plot and the characters were honestly pretty predictable, certain devices and people thrown in there for the sole sake of progressing the story along and/or creating conflict and then they were out of the story after having done their job. The whole book also had a somewhat rushed feeling to it, everything (including backgrounds) explained on the fly and not explained in full, while other things were quickly brushed over as if the author couldn't be bothered to write about it. It also seemed like Hake couldn't be bothered with double checking historical accuracy because I was confused on the time by different things being used, said, worn and done. In the end, it was all stuff I could accept. I guess the best way to describe it was that it was kind of like a young-adult book, wherein everything I mentioned is a common occurance in most young adult books in order to make them shorter and easier to read and follow.As a Christian I did appreciate the Christian tones to the book, but many times it became a little too much, even for me. Near the end of the book some messages were getting mixed. I was confused as to whether or not Hake was trying to say women should be subservient to men or if they shouldn't be. That actually never really became clear. There was also the constant habit of writing what the characters were thinking. It's okay once or twice, but it occured on pracitically every page. I find constantly voicing characters thoughts to be a version of telling (as in show don't tell) in the writing world. There are clear ways to indicate what a character is or could be thinking by showing the reader.Despite it's flaws I was still entertained.

Just the realistic absurdity of most of the situations Sedaris finds himself in were enough to make me chuckle, but his dry, slightly buffoonish wit made me bark and caused other people to stare. That's exactly what Me Talk Pretty One Day did to me.Sedaris is the awkward, every day man you can't help but be drawn to. At least in writing. In person he might be that guy you edge away from as subtly as possible for fear he'll engage you in uncomfortable conversation, talking about something you're not really interested in and you just aren't in the mood to nod as if you were. But in his writing you want to hear more. He thinks things we are all constantly wondering and he does things we all wish we had the balls to do. He clearly has a way of writing though, that people will either love or they'll hate, so don't be surprised (and I'm not) if you run into people that just don't like his books.When You Are Engulfed in Flames chronicles David's life in the last decade or so with only a few brief forrays into the past. He finally reveals his secret of keeping regular notes about the odd things he observes and the strange thoughts he has throughout the day, thus why his essays are so detailed. The notes, combined with a seperate diary (from what I've gathered) allows David Sedaris to go from just recapping his day to becoming what he really is: a storyteller.It's hard not to like Sedaris. Despite his prowess with words, he's just an everyday, average, non-intimidating guy. It's why you end up liking him. I've read three of his books so far (I own Holidays on Ice but have yet to read it seeing as I feel I should read it during the holiday season) and I've enjoyed all of them. I fully intend on reading his entire collection.

Wesley the Owl is going to be a tough one.One thing I'm beginning to notice about all these ""My Pet & Me"" books hitting the market is the fact that a lot of them are written by writers, meaning people that actively write for a living. Wesley the Owl was not. O'Brien is a biologist first and foremost. Obviously she has some skill as a writer because she's had to research and write papers in order to earn her degree, but it was evident in the book that creative writing was not her forté. Despite that I still enjoyed the book immensely and it was still well-written.From the moment O'Brien writes about looking down on the tiny, fluffy Wesley and immediately falling in love with him the reader falls in love too. Being both a scientist and an owl mom O'Brien highlights all of Wesley's unique quirks and traits in astonishing detail so we begin to know him intimately. She also doesn't hesitate to talk about the gross stuff either, thank God books don't smell or I would have been gagging at a lot of parts.Throughout Wesley's story Stacey also talks about owl facts and various animal behaviors, taking advantage of informing and educating involved readers. A couple of times she does reiterate herself, but thankfully not to the point of redundancy. Also, given the fact that most people reading the book are completely uninformed about owls, the tidbits given are really fascinating. For me at least, I loved when she would discuss various owl and animal info, but for others not as interested in animal behavior and more interested in Wesley's tale, those small parts may bore you a bit.Any animal lover will love this book and it continues to prove what most of us already know: every animal is a unique individual with their own seperate personalities and feelings. Most of them have been on this planet longer than us and we need to take better care of sharing it with them. Animals are not here for us to own and dominate, they're here as friends and neighbors and we need to start treating them as such. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 23, 2010","Apr 24, 2010","Jan 22, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3001512-wesley-the-owl

It basically means what it says, a non-fiction book has descriptions and narrative added in that no one could say really happened or not, it's been added in to make it more of a story, to make it more of a novel-type read rather than a straight through monologue on what happened during a period of change in America's history. Karen Abbot did say in her author's note, ""I want to stress that this is a work of nonfiction; every character I describe lived and breathed, if not necessarily thrived...Anything that appears in quotation marks, dialogue or otherwise, comes from a book, archival collection, article, journal, or government report."" Clearly Abbott did extensive research to maintain historical accuracy in this book, but it's also apparent she added her own flair to help make it a good story. Thankfully it never was in sacrifice of the truth.Sin in the Second City was totally enthralling from page one. It's a subject I'm not familiar with (the 19th-20th century brothel/prostitution system), nor the history and changes that were made in our laws because of it. Therefore all these people, places and events had me hooked and I wanted to know more. I, personally, was most interested in the life of the Everleigh sisters and I had hoped that the book would focus mostly on them with the reformers and politicians and laws staying on the periferary. It was an even split actually and as everything and everyone effected everything and everyone else it made sense to do it that way. But it did get a little dry and a bit boring when it came to the talk of politicians and laws.The book lost steam near the end, only one thing (which I will not disclose as it will spoil the read) really keeping it going. That, and the dryness in the political sections, were what I found to be the only downfalls of the book. Abbot's writing was fantastic, every character that came to the page came to life. She managed to find the drama and intrigue in all her research and share it with the reader, which will keep the reader hooked. If you're interested in the lesser known, ""darker"" and ""seedier"" side of American history and you also want a good read, Sin in the Second City would be a good choice for you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 30, 2010","Jun 03, 2010","Jan 22, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3495359-sin-in-the-second-city

I read Year of Wonders way back when and fell in love with it. I enjoyed March a lot, but not quite as much as Year of wonders (for a  of March go here). People of the Book falls right in between the two.What Brooks really had going for her is her attention to detail and character. Her words bring you in and wrap you up in imagery, but at no point are you overwhelmed and smothered in it. Hanna is an endearing character who is great at linking all the mini-stories together, and gives you someone to bond and share the experience with. And speaking of the mini-stories, they're kind of hit-or-miss. Two of the stories I just didn't get in to as much, but the rest held my attention.Honestly though, I think the whole mystery/situation/whatever you want to call it that crops up at the end (trying to say this without giving anything away) was completely unneccessary. The journey of the book itself was enough to carry the overall story, and it seemed that the ""situation"" was just something haphazardly thrown in there to jazz it up a bit. Even though in Brooks's world haphazardly is still pretty well done. Perhaps it was just a way to help her end the book? Who knows.If and when Brooks comes out with another book, I'm there. She's an extremely unique author, who's writing style is like a fresh of breath air in all the shit other books that are floating around out there right now.

I finished this one in plenty of time, just didn't  it in plenty of time.The Nature of Monsters is definitely not your typical historical fiction novel. Clark does not gloss anything over or romanticize any bit of the era she is writing about. Everything is raw, gritty, bawdy and described down to the most mundane, and often disgusting, detail. Completely different from any other historical fiction novel I've read. There is no romance, so if that's the only reason you read a historical fiction, put this book down right now.Every character, setting and situation is flawed to perfection. It's an odd thing to say and probably even harder to imagine but it's very true and upon reading the book you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. None of the characters are sympathetic, even Mary, yet somehow I found myself drawn to them and hyponotized by their story.I think the best way to describe this book is like a beautiful trainwreck. It is terrible, horrible and ugly, you know you should look away but you just can't. There's something drawing you in and keeping you there. I'm going to leave it at that. There's something I liked about this book, but I really can't put my finger on it because I don't think I should have liked this book.

Pretty much the last 4-5 books I've enjoyed but haven't been raving about to my friends, which is what I usually do after a really awesome read. Thank God Mirror Mirror broke the cycle! This book was awful.The biggest issue I had with Mirror Mirror is that it was all over the place. One second you're here following this character and the next you're there following that character. Add in a lot of needless rambling about scenery, architecture, and historical beefs, you get a very unfocused book. Sometimes unfocused books can be all right if the author's goal is to have that scattered feeling and/or if there is one character or something acting as a linking thread throughout the whole book. Mirror Mirror lacked that and therefore it also lacked my attention.It also lacked any character development. The periphery characters where pointless and amounted to nothing, our villian(ess) wasn't really evil, and Bianca (Snow White) came accross to me as shallow and completely uninteresting. That can all really be linked back to the lack of focus in the book. With all that jumping around characters never got the chance to grow nor develop relationships with one another.So why did I read the whole book? Pretty much because I got halfway through before realizing the story was never going to pick up and by then it was too late. I also wanted to finish it because maybe this was going to be one of those terrible books where the ending makes it all worth while. Nope. Now I use it to help others learn from my mistakes.

It's someone's diary edited down and put into book form. How do you  someone's personal thoughts and daily life? Honestly, you don't.This is something you read based on personal taste. If you are a Monty Python fan or a Michael Palin fan (in terms of his writings, career and travel books and documentaries) you should read this. He does write a lot about Monty Python because in the ten years his diary spans Monty Python takes up the bulk of his time, replaced only by family and writing really and even then those things tended to go hand in hand. It's fascinating to suddenly have this insiders perspective on something I'm absolutely in love with. Palin doesn't cover bits and sketches we look on now as genius and hilarious, and Holy Grail was only a fast couple of weeks in these pages literally spanning a decade. It shows how all of these things became important after the fact. It's also fascinating to watch fame creep up on him and the rest of the members of Python and how they all deal with it. For the most part Michael remains humble, something hard to cover up in your own diary.The editing was very well done. Obviously in a personal diary things are going to be said that you don't want people seeing. There were a couple parts things were obviously edited out, marked by the classic ""..."" after certain points, but nothing was abruptly cut, allowing everything to continue on smoothly. It looks like most of the diary was kept intact, certain things popping up I'm sure Palin debated heavily on keeping or not.At first I thought reading this (I don't really know what to call it: a book? Novel? Diary?) would make me feel extremely voyeuristic, but after the first couple of pages I didn't at all. Michael is often reflective, but keeps his words light and fun. It's not as silly as his sketch writing, and is much more flowing and detailed. It's clear why he is so good at writing travel books because his attention to detail is fascinating. His descriptions of the places he goes and the people he meets are so clear that it was those moments when I forgot I was reading about someone's actual day!There are a couple parts where it gets heavy in British politics and sporting events that lost my interest just a little bit, but Palin tries his best with footnotes to help readers unfamiliar with those to follow along. Really it was a fascinating and really good read for me, a huge Monty Python fan. I feel like I have a completely new perspective on one of my favorite comedy groups ever, I think from now on the movies and TV show are going to be viewed a little differently by me. I think this could also be a very good read for non-Python fans or people not so familiar with Python. He speaks fondly and emotionally of his father, who we are introduced to in his older and failing years. I was brought to tears a couple of times when he spoke of his father, because I'm going through similar things Michael was going through, the fact that the age difference between him and his father is the same as me and my dad just drove it even closer to home. His relationship with his wife and kids and friends are all sweet and he tries to do his best to please everyone. And like I said before, just the way he writes with such detail, yet light and funny would keep you reading even if you aren't a Python fan. I'm excited to read the latest diary set Palin has come out with, the ones chronicling the 80s. This has also given me a bit more of a drive to be more regular with my own diary. I highly doubt mine will ever be published though.P.S. Keep your eye out for frequent cameo appearances by famous celebrities, especially George Harrison who at one point near the end starts being referred to as the 7th Python....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 13, 2010","Mar 25, 2010","Jan 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/845223.Diaries_1969_1979

If I remember correctly I saw the movie and didn't like it. There wasIt took me way too long to finally read this book and I'm kicking myself for it. If I remember correctly I saw the movie and didn't like it. There was something about the way the movie approached the story or the characters that I didn't like and that completely turned me off from reading the book. I basically did something I know better than to do. I know the book is always better than the movie. The proof is right here.Golden's writing is completely hypnotic. It flows steadily and evenly through the places, people and actions with a certain musical quality that not many writers possess. What pleased me the most was that it never seemed as if he got lost or tired in his writing. Every section, every word came across to me as perfectly planned and thought out, and never rushed through, so I never felt that I was robbed of something vital.The thing that I liked most about the book was that Chiyo/Sayuri was very real. She wasn't some sort of heroine thrust into this lifestyle that decides to start breaking all the rules and becoming a rebel. She lives the life. She accepts the life (for the most part) and she follows the rules and actions. As much as I love the tough women who assert themselves as equals to men, there was something refreshing about Sayuri following the rythm and rules of geisha. Geisha are, by no means, submissive and Sayuri still comes across as a very strong character, but it's not blown to an unrealistic, Joan of Arc-type of proportion. That alone sold the book for me.Honestly, nothing about this book disappointed me. Everything came together perfectly to create a beautiful piece of literature. The ending, without giving anything away, might be disappointing for some people, with Sayuri's difficult choice and the results that come from it. Despite having seen the movie, I was still very much surprised by it. If you are like me and waffling about reading this book... just read it. I'm about 98% sure you'll be so happy you finally did.

The Likeness was just as good, if not better, as In the Woods. There's something about the intricacies and details she puts into literally everything with this book that sucks you in then blows you away. I almost don't want to say anything more than that, fresh from turning the last page, but I'll try.I'm going to refer you back to my  of In the Woods because a lot of the same elements I liked in that book were present in the sequel. Her characters, her in depth descriptions on the things that were truly important and that the reader should become invested in (and not in an overly obvious ""Look at that!"" sort of way), her clever and thought out story line. Everything I liked about the last book I can say increased tenfold with this one.Perhaps I enjoyed this book just a bit more because this time we're following Detective Maddox and her character just comes across as more sympathetic and relatable than Detective Ryan, who was our protagonist in the last book. Maybe it was the more dramatic and unique storyline that really sucked me in this time. Most likely it was just that this was a very well done follow up to an already amazing first book. Often times a follow up is a pathetic let down.In the end what probably did it for me this time around, was that I felt everything was wrapped up nicely. Not in terms of a happy ending but the fact that there was actually a resolution. I didn't find myself going, ""What a minute- what about...?"" all of my questions were answered. Something I found lacking in In the Woods.Finally, and best of all, French's unique style of realistic whimsy was still prevelant. It was a style I loved but couldn't put my finger on in the last book. It's hard to describe exactly what it is, but to put it simply the book comes across as real but there are these beautiful, almost fairytale-like elements woven throughout.

I find that when a book is hyped to me I become a bit more critical and cautious of it because if it doesn't live up to that hype than I am obviously disappointed. In the Woods though? Not disappointing. Tana French definitely earned her Edgar Award for Best First Novel by an American Author.French has an interesting writing style that I immediately fell in love with. Her descriptions are gorgeous, but she uses them only when neccessary. Where some authors may describe in full every setting, every character, every sight and sound and smell, French holds out those descriptions for the important places and situations. The most perfect place she waited to use her beautiful descriptions for? The woods of course.The entire book is written like a tapestry on so many levels, with the storyline itself woven so intricately and every word chosen and placed perfectly so. Even though it stays true to your classic ""whodunnit?"" mystery, it bordered more on thrilling and intriguing rather than cliche and boring as a lot of mystery stories are tending to stray towards lately. French also didn't try and take the story to soem sort of crazy extreme in an effort to make it different and ""surprising"" which usually reads as confusing and unbelievable. There's layers of mystery scattered throughout, from the law enforcement solving a crime, to the haunting hidden somethings of the wood.Definitely keeping the whole book alive, fun and interesting are Detectives Rob Ryan and Cassie Maddox. Every character we get the chance to meet is written out, even if only appearing on one page, to be a fully fleshed out real person. That's again something that seperates French from the overwhelming group of new mystery writers. Even if she needs a character to serve one purpose, she still writes them as if they have been in the story the entire time and if you were to ask her I'm sure she could give you a full background on those background characters. Rob Ryan especially has background, and his entire character is so flawed that at times it edges precariously on being unsympathetic, a daring risk French took and succeeded at. The fact that the reader is suddenly invested in such real characters heightens the excitement in the entire story and brings it up to that final level that makes it a true thriller.Please do not read the following if you do not want to be spoiled. Seriously. Stop right here.Okay. Spoiler time: The only disappointment I had with the book was that Detective Ryan's case from when he was twelve was never solved. I thought we would have the solution of both murders/disappearances. And while it could be argued that then it would have just made for a cookie cutter ending, I still felt it left the book slightly incomplete. One of the things we as readers had become invested in is just left completely unresolved. Still, French manages to do that in a way that you don't feel all that ripped off. I don't know how she did it either. Yet another talent leaving me wanting more from Tana French.

He faces the issues people try to skirt about with bold-faced openess and then points out how uncomfortable people are with it. He's basically saying, ""It's here. Deal with it.""It's a fitting style of autobiography for a humorist. And I'm sure it was cathartic for him to write it in his final days. As his wife points out in the afterword, he died doing what he loved. By just the way he writes you can tell writing brought him the most joy. To me, it reiterated the point that I don't know what's going to happen with my dad, and it doesn't matter.

But I'm sure other people are going to read this book and be absolutely in love with it. While others are just going to down right not like it at all.

I really enjoyed the other two books I've read of hers, My Sister's Keeper and Nineteen Minutes. I was hoping to like this book as much as I had the others. Again she was attacking a sensitive issue and trying to give a voice to all sides of the argument, but something was lacking this time around. Perhaps because one side just wasn't as strong? I can't quite place my finger on it what was lacking this time around. I think it mainly was because this book was so similar to My Sister's Keeper that it just felt like an unncessary rewrite of it.What didn't help the book was also the amount of characters talking. In her usual style, allowing the reader to hear all sides of the story, Picoult writes from multiple characters perspectives. She stretched herself too far this time. Because certain characters had the same opinions it just became a rehashing of stuff we already knew. Some characters were just as not as sympathetic or as interesting as others so that just dragged the book out a little further. Also all the baking references and recipes, though I could see what Picout was trying to do, didn't push the book along or enhance it at all.I still read it pretty fast though because the whole idea behind the book was fascinating and I wanted to see where it would end. Picoult hadn't disappointed me in her last two endings, and I figured she would again do some kind of unique twist ending. She did. Kind of. All in all it was the subject of the book itself, the controversy of parents suing for a ""wrongful birth"" and the character of Amelia that kept this book alive and really kept me reading. I wish Picoult had cut out the lawyer Marin's seperate storyline and had focused more on Amelia's struggle and story.One last thing. Reading this, I couldn't help picturing it all as a Lifetime movie. The court scenes, the dialogue, the angst- it all fit too perfectly and is ready for a made-for-tv-movie.

Within the first couple of pages we learn that Montgomery's father is struggling with lung cancer. My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer at the beginning of the year. From that moment on, this book took a completely different tone with me.The Good Good Pig is really just as much about Sy as it is about Christopher Hogwood. Maybe even a little more. Sy's growth in her community and with her fledgling family is coincided by Christopher's growing (both literal and figurative). She defines family as what it really is, making a home with the ones you love, be they related by blood or not (or in the same species). I appreciated her use of the phrase ""child-free"" rather than ""child-less."" There are many couples out there who choose not to have children and to consider them child-less makes it seem like they are lacking something. Clearly Sy lacks nothing in terms of family. She has an adoring husband, a loyal dog, a fanclub of clucking chickens, and one smitten pig.Montgomery has a light wit throughout her writing, never getting too serious and only highlighting a few poignant and memorable moments throughout the life of Christopher Hogwood. Christopher was the highlight of a very wonderful, tumultous and exciting time in Sy's life, and he was always there for her. Montgomery describes all of Christopher's characteristics and his surroundings in such crisp detail you feel like you know Christopher just as well as Sy. You'll also put the book down having an entirely different opinion about pigs than before. I already felt I knew that pigs were smarter than most people give them credit for, but I never knew they had such strong personalities, loud opinions and refined taste.

Maybe it's because I headed into it with a bit of trepidation because after the last historical, Christian novel I read I was very disappointed. Fire by Night was a completely different creature.The thing I appreciated most was that at no point did I ever feel like I was being preached at. The presence of God throughout the novel was there and touched upon frequently, but it wasn't forced upon the reader as something they should have to relate to, rather it was part of who the characters were and in that way the reader could either take it to heart or just let it stay in the character's lives. For me, the sharing of God should not be forced on anyone, it should be there for people to take as they will. When they do it that way, I think the message is felt so much stronger, and much less resented.Of course the story became cliche at times, it's a fun, historical romance novel, it's to be expected, but for me it never hit cheesey. I found Austin's handling of the two main characters beautifully done, they both evolved wonderfully and neither of them made huge, saint-like changes. They stayed raw and real and fully developed throughout the whole novel.Austin also didn't hold back in telling it like it is. She of course stayed away from any kind of shock factor, but did acknowledge the fact that this was a real war, a real, violent and unbelievably deadly war that affected everyone in the United States. People on the front lines saw awful things and Austin shares that with the reader. Also it was clear she tried her best to stay historically accurate, I don't know how accurate seeing as I'm not an expert of the Civil War, but accurate enough to not take the reader out of the book by going, ""I highly doubt that could ever have happened.""Fire by Night is a good read. I don't want the idea that it is classified as Christian Lit to deter anyone because like I said the Christian message that's in the book was never EVER preached to the reader.

To me it came across as a slapped together attempt to ride the coat tails of the success of The Da Vinci Code. There was no need for her to do that though. In the sudden rise of these historical mysteries popularity The Eight would have been rediscovered by a new generation all on it's own, there was no need for a shoddy sequel to point readers towards it.I should preface that my entire judgement and criticism on the book could be clouded by the fact that while reading this I was in the midst of a serious family emergency, which often didn't allow me to focus entirely on the book. Even so, it was so drawn out and fact heavy there was nothing within it that gave me the much needed distraction that books can often provide. For most of the book I was confused and bored. There wasn't a lot of plot or action, and it was heavy with ""telling not showing."" Neville tried to follow the same formula she wrote The Eight with in terms of having two corresponding storylines happening at once but that didn't work this time. The twists and turns that were shocking and exciting in The Eight seemed predictable this time around. The story took a back seat to all the facts and information being given (very dryly I might add) which then defeated the purpose of having all this information because there was no story for it to fuel.My investment in the characters was non-existant, mainly because their development was non-existant. Relationships suddenly appeared, other characters disappeared, and the ones we loved from The Eight just seemed shoved in there because fans of the first novel were expecting them to be there. While in The Eight there were many characters, every single one was neccessary. Here? No. Too many. Too many characters coming across as useless and hard to keep track of.Of course most of this critique is being made in comparison to The Eight, but it's the sequel. The Fire was a sequel that did not live up to it's predecessor, which is disappointing because The Eight was such a fantastic novel. The Fire wasn't entirely without it's good points. Neville still stayed strong to the endearing cheesiness I grew fond of in The Eight. She also made sure not to leave any stone unturned, so even though it stretched the novel out and made it boring at times there was no way you were left going, ""Wait! what about...?"" Most importantly there was Neville's beautiful use of language, she writes with wit and intelligence abundantly. This actually was the first book in a long time that I've had to stop and look up a word or two.In the end I will state it was worth the read, even if it was just to make The Eight seem all that much greater. I'll stand by my original statement though that this sequel didn't really need to be written. An okay but unneccessary book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 25, 2010","Feb 04, 2010","Jan 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2848984-the-fire

At least, for my mother (who got me the book) and me it was. Both of us thought this was a historical romance-type book. It's not. And while I wasn't disappointed upon starting to read the book, I was slightly caught off guard because I found myself having to quickly shift gears. So if you're like me (and Mom) don't be fooled, it's a biography- not the historical romance you may have been expecting. On that note...This biography was still very good. Foreman clearly spent an exhaustive amount of time researching for the biography (which she stated in her author's note that she never actually chose to do, the life of the Duchess chose her) and that research definitely payed off for a well planned out and very informative book. The thing I appreciated most, besides Foreman backing up all her research, was the fact that she clearly stuck to the solid details, rarely, if at all, adding a couple creative flairs here and there. At times the foray into British politics became a little dry and boring, the ins-and-outs being a little difficult to understand despite Foreman's clear and easy explanations of it all.The most remarkable and best achieved thing about the book was that Amanda Foreman brought Georgianna back to life for everyone of today and tomorrow to get to know this remarkable woman. Her carefully reconstructed life and words combine to allow you to know the real Duchess, the woman who was often riddled with insecurities and anxieties that only a few of her closest friends knew about. There is also a lot of drama, romance and intrigue throughout Georgianna's life so despite those lulls in the political sections the book is enthralling and exciting, made even more so by the fact that this all really did happen.Foreman has a clear gift for detail, research and a clear, concise yet beautiful way with words.

Taking a moment from not-so-distant history and breathing life back into it. Like The Red Tent this was a very difficult book to put down so allot yourself some time to read it.Something interesting Diamant did with this book was making the span of a month (was it just a month?) seem like years, thus allowing the reader to experience the same sort of time manipulation the ""prisoners"" felt. Every day felt like a month and after a while you don't really know how long it's been. Time has slowed to a standstill. Perhaps it's her attention to detail and characters that has time dragging, but though time is dragging at no point did the book. She maintains a certain flow to her writing. Despite jumping from character to character and event to event, there was no bumping the reader out of the moment. The changes were so subtle and smoothe the reader was easily able to stay with the story.Diamant clearly has a gift with creating characters as well. Of course there was a central conflict point to push the story along, but really, for me, it was mostly character driven. Each woman was so unique and well developed I kept having to remind myself that though this was based on a real story, the characters themselves weren't real. They were flawed, not over the top, with varying personalities.

Therefore I feel that this book needs to be ed as a companion book to Animals in Translation rather than a completely new and different book.The book is divided into sections focusing on specific species and then analyzes their behavior in order to allow us as humans to better understand them, thus better their welfare. Again, Grandin does her best to simplify the super-scientific stuff, but at times I felt it almost about to go over my head. Even still, the majority of the book was fascinating and informative. She doesn't anthropomorphize the animals at all, but she does make very clear that animals have feelings, though processes, anxieties, pretty much everything humans go through, they just go about it a different way. We need to stop thinking about animals as just dumb things out there to serve us, Animals Make Us Human gives us valid reasons why.For all you pet owners out there, this book is a must-read, if not a must-own. It's better than a training manual because it will help you understand your pet on a completely different level. When you understand your pet and why they do the things they do, training them will become so much easier. Also, understanding what will get them to do certain things is what can turn an hour of training into a minute.

Surely no dog could get into so much trouble! And then there are those of us who know- have experienced it ourselves- that the stories are told by word for word fact. There's no need for embellishment. Larger-than-life dogs like Marley give us larger-than-life stories.It's those stories that Grogan shares with readers in Marley & Me, written for everyone, not just dog lovers. His recall, wit and humorous writing bring the reader in and keep them there. Marley is the main focus of the story, but through Marley were drawn into the lives of the Grogans and share ups and downs with them. When the story shifts to focus more on John or Jenny, Marley is still there in the background, chewing on a couch, slobbering over a shoe, or wolfing down his food in one bite. Marley highlights the events that don't star him, and blow you away in the ones that do.Just like Marley himself the book is fast-paced and exciting, but still manages to slow down for those touching poignant moments that appear throughout. Grogan has a columnists style to his writing that is funny and descriptive but not overwhelmingly so. Told in stories and events, and strung together with small bridges to the next story.I knew I was going to love this book the minute I heard about it. Being raised with two happy, street-smart but not the brightest, mischeiveous Irish Setters, every feeling Grogan described at seeing another item lost to the cavernous mouth and stomach of Marley, or the shock at having a leash suddenly ripped from your hand and a streak of yellow (red in my case) go flying into the distance was familiar to me. The occasional annoyance with these large and goofy creatures always dwarfed by the unconditional love and mutual love you feel for one another. Grogan captures that relationship between dog and owner (friend and partner in crime more like it) perfectly.When I put down the book I was touched, not only by Marley's story, but by the memories of my own underwear-eating, never-listening, screendoor-crashing, endlessly-loving, tender, caring dogs.It really doesn't matter if you've owned a dog (or a pet at all). You will still, hands down, enjoy Marley & Me. I also say, if you're considering getting a dog, Marley & Me is a must-read for it gives you the hands-down truth in owning a dog. It's not easy, by any means, but if you're willing to deal with all the troubles the Grogan's and countless other dog owners before have gone through, than you'll be rewarded with something far greater than anything you could ever imagine....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12691.Marley_and_Me

Interesting storyline, with some cliche plot points, characters not quite fully developed, and writing that was just descriptive enough and just good enough to pull you in... just enough.Garden Spells is a book you can half read but still get the full jist of. It gets a little dramatic and cheesey at times, but it's still a good place for a first novel to be. It's something that Allen can improve upon, and seeing as she's already at a good spot, her future novels will just go from better to excellent.The thing the book has going most for it, is that it takes the story of family relationships and history that has been told time and time again and makes it new. It's a unique twist on an old story, but is told with a timeless quality so if you were to pick the book up 20 years from now you're not tackily transported to the past as a lot of popular fiction can do.If you want a light and entertaining read than I'd advise picking up Garden Spells....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1158967.Garden_Spells

It was also his writing that kept me truly engaged. I can't even put my finger on it, but something sucked me into this book and kept me there until suddenly I turned the last page, looked up and wondered where the time had gone.A couple of times I think Davies lost control of his novel. A few too many story lines that didn't really add to the big picture, that of Esther and Karsten's relationship, or even they're seperate stories. Take out the extra characters that apparently had backgrounds we needed to address, Davies could have focused on Esther and Karsten more and given their individual and combined tales richer layers that the reader could further fall into.I did enjoy the few running themes that occured. That of Esther, Karsten and Rotherham all being of single-parent households and being bilingual. Both of which caused them to struggle with their identities and places in the world.The main thing that I just keep thinking about with the book is Davies's writing. It's descriptive enough to allow you to picture everything the way you want to picture it and set you in the story, but not overly so that you're continuously taken out of the story itself. It's a delicate balance not a lot of authors can pull off, but Davies's does it superbly.In the end, if you love WWII historical fiction, this is definitely a new one to add to your library. It'll give you a breath of fresh, Welsh air.

The Lost Symbol definitely falls short compared to the sensation of it's predecessor. And I didn't even have high expectations to begin with to be honest. I think Dan Brown put so much heart and soul into The Da Vinci Code there wasn't a lot left to put into this one.The main problem I had with the book was unlike The Da Vinci Code and even Angels & Demons where information and clues were doled out while on the run and in the middle of action, The Lost Symbol paused to feed us what we needed to know, which dragged the book down severly. At the end of one short chapter you have something exploding and the next you're casually sitting in an office without a care in the world hearing a dry explanation on an order of symbols. I felt like it wasn't until I was almost halfway through the novel that things started picking up and it became a page turner.The ending (without giving anything away) was also a bit disappointing for me. You get your answer, but it's a bit of a letdown and you still kind of feel like there should be something more. And I'm talking the ending ending (because there are a couple), the ones before it were actually exciting and worthwhile.There are many interesting situations and nail-biting moments scattered throughout the slow beginning of the book that keep you reading. And Langdon remains entertaining, along with his partners in crime, so don't think I'm saying the novel's a total bust. Neccessary character background is put in during appropriate times and doesn't come across as an awkward nuisance or glaringly obvious hints to what's coming that can so easily happen in other mystery novels. Plus, our main bad guy in the book... creepy and evil as hell. Especially because this time we know who it is which makes it even scarier when we see our good guys continuously walk into his traps.In the end it's a mediocre, bordering on good, pop-fiction mystery, with enough scientific, philosophical, historical and religious jargon thrown in there to make you feel kinda smart. Like always don't let my negatives or positives throw you from a book you may have been anticipating. As my friends and family read my copy that's being passed around I'm very curious to see if they found it to be better, the same or worse than The Da Vinci Code.

You start reading this book with the mindset that it's written for a younger audience. And the book of course starts off in a similar manner. But gradually as you turn the pages and see the pictures you begin to drift into a frightening world you wonder if a child could wrap their heads around... and then escape.Coraline is a freaky as hell book and the childlike simplicity and wonder with the way it is written makes it even freakier. The illustrations by Dave McKean that are peppered throughout the novel don't help either. Gaiman writes just descriptively enough to give the reader a start and then lets their imagination fill in the rest. That's what makes the book so scary, because everyone can imagine something different, they can imagine a picture that scares them the most.Also- the idea of what has happened to Coraline, and what she's going through chills me to the bone. I kept thinking myself as a young girl and tried to think of what it would be like to be in such a backwards, yet wonderful world, only to realize that my real parents, as much as I butt heads with them, were gone for good.

This didn't read like a memoir, full of funny stories and important, yet fleeting figures, that all combine in the end to give a moral or a lesson. Rather this is just a raw and honest look at a hard life.When I talk to people about Angela's Ashes most have the reaction of, ""Oh my gosh it's such a sad book."" Or ""I loved that book."" Or variations on the two. The former reaction seemed to come from people without strong Irish heritage. The latter- Irish. There's a bitter humor that runs throughout the book. A very, what I've come to realize is an Irish humor.If asked- I'm American. Really, most of my family has been in this country since it was first founded. But when tracing family lineage I'm a strong 25% German, and the rest of me is Irish. Maybe just a dash of French, Scottish and English thrown in there- but mostly Irish. I found myself laughing at so many things, that other people, without that bitter, biting, Irish sense of humor would find unsettling. There is an Irish personality I've noticed, especially after reading this book and thinking about my family. We laugh at hardships, they (or at least Frank) laughed at hardships.Yes, Frank McCourt had an extremely hard life. Yes, there were dispicable things happening, disturbing and sad. But he writes it all with such an innocent and storylike quality to it, you feel that he's kindly putting up a window so you're not right in it, and you can watch in comfort.His style of writing is so unique as well. It's story-telling done so well you have trouble remembering this all really happened. There are depressing moments, there are touching moments, and like I keep saying there are many funny moments.Angela's Ashes is a perfect book to help you really remember that life is what you make it. Shit is going to be thrown at you, but you can't let it weigh you down. You can change your circumstances. Yes, it's hard work, but with determination and the ability not to take it all so seriously, you can turn things around your way. And really, things aren't so bad.Oh- I guess there was a moral here.

The bits of history that are intricately weaved throughout the book remain just as vibrant and alive as the characters living it. Often times historical novels, when they get to the historical part, can become dry and boring, causing the reader to lose interest in the rest of the story. Perhaps this is done by Seton's own desire to stay as historically accurate.The character of Katherine herself is the strongest part of this book, which is good seeing as the book is about her and a weak main character can just destroy a book. Katherine is very real, not just in the fact that she actually existed and much that was written in the book about her actually happened, but in the way Seton has written her. She's not some lovely beauty flitting about like a ditz (Gwenyvere?), she is a strong woman torn between rights and wrongs, love and loyalty. The best part of Katherine? She grows. I barely recognized the young Katherine on page one from the sweet, older and wiser Katherine on page 499. This again Seton does with flawless grace, there is no awkward ""here's Katherine growing up"" moments... it just happens, perfectly capturing how it happens to us. Katherine is shocked at the decisions she makes one day as she knows years before she wouldn't have made the same decision, just like we feel the same proud glow for doing something ""adult.""It's not really fair to call this just a story about Katherine's love affair with the Duke of Lancaster, though does play a major part as that was the driving force for most of her life. The story is Katherine. It follows Katherine, taking brief side trips to the Duke and the events of England he is so involved in. But we don't get to know the Duke as we do Katherine, nor do we get to know and love the Duke's companions as we do the ones who are such a close part to Katherine's life.There's a lot more I could expand upon, but I like to keep these s short and brief. There was so much about this book I really liked and could constantly keep thinking of more things to address that I enjoyed about it. So as a lover of historical fiction to all you other historical fiction lovers- if you haven't read this book do it. It is by far one of the most well written historical fiction books I have read. I will definitely be seeking out more of Seton's work in the hopes this one wasn't the best of her work and that they all shine just as brightly....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jan 2010,"Jan 21, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33609.Katherine

Plus, she was there first, in this genre of historical mystery I guess you could call it.This book was enthralling. At times the dialogue was a little cliche and unrealistic, but that was easily passed over for the overall intelligence of the book. She wrote in such a way that while you may not understand chess, physics, historical figures, etc. you can follow the ideas of it all with ease, and she doesn't dumb it down either! There were moments where a sudden influx of dry facts came in and I found my eyes glazing over, but I kept through those because the payoff was going to be great and it definitely was. Everything was thought out, planned out and intelligently written. The characters seemed fleshed out, and while occasionally silly and cheesey, still fun additions to the story. Cheesey does run rampant at points in the book, but it seems to fit well with the classic ""the game's afoot"" theme of the book.Most notably for me was that both story lines, were wonderful to follow. So many times in a book with two story lines that are later weaved together, one is so much more interesting than the other and it's that stupid one that makes the book just awful. That didn't happen with The Eight though. I was disappointed everytime one story took a break for the other one to start up again, but it was only a momentary disappointment because than I was back in another storyline again. It's hard to describe but I loved it, and it was the fact that both lead characters and both their stories were so well written that the book flowed along so well.I'm cutting this  short because there aren't a lot more compliments I can pay to the book.

It is daunting, heavy and, at times, overwhelming. Eventually you get to the peak of that hill, and the rest of the journey is smooth and easy. For the most part.I picked up The Mists of Avalon knowing it was a classic and a must-read for people even remotely interested in the fantasy genre, and especially for those who love the tale of Arthur. Marion Zimmer Bradley takes a truly legendary tale that everyone either knows or has at least heard of and makes it completely new. Taking it from a completely different angle, focusing on the misunderstood women of the tales and giving it a different take. All the while following the old stories. My issue, which isn't really an issue, in reading this novel is that I have never previously read any other Arthurian books, so my knowledge going into this is only what is commonly known. I had no prejudices or preconceived ideas starting the book. It made my experience different from people who have read books like The Once and Future King and others, because now they're hearing the story from a new perspective, while I'm hearing it for the first time. Hopefully having read this novel will now not cloud my judgement on future Arthurian novels as I have heard it has been known to do. But The Mists of Avalon sparked my interest in other Camelot-centric books so I'm still very interested in tracking down those no matter how this novel has marked me.Bradley's novel is breath taking in it's descriptions and language. Every word brought me further and further into the world of Morgaine and Avalon. I could feel the damp earth beneath my feet, hear the lap of water on the lake shore, shiver in the mists the reader is so often brought to. Each character was so real too. The slow beginning was worth it in the end because it allowed me to get to know each character so intimately I felt as if I'd known them my whole life. And it wasn't long-winded explanations either, it was just a literal start from the beginning that made the novel so long for the first half.In terms of characters though, I didn't find Gwenhyfar redeemable or engaging at all, despite any attempts Bradley may have made otherwise. I disliked it when the story shifted to her and wanted to punch her in the face more times than I can recount. I wish someone had punched her in the face because then it would have made her by far more interesting. The only purpose she really seemed to serve was as a stark contrast to Morgaine, therefore enhancing Morgaine's bravery, cleverness and independence. Between Morgaine (our true heroine) and Bradley's beautiful writing there's no question as to why this novel is considered a classic in many circles. If you've been questioning picking it up and starting it, constantly frightened off by it's bulk, just get over your fear and read it. If you've started this book and thought that it's just too slow and you can't keep going, trust me- keep going. The second half is when things will pick up and you'll appreciate the time you spent on the tedious first half. Bradley created an epic, carefully crafted masterpiece, every word definitely worth the read....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"May 28, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/402045.The_Mists_of_Avalon

Mmmmm- Mr. Darcy. I'm sorry- I got distracted a moment there.Yeah- I didn't fall in love with our dark and admittedly mysterious Mr. Heathcliff in any way shape or form. Rather I couldn't stand Heathcliff. Or anyone else for that matter. The only person I could remotely say I liked was Ellen/Nelly and even then there were a couple times I wanted to jump into the pages and just full on bitch-smack her.Wuthering Heights is truly it's own novel. There isn't anything like it, and considering this was published in 1847 just blows my mind. I can understand why this book wasn't so well received at first. What is this? This isn't something people of those days would neccessarily be drawn to read. It's about the dark, twisted shapes love can take. About injustice and cruelty you inflict on those you care deeply for. It follows unsympathetic characters who range from weak and whiny to angry and spiteful. Why would anyone like this book?You end up liking this book for those very reasons. That there is not a single character you root for, and you only keep reading because you want to see their end rewards. You want to be able to go and spit on their graves in the end.

And it really wasn't until I was halfway through that I finally found it interesting and engaging. The way she writes the story also makes it a little hard to follow at first. It's a story being told to someone else who's relaying it to us. Just confusing enough it's hard for me to even tell you how it's being told.

I found it an interesting tale of a first lady we've heard of so much due to being wife to one of the most influential and great president's the U.S. has seen today, but yet we don't know much about. There are many things that made this book a unique and fun read.One thing was that we got a new view on the Civil War. Many books are written about either soldiers or slaves, occasionally family members of those fighting. Not many are written through the eyes of a politician, let alone one directly in the White House, and let alone the First Lady. The way Mary Lincoln is written she would definitely be considered a politician.That was another thing that made this book such a good read. Mary not only supported her husband in all of his political ambitions, but often discussed and planned with him the various actions he was hoping to take on. She was often outside that box women were constantly shoved into back then. Yet at the same time, in contrast to doing things not suitable for a woman, she did things that were quintessentially feminine. Decorating, shopping, cooking, cleaning, hosting, mothering, etc. She was almost a walking contradiction to herself, and it could have gotten very tricky to write at times, but Newman pulls it off flawlessly and smoothly.Of course the book was not without it's flaws as a whole. At times it became long and dry, parts popped up that didn't neccessarily need to be there. Also, I was occasionally uncomfortable by the overt sexuality of Mary Lincoln, especially with her husband, Mr. Lincoln. Possibly it's because I couldn't shake the image of the older, noble president and his wife that appears in pictures not looking all that young. It's almost like reading about your parents or grandparents having sex. The romance is sweet, and it gives the Lincoln's a side rarely seen, but it often came off as something Newman desperately wanted to write. I think if she had such a desire to write a historical romance she should have saved it for some different characters, I'm positive she could pull it off without trouble.In the end, one of the main reasons I liked this book was because of dear Robert Todd. Such a misunderstood man that was written more on the two demensional side amongst a cast of fully developed characters, still succeeded in frustrating me beyond reason with his inability to understand and sympathize with his mother. I'm pretty positive anyone else who reads this book will also find themselves scoffing and dropping their jaws at the moments of pure thick-headedness Robert constantly displays.So if you're looking for something new in Civil War era historical fiction I would say try out Mary: Mrs. A. Lincoln and see how that works out for you. I highly doubt you've read something like it before.

It was a fun historical romance (which, as you can tell by my book list, is one of my guilty pleasures), not one of the best ever, but still good.I applaud Anne Easter Smith for not worrying too much about being a stickler for historical accuracy. It felt like she wrote with the knowledge of all the facts, but where facts fell away she didn't feel it wrong to put a bit of imagination in there, aka fiction! In some historical fictions the author worries too much about playing with history and the story starts to fall away and not nearly be as interesting. She added characters where she needed characters (namely Fortunata), and she added the romance which may or may not have been there.At the end of the novel she made a note saying that Anthony Woodville did exist and that there is the remote possibility that he and Margaret of York could have had a relationship (romantic or otherwise) due to their many shared interests. The ending, she also noted, could blend cleanly into what really did happen in history.Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that the politics flowed smoothly throughout the book and rarely ever dragged the story down or stopped it completely. An accomplishment in any novel dealing with the old European courts. Of course there are a few moments that drag but they are few and far between. Also, parts of the book didn't feel neccessary to the story at all.Overall, though, the book was good. A decent historical fiction for those of you who like them.

Adelia is not written unrealistically though. The challenges she faces as a woman make it all very clear that people dislike her actions and are suspicious of her, it makes what she's doing all the more interesting. It was also funny to read how people would trust her manservant Mansur, a Muslim, before they would trust a woman.While so much of the movel seemed historically accurate (or at least was written in that way), I was constantly wondering if the different investigation techniques Adelia was using would have actually been used back then. I guess it seemed sort of a stretch because some of the techniques are still used today. I chose to trust Franklin though, and believed they actually were ahead of the times in more ways than others.The only problems I had with the book was that while the ending slightly surprising, I did kind of predict a few things.

Luckily I made it by a day. Too close for comfort. Especially seeing as it took me almost two solid weeks to read it. Good Lord.I gotta get this out of the way first- I hate not liking books. I always start a book with the hopes that I'm going to enjoy it because I know how hard it is to write and to make something good and to want to please people. So to be someone that is displeased by the work of an author, well- it makes me feel bad. Luckily for Labyrinth and Kate Mosse a lot of people really liked it. Which makes me feel a little less bad about really not enjoying it. To be honest, though, I can see how a lot of people liked it so much.Labyrinth is The Eight meets The Da Vinci Code. Actually it's those two novels put in a blender, water added for consistency, blended for five minutes and then poured over chicken tacos. Simply put I was lost and confused for most of the novel. I'm someone that can follow confusing plotlines really well and keep track of an insane amount of characters (Lost is one of my favorite shows) so for me to be unable to keep track of what was going on and who was who is saying something.The main problem with the entire book is that there was just too much of everything with not enough follow through on it. Too many mysteries, too many characters, too many storylines, too many locations, etc. For a first book Mosse took on way too much. Had she scaled it back a bit I think the story as a whole could have been so much better. So because there was so much to try and folow but not enough to back it up I didn't feel invested and I just became bored. And like I said earlier, this is almost a clone of The Eight with a bit of The Da Vinci Code in there, and both of those were executed much, much better. Therefore, seeing as I'd read it all before, there was even less to draw me in and keep me going. The only thing that got me to the end was that common mistake of, ""Oh, it's got to get better!"" and by halfway through the book I was too far in to just stop, at least during this year with my goal of a book a week.As for Mosse's writing? That didn't even save the book. I found it repetitive and overly descriptive with not a lot of faith in her readers. She did the thing I hate most from authors is when they have to explain every little action and every reason behind a character's actions, taking for granted the intelligence of the reader and the faith they can figure it out on their own. For me it takes the fun out of the book, especially when I discuss it with people, because then there's no reason for analyzing and debate because everything has been spelled out.I wanted to like the book, I really did. Especially as someone venturing into the writing world myself I often have to wonder if I am guilty of the same mistakes and how my writing would fare under a microscope. But as I know with this book and with countless others, people will either love it, like it or hate it.

I'll keep this  short, just saying what I liked, and what I didn't like.What was good? Once again it was unique and something different in a world of young adult novels that are constantly trying to emulate one another. It does have that fantasy qualities a lot of other novels are riding on, so of course you will find a few similarities, but overall it's different and new. And as usual our characters are fantastic, the returning ones gaining even more dimensions (especially Artemis).What was bad? The plot wasn't as developed as Colfer usually gives and there wasn't as much story. I felt that Colfer was sort of coasting along, filling space for some reason. Like the publishers wanted him to write another story when he had nothing so he just sort of scribbled something down half-heartedly and turned it in. What made that all even worse was that the conflict was just mediocre. I didn't think the stakes were as high and it took a long, long time to get to that climax while the denouement was short and quick, too quick.So there you go. I'm ing this book in comparison to the other books because as a series progresses you sometimes have to do that. Especially when instead of the books getting better or even just staying the same, it gets worse. I'm hoping that the next books will be better and that this one was just a fluke.

It was disconnected and didn't flow so I was constantly wondering where it was going, what was happening? That could have possibly been remedied had I been attatched the characters but I wasn't. I didn't like any of them, they weren't interesting nor were they sympathetic.But like I said, the book is mediocre.

Don't even know how to spell that or if it makes any sense. Hey, that makes a nice segue into my .Let me start with the one perk I can honestly give this book. Anne Enright has a beautiful grasp of words but she doesn't know how to use them. She also had a wonderful gem of an idea for a story, but she didn't know how to develop it. Combine those two together you get a reader thinking, ""I want to like this, but I don't know how."" The Gathering could have easily been a beautiful, deep and touching novel, but unfortunately Enright fails at delivering that.I found the story as a whole much too disconnected and disjointed. I constantly felt like I was being bounced around. By the time I got relatively comfortable in one scene I suddenly found myself in a completely different time and place with unfamiliar characters. It wasn't just the line of the story that was disjointed, but the actual writing itself. Actually, that might not be the best way to describe writing that is mostly run-on sentences and rambling thoughts, that's pretty much the opposite of disjointed, even so, it somehow still managed to feel that way.The story wasn't even saved by it's characters. There wasn't a single fully developed, or even half developed character throughout the whole book. Even our main character, Veronica, remained two-demensional at best, despite having moments where I felt I should be feeling a connection with her. Rather it felt like I was standing awkwardly by someone I barely knew while they had an emotional breakdown, glancing occasionally over my shoulder wondering if I should leave them alone or dumbly pat them on the back. I think I was expected to be attatched to most of the characters, but I wasn't. I didn't feel sympathy for them, nor did I even like any of them. It made the book even more boring and uncomfortable.It's a great disappointment to read a book you think has so much potential to only have it fall flat. If Enright has written any poetry I might be interested in reading that, I have an inkling she would make a fairly good poet, but I'm going to be staying away from any other novels she's written. Especially if they're anything like this....more",Notes are private!,0,122,1,not set,Feb 2008,"Mar 16, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/998133.The_Gathering

Nicole Galland has a fun, witty, elegant, descriptive, and flowing way of writing that grabs you at the first page and doesn't let you go until the final word on the last page. Something that was refreshing in my current favorite genre of historical fiction. I know there's a lot of us out there who have become addicted after those Philippa Gregory novels and we're constantly searching for another gem of an author, I've found her for you!What really made the story was Galland's writing combined with her characters. She's got a really nice flow to her writing that has an underlying (or in the case of Gwirion, outlying) humor to it and that just engages you and carries the story. Then, every character that even just passed by in the background seemed to have a story behind them, a life they were living and that helped give the novel a full and real feeling. Of course if that's how a background character seems, you can't even imagine how our three main characters are.Gwirion, Noble, and Isabel all are imperfect and that's what makes them real. It's what makes them well-rounded. And, to me, it's what makes a well-rounded character. If you've read a lot of my s you'll realize that I'm typically drawn to books that have real characters who are flawed. Each of our three characters all have stories behind them as well. It helps you understand them, sympathize with them, and see what motivates them. You also will become drawn more to one character than another, but that's not due to how Galland writes it. It's not because she wants you to like one more than another, it's because you will choose who you like. You're always drawn to one character in any book, even if they're all the ""good guys."" Galland doesn't force one on you, which is another reason I fell in love with the book.Of course the book isn't without a flaw or two, the only really major one being that it did end up feeling a little cliched at times, but that's about it. It gets remedied though by the surprising ending, which if I hadn't already thought the book worth the read, would have made it so. Seriously, if you want any reason to read the book, it's the ending. Unique and surprising, I was floored. I'm not giving anything more than that away.Really, if you've been looking for another good historical fiction (historical romance) author, I've found her for you. Nicole Galland!

I'm not big into the zombie phenomenon so I was a little unsure about starting the book. I am big into dystopian novels and some dystopian movies, there's something fascinating about them. Certain ones hold messages that if we don't change our ways, bad things will happen, others are just plain fun. World War Z falls into the latter category.There's a realistic tone that hangs over the whole novel and that's what really creeped me out a lot of the time. I would read a certain passage and find myself looking up to make sure a door was shut or wondering what that sound was. The creepiest part for me was every time they started describing the zombies in the water... I'm shuddering just thinking about it.Brooks presents the story in a unique style, through multiple voices. Sometimes one character just speaking one time, other times returning to someone more than once to continue their story. In that form the book was a little slow to start, especially trying to follow the same story from different perspectives. But after a short while you start getting into a flow and the story begins to go along at a quicker pace and you find yourself caught up in this zombie war. Brooks also has a very interesting way of telling the story primarily through dialogue because each section is basically an interview with a person. And that's the other thing I found fascinating, every person, no matter how briefly we see them for seems fully developed. I have a feeling that if you ask Max Brooks some random thing about a random character he could probably end up telling you their whole life story.Basically this is a very fun, unique and chilling read. Don't think of it solely as a zombie novel because that may turn you off from reading it. Think of it as a dystopian novel with a zombie twist to it. Mind you, I may not be the best critic about a zombie book since I'm not really into that whole zombie-craze, but I found it to be a unique take on the whole thing. We get to see the beginning, the middle, and the end. If you're a zombie ""expert"" though, read this and I would love to hear your take on it. Perhaps you'll think it's absolute crap. Who knows. At least I enjoyed it and in the end, I'm all that really matters... me and the zombies, because they're going to get us in the end....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Feb 2008,"Mar 16, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8908.World_War_Z

But I'm going to say what I can...This book was a hard one to read yet I couldn't put it down. There's a different something in Dave's story that will keep different people reading. Mine was: Why? I wanted to know why his mother did this. I wanted to know what made her do it. I wanted to know how she could to it. And I wanted to know why it was Dave she picked out of him and his brothers. What made Dave the one she singled out for such monstrous torture. But that's something people involved in child abuse cases ask themselves every day.You really do feel for Dave. You don't feel with him because there are moments so bad that he has to disconnect himself. I couldn't do that while reading it though. I almost felt that if I could send my anger and frustration and sadness and hope out there it would stop. Of course it was foolish of me seeing as it happened many years ago and he's a grown man who escaped his mothers claws.I was only annoyed by the fact that the book was too short and that dividing his story into three seperate books seemed unnecessary. Especially because by the end the reader has become so invested in Dave and feels like they're such a part of his life, they want to go with him as he continues on to the next, hopefully happier chapter in his life. Perhaps it was a publishers marketing scheme to get more money or something. Goodness knows it wasn't Dave's. His goal was to tell his story, thank those who helped him, and open a door to shed light on an issue that is often hidden away. All of which he accomplished magnificently.What we learn in Dave's story is that child abuse is real. It comes in many forms, but it's out there and it's up to those of us in the lives of children to stand up and be the voice for the abused. Another thing we learn is to not back down in that fight, of course there will be road blocks, but if you champion for a child as those special people in Dave's life did, you can help. You can save a life, heart, and soul. You can give a child hope.This book is a must-read I'd say. I of course went out and got the follow-up (I hate to use the word sequel with something like this) and read it right away. That's a  to follow later. If you are debating about reading this book I will just say that it is a hard read. If you're a mother it will probably be especially hard. If you have a deep compassion and love for children it will probably be hard. If you yourself have experienced abuse it will probably be hard. If you just have a heart it will be hard. But don't give up. It would be even harder to just quit in the middle, trust me on that.

I can't really criticize about the book really because I don't feel there's enough to actually pick apart. It's definitely recommended for younger readers, and I don't mean teen, I mean tween and below. It carries your typical ""be true to who you are"" ""and it's what's on the inside that counts"" message, which in the end is the important aspect of the book.If you have grown past the tweenage years like I have but want to drift back to childhood and read a feel good adventurous fantasy you haven't read yet, here's your book.

If you continue reading, don't bitch at me that I gave something away because I warned you. If you want to know in brief what I thought (because I know you so desperately value my opinion) here it is: beautifully written and unique novel with engaging, fully developed characters. Really, what more could you want in a novel?Okay, now down to the nitty gritty. At first I thought that this was going to be a sort of mystery novel. We know that Susie is dead, but I bet we're going to have to figure out who killed her and why! Nope. Straight off the bat Susie tells us who, what, when, where, why and how. Then I'm thinking, okay, so what's going to keep this novel going? In any other novel you pick up that has someone murdered you usually keep reading only to find out who, what, when, where, why and how. Now why am I reading this?Despite being curious about how heaven was going to be portrayed, it was the fact that I held the knowledge of Susie's death that none of the other characters held. It's the feeling of omniscience that kept me reading. So many times, along with Susie, I wanted to scream at characters, tell them to wake up! Tell them that Susie was still there, to not be sad. The novel ends up not being so plot driven as it is character driven. To have book being pushed along by characters is always a risky thing, but Sebold pulls it off beautifully.It's Susie watching them all that makes it so beautiful. She doesn't age as everyone else does. She watches her sister and can only grow up through her. She can only have experiences such as a serious boyfriend, finishing school, losing her virginity, through her sister. You feel pity for Susie during these moments. You know that she has been robbed, and you feel so angry about that.The only part that I found strange was when Susie suddenly becomes Ruth and has sex with Ray. It didn't seem to fit with the style of the novel and would have fit better in a fantasy style book or ghost story rather than what Sebold had been giving us the entire time. I wonder if Sebold didn't really know how to end it or she felt bad for Susie and wanted her to have that one moment for herself. As much as you want to give Susie that moment, I think it would have made the novel so much deeper and touching if she never got it. She's dead! She was murdered! Really, she'll never get that moment. How much more would that have meant to the reader? Of course you would be left feeling bad for Susie, but it's reality. The rest of the novel had been steeped in reality, why was this one part written to be not so?That was the only part that bothered me. Over all though, this novel was touching and an awesome read. I like books with a unique take on old stories... this is one of those. What happens when we know how the murder occured? What happens afterwards?

I'm thinking that with the success of Wardrobe Lewis gained a certain confidence as a writer that allowed him a little more freedom with his next book.There was still that story book quality to the book, but I think it was much less condescending than in the first one. Perhaps Lewis decided to trust his readers a little more and rather than spelling every litle thing out like he did in Wardrobe decided to focus more on story and let the reader put two and two together.

I decided to read them in the way they were written. I could go into long explanations on why, but, this is supposed to be a book , not a ""why I'm reading this"" .It has to be said first-off that these books are written with younger readers in mind. With that out of the way, older readers should not turn their back on it at all because they're still fun and entertaining reads. It's a classic good versus evil story set in a magical kingdom, how much more fun could you get?The simplicity of the story adds to the charm of it. It allows you to let go a little more and not fight the urge to scoff at certain happenings. while reading I often felt like a little kid again, escaping with a ""grown-up chapter book."" There's not a lot of character development and the story telling is more tell not show, even so... I enjoyed it.I think Lewis also had a hard time writing certain portions, or was trying to figure out how to write certain portions, because at times things where either summarized quickly, hurriedly written, or altogether passed over. The best example of all that is in the huge battle... where was it? Pretty much just a picture at the bottom of the page.Yet at the same time I can argue that Lewis also allows us the liberty to create our own events taking place in this world. Maybe he didn't spell it out for us as he did with so much more, but that doesn't mean it didn't take place. It's up to us to figure out exactly how it took place.Really, though, you don't need my  to tell you whether or not to read this book. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a classic.

I was a bit confused at first trying to remember the characters outside of Butler, Foaly, Artemis and Holly due to that two year gap in between readings, but I was able to quickly grasp the plot and previous incidents again. Colfer was kind in that sense, reminding us of key details we should remember, but doing it subtly enough you felt like it was just something along for the ride.I still felt the book was more geared towards children, but I could sense a little more adult humor coming through, making this a fun book to read aloud to your kids... or pets if you don't like kids but enjoy reading to your furbabies. I did find myself chuckling at different parts and I don't think that's just because I have a slightly juvenile humor.And to those of you who read the last book and didn't like that Artemis didn't change, that's something that does change in this book. We see our dear criminal teen actually start growing a heart and fondness towards those around him. Perhaps that was awakened by the hope of his beloved father coming back to him and knowing that to achieve that he would have to work in a team, and be nice about it.Yeah, a good, fun, quick read.

The only disappointment was that it seemed anti-climactic. I was expecting a little more to the ending, going out with a bang, not the relatively quiet exit that it actually had. It didn't kill the novel for me, but it did disappoint me a bit. I'm wondering if Pullman chickened out with a big ending he originally intended or someone stepped in and made him change it. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the latter because the book does deal with some pretty controversial issues. Either way everything was tied up very nicely and all my questions were answered. But he also ended it in a way that sort of left it so you can also make your own decisions on what happened or what else will happen, I liked that a lot because I felt that it meant Pullman had a lot of trust in his readers.Once again Pullman's writing did not disappoint, he explained things without spelling them out but also so even those not well versed in religion, science or fantasy could understand what he was talking about. His vivid descriptions still survived well into the last page of this last book. And even though there was a lot of jumping around from character to character it was done smoothly so the reader wasn't annoyed or left feeling jarred out of place. All of his characters grew and became even more demensional, though it did make Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter a little more confusing... were they good or were they bad? I kind of enjoyed that delicate line they balanced on.I think one of the most wonderful parts in the story was Will and Lyra's relationship. It had to be treated so carefully because while they were still kids on the cusp of becoming adults, they had just been through so much that shaped them and had them grow. The relationship just didn't happen, there were hints scattered throughout so when they finally did get together you weren't seeing it as unbelievable, you were seeing it as something you knew was coming. It also wasn't too adult, it was perfect for them. Children that weren't quite children due to what they had just been through, but not quite adults due to their age. It was heartbreaking when they wouldn't be able to be together anymore because you knew it just wasn't a young first love, it was a true and deep love they more than likely won't find again. It was because their love was so raw and undying that they were able to change the Dust and help the worlds. It was honest, true love, the love that Mary explained to them, the ""forbidden fruit"" if you will.Overall I loved this series, every character was a joy unless they were specifically supposed to be cruel and unliked, and even then they weren't annoying and I wasn't finding myself wanting to skip past the pages they were in. The fact that Pullman was able to address so many issues (especially the ones about religion) without getting preachy or dry was another thing I think made the novels truly enjoyable. As a Christian I didn't feel the need to get defensive about how he represented God and religion altogether because he presented it in a fashion that while you believed it to be true in the world of the novels, you knew it wasn't an outright attack on the beliefs of many.In the end this was a fantastic series that was very much a worthwhile and enjoyable read. I don't think it's a series that's aimed towards a specific group of people because it encompasses so much. There is bound to be something within the novel you find and bond to that keeps you reading. And, personally, as much as they say it's a children's book, I think it's totally an adult read as well. Maybe even moreso than a kid's read, you think?...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,Jul 2007,"Jul 11, 2007",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18122.The_Amber_Spyglass

In The Golden Compass we're pretty much with Lyra. Unless she was a part of the action by either being directly involved or spying on a conversation, we didn't know what was going on. But in The Subtle Knife suddenly our perspective is much wider and we're seeing what's happening in the lives of others. I enjoyed that a lot more because it allowed me to get to know and bond with other characters. And can I just say that I love Lee Scoresby and Hester? They have to be, for me, the best characters along with Iorek in the novel. I don't know why, he was just awesome! Though, because he became one of my favorites it did make the ending pretty hard to handle. Not giving anything away I hope. Also, side note, I'm super stoked that they have Sam Elliot playing him in the movie!The only real negative thing I have to say was that there were times when I felt that the story was failing and the only reason this book was written was to act as a bridge between The Golden Compass and The Amber Spyglass. A lot of explanations and things being set up that won't come into play until the last book.

That's the thing, though, these books don't work really well on their own, at least this one doesn't because it ends in a sort of cliffhanger. While there is a type of resolution, there is an overall arc being set up that goes through all three books (or so I assume).My favorite thing about the book was our introduction to dæmons. I'm an animal lover so to see people's souls represented as animals was really cool. I even went on The Golden Compass movie site and took the test to see what kind of dæmon I have. I am (have?) a raccoon named Albus! He kicks ass, and not just because he's a raccoon... named Albus. When I think about it I can really see my soul as a raccoon (sometimes a cat). But this isn't about me, is it?Pullman's writing is descriptive but not overly so. You know the kind where the descriptions are so lengthy you just don't care anymore and start passing them over? But that's not Pullman. I think one of the best examples of the way he helps you clearly visualize everything is in the part where Iorek and Iofur fight. I saw, heard, felt, even smelled everything during that fight. I was there. That's the mark of a brilliant writer, someone, who in a few words, can transport you to a place you've never been before and watch something you've never even had a glimpse of before.Overall it was a great book, and a wonderful introduction to what's going to be a great series.

I didn't really take anything away from reading this and found my mind often drifting away. I often had to go back and reread what I had just read because I honestly didn't remember having read it.

Despite Mamet's bashing of the institution you need to remember that school can teach you different methods and styles of acting, giving you a variety of skills to fall back on. The new actor should never push themselves into a corner of one style of acting. As for the older actor (i.e. one who has been studying/acting for a while) Mamet's book may not be the new lesson you're looking for.

Remembering how amusing and fascinating that read had been (I recommened it to several friends who have the same weird sense of humor and morbid curiosities I do) I had a feeling this book would not disappoint. And it didn't.First off I'm going to give the same disclaimer Roach did: this is not a book written to debate various moral, religious, or philisophical beliefs. It's not meant to prove or disprove life after death, the existence of souls, or if heaven is out there. Rather it explores the various research that have been imployed to discover that. It's meant to shed light and simply learn. Okay, with that out of the way, I can safely begin!If you had started reading Roach's other book, Stiff and just found it to icky to go through with it, have no fear, you'll be safer with this book. There are a few moments you're a little disgusted, but the amount of times you'll be laughing, shaking your head, or simply saying ""wow"" definitely out weigh any squick moments. It's Roach's sarcastic wit that really makes the book an enjoyable and fun read. Her footnotes (that really read more like sidenotes) are a real treat constantly scattered throughout. Her approach and way of writing non-fiction subject matter is dealt with in a really nice way that even those who cannot stand anything dealing with real life will find the book hard to put down. There's almost a constant narrative and a steady stream of thought going on, something I think is made possible because instead of just constantly regurgitating facts a lot of what she's writing about she went and experienced first hand. It's the personal twist on everything she writes about that makes it a lot more interesting and easy to get into.There were the inevitable dry moments that were scattered throughout. Those mostly came about when Roach began giving the scientific explanations that were needed to explain the theories and research being done. I did feel kind of dumb reading some of this as it was way over my head some of the times, but Roach managed to remedy that by poking fun at her own ignorance. The fact that even the author was a little confused at times makes you feel a lot better for not getting it.I don't feel the book really opened any new beliefs for me, or pointed out anything I hadn't thought of before. For me, the book more or less explored the actual studies that went into what different people think happen to us after we die. No new school of thought is introduced to us in this book. That still doesn't make this book old and nothing we haven't heard before. I actually learned quite a bit. Especially with how long people have actually been trying to find the soul (and the various places people have put it in the body), my knowledge of Spiritualism has been greatly increased, and the fact that there are funded studies still being done out there to research the soul and life after death is fascinating. If this sounds interesting to you, even in the slightest, you will really enjoy this book then. Even if it doesn't sound interesting, Roach's style and humor will probably pull you in anyway....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Aug 2007,"Jun 14, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14990.Spook

The whole book contains messages that transcend all age and gender boundaries.Large font, small pages, and short chapters could classify this book as a quick, yet moving, beach read.

AND JUST FOR THE RECORD: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!I could not put this book down. I disagree with the statement that the ending was predictable. On the contrary I was pleasantly surprised that Jacob and Marlena ended up together because I thought the book was going to follow the format of those ""never meant to be"" loves. You know, where they hook up, yearn for each other, but can't grow old together.I think the biggest disappointment I had with the book was Marlena's relative weakness. I think I would have loved the book even more had she been written as a stronger woman. Though I think her nature reflected that of most women back in the 30s. Still, I got annoyed by the frequent crying she did. I was proud of her for standing up to August in the end. Even so, Marlena's weakness didn't stop me from loving the book.What drew me in the most was our flash forwards to 93-year-old (or is it 90?) Jacob. With the exception of his grouchiness everything about him reminded me of my grandfather, who past away last Thanksgiving at 97. It was the fact that he was failing physically but was holding on strong mentally that kept making me think of this man I admired so much. Also, Jacob's undying love for his wife was extremely remeniscent of my grandfather's relationship with my grandmother. If you have elderly loved ones this is just another reason for you to pick up this book. It will probably make you want to call up said loved one and talk to them about their past and their memories. Hopefully it will also strike a note to those who have ignored/forgotten/set aside their loved ones for so long, as Jacob's family has done with him.Animal lovers beware with this book. As much as Jacob loves and has a passion for the animals he cares for, there is also a lot of animal abuse that takes place throughout the novel. Being a huge animal rights activist and just all around animal lover, I knew that the animals probably weren't going to be treated very well seeing as 70 years ago animals in the circus were only taken care of as long as they were bringing in a profit, even then... But despite having prepared myself, I was still caught of guard often. So just know that upon picking up this book. The happy animal moments do outweigh the cruelty, though, and if you know animal behavior at all you'll find yourself giggling and cheering quite a bit.On a final note, this book is being praised as a romance novel, but it's so much more than that. There are so many layers and characters in this book that to shove it in that one exclusive category could turn away a lot of potential readers who will love this book. If you're a lover of animals, the elderly, adventure, circuses, the Great Depression, or even drunks, pick up this book and you'll find yourself hooked....more",Notes are private!,0,231,1,not set,Aug 2007,"Jun 09, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants

It was one of those bittersweet novels that leave you feeling uniquely satisfied while also feeling incomplete. Hard to describe.I keep wanting to say it was as good, if not better, than The Kite Runner, but that's not true. For me personally, it felt just shy of being equal to The Kite Runner. Maybe it was because I was so busy while reading this book and never really had time to really sit down and enjoy it. I know that can often affect how great you think a book is.The only other small problem I found was that it dragged in the middle a bit. It didn't seem to have any thread pulling it along and keeping it anchored to the beginning and solidly tying it to the end.Besides that the book was awesome, especially the ending. Be warned where you finish this book because you will get teared up if you're not already crying. The part that really did me in was Jalil's letter. It was heart-breaking to read. The end also fills you with a sense of hope and rebirth.I hope Hosseini continues to write about the Afghanistan and people that most Americans down know. It's not just some far away land on a map full of gun-toting people. It's a homeland for many people who just want peace, they want things the way they once were. Are we helping them achieve that dream? Or are we just another of an endless cycle of outsiders?

With The Stolen Child being his first novel Donohue definitely does not burst quietly on to the scene. The only problem he may encounter for any future novels is that he now has set the bar pretty high for himself now. A problem not uncommon in the writing world.What drew me to this book was the unique storyline and I was not disappointed. Plot, characters, writing, you name it, were all fully developed and interesting. You find yourself drawn to both Henry's and liking them both equally, which was another thing I liked about the book, it didn't force you to choose one over the other.At times the book did drag a bit, parts seemingly forced in to create a bridge between plot points or something. At least those bits weren't that long and I still wanted to continue reading.The most remarkable thing about the novel were the changelings themselves. Trapped in the unaging bodies of children, they often act like kids, mischeivous, playful, but they also spoke and acted like adults, conversing sometimes like a group of people you would expect to find in wheelchairs at a nearby rest home. The combination was perfect, never seemed forced and always believable. Had it not been that way, I think the novel would have been awful.But it wasn't, so yay! It was a good read. If you like folk lore and Lord of the Flies you'll more than likely like this book.

Don't get me wroI think this was one of those books that was praised so much by the time I read it it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong, it was good... but, not what I was hoping for.There were two problems I had with the book. One was that there were moments I found unneccessary that just caused the book to drag. I read this in October so I can't recall any specific instances. The best example I can give were the parts following Norah. I didn't find myself connected to them at all, and I think that also relates to the second problem I had with the book...So much of the book was about Norah's downward spiral after ""losing"" one of her children. I don't know why, but I had such a huge problem that she couldn't get over it. Before you attack me and say stuff like: ""Well that's because you're not a mom, you don't know the bond that is created!"" Let me say that, yes, that is why. I haven't birthed anything. I've lost people close to me and it hurts and is hard to get over... but you do keep on going and eventually life goes on and you can maintain the balance you had before hand. You would think that yes, losing a child you gave birth to is hard, but it wouldn't be as hard as one that you raised as well, you know? And you would also think that the consolation of still having that son would be something that would help you start to recover quicker.I could completely understand why Dr. Henry was upset after that day. Guilty conscience. But Norah's continuous moping for the years to come... I don't get it. It was why I enjoyed the parts following Caroline and Phoebe. Also because their story felt like it was continuing and growing while the story of the Henry family just sort of sat there... in the doldrums.You could easily look at that and say it was Edward's choice, and I accept that. I can even see it and understand it. The comparison of the two family's is full of such stark contradiction, that you can see the consequences one action can have and different people. How the same action can be a blessing and a curse.With that said, I'm going to say that you really need to form your own opinion about this book, which you should do with every book I . You also need to understand that this is my opinion and I'm entitled to it. Obviously there have been a lot of other people who enjoyed this book, so take my  with a grain of salt.

This could be the quick beach read many people are seeking out this summer. Though if you're easily driven to tears than you may want to leave it at home.Anywho, this  is probably going to be shorter than the summary given because I honestly don't have much to say about the book. It was good, no doubt about that. Albom's reflective and sentimental writing up to his usual par (though I only have The Five People You Meet in Heaven to compare it to). And it's got messages for the reader to take out of it.There was still something missing. Perhaps it was the briefness of the book that kept me from becoming attached to the characters. The only reason I probably did become involved in the book, and others will too, is that there are many different issues just about anyone can relate to. Even then the characters aren't that sympathetic, or at least our protagonist Charley. He of course was full of faults, but that was what he was mostly full of. To have a character you like a lot and become attached to there has to be an even balance of pluses and minuses to their person. Had we a little more time to get to know Charley, perhaps he would have developed more and we would have become a little more involved.So yeah, good book, usual Mitch Albom style, hurrah.

That's the summarized version, but for those of you who want a little more I will go into detail...I thought a novel about Eleanor of Aquitaine would be a powerful story pushed along by a powerful character. There really was no central conflict that the story flowed along so it was going to have to be the characters that made it interesting and unfortunately it fell flat a lot of the time. Eleanor was the most well-rounded of everyone and a couple of times even she came across two-demensional and the story line fell. It really felt that Margaret Ball was trying to highlight everything in Eleanor's early reign and that was just too much. In historical fiction you don't need to do that. It's why it's called historical fiction.Despite all that it was still an interesting read. Eleanor is, like a said, a powerful and fascinating character. The fact that she constantly took control (or tried to take control) of her own life and future, really unheard of back then, is at least one reason you may enjoy this novel. Our dear Louis VII is another reason to keep reading, he's just so catty and evil, yet sweet and charming. A very bipolar character almost. You also have the cocky Henry II popping up randomly and lightening things up, along with a few other fun characters.In the end it's a good historical fiction novel that comes across more historical than fiction which I think is what often times causes it to fall flat. Still give it a try though, and tell me what you think....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Mar 2008,"Jun 09, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/213064.Duchess_of_Aquitaine

It may touch those of us who have loved and owned animals a little more, but don't let that stop you non-animal people. Richards unique, witty and warm writing style immediately draws you in and makes you feel like you're a close friend and she's telling you a quick anecdote from her own life. In reality it's a long story, but it will suck you in and before you know it, your at the last page hoping Susan isn't done.I was raised around horses, and my aunt, mother, and father all are horse lovers as well so this book really hit home for me. If you check my writing section there's a more indepth story about my experience with horses if you want to check that out and maybe share your own experiences.Richards's as a smart way of writing that doesn't try and show off any clever literary turns that some writer's try and do. It makes you like her even more and draws you into her story even more. She never asks you to pity her, nor does she ever want you to like her. By all means there are things she talks about doing that should make you hate her or just plain not really care about her. In the end though you're crying for her loss of Lay Me Down, but smiling at the fact Lay Me Down has brought her something she never thought she would ever had.Through her beautiful words Richards's story flows smoothly and if you're as drawn in as I was you'll finish it within hours if not a day.

Ignore the summary of the book, or most of the summary at least. It's written to sound like another Da Vinci Code with hundred year old secrets being unearthed... but that's not the case. Yes, Thomas Jefferson is involved... but maybe a page's worth altogether, not even enough to merit being mentioned on the back cover. I think if you pick up the book expecting old American mysteries being uncovered, you will be greatly disappointed, as my mom was. That's why she told me... and I wasn't disappointed with the book. It was actually a good read. I'm not all that into mysteries, especially modern day ones with cliched twists. But this book still kept me relatively interested. A couple of times I was surprised with the things unearthed and revealed, but a lot of times I saw the ""twist"" coming. Those of you who are huge mystery buffs and could probably out-Sherlock Mr. Holmes himself will probably find this book rather tedious after the first dozen chapters after everything had been set up. This is a book I would classify as a light mystery that makes you feel smart... or dumb depending on how knowledgeable you are about the government and history. Okay, so it's a light mystery for smart people, a complicated and confusing read for those who are ignorant to things besides Paris Hilton's latest shopping excursion. For me it was kind of in the middle, I'm far from dumb, I do know my history fairly well and I'm not completely ignorant on the goings-on of the government, though I think not knowing that much helped me suspend reality with this book. Any government official who may read this book will probably be thinking, ""You can't do that!"" ""The president is not allowed to..."" ""That's not even plausible in this day and age!"" throughout their entire read. A bonus point was that the characters were not your stereotypical leads in a mystery novel. None of them could be described as glamorous. The book had just enough action to keep you reading but not so much you became overwhelmed and bored with it right away. It also starts with a bang, and that first chapter may be a good indication of whether or not you're going to like the book. So if you're not dumb or a government official (don't even start with the comments that those are the same thing) more than likely you'll find this book a fun read.

Once again your favorite characters return (the living ones at least) and the Lytton family drama is in full force. The books seem to focus specifically on three distinct generations while keeping the other ones fresh on the surface and not letting them get too far away. No Angel of course focused on the original Lyttons in their prime such as Oliver, Sebastian, LM and of course Celia. Then Something Dangerous added a little more focus on their children. Of course you can guess that Into Temptation held a stronger spotlight on that third generation of Lyttons. Though, throughout the novels, two characters break down that generation gap and continue to steal focus, two of the strongest and of course my favorites: Celia and Barty. One thing I felt made this book a little stronger was that all the stories were so interconnected. Something happened to someone or they did something and it causes a ripple effect. The other books had a touch of that, but the stories seemed to only be tied together as they were happening to members of the same family. Of course I enjoyed the other books, but the fact this one had more of a linear storyline and things were caused by the decisions and actions of other made this story flow so much more and a lot more interesting to read. More interesting to read because even though you may be following a character you're not quite as fond of, you want to know what's happening to them because of what a character you love did. Does that make sense? My only problem with this book in general was it still held a very old fashioned quality to it, it did not seem like it had entered into the latter half of the 20th century, those years following WWII, even though that was the time it was supposed to be in. Also, the Americans (the actual Americans) seemed very British to me. I thought Vincenzi would have taken more opportunities to show the differences of cultures and generations. She occasionally did it with the generations, but not so much with the cultures. Perhaps she was focusing on so much to begin with that adding that in may have been a little too much. Overall though, I loved this book. It was the perfect ending to a fantastic trilogy.

I think it had something to do with the characters, though. As I begin to think about it I realize the characters seem different because we're looking at them in a new light. So no matter what order you read the books in, prepare for a bit of change.There was still something about No Angel that made it less enjoyable than Something Dangerous and think it's partially my fault for having read Something Dangerous first. Like I said some of the characters change and some are added or taken away. There also seemed to be a lot more lulls in the novel; a lot more times I found myself putting the book down out of boredom.That minor criticism aside, the book still had a lot going for it and was still a really good read. Vincenzi has a really nice way of showing the reader and not telling them. She doesn't rely constantly on long details and descriptions and instead lets the character, setting, situation, etc. speak for itself.One thing that was intriguing, that the book pointed out, was how much the publishing industry of the early 20th century is like the TV/movie business of today. The amount of promotion and effort that went into it was really interesting. And it reminds you of how reading and books used to be one of the top forms of entertainment.

It had too many underdeveloped characters, was anti-climactic, and at times a little too message happy. But it wasn't totally lacking in being an entertaining read and often I did find myself riveted. That pretty much sums it up, but for the sake of the more curious I will elaborate.Zigal's writing was good and flowed quite nicely, though the timeline didn't. I often found myself asking, ""Why isn't this guy at work?"" And while he did try his best at fully fledged characters I think he overwhelmed himself by putting too many in there, so most of them only became half developed at best. The only one that achieved three demensional status was our protagonist himself and I think that's only because we had some insight into his inner thoughts and feelings.My other big problem was with the resolution being too anti-climactic. I expected some sort of bang, not a pathetic fizzling out. If you want to analyze it, I guess you could say that's because most dark political dealings are resolved quietly under the table. You would think, though, to make the book a bit more exciting, Zigal would have had the resolution out in the open in some sort of dramatic affair.As for my thoughts about the book being too ""message happy"" at times, that comes from the constant bombardment of ""working class blacks: good; uptown rich whites: bad."" Don't take that as me being racist, by all means I'm not, but beating your readers over the head with that can get a little old, fast. Especially when your characters don't really do anything to resolve any sort of racist issues until the end. They don't even start! I wouldn't have minded the message as much if we had someone attempting to resolve it all.Zigal does redeem himself, though, by giving us a nice clean ending. All loose ends are appropriately tied and we know that things work out, which is always a nice thing in a book. The book does get a little dry and boring at times, but the issues and situations we're dealing with throughout the novel will keep you reading.

I just want to start with that and get it cleared out of the way. It wasn't just a sniff and the threat of tearsBy the end of this book I was crying. I just want to start with that and get it cleared out of the way. It wasn't just a sniff and the threat of tears, I had actual tears running down my face and snot streaming out of my nose. I was leaking enough that I actually had to put the book down and go grab some tissues.This book is very emotional, not just with how it makes the reader feel, but with how it's written. There was something unique about Oates writing that reflected a purely emotional connection. The way sentences and phrases were repeated was reminescent of the speech of someone in a highly emotional state. It reminded me of when I am very angry or upset and am trying to convey something towards the source of my anger/sadness/passion and I feel the need to repeat what I find so important, even if it's really a minor issue. That was how Oates writing felt a lot of the times. It's probably why I found myself getting upset, frustrated, curious, or sad, because she wrote in a way to help push those emotions to the front.Of course the subject matter really increased my emotions. The things this family went through and how they dealt with is enough to break your heart just hearing about it, let alone suddenly becoming very involved. All the characters are sympathetic, even Michael Sr., who is pretty easy to hate. Everyone we encounter is flawed and real and that makes you feel for them so much more. Of course the one you feel for the most is Marianne, the true victim in all of this. Yet, somehow she manages to move on with her life and become the strongest of all the Mulvaneys. She's filled with hope and love and the fact she maintains that after her rape and then the odd rejection of her family is truly amazing.The last part of the book and the ending was very bittersweet. As much as you want to be happy you can't help feeling something is just not letting you achieve that. It's probably the same thing the Mulvaneys are feeling by the end. Somehow we've become the Mulvaneys by just a few chapters into the book, so truly whatever they're feeling, you're now feeling. That just got you all the more involved in the book, because of course you want to know everything that happens and why. It also makes the book that much harder to put down.I've read Foxfire and want to reread it now, but I remember it's tone and style being extremely different from We Were the Mulvaneys. I haven't read any of Oates other works, though. Do they all vary from each other? Do they live up to the greatness of We Were the Mulvaneys? Should I try out her other works, or am I just destined to be disappointed after this book? I would love to hear your opinions on Oates other works as well as what you thought of We Were the Mulvaneys. Did y'all enjoy it as much as I did and have it affect you like it did me?

I happened to see Watership Down lying around and thought... Easter? Book about bunnies? Perfect! But seriously, who thought a book about rabbits could be so engaging. I was literally sucked in and didn't want to put the book down.The thing that made this book so interesting was that Adams barely anthropomorphized his rabbits. Rarely did a human characteristic pop up and when it did you barely noticed it. Adams definitely had to be careful about that seeing as human-like rabbits could easily turn the novel hokey and cartoonish. It's the fact that he doesn't though that invests you in the novel and these interesting little creatures we know of but know nothing about.Adams also has an incredibly detailed and descriptive way of writing that helps you picture and see every rabbit, action, location, object, whatever! It's beautiful and flows wonderfully so before you know it you're suddenly twenty pages along and you're wondering how that happened.The most important thing in the end, though, is the rabbits, our main focus throughout the novel. They carry it. The characterization of each individual rabbit is amazing! They all were unique and different and I bonded to each one (well except those certain few, but even those were sympathetic every once and a while and you found yourself liking them).I need to stop because I could rave and rave about this book. I'm sure if I thought about it more and longer I could think of things I didn't like, but honestly... I'm drawing a blank, I loved the book. Disregard the fact that it's about rabbits.

I would have preferred it to go more in depth so I could become more involved, but it never did so I never did. It was a unique storyline, taking old Celtic myths and putting them into a modern setting, acknowledging the entire time how weird it is.

The writing itself was really nice, dealing with complex issues so that the average reader could understand it, but not spelling it out to make you feel dumb. The characters, while not completely developed, all had flaws and more than one demension to them, thus helping you become invested in them.Now with that out of the way let me talk about the problem, which I think can be covered by one thing. The book was very underdeveloped, it was not flushed out enough. I'm saying that despite the acting not really starting to pick up until the latter half of the book. The entire first half I kept asking myself, ""What's the point?"" There was really no clear conflict, rather several small ones lazily floating around. The only main idea I could pull out was the idea of security and where it really lay. What could really make someone safe?There were a lot of little plots running around, none ever really coming into full light and being addressed. And I didn't feel that any of the feeble conflicts that did come up were ever properly resolved, especially the ending which was so abrupt and out of the blue (especially if you're not paying close attention to the few small hints in the novel) that you feel robbed of something.I think this novel needed more developement and a lot of cutting down of the various storylines. Raban obviously had a lot to tell, but you could tell his focus was split into too many directions. Had he just focused the novel on one or two of these ideas, he would have been able to add so much more to this story. Ending it with a solid, satisfying, complete feeling.I would especially like feedback from other people about this book.

Something Dangerous is one of those books.One problem, that was easily overcome though, was that this is the second book in a trilogy, I didn't know that when I started reading it. I thought it was sort of weird how there were certain references made every once and a while that were being referred to as if the author knew what it was. Even so, I found the book did really well on it's own. I loved it.Every character, at least by the end of the book, was fully developed. I found that fascinating because Vincenzi had well over two dozen characters to keep track of. The reason I say by the end of the novel they become three demensional, is that while you're getting to know some of the characters (especially the twins) they seem just really shallow. But then again, that's what they are when the novel first starts. They are shallow, naive, young, but as they experience things such as the depression, marriage, children, love, and World War II, they begin to change and grow and step out of that sheltered mold they had been in for so long.Despite it being 710 pages (at least my edition) it's a hard book to put down. But, also being that long there are the moments when it gets a bit dull, they were few and far between though so I really didn't mind them. Also because so much of the book was so absorbing you just kind of pass over the dull moments.I honestly think that this book can be read on it's own. The way Vincenzi writes it, doesn't really rely on the other books, or at least the prior novel. But by the time you're finished with this book you are dying to read the others.

One thing that was particularly unique and enjoyable was our narrator. She was an actual character but having died before the story began gave her an omniscience that allowed the reader to see past the first person perspective.The book was slow to start and there were so many characters that any time to get to know and bond with them never happened.

His incorporation of real historical figures was flawless and didn't seemed stretched at any time. They blended seemlessly with the fictional ones, and never appeared out of character. At least they didn't for me, maybe those of you who are HUGE history buffs about certain figures would be able to tell more.The thing that was disturbing about the novel was how real it was. Not in the way it was written, but when you read the postscript at the end about these historical figures and their own personal timelines, you can see how likely the book could have been reality if things had only been slightly different.If you're planning on reading the book and find yourself losing your focus on it in the beginning, finding it getting dry, I advise you to hold on. For me it finally picked up by chapter 7 and just kept going from there. And there are bits in the beginning that are a little more exciting and I found those enough to keep reading.In the end I think this is a book that will always garner different reactions and opinions. It's not about the way it's written, the characters or the storyline, it's just going to be if you liked it or you didn't. For me, it was good, but I just didn't think it was that good....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2007,"May 30, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26913.The_Plot_Against_America

There was no pussy-footing around with this book, it started off with a bang. Or an explosion. Or rather the informing of an explosion.This isn't a story about grief and loss. At least it's not just about grief and loss. There's a mystery. There's things we need to find out. We follow Kathryn as she not only deals with the death of her beloved husband, but has to deal with the aftermath that her life was not as it seemed. That it wasn't totally a tragic accident.It's a novel that sucks you in in a way you don't know why you've been sucked in but you really don't want to get out. The characters, every character, are rich and full. You truly like Kathryn because she's not perfect, therefor you can relate to her and you can truly sympathize with her struggle. And like her, you want to seek out the truth. What's really going on?From the writing, to the story, to the characters, Anita Shreve truly does a remarkable job. Her descriptions are gorgeous, you don't even have to have seen a picture of anything she describes to get an image of it, she tells it perfectly and you can form it easily.The only true flaw at all, and it's very debatable, is that I wasn't fond with the ending. It almost felt as if Shreve was fishing for a bunch of explanations that didn't even fit and just sort of threw them all together. Suddenly everything was happening at once and I wasn't quite sure what to make of it all. It almost felt that there was too much closure. With such raw reality that Shreve had been dealing with this whole time, such a finite ending didn't seem to fit. But I'm sure a lot of people appreciated the way it ending, a true open and shut case that gave them the same sense of closure Kathryn got.Either way, this book is a definite must-read. So engaging you'll wonder how you read it so fast....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"May 30, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5191.The_Pilot_s_Wife

If you enjoy mysteries yet don't want something too deep than this is perfect for you. To be honest I liked it so much that I'm curious to check out the sequels. A small warning to guys though: this book does tend to err on the side of Chick-Lit, so if you don't like that, you probably won't like this.One thing Collins did was try to steer clear of unintentional cliches. Of course when you do hit them it seemed like Collins knew it was cliched so would address it in a fashion that wouldn't make the reader roll their eyes. The book felt fresh and new in the bogged down world of mystery Chick-Lit. Though, to tell the truth, I can't compare much.Another pleasant surprise was that there wasn't one of those huge plot twists where a character you think you trust and you think is completely innocent ends up being the murderer. That actually ended up being a relief from all the writers who do that. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of twists and turns throughout the story that keep you (and Abby) guessing.In conclusion I have to say that my favorite part of the book was our introduction to Simon the cat. If you're a cat lover he's reason enough to read this book. His parts were always good for a giggle. Please tell me he continues his appearances in the other books. Also, just tell me how the other books compare to this one. Like I said, I enjoyed this book enough to check out the others.

Yet... it was awesomely bizzare and I loved it!Middlesex, for me, read like a car wreck (mind you, a car wreck I sped through) because I couldn't look away. There are so many odd twists, turns and curiosities you feel that if you blink you'll miss something. The very first sentence in the book sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the end, all the while setting the tone for the whole novel...""I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January of 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974.""That line alone should have told me what I was in store for but I still found myself practically gasping aloud, rereading sentences to make sure I ""heard"" right, and looking around as if to ask if anyone else had just ""saw"" what I saw. I didn't expect this from a book I debated about reading for a while. I'm sure you're doing the same thing. If you have the book in hand right now and are wondering if you should read it, do yourself a favor and open it up. I'll give you a couple chapters, if you're either not hooked or seriously too disturbed to keep going, then put it down. I'm going to guess I won't see you for a little while.Of course there are the occasional dry parts. Accounting the whole lifetime of a person (fictional or otherwise) can be a tedious process and it can be hard to figure out what to put in and what to leave out. In Cal/Callie's case, practically every moment that happens to her, her parents and her grandparents set into motion what basically makes Callie into Cal, so who is Eugenides to judge what stays in and what goes? Those dry parts are few and far between though, so no worries.The narration also flows smoothly from an adult Cal/Callie to the younger version without hiccups or the odd imbalance that can sometimes occur when trying to make the same character a different character. Eugenides does it with grace so that you can continue to drive that car through the wreck without any speedbumps or odd debris.I'm not going to say too much more about the book because so much happens I may accidently give something away. My final note is that this book was so realistic at times I had to wonder if this wasn't an autiobiography of some true person actually walking around out there.

Those who are not Christian and/or not into Christian-Lit may read the summary for this book and immediately be deterred thinking that there's a lot more preaching than storyline. That is definitely not the case and actually one reason I enjoyed this book a little more than I enjoyed the Left Behind series.Judgement Day stays away from preaching, and even though the Christian group are the protagonists of the novel, they are not without fault or blame and are far from perfect, yet another reason I really liked this novel. The only flaws that I found in the book were the timeline was a bit stretched and confusing (I'm a reader who prefers a clear timeline), the scientific mumbo-jumbo went a little over my head (it was kept to a minimum though), and the name of one of the characters went back and forth between Faith and Ruth a couple of times (though that may have just been my book which was an Advanced Reader edition).I warn you though, this book is big and hard to put down. And like I said at the beginning, because it is supposed to be geared towards Christian readers, don't let that stop you. I'd say this book is more Science Fiction that Christian-Lit. I think comparing this novel to Left Behind isn't really neccessary because the only similarity I found was it was set in a somewhat Apocalyptic world. Unlike Left Behind it doesn't really follow the predictions set out by Revelations nor is it full of ""repent or die"" sentiments and many visions. I think David has written in a way that's friendlier to the non-Christian readers that are curious about picking up the book.I've read that this is supposed to become a series, and I would love to see where David continues to take the characters and plot he has started with, but at the same time I'm not against keeping this book as a stand-alone novel, because it holds its own quite well....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jun 2007,"May 30, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/634274.Judgment_Day

Gap Creek was definitely one of those really good reads. For me it was also a short, quick read. Started it Friday night, was done with it the next night.The book is driven by Julie Richards nee Harmon, a multilayered character that seems so much older than her seventeen years. She does work without complaint, hard work, and for the most part accepts what life has given to her. But at the same time she worries and frets and is naive about things. She's young but old, something that makes her so real. Despite the book taking place over the span of a year, Julie is at an age and at a change in her life where so much growth can take place. And it does. We see her not only step up to her new life, but grow up to match it.The writing at first is a little difficult to get into, written from Julie's perspective in that turn-of-the-century Southern talk that can come across as uneducated at times. There's also talk of chopping trees and butchering and preparing a hog, things that are completely outside of the average reader's knowledge and comfort zone. Morgan describes it all with such natural ease the reader can picture it all. It's actually his indepth descriptions that really pull you into the book. He writes everything, every sense- smell, sight, touch, sound, even taste when they're eating dinner. You aren't allowed to observe with Julie, you're right there next to her experiencing it all.There's not really much else to praise about the book, nor is there much to criticize. It was a genuinely good read: unique, well-written and enjoyable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 05, 2010","Feb 06, 2010","May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77398.Gap_Creek

This had to have been one of the most boring books I have ever written. So boring I couldn't even make myself finish it. It wasn't just every page or paragraph that made me tired, it was every word. There was no life to any of the writing in this book.Of course I understand that it's non-fiction, I didn't go into this book expecting some sort of romantic, action-filled romp. I didn't even expect that much drama despite dealing with a combination of theater and feminism. But I did expect something... and I got nothing.The entire book reads like a high school students report, though the content and language reads more at university level. There are so many source notes throughout the book that there is near fifty extra pages added to the book to actually cite the sources. The fact that it became saturated with psychology and began to get really wordy also didn't help keep it from feeling like a report.There were a few interesting tidbits scattered throughout but for the life of me I really can't recall them. I'm really disappointed at how dry and uninteresting this book was because the actual subject matter deals with two things I'm really interested in, theater and women's rights. Yet as fascinating as those things are when dealt with in a dull fashion... I couldn't bear it.Really, there's nothing much else to say. Don't say I gave up, though, because I did get through more than half the book and when I found it wasn't improving (getting worse actually) I just couldn't stand it. I've got loads of other and better books that I want to start on.

I don't really know if I can say more than that really. I was so surprised by how into this book I got. The only reason it took me so long to read it was because I didn't have a lot of time to sit down and read it.This is almost one of those novels you just have to read to know what I'm talking about. I'm still trying to figure out why I liked it so much.There were multiple story lines coming out of one central plot, but all of them were developed, interesting and added to the story in unique ways. The same goes for all the characters, you pretty much appreciated them all in their own ways. Though it was kind of hard with Jack who was an ass and Reggie who was plain annoying, but then again that just made the characters.Smith's writing was one of my favorite and one of the best things about Delicious. He's so vivid and descriptive about things so you have no trouble seeing it. It's actually both a blessing and a curse to the reader, specifically in his descriptions of food and eating (which crops up a lot) and it can either make you hungry or sick depending on how he wants you to feel. The same goes towards his descriptions of people, settings and sex.Maybe I kept reading this book because I was drawn to it the same way people are drawn to a car accident or Paris Hilton. And more than likely you'll be drawn to it too. I'll warn you again, though, despite the wry, weird humor running rampant in the novel, the kind that makes you laugh while shaking your head, there is a lot of sex, some violence and much profanity.

How I was able to do that so easily, I will never know because the second time around this book ended up being difficult to put down.Isabel Allende has created a very engaging and well-rounded character in Eliza Sommers. I found the most endearing thing about Eliza was her stubborness and her imperfections. Often that is what will draw me to a character because it makes them real, and I found Eliza couldn't be more real if she had even stepped off the page.Every character that Eliza encountered helped to enrich her life and each one added more to the story that kept you reading, but obviously the one you bonded to the most was the one who held a story of his own: Tao Chi'en. The bond those two created could drive you crazy and was really kept me reading until the very end.Without giving anything away I'll finish off by saying this book is written like Eliza has developed: raw and real. Allende is not afraid to stray from the ""Hollywood"" style of story telling, with everything working out as it should or the way the reader wants it to end. There are bumps and blips throughout the story that will drive you true-heart romantics out of your mind, but those of us who crave a certain reality in our stories will love it.In the end this story will make you feel good, even better than your typical ""feel good"" book because you feel like you can tell yourself, this is real... maybe it really did happen......more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,Oct 2007,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16527.Daughter_of_Fortune

It's a classic, the idea behind it is genius (as well as legendary) and everyone I've talked to I was disappointed that I didn't like this book more. It's a classic, the idea behind it is genius (as well as legendary) and everyone I've talked to about it absolutely adores the book. Despite the short-comings I had with Catch-22 it was still good and definitely lived up to it's earned titled as a classic.Perhaps my main problem with it was that it took me ages to read the book. Maybe because I started it around the beginning of the holiday season where life in general takes on a busy rush with little downtime. That and also, it's a book that once you start reading you can definitely stay absorbed and engaged, but finding the will and energy to pick it up... well- that was pretty difficult. It almost felt, to me, like required reading from high school- you knew you were going to enjoy it once you started reading it, but it was a brand of homework that you (or at least I) always struggled to avoid. But yes- once I did start reading it I enjoyed it, despite my difficulty following it on nights I was almost too tired to keep my vision focused.Yossarian, I felt was the perfect person to follow throughout our story. Non-threatening, not overly-neurotic, funny and clever, yet angry and assertive, he was a great counter balance to all the interesting and random people that came in and out of his service life. There were a lot of people, though. Or at least it felt like there were a lot of people, and that was part of the problem keeping up with the book. Especially the commanding officers. Often they blurred together and I couldn't keep them apart from one another. Certain ones popped up that I never remembered being introduced to, and others just disappeared... Major Major anyone? But at least Yossarian was a reassuring constant who kept the book afloat. After all there was really no plot-line doing that, the ""story"" all rested on Yossarian. And while I was annoyed by the huge amount of characters, they still all felt needed, so I just took it as a neccessary evil. The growth of Yossarian was also really moving. There is no given time frame, only the amount of missions being raised, so the reader doesn't know how long Yossarian has been flying. But his personality and nature in the beginning changes and evolves to something obviously more jaded and matured (and of course worn down) by the end of the book, but still maintaining the spitfire personality we first saw.Hands down the best aspect of this book was Heller's writing. Not only is our central problem the issue of Catch-22, but everything is written as it's own small version of a Catch-22. The steady flow of hypocrisies and ironies were beautifully and humorously written. The creativity and genius that was involved in the writing definitely marked Heller as an author to be reckoned with. It was his crafting of the overall novel that encouraged me to seek out his other works to see how if his writing changes, which I kind of hope because the style he chose for this book really could only fit this book.Let me give this advice if you're reading this book or thinking about reading it. Do it. Keep going. The ending definitely picks up a bit more of a storyline to push you through those last chapters. Plus- Heller's writing is phenomenal, his words, structures, characters all worth seeing through until the end because they stay strong and do not become old and hackneyed.I'm glad I read this classic. I may even read it again in a couple years (not during the holidays) and see how I enjoy it then. My boss (who says this is her favorite book) tells me it gets better with every reading so I hope the same is true with me....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2009,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/168668.Catch_22

Mind you, it's just the latest in an apparant series of book following Cotton Malone's adventures. Perhaps that's why I never really got all that involved in the book was because I had never really gotten to know the characters and there were just so many that I was expected to.Even so, with the plot jumping to three different places and three seperate storylines (for the most part until they join together at the end) I was just pulled in too many directions. I didn't know who I really wanted to follow, root for, or trust.Probably the most annoying aspect of this book was Pam. She just pissed me off. She never listened to Malone, thus majorly messing up plans and almost getting herself (and others) killed. In a way I wish she was killed that way she would have been out of our hair.The last quarter of the book does make up for all the annoyances. The Library of Alexandria has always been something that fascinated me. A place with all old world knowledge stored up and lost. What we could have learned had we not lost the library, where we could be right now, it's amazing to think about. It was the main reason I wanted to read this book and it's the main reason I kept reading. I was extremely pleased they did focus on the library at the end, and we actually got to see it!Still... okay book, just too much. I'm sure for those following the adventures of Cotton Malone the book will be so much more worthwhile. But for those of you who plan on making the mistake I made and thinking this book would mainly address the lost library, you're wrong.

Every word, while informative, is rich and enticing, keeping you hooked.Another thing Egan did really well was keeping thing easy to understand. There were a few moments where I was a little lost, but for the most part everything was clear and allowed me to fall into this strange world that actually existed less than 80 years ago.One thing that drew me into this book was that this was about my grandparents generation. They weren't in the Dust Bowl, but a fair share of this book is about the Depression itself, and that effected everyone in the country. The fact that this massive drought occured at the same time of the Depression is almost unbelievable. But even if you don't have any personal ties to the Depression or the Dustbowl, this book will still have something that grabs at you.In a way the fact that it almost reads like a novel kind of hurts the truthfulness of the book. It detaches you in a way and you have to keep reminding yourself that this was real, this did really happen, people suffered and died even. Egan does ground you in the end with an update of what's going on today. The book wakes you up that man can't do anything he wants to the earth. The earth is a very delicate creature that needs to maintain a balance that man can't control.This book is left as a reminder of what happened as the people who lived it are now reaching the end of their long journey.

Yeah, I just finished this book and it was all right to say the least but it was also really confusing. If you're a reader of comic books this may be a book you'll enjoy because it really had a comic book feel to it. Now that I think of it this book would have been so much better and easier to understand if it were a graphic novel.This book was Flowers in the Attic meets Danielle Steel/Hustler meets Lord of the Rings meets Matrix. For real. If you can't even wrap your head around that concept you probably will explode trying to read the book. It's probably also not the most appropriate to read as a bedtime story to your kids.I was reading from an advanced reader edition so I'm going to comment on typos, spelling and grammar errors, but those were the only major flaw I found in the writing of the book. Witcover seems to have a very firm grasp of the English language, using it beautifully throughout the novel. Though sometimes it appeared he was showing off how mamy Scrabble-winning words he knew.One of the biggest problems was that practically the whole novel was exposition. Most of it explaining the world of Kestrel and the mutes. Even then some of the explanations were so confusing it wouldn't even help to read it over again. There never really seemed to be any story, and when there was it was overshadowed by different things being told in order for the story to make sense.Another major problem I had was that the two seperate stories being told didn't appear to have any solid connection between the two, at least none that seemed reasonable. And by the end of Jack's story I was lost. If you've read this book and are looking to me to try and explain why Jack did what he did in the end, you're looking at the wrong person.Overall the book only had the writing going for it. The characters, the story, most everything else about the book just wasn't that great. There's a bunch of other things I could criticize about the book, but why beat a dead horse.

I don't know what I thought I was going to read, but it wasn't this. So a warning to you: this book, or at least the beginning of it, is pretty freaky. I'm not a wimp. I grew up on Goosebumps and Scary Stories by Alvan Schwartz, graduating on to Christopher Pike and various R.L. Stine young adult novels. I also love scary movies of all sort, so I'm not one easily freaked out. But this novel was pretty creepy, or at least the beginning.Perhaps it's the concept and the description of the ghost that is unnerving. Maybe it's also because I was sort of caught off guard by what I was reading. But whatever it was I was freaked out and loving the book. The whole concept of the novel was unique.At times I found myself wanting to give Joe Hill a thesaurus and a phrase book, because he kept using the same descriptions over and over again. I think it would have also helped him in making things a little clearer. It seemed he was having a little difficulty fleshing out plot points at moments. I can't really think of any specific examples, but you'll come across them as you read it.The end seemed really just swept up. Not really making too much sense in relation to the story. It seemed like Hill just wanted to quickly wrap it up, no matter how many questions it either raised or left unanswered.But besides those minor flaws, I gobbled this book up really fast. I wanted to know everything that was going on. Something kept me riveted throughout the whole story. That's why I'm keeping my rating at a B, despite some of the problems I pointed out. I'm also interested in reading some of Hill's other works. It was his way of telling this ghost story and the type of ghost story it was that made me interested. Overall? Pretty good read.

Once again Jodi Picoult tackles a sensitive and controversial issue, in an amazingly strong and dignified manner that doesn't have you choosing sides.She did it to the reader in My Sister's Keeper, where the minute you began to go to one side, she presents something where you're suddenly seeing it all from a different angle. Every time you begin to thing Peter was in the right, an angry and upset parent stands up and says something to make you think again.

There are many times that the story is full of action and plot, thus making it very engaging. But there are just as equal an amount of times when it dives into ancient politics and slows to a crawl where you begin to struggle to keep your eyes open. The book is still very enjoyable though.It does get confusing, because while there are times when Rutherfurd realizes the reader may not be familiar with the ancient rules and regulations of Ireland, he also sometimes gives you the benefit of the doubt that you will understand everything he's talking about. Also sometimes it seems he has difficulty describing scenes and pictures in a way that allows the reader to see what he's talking about. Not all the time, but sometimes I just couldn't see it.One thing that was a plus was that Rutherfurd really seemed to capture the spirit of the people he was writing about. Ireland no longer became a land mass but a living and breathing entity. Made so by her princes and princesses. I was delighted to learn about the role women played in Ireland, a stronger, smarter and more noble one. You also grow attached to the characters, at least the ones you get to know, others have just been placed in the story in a way that's hard to follow.At first it irked me that we started losing connection to the characters from the very beginning of the book. I understood they were dead and we wouldn't be seeing them, but I meant in refrences and descendants. Then I began to realize that it was Rutherfurd's way of showing how ancient Ireland began to be discarded and forgotten as the Vikings and English came. It was a way the reader could relate to the native Irish as they began to be forgotten.Overall the book was entertaining, filled with both fact and fiction. It can be a quite wordy and long read so prepare yourself. At times it can read kind of like a history book, and you often find yourself flipping to the front of the book where a sort of family tree has been assembled, that still doesn't help you keep track of all the characters.

The key thing is, is that this novel was based on Lalita Tademy's own family history. She calls it fiction, though, because she had to elaborate and add rich detail to the simple stories she had been told of her grandmothers before her.What shocked me most about this novel was that it was Tademy's first. Her writing seems to reflect years and years of writing before her, it flows so well and the language is so rich. You can't criticize her characters, because they are real, even so she added layers on to them that just increased their likeability.It was funny, because I didn't think I was going to like the fact that the book followed every generation closely. I thought I would bond with Suzette and feel slight resentment when her daughter and granddaughters story came up, but I didn't. Somehow I loved it. I loved it because the mothers and grandmothers weren't shoved to the side when the story switched focus, which is further reflection on how Tademy's family thinks of their elders, especially their grandmother's.This book is a surprisingly enjoyable novel, and I'd say if the story doesn't sound like something you would want to read, give it a try anyway. I really don't need to say too much about this novel because it doesn't need much. Everything about it is great, and really, that's all I need to say....more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,not set,Apr 2007,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5167.Cane_River

I didn't think I was going to like this book as much as I did... but I really did. I got so involved in this book that my emotions were going haywire. Not just feeling happy and sad as you do with most books, but feeling anxious and angry and dissappointed. Everything these characters felt I began to feel. That's definitely the mark of a great novel and a great writer.One thing I think this novel really does is shed light on a situation we really don't know all that much about. It highlights a country we only see in stereotypical clips on the news, skewing our perception and making us think only of one type of world. The Kite Runner puts the world we either never saw or don't see into view. We think of Kabul and Afghanistan only as he writes it in the second half of the novel, most of us have never even thought about it in the way it's portrayed in the first half. And that's how Aghanistan was for the longest time.I think one of the most amazing things about this novel was the friendship between Hassan and Amir. It wasn't what you would think with, ""I don't care that he's in another race I'll defend my friend no matter what."" It was a real friendship against the odds. He didn't make it cute or fake, Hosseini made it raw and how it would really be in the world where a certain race is persecuted.The characters are also all well-developed and three demensional. Never once did I see a character that was just there to further the story along and then left, without a background or history to them. Every single character gracing that page had a soul and had a past.As usual there's so much more I want to say about this book, but for something this good you'll just have to read it yourself. Trust me, it may sound like something you really don't think you'd care for, but you'll be surprised how much Hosseini's writing and characters pull you in.

Something I always tell other people: don't go into a book with expectations. I should have listened to my own advice, then maybe I would have enjoyed the book a little bit more. But this being Schwarz's first novel, I'm not going to complain too much, because it was still pretty good.It was a little too jumpy, just all around, writing, plot line, characters. While they weren't all over the map, they didn't stay on the same line. I also think Schwarz put herself in a hard place with some of the characters because a few of them served a purpose while at the same time seemed pointless. You know those types of characters I'm talking about? Those are almost as annoying as the ones who have no point at all. But I think she put herself in a hard place because they couldn't have been written out.Also, it seemed that Schwarz had some difficulty catching Ruth's age when she was younger. I couldn't figure out what age she was supposed to be because she was never acting her age. Unless it was said what age she was supposed to be at certain times, I wouldn't have had a clue.You can easily get past all those for a very interesting story. It's slow going at the beginning, but give it a chance because once you get into it you'll love it. It's sort of like a mystery with an unexpected twist.

Stephen King has a very unique style. Most of his writing full of horror and gore, but that's nothing new for me, some of my favorite books as a tween were by R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike. It's actually kind of surprising I didn't move on to Stephen King and become obsessed.Anywho, this book was addicting. I could hardly bare to put it down. I think it was the new take on the old zombie story that made it so interesting. It was also a pretty original idea.Stephen King of course writes amazingly, but I wasn't too impressed by the characters. I didn't really find myself connecting with them or feeling for them. I was also bothered by the fact we never found out why. Why did this happen? Who was behind it? The most answers we got were in the form of theories. Maybe I'm just the type of person who likes some answers.I think this is a good book for people who have never read King but want to try him out. This will get you used to his style but you don't need to have read any of his other work to know what's going on.Overall, a pretty entertaining read.

I never really saw the daughter (with the exception of June) learn about their mother and hold a new understanding of her. The most the other girls caught was a sort of toleration of their mother.Amy Tan is one of those writers who draws you in with every word. It's a good thing because at the beginning I wasn't really hooked, it took a few chapters before I was into the book. It was really the mother's stories that grabbed my attention and unfortunately it seemed that every time the daughter's tale came up I wasn't as into it. Luckily there was a careful balance between the two.I think the most rewarding part of the whole novel was the ending. It didn't neccessarily tie the whole novel together, but it made it all worthwhile and happy.The characters were also pretty well-developed, though if Tan wanted to change the view on the older Asian women and the stereotypes following her, it didn't work. It sort of shows you how stereotypes have to come from some place and most of the time the mom's act like what you think an older Chinese woman should usually act like.The book was good though, character driven with a small plot thread to keep the book really going.

Information that appeared to be vital to the over all plot seemed to be thrown in at the last minute when it was finally needed, catching me off guard. Information like that needs to be planted earlier in the story to help it flow more instead of in the stacatto-like pattern of a preschooler telling about their adventures at school.The characters also weren't very well developed, two demensional at best. There were too many and it became too cluttered, I now understand why writing teachers would say the few characters the better because then there's less to keep track of and you can keep a tighter reign on them.

Everything set with a sort of critical distance, the narrator shaky (you're never really sure who's telling the story until near the very end of the book). There is also one character, who the entire story seems to revolve around, who is barely mentioned at all within the novel, though the author acknowledges this in the end.The end was what made this book worthwhile, quickly becoming a mystery with a twist that even the most seasoned of mystery readers wouldn't see coming, I sure didn't.

Enjoyable, goofy, I really did not need to think all that much, which was a pretty nice relief after 1984.For the most part I liked Nic, which is a good thing because you should like the protagonist of the book you're reading. But every once and a while she stopped acting like a normal teenager and suddenly was able to quell her emotions and act in a rational manner while those around her seemed to be off their rockers. She just wasn't acting like a teenager, which was somewhat annoying, especially to me, who was a teenager not too long ago, and knows that to act rationally in certain situations is a very difficult thing to do. But really that was the only annoying thing about her.Another thing I was bothered by was the lack of solid conflict in the novel. There were little problems that kept arising, but they were quickly resolved. But I found there was no overall conflict to keep pushing the novel forward, and I occasionally found myself wondering why I continued to read this. Every book needs some sort of conflict to keep the story going, and this book seemed to lack that driving force.There were a few other things that bugged me throughout the book, Coach Luther's sudden involvement near the end when there really wasn't much else from her throughout the book. The two boys fighting over Nic so soon in the book (a few pages in, literally). Small things I was able to push aside in order to enjoy the book.That's one thing you should be able to do in order to read this book, push aside the small annoyances that pop up.

This book I feel is more relevant now than it ever has been before, though Orwell was writing it at a time to bring to light the dangers of ""communism"" and more specifically totalitarianism and facism. But right now, with the state of chaos and fear the world is in right now (especially America) I feel this book has an even stronger message.Let me point out the bad points (I found) of this book. At times it became a little too wordy and political for my taste. So much so where I began to get a little lost. And, now that I think about it, that's really the only downside I found to the book. Though, some may find the ending disappointing (I'm definitely not going to spoil it) I found it just hammering Orwell's message even further, that it takes a long time to make change, but that it has to start somewhere.I think the thing I found most fascinating about this book, and what drew me to it in the first place, was the idea of Newspeak and the whole principal it was founded on. The fact that it's a language that gets smaller as it develops instead of bigger. To me, words are amazing, I love them. I love that you can look up the word ""good"" in a thesaurus and find a plethora of synonyms to it. It's why I often refuse to dumb myself down to talk to other people who may not know the words I'm using. This book illustrates how restricted and sheltered people become when cut off from certain aspects of language. You begin to realize how precious a single word can be. There are words out there to describe every single thing you are feeling, what you want to do, who you are. If those are taken away, can you still feel this, do you know what you want to do, are you still truly you? Or are you just another nameless face in a crowd?There are so many other amazing issues this book brings up and I would love to highlight them all, but definitely pick this book up.

All the other characters are just two demensional at best. One character flaw in the book was that there were a couple problems set up (Ingrid's brother possibly using steroids? Her grandfather's farm? What's her dad being secretive about?) that are never resolved in the end.Speaking of resolutions, the end of the book was very short and abrupt.

Blum takes an enormous risk writing from the German perspective of the Holocaust, but it's a much needed risk. It's amazing how people still frown down on all Germans involved in the Holocaust, how persecuted and hated they became once WWII was over.Please don't get me wrong, I'm not defending the actions of the German's who openly participated in this senseless genocide. And there is of course that even if you're not directly involved, not doing anything to stop it still makes you a part of the problem. But this book sheds a tiny light on the German's who stood back and did nothing, or only did a little, or did what they could. It shows us why many people didn't do anything to stop those doing wrong.The book starts a little slow, and at first I wasn't too partial to the jumping back and forth between Trudy in present day America to Anna back in war torn Germany, but after the first few chapters/sections of it, I grew used to it and actually preferred it. It also took a little getting used to the way dialogue was written out, I haven't read too many books that cut out quotation marks all together. But again, once you get used to it, it takes on a natural flow.Anna and Trudy are both very different and intriguing characters that really hold the whole story together, especially Anna. We have the privilege of seeing her young life in WWII and then seeing how it affects her as an older woman, allowing us a glimpse of other German's who came out of Germany after the war from a more personal perspective.When reading this book keep an eye out for the name Pfeffer, it will allow the interesting, I guess you could call it a twist, at the end to be even more ""shocking."" For me the name sounded familiar, but it was only a name in passing that I will have to probably go back and read again.One thing that tied me personally to the book was when Anna finally came to America and the sort of treatment she received. On my father's side of the family his own dad's family immigrated to the U.S. circa 1920s. When WWII came around, the family was treated with hate and disdain, even the kids (like my grandfather) who were born in the U.S. I think it was one thing that I appreciated about this book, is that while it's not condoning anything the German's did in the war, it's gently saying that hating all German's is wrong. There are still German's out there racked with guilt even though, as the book tells us, there really wasn't much they could do.This is a touching novel, that while it does have a positive ending, doesn't turn into a sappy mother-daughter bonding book. It stays true to it's characters and style, and I definitely applaud Blum for taking a bold step and putting this amazing novel out there....more",Notes are private!,0,129,1,not set,Jan 2007,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49465.Those_Who_Save_Us

It's also a quick read (about two hours for me) and something you don't have to focus on, so perfect for an airplane ride or a day at the beach.I was surprised how into this book I got, though. At times I was getting upset, angry, even nervous while following Annisa's story. Of course none of the relationships or characters were written to be really deep, even Annisa came off as two demensional quite often. And the amount of product placement, name dropping stuff became a little annoying at times, but I looked at it as just another way to draw young readers in. Just giving them another way to relate to Annisa and the others in the story.Really, I can't criticize this book too much because, come on, how much do you really think I expected of this book.

A little hard to follow at times, but you're really so enthralled the entire time the difficult bits just fly by.Though the novel bounces back and forth to different perspectives, it's truly Carrie McGavock that carries the novel, just as she carried so much during and after the Battle of Franklin. An amazingly strong woman, I wonder how much was her real character and how much was added upon by Robert Hicks. As for her relationship with Zachariah, it seemed at times unneccessary and would drag the novel down.Hick's writing, though, makes up for any character flaws in the novel. I felt that his descriptions and narratives really brought in the nature and attitude of the South near the end of the Civil War. He doesn't vilify anyone in the novel (i.e. Confederates, Union soldiers, blacks, ideals of the south) which is a relief for any reader wanting to read a (relatively) hopeful story of the War.There's not much else I can say about this book.

Why? ThI wouldn't be surprised if Krakauer's first books were fiction novels, which I don't think they are, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were. Why? This book reads like a novel, a very confusing novel, but a novel nonetheless.First things first, there should have been some sort of family tree or timeline or some sort of organizational medium provided besides a map. By the end of the book you have so many people and so many families roaming around you no longer really know who's who except for Joseph Smith.I also didn't like how we kept jumping around. One minute we're talking about Ron Lafferty trying to kill himself in his jail cell and then suddenly we're hearing about how Joseph Smith found the golden plates in the dirt. In a history such as this one, I would have much perferred a straight-thru shot of everything, rather than this somewhat confusing bundle that was presented to me.One last thing, while I completely understand the neccessity of recounting the history of the Mormon church so it's easier to comprehend the different factions of the church that are out there know and understand their various reasonings, there were certain storylines that only served to confuse more, rather than add to this journey.The book does not put the Mormon church in it's entirety into a bad light, so if you're Mormon, don't let it deterr you from reading this book. Krakauer, while shining light on the wrong the church and it's split-offs have done, he also shows the wrong that's been done to the church and the persecution it's had to go through since it's conception.The whole book is shocking and makes you think, but it's not until the end when we get to the argument of whether or not Ron Lafferty should be declared insane, that you really sit up in interest. It presented a serious problem: If Ron was judged insane, then nearly everyone with a religious conviction of any degree could therefor also be seen as insane. It was that moment that really brought the book together, I felt. Which is sad, because while an interesting and informational read, there wasn't much else to the book until the end when this problem was presented.Read the book, like I said, it's an interesting if not entertaining read and really sheds some light on a religion not many people REALLY understand outside of stupid stereotypes....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,Jan 2007,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1894.Under_the_Banner_of_Heaven

This book finally has caught up with her masterpiece that was The Other Boleyn Girl. I think it's because of our main heroines in each story and the way Gregory relates to them.I've read that both Mary Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon fascinated her, and it seems that she'll put a lot more into writing about the women that have caught her interest. It reflects in her writing. Her other books that take place in this same time period have something missing that is held within both these books. I don't quite know what it is though.As usual, Gregory's writing is beautiful and transports you back to late 15th early 16th century England. I think this was the book I was waiting for because it really starts at the beginning of Henry VIII's reign, even before that and we can see where it all starts. Had she come out with this book first, there would have been possibly been a little less confusion while reading the other books.Katherine is a very unique character in her attitude, ideals, and principles. Her relationships with both Henry and Arthur are unique and endearing in their own ways. And while you're constantly rooting for Arthur while reading the novel, you can't help but actually like Henry a little bit. Probably the only book of Gregory's you actually will.There was less cattiness in this court and the characters were a little easier to keep track of, possibly because we weren't being forced to meet every single one. I really liked this in comparison to her other books in it's simpleness. I think this novel was a lot more simple and instead of it making her writing seem weaker I think it added a lot more power to it.If you've enjoyed Gregory's books treat yourself and pick this one up. Try and read it before The Boleyn Inheritance, I read it after the fact and realized that if I read this one first it may have helped me understand the whole Plantagenet royal bloodline thing a little better.

But other than that, there wasn't much to the book.Truly the best part was the fight for justice, because when it came down to it, it was about trying to get the long silenced voices heard.

For a first novel O'Dell does an extremely good job. Her writing is raw and real which helps add to the mood and characters of the book.One thing I liked about O'Dell's style was that instead of constantly describing the overall pictures of things, she finds minute details, idiosyncrasies in characters, flaws in settings, to focus on instead. It's fascinating and beautiful at the same time.Like I said earlier, there are so many surprises that pop up throughout the book to rehash the plot and what I liked about the story and didn't like would give too much away and probably keep you from reading the story.

Thankfully Christmas was just around the corner and there was still room under the tree for a book! I fell into reading it within days of unwrapping it and found myself in a completely different world in the first page.Gregory has caught up, somewhat, to the successful story of The Other Boleyn Girl. She corrects the flaws from The Virgin's Lover with the way she presents the different perspectives. It still causes the story to jump around a little bit more and it takes a few chapters to fall into the vibe, but once you do it's well worth it.As usual, Gregory's writing is beautiful in language and she presents this different world to the reader in such a way you understand every custom, dress and word. It's a little hard to keep track of all the different characters running in and around, but it's not to great a deal as you do remember the ones that matter.Speaking of characters, there is only one that brings the book down. Katherine Howard. She's written as a two-demensional character, which wouldn't be a big deal if she wasn't one of our main protagonists. She comes across as a flitty, dumb little girl. She acknowledges this flaw in herself, and that's great, but it means nothing to the reader if there's nothing else to her. Sure, maybe she's written this way so we just see her as another one of Henry's wives, but she was a wife longer than Anne of Cleves, and Anne's character was written much better and you care for her a lot more.Other than the nuisance that is Katherine, the book is fabulous. Gregory does not disappoint and definitely proves herself worthy of being the eyes and ears of this most unique court....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2006,"May 29, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16180.The_Boleyn_Inheritance

Everything about this book was truly enjoyable and memorable. From the story itself to the writing to the characters, it was all great.Usually I tend to not like books that take you all over the map in terms of time. In the case of this book, as with others, it recounts a period of ten years or so in Novalee's life. Some writers tend to jump around and often catch you off guard. But Letts takes you through Novalee's journey with such ease and gentle transition it's very unlikely you are going to be thrown off. The only problem in this sense that did pop up was Willy Jack's seperate story line. I understood that in the end it helped Novalee realize her true feelings towards a certain someone, but for the most part I found it unneccessary and took me out of the story.The only other problem with his novel was the ending. I'm picky about my endings, I realize, and the problem I had with this one was that while there was a sense of closure, I didn't feel enough of it. There was a feeling of abruptness to the end. I guess I just wanted to know more about what happened. I had been so involved with Novalee's life to suddenly cut me off at the end just didn't seem fair.The novel as a whole, though, makes up for any flaws one can find in it. I loved all the characters Novalee encountered, and just like Novalee, fell in love with them. I felt comfortable and at home with everyone.

I read the summary on the back and I was intrigued, but wasn't intending to pick it up right away until my mom demanded that I read it as soon as possible so she could read it. So I did. I read it in a day.I'm a fast reader no matter what, but give me a good book, I'll finish it faster than usual. This book was good. Excellent. I was drawn in with the first word. There were stories within stories and I was able to follow each and every one of them and become absorbed. Diamant's writing took me back to this time period, and instead of pointing out all that was bad and raw in a time we often look back on as savage and uncivilized, she points out and embraces everything that was wonderful. Or at least she writes in such a way you look at it as completely normal and okay. I was also surprised how much these people embraced womanhood, when often when you hear about those times it's all about how women were submissive and cursed, born only to be slaves to men. But the women in nearly every culture Dinah passed through were respected for the most part, and held some sort of power. This is not the time when men began stepping on the women. Something happened between then and now that changed the view of womanhood to be ugly and wrong.Speaking of the women, the one problem I had was that the women the first third of the book was dedicated to, just ended up disappearing. We were lead to fall in love with these women, only to have them later have them fall off the radar. It's not a huge flaw, because Dinah has to lose them as well, and they fall of her radar as well and we do learn what happened to them in the end, but still...Other than that one small, but understandable flaw, this book was fantastic. Dinah goes on an amazing journey and it is told beautifully in her voice. Diamant has a wonderful gift as a storyteller. Do yourself a favor and sit down with this book, you will hear Dinah speak and you will feel the gritty, dirty, wonderful world she lives in. Don't let the fact that it was taken from the Bible deterr you. Diamant writes in such a way that if you are familiar with the Bible things come up and you're like, ""Hey!"" But, if you're not religious at all, she writes so that you aren't shut out from a special world, you are welcomed and embraced and the story is still just as wonderful....more",Notes are private!,0,141,1,not set,Dec 2006,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/113348.The_Red_Tent

Well, as satisfying as you could get given the circumstances, but I won't spoil those for you.I honestly don't know what else to say about this book. It was quite an engaging read, what with such a unique storyline behind it. The loops and dances Max goes through to win his love three times over is fascinating and you can't help but root him on. His long friendship is also another relationship you can't help but love, and the end of the friendship is so harsh it will probably draw tears.Greer really does take you back to the twentieth century, not hesitating to color things brightly, but keeping them raw as they were the days they happened. Sometimes it was a little jarring and took you out of the book, but only for a moment. If there was one flaw to the book, perhaps that's it.This is not a romance novel, really.

For the most part, this book was a very enthralling and entertaining read. The story itself and the writing both very fine. It's not a book, though, that's going to go down in history as one of my favorites, despite the fact I really did enjoy it.The main problem I had with the book was the characters themselves. They were likeable enough, but with the exceptional of Icy, most everyone she encountered seemed 2Demensional at most, they weren't flushed out enough for my taste. I'm not saying every character that appears on page needs to have a full history and story going on, but there were characters that played a huge part in Icy's life that didn't have enough to them. I didn't see it with Miss Emily or Icy's grandparents. Those three were central figures in Icy's life.Also the antagonists Icy encountered throughout her journey, like her teacher in the beginning and the one nurse at the hospital... they were just mean, there was nothing behind them pushing this meanness. Perhaps it was Rubio's way of letting us see this from young Icy's point of view. Adults don't need a reason to be mean, they just are mean! But if you're going to write in the perspective of a ten-year-old, keep it consistent.At times I felt Icy was not thinking nor acting her age, her views became suddenly too adult, her attitude to adult. When we jump forward a couple of years I at first thought Icy was 16 or 17, not 13. It's hard to write from the perspective of younger people, so I give Rubio major props for being able to capture any of those ages.So, basically, it was character that gave the book it's biggest flaws. But while reading it I really didn't mind. I was very interested in the subject matter, what was going on with Icy and what was going to happen. I was drawn to Icy and concerned for her a lot. Even though I knew what kind of disease Icy had, I wanted to hear the answers just as badly as she and her family did.I would recommend this book to read.

That goBefore I started reading this book I gave a brief summary to some of my friends who saw that I had just bought it and were wondering about it. That got us into a heated discussion about how completely outrageous it is for a woman to dress up as a man. How it's pretty much impossible to get away with it seeing as you'll always end up in some sort of situation where you have to reveal yourself for what you really are.That discussion ended up shading me slightly when I began to read, thinking, ""Really? How is she going to be able to pull it off?"" speaking of both the author and Joan herself. But both were able to pull it off quite well and realistically.Not to be sexist, I don't know how much a guy would really enjoy this book, but I hope he would. I would hope that he would actually pick up and read this book, because if you look past all the religious controversy of a woman being Pope, there is an underlying story of the beginning of feminism and a woman standing up for herself and pursuing her own dreams and desires despite everything that goes against her. I would hope that a man would read this and realize that every woman has this potential and we are truly equal to men.Pope Joan, or at least the character of her in this book, is truly an inspiration to women everywhere. She defied the odds and did everything she could to get what she wanted. And apparently, if you want to bring in a religious aspect to this as well, God wanted this all for her too, or else things would not have worked out the way they did with narrow escapes and fortunate meetings.I honestly don't have much to criticize with this book. I enjoyed it a lot and reading the author's notes at the end piqued my interest about this supposedly ""fictional"" character. There is something in this book that will grab you, I guarentee it. Be it the historical facts and events that were traced, be it the slight tale of romance hiding inside the bigger story, maybe it's Joan herself and her pursuit of knowledge, maybe it's the outrageous way women were treated.

Now, on to the more important matters...Almost from the first word I had become sucked into this book and Ninah's character, a flawed, naive girl who truly doesn't know better. She's sweet, tries hard, but just doesn't know what she needs to know. The way Reynolds has written her, doesn't make her naivity annoying, but just adds to her character.Part of what makes this book so interesting is that it's written in a way that completely immerses you in their obscure and different world, but allows you to keep your own knowledge and ideals about you, so that you look back and can still think, ""That's so wrong!""Ninah goes through a trying journey and we are along for the ride. I was enthralled with every character that graced the pages of this book.

This book holds so much depth to it, but it's presented in such a way that the reader doesn't feel like their drowning.The one small problem I did have was that the ending seemed a little too abrupt.

It forces you to be in the same predicament as the blind.The way he writes makes you realize just how much we all do rely on visual stimuli, even in books!

For me, it marked Saramago as a truly brilliant writer.But even brilliant writers and brilliant books have their flaws. The time spent in the hospital seemed too long and unneccessary to further the story along, rather it stopped the story.

There are moments when the story picks up slightly, but it isn't until the last few chapters of the book that you're once again enthralled in the story. Before that I'm reading, a few images popping out at me, but for the most part I was on autopilot.I don't want my bad grade to affect anyone's debating over picking up this book. The subject matter is heart wrenching, and you just want to reach out to some of these characters. Women, especially, should read this book. People are constantly saying how women in the Western world, especially the United States have it so well off, and it's true. Especially because this story is a reflection on a real society and really what goes on in it. I was constantly being shocked and shaking my head. I was gritting my teeth for some of these women, forced to be shrouded and looked down upon. But at the same time, you see how strongly some of these people believe in this culture, and just as strongly, how there are people being opressed and wishing with all their heart to break free.This book was good, but the middle lag (which I admit is the toughest part of a book or anything to write) held me back from falling completely in love with this book. But for a first time writer (at least I think he is) it's a wonderful accomplishment, especially when coming from such an opressive environment and with fear of death for sharing his words.Remember, we are lucky, in this country to be able to do all we can. Just remember that. Read this book if you think we're constantly being stifled and opressed, you'll realize that we're birds in a forest, not in a cage....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2006,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/765629.The_Swallows_of_Kabul

But this book lacked a lot of that.Also, one thing that really put me off right away was the sleeping arrangements they had this time around... it reminded me too much of a concentration camp setting, which is sad and depressing and not wholly appropriate even in this kind of book.This book also makes the reader sort of ask, ""Why?"" Where is the book going? Is this whole series just about the orphans going from crappy place to crappy place? What's the point in continuing reading about them then if there's nothing good at all? Thinking about the book I can't really see any major need to have it in the series, I don't see exactly what difference it made except just as sort of a filler space before the other books were written and published.It was still a good and entertaining read.

Temple Grandin offers fascinating insights to the animal world, which will confirm things long time pet owners always knew, and bring to light startling new information.One main thing this book brings to light is to not underestimate animals or those with autism because often times they're smarter than us. Yet, that's one thing Grandin tries to avoid, saying things like animals are smarter or humans are smarter. Rather she just tries to point out that animals may do things differently but that doesn't mean they're stupid. It's all about skill level that certain creatures are better at than others.This book never got boring, whereas many other ""animal"" books tend to get dry and scientific. Grandin, while delving into scientific facts, puts them into words the average person can understand, and most always will support every fact or theory with an example. Always there was some story to go along with everything she was telling the reader about, and every story was amusing and fascinating to read about.Another thing this book was wonderful at was pointing out autistic characteristics in a way that's not so harsh or right in your face of ""look at how similar they are!"" It was gentle, casual, not making a big deal out of it. It's also divided into easy sections so if you want to skip something or find something specific you can.I really enjoyed this book. I want to try to get my roommate with the puppy to read it because it will teach her things about her dog that I'm sure she never knew.

It's much to long to put the whole thing on here...""This book is definitely a must-read for all of those that plan on putting a Broadway musical on in the future. This is a perfect guide book to help you avoid putting on a flop. It tells you about what to avoid, whether the time is right, and signs your show is doomed. Especially nowadays this book is a must-have seeing as practically every failure has been done already and if you repeat the failure, it’s even more of a slap in the face and there’s bound to be someone standing there saying, “I told you so.” It’s almost a history book of all the battles lost on the Broadway stage, who doesn’t like to read/see about failure. Though it does get dry and text-bookish at times the book still had it’s moments of interest. Also, since many of these musicals are flops that happened in the 50s-60s, most of the readers may have never heard of the shows, so Mandelbaum will recap the synopsis the best to his ability. He also has a non-critical outlook on each show, gently pointing out what went wrong, along with highlighting the great things about each show. There were maybe two shows in all that he mentioned he didn’t have one good thing to say about. Also, due to the content of the book, the reader is often left shaking their head, wondering why any one would be stupid enough to put on a musical based on certain subject matters or in certain performance arenas. The reader may also be shocked to see that some of their favorite musicals are listed as flops, because they may have only heard the score or cast recording. Most of the musicals in this book, surprisingly, have beautiful scores, and it’s often why regional theatres sometimes make the mistake of repeating failure by wanting to put on the show again, thinking the storyline and the score is great they don’t look into why the show failed in the first place. This book also comes in handy as a guidebook for that. If you’re desperate to put on one of these flops again, you can look it up in the book, see why it failed, and try to make sure you don’t make the same mistake twice.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2006,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14462.Not_Since_Carrie

By now we know all the players and we have the basic jist of the overall plot.The reader is anxious just as anxious as the Baudelaire children as they head off to their new guardian. After the last one they have no idea what to expect, and cannot help being nervous that this one could be worse. After all, we're all getting the idea that Mr. Poe is not the best judge of character. But the moment everyone meets Dr. Montgomery, we are all reassured. Dr. Montgomery is calm, sweet, generous, everything you could want in a proper guardian.

While I still enjoyed the The Virgin's Lover I was far from impressed because I know what Philippa Gregory has the capability of doing.The writing was still beautiful, as always, but the story line (though taken from history and elaborated upon) was lacking. This time the story was not told from one person's perspective, but several. I think it gave the story less dimension because you found yourself unable to figure out who you wanted to root for. Perhaps that was Gregory's point, but even so, it wasn't kind on the reader.Also, I'm suspecting she wanted the reader to have read the first two books before this one, and remembered them because there was no family tree or character guide in the front of the book. That would have been tremendously helpful because I had a little trouble trying to follow who was who if they were not in the center of the story. There are a lot of people in the court to try and keep track of after all.One thing that was kind of fun, was we saw Hannah Green at one point. You may remember her from The Queen's Fool.

It truly is one of those books that you really can't stop reading. Especially for me, because in a way it took me back to my Lurlene McDaniel days. Did anyone ever read her? She was always writing books about different teenagers and young children with terminal illnesses. I was addicted to those books. So it was no surprise when the young reader in me sort of jumped up when I saw a friend of mine reading this book and she described it to me.Boy was it a book well chosen. Picoult writes from the views of a few different key characters, allowing the reader to get an extremely well-rounded look at the story. At first the jumping from character to character is a little jarring and you have to keep reminding yourself that it's a new character, but eventually you get into the vibe of the book and wouldn't have it written any other way. The one thing Picoult does perfectly is make you torn. You really don't know who to support in a case like this. At times you find yourself leaning towards Anna, and other times wanting desperately to shout your support for Sara, the poor mother in this situation. With the readers information of other characters points of views and knowledge, the whole case is a lot more difficult to have a desired verdict towards. In the end a decision is made, a decision that, while reading the book, I was constantly wondering what Picoult was going to do, because either way one fully supported side was going to lose. But the way she really ends the book puts results to rest in a solid, yet emotionally unsatisfying ending. The ending it by no means bad, quite the contrary it was beautiful and settling, but at the same time you don't know whether to be relieved that there was an extremely closed ending without debate, or to cry. I won't tell you why, and I may have said too much already. But this book is just incredible and I highly advise you try to read it as soon as possible....more",Notes are private!,0,170,1,not set,Jan 2005,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10917.My_Sister_s_Keeper

The book was still good, though, with interesting characters that seemed fully fleshed out and appear to have full, consistent backgrounds. The inner-workings and relationships everyone has with one another is also very interesting. It just gives evidence that though Lorenzo really does have a drive and desire to leave his old life behind him... he can't.The only major problem I had with the book, was the habit the author had of repeating information. Not really neccessary information either, simple, easy to remember information such as a characters full name was repeated over and over again. But really, other than that, this book was awesome.

It was very creative and had a different twist on our usual take on fairies and leprechauns, dwarves and goblins. Especially with all the technology these legendary magical creatures have.The characters that were focused on the most were barely rounded, but well rounded enough. Those secondary characters were the typical ones of a childrens book, either being the bad guy or the good guy. All characters remained consistent though, which I felt was nice and also probably gave Eoin Colfer a bit of a challenge... because not redeeming Artemis Fowl in this story for kids about a kid is something that most people were expecting. I liked the fact Artemis wasn't redeemed in the end.

Let me tell you, she speaks as eloquently as she writes. She's also just as witty. After hearing her speak, I realized that a lot of her personality comes through in her writing. Her amazing writing.She spoke of how she felt The Mermaid Chair was going to be often compared to The Secret Life of Bees and maybe wouldn't be able to live up to the high praise it's earned so far. She also worried about the characters being too similar. I don't think Sue has anything to worry about. The only thing the two books have in common is the author's writing... a beautiful, flowing and engaging style.I think I like Sue's style so much because it has the right amount of description for things, her dialogue is realistic, and when you think about it her stories seem so outlandish, but when reading it you can see it actually happening. Her writing is also very eloquent and deep, but fun and witty at the same time.There are no characters in The Mermaid Chair that are reminiscent of any in The Secret Life of Bees, and specifically what Kidd was worried about was people might roll there eyes at another pack of strong female characters taking presidence in the book. I didn't and don't see any problem in that. We need as many strong literary female characters as we can get. And these women, that you grow to love, are as strong as they come.The way the love story was written out was also so wonderful. You find yourself feeling for Jessie's dilemna of being in love with two men. Kidd doesn't write it so you're leaning towards one man over the other (well, you may be, but it's honestly hard to choose) because both men are so likeable and good-looking and genuinely care for Jessie. And though Hugh is the only one painted as having any flaws, they're pointed out to us by Jessie who, after twenty years of marriage, has come to find some things he does annoying, which she later comes to realize (and we know) are more endearing.Personally, I liked The Secret Life of Bees over The Mermaid Chair because I just found that one more interesting... but The Mermaid Chair was just as engaging and well-written as it's predecessor.

This was an incredibly moving story that got a lot of emotions boiling inside of me. This book was just so real, and I know I use this term a lot, but I think it's an important term to use when discussing books, because that's often what makes or breaks a book for many of us. I have a feeling that Annelie Botes has either experienced autism first hand through a friend or family member, or she has really done her research.This book really moved me. At first I thought it was going to be kind of an investigation book where people assume the mom did it, but through clever detective work and looking at the past we're going to learn that the kid was murdered by somebody else... Instead it's an introspective look at the past nine difficult years in this woman's life. You are amazed by her strength and determination to carry on in the face of all that is going against her. You love the support she gets in Miriam, who's story we also see a lot of.The book mainly focuses on the two constant figures throughout Alexander's life. His mother, Ingrid, and the housekeeper/helper/shoulder-to-lean-on/wonder-woman, Miriam. Both these woman care for Alexander and love him no matter what. But both women see different sides of Alexander.It's a relief when brighter moments occur, because I constantly found myself grinding my teeth in anger either at the police interrogators, or the townspeople, and especially the compeletly corrupted church. The church is what pissed me off the most in this book, just read it and I'm sure you'll be grinding your teeth down too. Also, Dawid, Ingrid's husband gets on your nerves too, but it's a lot more understandable why he's sort of an asshole. With the church... I just don't get it. Gah! Can't even think about it!What else was I going to say? I don't know if it was my edition of the book, or if it's like this in all English editions of the book, but the language is not American English, and I'm not even sure if it's British English. It's clearly a specific English spoken in South Africa. The book was translated from Afrikaans, and actually the first of Ms. Botes books to be printed in English.That was another thing that was strange and also compelling, was where the book took place. Supposedly the time was the year 2000, but it constantly felt like the 1960s or something with the way autism was being dealt with and the way blacks were being treated. The difference between whites and blacks is obviously very clear, and not just in the way they are treated. There's a line that's thought by Miriam where she says she would rather be in Brown Heaven than in White Heaven. She reflects on how their cultures are different. Comparing the white people's treatment of Alexander to the brown people's treatment of another mentally disabled boy named Tompy. The whites bascially shunned Alexander and his family, offering no help or understanding. While the browns loved and accepted Tompy. When his mother went to work, Tompy was always looked after by neighbors, fed and kept safe.There's much more I want to say about this book. Be careful though, because it will really make you think.

I've wanted to read this book since I saw a  of it in People and thought it sounded really interesting, despite it appearing to be just another book in that slew of pop-fiction. I finally bought it at the beginning of January, but because of school I've had to put off reading it. Finally, thanks to summer, I got to read it. And it didn't fail to please.I haven't ever really read a book like this before, both in plot and style. I know we've all read a book at some point that's in the form of a diary or something, but most of the ""diary novels"" I've read tend to not act like a diary. Like there's full on dialogue or what not, especially vivid descriptions of everything... as far as I know, people don't really write diaries/journals like that. Well, except for one person I know... but he's the one exception and I love him (hi, Richie!). So I was very please to read Rosalind's grief journal entries and find them written like a fourteen-year-old girl would write a grief journal.A lot of times I was struck by how absolutely true Rosalind's emotions were. I remember feeling some of those exact same emotions only a few years ago. The anger, the confusion, the sadness... I definitely tell all teenagers to read this novel because there's going to be at least one thing they can relate to Rosalind with. Be it losing a parent (or two) or hating a parent.And despite all that Rosalind says, you find yourself really drawn to Sean, he's really endearing and sweet, and I think parent's will probably be able to connect with him. He's a suddenly new parent... with a teenager... and you get to see (read?) him expressing his concerns and crying for help. Probably something most parents of teenagers (or simply most parents) can easily relate to. He struggles to be a disciplinarian, but also tries to create bonds with Rosalind, two things that are very hard to try and do at the same time.The style of the book was also really awesome, in the way that a clear story is told through various emails, journal entries, IMs, recorded conversations, teacher reports, so many different forms of communications that really get this wonderful story across.So, while I'm not sure how much parents will be able to relate to Sean (though I'm pretty sure they could) I know teens, and those who have been teens, will be able to relate to Rosalind in a lot of different ways. This book was really unique, and it will be a great summer read for you as it was for me....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jun 2005,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/546024.Donorboy

It's a beach read... so you may want to pick it up the minute it comes out on August 1st so you can read it while soaking up those last rays of summer.There's not a lot I honestly want to say about the book. One flaw it had was that it's characters weren't all that developed. They sort of had one personality type that went through with them throughout the entire story. Also, at times, the 18-year-old Merry's mature attitude after finding out about her real past, could be a bit weird to some readers. I can understand it though. Young adults who have become absorbed into one sort of art form (in Merry's case, ballet) tend to mature a little faster because they gain a certain dedication most teens don't have. Um, I'm going to stop because I'm not explaining it very well and I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, but I could see why Merry acted so mature.Overall the book was pretty good. Um... yeah. P.S.

Albeit, I was a little shocked at the end when something happens to two of our characters (I'm not giving it away in case you are intending to read or are reading this book). But... other than that I could care less. With the exception of Bertie, and occasionally Mariam, everyone in the book, be they secondary characters or primary, come off as extremely shallow... mind you, that is pretty much Hollywood for you.Wagner seems to enjoy showing off his skill with the English language and displaying his amassed knowledge of obscure nouns, verbs, and adjectives. I know that I'm a well-read young woman, but occasionally I stumbled across words that, had I the energy or the drive to do so, I would have to look up in the dictionary.

I'm just going to address my one major problem with the book before I go on to tell you exactly why I liked it so much.Language. I don't know how they spoke in the 1490s, but some of the language seemed very current. Some of the slang used to describe various body parts and bodily functions seemed like something I would hear today on the streets of England. Not America because Americans aren't quite classy enough to say ""Shitting."" Instead we say things like, ""Take a crap."" Yeah... real high brow. That was just my one major problem... and it wasn't even that big of one.I loved the characters in this book... well... except the ones you weren't supposed to love, like Savonarola and his followers. I especially loved Erila, and I'm sure you will/do too. They were all very well-developed and real, even for their time. Art lovers and appreciaters will love this book for all the praise it gives to Renaissance art and it's artists. But even if you know diddly squat about art you will still more than likely enjoy the book and understand even it's most obscure art references.Sarah Dunant is an amazing writer, stretching her craft to it's fullest when she must describe not only the art work itself, but more often than not, the colors. To see colors is one thing, but to read them is a completely different.There are several surprising loops and turns that cleverly take place throughout the story, and I don't want to spoil any for you, so I'll stop my  now before I accidently say something revealing. Overall, the book was wonderful. Definetly a must read. Especially if you're like me and you're into this type of historical fiction.P.S. My mom and I are in a debate right now. Maybe you guys can clear it up if you've read the book. Michelangelo was not Alessandra's painter, was he?

I thought the writing was lovely, and both Aggie and Arthur, who I saw as the books main protagonists, were both developed into nice, believeable characters.Other than that... I didn't enjoy the book that much. I'm going to repeat, once again, that I have an issue with an unclear timeframe in a book. It's okay if you jump back and forth... but if you don't make it clear, I get pissed off. Also, length of time... if too much happens in such a short space of time, I just don't believe it and I'm gone. Like, with Arthur's visits to Aggie, he only went three times... yet it was written out to seem that he visited her practically every weekend until the baby was born. Yeah.I thought that the issue of the persecution of the Jews was touched on nicely. Not so much as it happened, but more of a reflection on what happened in Arthur's life and how he remembers it and later reflects on it. Also how it affects him and his son.I had a problem with the relationship between Aggie and Toby. You find out early on in the book that Toby is Aggie's baby's daddy, so I'm not giving anything away here. But we only maybe see them together once or twice when they're older, but loads of time together when they were younger... perhaps though that was Carrie Brown's intent. Arthur kept seeing these two as young children. Not the grown man and woman they were becoming... so maybe that's how we were supposed to see them as well. Who knows, all I know is I wanted to see their relationship a little more.Just so you know, I read an Advanced Edition of the book, so I don't know how much has changed from this book to the released book.

She wrote in a style that made you feel like you were there being held hostage. Time played no factor in the story... just like the hostages lost their sense of time. After a while you no longer knew if it had been two weeks since the terrorists had crashed the party, or two months. And when you do find out it's been two months you're just as shocked as the hostages.You grow weary along with the hostages when you read about some mundane thing taking place, but that's the point. You are just as bored as the hostages and even the most simple thing can be the highlight of the week. You are introduced to characters that you remember well, and then there are others that fade in and out of the background, just as the hostages see one another. You like some, you dislike others. It's just amazing how you become one of the hostages, yet it feels completely natural when you are pulled out slightly and become the all-knowing narrator.The book was long and felt tidious at times, but I realized it made you feel what the characters were feeling. The writing was beautiful and the characters were well-developed. It seemed a little too convenient to have the Ultimate Translator handy for this event to take place, and you could easily see it as a tool Ann Patchett used to get her characters into easier communication, she turned him into such a key character, he no longer seemed like a convenient tool.Overall the book was amazing, and I still can't get over how the writing reflected so much on the ordeal itself. The only major problem I had with the novel was the Epilogue just seemed tacked on as some sort of final closure. She could have just left the epilogue off and had a very shocking and abrupt ending. I think that would have been befitting and followed the style of the rest of the book. The ending we do have just... I don't know.

But the ending was very different from what I expected.There were a few flaws I found in the overall- wonderfullness (if that's a word)- of the story, and that's that I think it may have been a little too long. I think the whole meaning behind the story and the relationship we see develope between Elizabeth ""Lux"" and Damien, could have still been just as strong with certain bits of the story eliminated. The beginning... the very beginning... I really didn't think needed to be there. It had no affect on the rest of the story except somehow explaining why Lux and Damien met. And even then, we didn't need all the background with Hoffman and what-not. I suppose the only reason Jessup put that in there was to introduce us to Damien in a different setting or something.

Honestly, The Secret Life of Bees has to be one of the best books I've read in a while. I just want to give it several A+'s and a kiss!It was touching, well-written, beautiful, full of expression, insightful, anything you could want in a book and then some. It started off with a bang, that wasn't a bang... it grabbed you, but didn't startle you so much that the rest of the book was dull in comparison. There was romance, love, family, racial issues, religious experiences, and bees.I have a feeling the title may deter a lot of people thinking that, oh, it's a book about bees! Well, there is a lot mentioned about bees, but it only helps enrich the story. With elements in the bees lives that tied in nicely with the lives of Lily Owens and the bee keeping sisters. All the characters are full and developed, except for the asshole racists in the very beginning of the book and somewhere in the middle, but even then real life racists aren't full and developed either. I'm sorry if you're a racist and you're reading this, but... well, fuck off. Mwa ha ha ha!The only problem I had with this book was that I wished it was longer... but I think it was the perfect length. Nothing dragged out and nothing cut too short. Like little bears porridge, chair, and bed, it was perfect! I'm not surprised their making a movie out of it... I just hope that most people read the book before going to see it, because if they mess it up in the movie, that could deterr a lot of people from reading this wonderful book. And typically books are better than movies, because there's more and you have more freedom for thought. I also want them to cast me. *wink wink*Sue Monk Kidd mentioned about possibly writing a sequel, possibly after she finishes writing her current work in progress The Mermaid Chair (which, if she continues writing like she did in this book, I will gobble up as soon as it comes out). I hope she doesn't write a sequel though, because The Secret Life of Bees can truely stand on it's own. And I'm sure as much as many people want to read more about Lily Owens and the Daughters of Mary, I think it will be hard for the second novel to live up to the expectations the first one made. This book may make it hard for Sue Monk Kidd... but if her writing continues to be as stellar as the writing in this book... she will have a fan base almost as big as J.K. Rowling.

For me I think it better understands where many of the Muslims are coming from, thought-wise, and kind of got me thinking about how much our Christian values have changed... have their values changed? I love when a book makes you do that... makes you think.One thing I would have liked to see more of was the relationships between Ellie and Will and Ellie and Gavin. I think those were shoved aside but seemed like they were meant to be dwelt upon more. But the relationship nearly every character had with the horse Hosanna made up for it. It's amazing and true how one extraordinary animal can change the hearts and minds of men so much. Even the reader finds themself falling in love with this horse, and worrying whether it will survive, or if it will heel, or what will happen to it next!

I love how she's writing a series, that's not a series... each book can be read on it's own, but it's so much better to read them together and in order.

The fact that Martha O'Connor is not afraid to address issues that obviously take place in the lives of many teenage girls today, is just wonderful. It would be a wonderful book for parents of teenagers. If you're worried about your daughter, this book will allow you to see what she may be up to from another direction, and perhaps allow you to better understand her. It will also make you realize that some things you do that you think are for your daughter's best interest, sometimes isn't. You'll realize that you should talk to your daughter rather than act without knowledge of why she does what she does.It's also a wonderful book to make you feel less alone in the world. And that friendships never die, even if you never see each other again, you'll always be friends. It's reassuring.I loved the way O'Connor set up the style of the book... setting each chapter from a different girl's perspective, and having it take place in the past or present. The past being written in 1st person past tense, and the present being 3rd person present tense. It was organized in a messy and fun way, and easy to follow. She never let the ending surprise slip out. Which was awesome.There's so much more I want to say this book.

The characters were two demensional at best, and the story line was thin and lacking in certain places. It jumped characters, perspectives, and times much more often then neccessary. And two seperate romances blossomed up way too quickly and made me want to barf.The relationship between the mother and daughter could have been really good, but instead it was just one sided really. Making the mother seem like a saint trying to do everything she can, while the daughter (who is the least demensional character in the book I should add) came off as a shallow, irresponsible bitch. Maybe I'm biased because I'm the same age as the girl, and sort of in the same position (minus being knocked up), but the daughter acts more like she's just entering high school rather than heading off to college. The ending was horribly cliche and sappy... like something out of a Lifetime movie. Hey, perhaps this will become one.

Well, by my grade I'm sure you can tell I wasn't too fond of the book and didn't like it all that much. I wish I could leave it at that, but I'm a person who's solidly against criticisms without any sort of reason to back it up with. So... let's explain why I didn't really like it...First of all, the story itself really didn't interest me at all. Sure there were moments that I couldn't put it down, but most of the time I was bored by it. Maybe because I didn't share any ties or connections to it. In many stories, to feel any sort of attraction or pull to it, you sort of have to have some sort of thing to relate to it with. This book I didn't really have that. I think other people could just as easily relate to and enjoy this story much more than I could.I think I also didn't like the story because it didn't seem that developed. It still seemed to be in a younger stage of writing, and possibly that's Edwidge Danticat's style, but I think it would have enriched and helped the story so much more if she had added more detail to it. It was very simple in many ways. And I don't want to think that she's trying to reflect the simplicity of the Haitian people or something, because Haiti and this time they're all living in is not simple at all. It's rich in color and thick with strife. And New York is a hustle and bustle of different people and business, while love is a full and strong emotion. None of that was explored, and I know the book could have been so much more had it been.Once again I had a time issue on my hands. In such a short book I can understand why Sophie suddenly jumped in age, but it was difficult and a bit confusing to follow. Especially because it seemed so much happened in between the two different ages and it felt like I was expected to know what happened. I don't mind it when we have time switches on our hands... it's just I like it when it's a smooth switch, or it's explained in a smooth way, or just... it's not as choppy as it was in this story.This book could very well be a wonderful book for someone else to read... but for me... well, it just wasn't my style....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,Dec 2004,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5186.Breath_Eyes_Memory

Honestly this has been one of the best books I've ever read and it has now been added on to my mental list as one of my favorites. I'm not genuinely one for love stories unless they take part in a bigger picture, they're well written, and aren't cheesey and vomit worthy. This book was none of these. Slowly, carefully, and as non-mind boggling as possible the beautiful romance of Clare and Henry begins.This book will make you exclaim in surprise, cry, laugh, and be happy for certain events that take place even though you knew in advanced what was going to happen in certain cases. It's amazing how tied into the characters you become and how you feel for both of them.It was the time-travel aspect of the story that really pulled me in. It's written so realistically that I wouldn't be surprised if people out there really did time-travel. Maybe it seems so much more real because it was written out as sort of a curse rather than a blessing, because you can't change anything in the past, which would be the one thing you desire to do. You realize you can't tell a lot of people things because it may ruin free will or surprises for others. Also you have no control of when and where you're going to or from. Plus, you appear naked, because anything that's not part of your body... doesn't travel with you. The book is so circular too, rather than linear. Within moments, within situations, and within the entire arc... circle... of the story. A lot of times it makes you go, ""Well, how does that work? I don't get it! But it does! Ah!!!"" For example, if Clare never gave Henry a book of dates she wrote down for him to memorize, he never would have been able to tell her the dates to write down in the book... yeah, a lot of times it's like that, lol.There is so much more I want to say about this book, but I'm afraid of giving too much away. This story is beautiful, moving, amusing, and new. A smooth moving blend of past, present, and future as well as switching between Clare's perspective and Henry's, the story is surprisingly easy to follow. One of my favorites now, I'm sure it will be one of yours....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Dec 2004,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/207035.The_Time_Traveler_s_Wife

But this book seemed like it was more of a pop-fiction book. Aimed at younger readers (teenagers) but something adults would also probably pick up to read because it sounded interesting but only to find out halfway through the book that it's rediculously insane and not worth their time.For me, it was a fun read, but it's not something that's going to stick with me. I had no problems with the writing this time around, but did have a problem with the sort of two different plot lines that really didn't have anything to do with one another. Thinking that somehow everything is going to tie together... but it doesn't. Also some things were entirely irrelevant to anything in the story... just placed there irritatingly. For example, what was the point of Winston Reece? The only thing he did to push along anything was to get Mick to talk to Myra. That's it. The rest of the times Reece pops up... he does nothing. Personally, I thought he wasn't an interesting character, he wasn't funny, he seemed to just be there, dragging the story down whenever he popped up.Also, it seemed like there was supposed to be a twist in the story that when the ending for one of the plots popped up you were going to go, ""OMG!"" But all the ""subtle"" clues that had been planted earlier made it extremely obvious where the story was going. Actually a lot of it was rather predictable.So, if you don't have a lot of time for reading and you want a really good book that will be worthwhile for you and stick with you and make you think...

Partially because I was bored but mostly because it was a very captivating read.I can't say too much because much of the plot revolves around this secret that isn't revealed until later in the book, and it's a secret I don't want to give away because then it would make reading it for the first time just... lame, y'know?The characters, or at least the two we're mostly focused upon (Hanna and Michael) aren't the most well-rounded characters to ever enter literary history... they've barely even reached two demensional, which is sad, because had they been further developed I would have felt much more attached to them, instead I just felt like an outside observer, watching them. But, perhaps that was the author's goal, because it is mentioned from time to time how Michael feels no sympathy, no emotion, just a casual observer, and maybe we're meant to feel like that as well, to feel what Michael is feeling. But I did get involved in the book and I was interested. At least interested enough to go, ""Oh, my God!"" near the end of the book... while I was sitting in the airport. Maybe you will too, maybe you won't...I really wish that Bernhard Shlinck had gone more in depth into this story because it has the power to be more than just a good read. It has the power to really make you stop and think (which at certain moments I did for a bit) and it has the power to make you wonder about your own actions and how you should view your own past, and your countries past, and your families past. Perhaps it could, for the devoted reader. But it wouldn't for a casual reader, which is a dissapointment. This had the potential to be a very powerful novel... and perhaps it is, but I did not view it this way. Some parts were moving, but a lot of it was more introspective on the part of Michael and his relationship with Hanna... which sort of impeded and clouded the more serious moments that arose in chapters. Had the relationship been more developed writing-wise, perhaps the book as a whole could have been more touching.In the end it was a good read, maybe a little touching, and for those of you who have read it, don't think I'm casually brushing off such an emotional subject, because I'm not. It's just that I have read better books dealing with this subject. The only thing that I found new and thought provoking was the idea of what second generation Germany was supposed to do about those (their parents and relatives) that were directly involved in the war, and how they were supposed to handle it...

Yeah, I put that so eloquently and explained my reasoning really well, didn't I? But no, really, this book was really good. Let's clear my only problem with it out of the way before I start on the stuff I truly enjoyed about the novel...Slow start. That's my only problem. It really took a while for things to kick up, but once they did it was a very exciting read. And even though I didn't like the slowness of the beginning part of the novel, I wouldn't have had it any other way because Dubus uses most of the beginning to set up situations and characters and make them all three demensional and believable, which was something I really enjoyed about the book. What was interesting about the book was the fact there was no clear protagonist in the idea of good guy vs. bad guy, which could have easily happened. Dubus has us constantly switching perspectives between our two main characters so we see behind their reasoning and begin to aggree with them. But before we can begin to side too much with one character, we're back with the other and beginning to side with them until we switch back. It may sound confusing right now, but Dubus does this gently so the switches are easy to follow.I would be interested to hear from those of you who have read this book about who you side with. Behrani? Or Kathy? I myself, once I finished the book, had no definite person I sided with. I thought they both deserved the house and both had very good reasons for having it. But then again I thought that neither should have the house, either because of their past actions or their current actions.The second part of the book was as fast as the first part was slow. So it sort of made up for the lack of action in part one.All together the book was wonderful, with characters you could sympathize with if not related too. Well-rounded and fully believable with their flaws. Brilliant plot and absolutely stunning writing. If you start to read this and find it boring at first, I will convince you to keep on going, because like I said before, what the first part may lack, the second part will more than make up for it....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,Nov 2004,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/359770.House_of_Sand_and_Fog

Or maybe it was just glaringly obvious for meI think Jane Hamilton tried to hard and too often to tie in the title of her book into the story itself. Or maybe it was just glaringly obvious for me since the book I was reading had penciled notes all over and various sentences and passages underlined. You wrote it in pencil! The least you could do is erase it!I'm sorry... *deep breath*I genuinely liked the book... most of it at least. There were a few spots where it felt like the characters became a little too introspective, which is irritating when you want to get back to the ""action."" I wanted to know what was happening with the court case, and how Alice was doing in the prison, things more along those lines. Not Howard's thoughts on his milking cows... at times it didn't even tie well into the story and was just floating off there by itself.What I did love was the content resolution. It's not all together happy, which would sort of ruin the realistic quality of the novel. But it was a neat and satisfying ending. Something which was lacking in a few of the books I recently read. Possibly because Hamilton knew if she didn't give the reader the solution to the problem, it would make the book an annoying and unworthwhile read. She could have easily written off the ending easily, and earlier, telling you how the case ends and leaving it at that. But I was happy she didn't, because after focusing so much on the Goodwin's lives before and during the trial, you need to know what happens to them after the trial.Another thing that struck me as extremely interesting, yet may be considered a spoiler in this reflection, was the use of a female as the accused sexual abuser. Sexual abuse is not rare in society today, quite the opposite, but usually it falls on to men. So why does Hamilton choose to make Alice Goodwin our accused? Perhaps it's so the reader automatically sides with her, disbelieving that a woman, a mother, could do things so horrible. We probably wouldn't have even had to get to know Alice at all and would still side with her. Yet, Hamilton does set up the first 3rd of the story so we know Alice, the way she thinks, and the way she reacts.It's unfortunate that it was the middle of the novel that had to drag so much, only bumping up at a few moments. If it weren't for the middle of the novel I would have given it a high B or even an A. But it was that long, lengthy, and introspective middle that brought the novel down so much. It happens to many authors though, trying to beef up the middle of their story that lacks so much, but I think Hamilton used fluff instead of something of substance.It would be interesting to come back later and re-read the novel, especially if Hamilton chooses to revise it, and hopefully focuses most of her attention on the center of the story.So many authors think they need to have an extremely lengthy novel, or at least one of 300+ pages, but that simply isn't true. If you are an aspiring author, know that it doesn't matter the quantity... but the quality.

Nor was I surprised that it was a made for TV movie. And I'm going to take a wild shot in the dark and say it was specifically made for Lifetime... Television for Women. Because everything about this book kept bringing up that whispery woman's voice as the narrator. I kept hearing, ""Anna Quindlen... A writer for women..."" No joke.But don't get me wrong. The book was good. Not life altering. Not wonderful. But a good read. At moments quite stereotypical, other times very absorbing.Anna Quindlen has written very well-developed characters, and she clearly has an idea of what's going on. Either she has experienced spousal abuse, knows someone who has, or she has done thorough research... at least that what it felt to me. I have never experienced abuse, so someone who has and read this book may think otherwise. But this isn't their , it's mine.The book is long-winded though. At times clearly dragging. There are many run on sentences with no punctuation, which could very easily drive some people crazy. I didn't mind it too much because it fell in with the style of the narrative, but I often did have to go back and read it over to pick up the cadance of the sentence or paragraph. But back to the long-windedness. This book could have easily been shorter and not left anything direly important out and could have still gotten a clear message out. Our narrator repeats herself many times throughout the book. Possibly this is a style Quindlen is trying to make because a few times the narrator (our abused housewife Fran/Beth) speaks of how comforting pattern is, how reassuring it is to have a sort of daily ritual that takes place. Maybe this is why we often have her resurrect topics more than once.Besides those few points, the book was a pretty good read. I do highly recommend this book to anyone who has suffered from domestic violence, because maybe from a different perspective, you can see exactly how important it is to go seek help. Or if you even know someone who is suffering from abuse, I advise you to tell them to go get help and suggest reading this book. Because maybe they, and you, can learn from this book that you can get out of the situation you're in and you can start a new and better life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,Nov 2004,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5157.Black_and_Blue

I was a little caught of guard when I read a few s of The Bell Jar comparing it to The Catcher in the Rye stating how it's the female version of it. I liked Catcher but I know there are many people who didn't and upon hearing that may be similar to Catcher not have the desire to read it. I assure you, The Bell Jar is a book all on it's own and should not be compared to any other book... even as a compliment.When I first started reading the book I was a little put off, feeling it was an extremely pretensious novel. Her descriptions were crisp and precise, often using words that one rarely hears spoken or even read. I went into the novel knowing that Plath was a poet and felt that at first the book was just another form of her poetry and her showing off her writing abilities. But that only remained within the first two pages, because after that I became absorbed. The writing that I was a little sketchy about at first helped me visualize the setting and get to know the characters. And though Plath never really described many characters as to their personality, I began to feel I knew them all intimately.Strangely enough, if you remember in my last , what bothered me most about The Good Earth did not bother me in The Bell Jar. Because the Esther, the character we are following, is slowly descending into madness, time no longer matters. There are a few times I was confused about the timeline, but it did not upset me. The book really spoke to me because of my own personal experiences with depression and suicide. It spoke to me as a woman and my views on sex and the confusion I'm sure most other girls out there face. It's amazing that this book was written and published over 30 years ago, really, when a new woman was coming out into the world. I have a feeling that this book helped women realize that they're not alone, and brought things to light that most people have commonly shoved aside; women and men. But what else is amazing is how relevant these topics still are today. Specifically with suicide, and specifically about the virtue and pureness of women compared to men.So I guess that is why The Bell Jar is often compared to The Catcher in the Rye, with it's discussions and writings of often controversial titles. Setting off a new generation of writers, styles, and people. Another book also came to mind as I was reading, and that was The Perks of Being a Wallflower. There are moments when I could make a few direct comparisons between the two. With Esther slowly seperating herself from socialization and sinking deeper into her own thoughts and depression. Analyzing things that go on around her and her surroundings. Very reminscent of Perks.If you feel you're suffering from depression, madness, confusion about topics pertaining to society and sex, or just looking for a good read, The Bell Jar is definetly the book for you. I also advise, if you're seriously suffering from depression, to get help for yourself. There is no shame in it, and getting help is better than ending your life. Even if you need to go on medication, DO NOT feel ashamed, especially if it's going to help you even more. ...more",Notes are private!,4,1949,1,not set,Nov 2004,"May 29, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/313276.The_Bell_Jar

This way you know none of the writing is judgemental towards the Chinese culture and it's people, but a truthful reflection of what she saw. I once again bring up the fact that her writing and imagery is simple but draws you in.One theme that seemed very constant throughout the book was that of money not being able to buy you happiness, actually quite the opposite happened to our main character, Wang Lung. It seemed that as his moeny grew and his prosperity flourished his problems increased as well, even more worries constantly pushed at him while he longed for peace. Peace which he could only find by returning to the simplicity of the soil and the earth.The one thing that bothered me in this book was the passing of time. It was very vague and unclear at times, something that irritates me when I read. I feel more comfortable if I have a general idea of the timeline of a novel, especially in one such as The Good Earth which basically spans one man's lifetime.Other than that I found the book absolutely fantastic, well written, well characterized, and just a very good read....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Nov 2004,"May 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1078.The_Good_Earth

Now... my thoughts:I picked up this book upon the advice of Oprah (and her book club) and my friend Kit. They owe me hardcore now. As does Mr. Tolstoy. This book was an extremely long read, not because of it's size and length necessarily, but because of it's content. More often than not I found myself suddenly third a way down the page after my mind wandered off to other thoughts but I kept on reading... am I the only one with the ability to do that? You know, totally zoning out but continuing to read? The subject I passed over though was so thoroughly boring that I didn't bother going back to re-read it... and it didn't affect my understanding of future events taking place later on in the book.Leo Tolstoy really enjoys tangents. Constantly drifting away from the point of the book to go off on three page rants on farming methods, political policies and elections, or philosophical discussion on God. Even the dialogue drifted off in that sort of manner. Tolstoy constantly made detail of trifling matters, while important subjects that added to what little plot line this story had were just passed over. Here is a small passage that is a wonderful example of what constantly takes place throughout the book:""Kostia, look out! There's a bee! Won't he sting?"" cried Dolly, defending herself from a wasp.""That's not a bee; that's a wasp!"" said Levin.""Come, now! Give us your theory,"" demanded Katavasof, evidently provoking Levin to a discussion. ""Why shouldn't private persons have that right?""No mention of the wasp is made again. Just a small example of how Tolstoy focuses much more on philosophical thought, and thought in general, more than any sort of action that will progress the story further. That's part of the reason the story took so long to get through.The editing and translation of the version I got also wasn't very good. Kit reckons that that's part of the reason I didn't enjoy it as much, and I am apt to agree with her. If you do decide to read this book, your better choice is to go with the Oprah's Book Club edition of Anna Karenina.The characters weren't too great either and I felt only slightly sympathetic for them at certain moments. The women most often were whiny and weak while the men seemed cruel and judgemental more often than not. Even Anna, who was supposedly strong-willed and intelligent would go off on these irrational rants. The women were constantly jealous and the men were always suspicious.There's not much else to say that I haven't already said. There were only certain spots in the book which I enjoyed in the littlest, and even then I can't remember them. All in all I did not enjoy this book, and it earned the names Anna Crapenina and Anna Kareniblah.But remember this is just one girl's opinion, if it sounded like a book you might enjoy I highly advise going out to read it.
