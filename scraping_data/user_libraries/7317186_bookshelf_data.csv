Toadling, our perspective character, is that fairy. She’s guarded the tower beyond the thorns for years, decades, centuries. And she made my heart ache. Toadling is such a sweet, lovable, quietly heroic character who has no inkling of her own attributes. She is also a tragic character; thus the heart ache. When a knight refuses to be turned back from his quest for the tower by anything Toadling does, she panics. But she also ends up making a friend, quelling her loneliness for the first time in years beyond her measure.The fairy portrayal was a unique and interesting one. Toadling is (kind of) one of the low Fae, more akin to an animal spirit or a brownie than to one of the more beautiful, mysterious Fae so popular in modern fantasy. There is more to her than first appears, but what exactly that “more” is comes into play later in the book. I loved Toadling’s description of her Fae family, and why she found these creatures that would be described as ugly by the world’s standards to be so beautiful in her eyes.I was enthralled by the opening of the story. The way in which the progression of time was presented in the first chapter was absolutely fascinating. We are seeing the slow move of time through Toadling’s eyes. We can piece together what exactly is happening in history, but she has no context for it. I was also, yet again, impressed with range of Kingfisher’s writing, especially when it comes to tone. I’ve read a few of her books now, and each has been radically different in tone and voice. This particular story feels very much like a classic fairytale in setting, but the maudlin tone lends it this achingly lovely air, akin to some gothic novels. It made my heart hurt to read it, but in the best way.I was thoroughly impressed with Thornhedge. Novellas tend to be very hit-or-miss for me, but this one worked in every way. From setting to writing to characters to the actual story being told, I just loved everything about it. I also think this would make a wonderful Studio Ghibli movie, as I could just picture this story drawn in Miyazaki’s style. This was a beautiful little tale that I will be thinking about for a while, and it’s probably my favorite take on Sleeping Beauty I’ve ever read....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 09, 2024","Apr 10, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61884932-thornhedge

I think it’s a wonderfully, prayerfully crafted show. From casting to acting, from script writing to set and costume design, you can tell how much care has been put into every element of the series, and how careful the show runners have been to stay true to the Bible. Unfortunately, like most incredibly popular pieces of art, it’s incredibly divisive. I find it heartbreaking how many Christians find the show blasphemous. Is the show word for word exactly the same as Scripture? Of course not. Characters have been written in and backstories have been expanded. The writers of the Gospels were more concerned with conveying the teachings of Jesus and the events of His life, death, and resurrection, than with telling a compelling story. And yet, the writers of the show are incredibly careful to never deviate from the Gospel. They are merely trying to showcase the unlikely cast of characters Jesus called to follow Him, the eponymous chosen, and give us an idea of who they might have been. The Chosen is not presenting itself as the fifth Gospel. It seeks to tell a good story, a story that has been expanded in terms of character development so that we can remember that the disciples were people like us. Such stories used to be more common, with Ben-Hur and The Robe serving as examples. We as a modern society have lost the distinction between truth and fact. A story can be true without being comprised of only fact. After all, Jesus most often taught in stories, though we fancy them up by calling them parables.And now, onto this actual book.The Chosen: I Have Called You By Name is a direct novelization of season 1 of the show. And I do mean direct. This is nearly word-for-word, scene for scene, the entire story of that season. As a lover of the show, this didn’t bother me. I might have hoped for a little bit of new or different or a slightly deeper dive into the internal monologues of the characters, but I was still happy with the story being told. I found it well written, though most of the chapters were almost obnoxiously short, and I say that as a reader who prefers short chapters. Some of these chapters were only a page long. I felt like they likely lined up exactly with the length of the scenes from the show. But overall, this was a fun way to revisit the show, and is among the better biblical fiction I’ve read....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 29, 2024","Apr 04, 2024","Mar 29, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55459480-the-chosen

I understand why, because it provides a fascinating overview of Christian churches across the globe through pictures. While I did find it interesting, and lovely to flip through, I had a few issues with it. Some of the descriptions mentioned the inside of a church while only providing a picture of the exterior, or vice versa. I wish that hadn’t been the case. If you’re going to detail this important piece of interior architecture, please let me see it! Also, some of the pictures themselves could have been better. I’ve personally seen better pictures of a handful of these churches elsewhere.

The last such book I found was Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow, and the series that follows it. While created for middle grade readers, the writing and the story being told are well-crafted enough to appeal to any adult reader. I would put Greenwild in the same category. As an added bonus, the book itself is gorgeous, chock-full of illustrations, large and small. There’s even a full-colored map serving as the endpapers!Daisy Thistledown has lived life on the road. Her mom, Leila, is a famous investigative journalist specializing in environmental politics. The globetrotting nature of Daisy’s childhood has been charming but lonely, and she regrets that she’s never been able to put down roots. But when Leila goes missing and Daisy is being chased through London, she finds her way into a world within our world: Greenwild, the home of a botanical magic that Daisy never knew existed. While Daisy is terribly worried about her mother, she also finds her place in the world for the first time. In Greenwild, she finds not only magical plants, but friends and a sense of belonging and, for the first time in her life, a home.Greenwild was billed as The Secret Garden meets A Wrinkle in Time. I absolutely agree with that first comparison. The second is a bit more of a stretch; the only real commonality is the fact that the Greenwild, the magical world of this book, exists in pocket dimensions within our own world. The pockets are entered through various botanical gardens, which I thought was a really fun decision. I’ve also seen some Harry Potter comparisons that I think are fair. The magical school here feels very much life a Hogwarts that is completely focussed on Herbology. There’s a Snape character, a bit of a Draco and a somewhat Hermione. There were things about the story that felt very reminiscent of Harry Potter. However, I didn’t find it derivative. I thought it was unique enough to feel in part inspired by these stories while still being very much its own thing.There is going to be at least one more book in this series, and I can’t wait to see what happens never with Daisy and her friends. I really enjoyed my time with this story, and it’s one that I think my niece is going to love in a few years. I would recommend this to readers of any age who are looking for something fantastical and whimsical with plenty of plot.

While I read abridged versiI’m trying to slowly make my way through all of Dickens’ work, and this is one of the biggest omissions still on the list. While I read abridged versions as a child, I had never read A Tale of Two Cities in its entirety. I’m very glad that is no longer the case. I have to admit that this was a more difficult reading experience than most of the other books I’ve read from Dickens. Oliver Twist and Great Expectations and David Copperfield are all pretty straight forward. Bleak House is a bit denser and more convoluted, but I had a wonderful professor guide me through that one in college, thus giving me an advantage when it came to fully digesting the story being told. And then there’s A Christmas Carol, which I had experienced in so many different forms as a child that I had no problem following the story when I finally came to the original. But then I got to A Tale of Two Cities, which is quite possibly the most well known work ever penned. It’s also one of the most unusual in terms of writing and structure.In most of Dickens’ books, we follow a very specific main character. From Oliver Twist to Pip to David Copperfield to Ebenezer Scrooge, it’s always very clear whose story is being told, and who we’ll be following throughout the narrative. Not so with A Tale of Two Cities. The cast is expansive. While said cast is interesting and varied, I didn't know who was meant to be the focus. Was it Doctor Manette? Lucie? Charles Darney? Someone else entirely? The plot seems to be going in so many directions, none of them clear. It’s a story that feels unfocussed and unimportant and honestly unnecessary for a while. After the brilliant opening lines, of course, which are among the most famous in all literature. But for hundreds of pages after that, I found myself wondering what was the point. Through the first two thirds of the book, I was just trudging through, so I could check this off my list. It wasn’t horrible or anything, but I wasn’t seeing what made this story special in any way.Until I did see. When I reached the last third of the book, I was suddenly blown away by how everything came together. Every character, every seemingly divergent strand of plot, every detail that I thought was unimportant, suddenly mattered and braided together to make a cohesive, beautiful, heartbreaking, incredibly powerful whole. I was blown away by the plotting and the character development. The cast had been expansive and the storyline muddled because the French Revolution itself was the main character, and was the true story being told. We see the multitude of reasons why the Revolution occurred, and why it was even necessary in a way, but also why it failed. (Side note: we also meet one of Dickens' most disturbing villains, who personifies the Revolution perfectly.) We see a society so deeply in revolt against the vices that oppressed them that they throw out all virtue, as well. And yet we see that virtue fight back in the most unlikely and moving of ways. What seemed like a defeat of goodness at the novel was really a quiet victory for morality. I actually wept, and I can’t remember the last time a classic elicited that kind of emotion from me.In one chapter, there is the most poignant, heartbreaking, and yet subtle declarations of love I’ve ever read. In the final chapters, we see that love realized in breathtaking ways. We see selfishness and vice die in the life of someone so that selflessness and kindness can take root in their place. It was the kindness that surprised and moved me the most. I was reminded of Jesus, and that is the highest compliment I can pay a story or a character, because He is the epitome of good, and His is the Greatest Story Ever Told. When I was halfway into A Tale of Two Cities, I was disappointed that it felt so bloated and unfocussed. By the time I had reached the final pages, I was blown away by what a unique, powerful tale Dickens had penned. This still isn’t my favorite Dickens novel, but I have immense respect for it, and it is definitely one I will be revisiting in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 26, 2024","Mar 11, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1953.A_Tale_of_Two_Cities

These are classic adventure stories for children, in the same vein as The Boxcar Children. We have a group of siblings embarking on an adventure, with a hint of a mystery in the mix. But, for the most part, we are along for the ride as they go through their day to day lives, enjoying life with a little distance from adults. In both series, there’s a delicious emphasis on the meals the children prepare for themselves. There are a few main differences between The Boxcar Children and Swallows and Amazons. In The Boxcar Children, the siblings are orphans, surviving the best they can on their own until they’re adopted at the end of the first book. In Swallows and Amazons, the siblings (both sets) have very supportive mothers who endorse their adventures. Also, in this series, there are two sets of siblings who become friends, versus the one set of siblings in The Boxcar Children. But the biggest difference had to be in the sailing emphasis in Swallows and Amazons. If seafaring and the minutia of nautical terms isn’t really your thing, it’s easy to get bogged down in those details. As I did.I thought this was a fun story, but I’m not sure I’ll be reading the other eleven books in the series.

But while this post-apocalyptic story is indeed bleak and heavy and hard, it’s also oddly hopeful. It’s a short book, less than 300 pages, and it’s stylistically unusual. It’s a surprisingly quiet story, balancing on a razor wire between gentleness and brutality, with lots of emotion and depth bubbling under the surface without ever coming fully into the light. It’s a story that inspires a lot of inner contemplation on the part of the reader. I think it’s a book that everyone should read at some point in their adult life, when they are the most willing to really spend time with a story and mull over it from a philosophical standpoint. I can absolutely see why The Road won a Pulitzer.We have two nameless main characters, the man and the boy. As this father and son traverse the post-apocalyptic hellscape that was once our world, they are frequently starving and always living in fear. There aren’t many people left, and there are even fewer animals. The only food remaining is what can be found in cans, and not all of that can be trusted. The world is cold, and covered in ash. The man is determined to get his son to the coast. He doesn’t know why, or what he hopes to find there, but he will not rest until they reach it. Thus, the man and the boy live on the road, terrified of meeting others but even more terrified of standing still. This is a story with layers. Our perspective character is the man, and we are seeing the world through his eyes. But we are sensing it through the eyes of the boy. The man trusts no one, cares for no one but his son, but is trying to put a braver, kinder face on the world for his child’s sake. The boy is more willing to trust, to be kind, to have faith, because of that. But the man has a hard time rectifying what he wants his son to believe with what the man in actuality believes. It leads to a tension that is at times heartbreaking. On this flip side of this, the man clings desperately to life, mostly out of a desire to not watch his son die, whereas the boy would rather die and see what comes after. Because, whatever it is, it has to be better than this existence, this life of hunger and endless journey. This life of the road. But the man tells the boy that they carry the fire, that they care keeping hope and humanity alive just by forcing one foot in front of the other, day after day, whether they want to or not. And isn’t that what life is sometimes?Stylistically, this is a weird one. There are no chapters. No quotation marks. It’s just one continuous stream of story, with tiny breaks here and there. This mirrors the story being told, as our characters endure this brutal monotony of life on the road, broken only be sleep or sickness. Even when something shakes them out of their norm, for good or ill, they always return to the road. I have to confess that these stylistic choices were a bit difficult for me to connect with, but I think that was the point.I found The Road very compelling. The balance of bleakness and hope resonated with me. McCarthy did so much in this story by refusing to lay everything out for us. He encourages readers to think, and deeply, about what’s going on and why. He also encourages them to never give up, even when it would be so much easier to stop striving.

I had heard that it was brilliant, a fictionalized account of real figures from history, but I also knew that I was going to have a difficult time with the material, with the hardship these Christians faced and the apostasy so many chose. I was right; it was a very difficult read. But it was also incredibly worth the effort. Silence is spiritually profound work of literary genius. It's tragic, but also laden with hope in the end.  I’m in awe of both the message and the craft with which that message was conveyed.“Sin, he reflected, is not what it is usually thought to be; it is not to steal and tell lies. Sin is for one man to walk brutally over the life of another and to be quite oblivious of the wounds he has left behind.”This is the story of Father Rodrigues, a Portuguese Jesuit priest who in 1639 hears that his mentor, Father Ferrara, has recanted his faith while on mission in Japan, amidst the Japanese government’s push to eradicate Christianity from their shores completely. Rodrigues and a fellow priest, Father Garrpe, are determined to get to the bottom to the accusations, to either prove Ferrara’s innocence or bring him back to the faith. After a harsh journey, they reach Japan and are surprised to find clusters of Japanese Christians still clinging to the faith in secret. The priests do what they can for the people, but are soon found out by the authorities. We follow Rodrigues through journey, from excited missionary to outlaw on the run, from his time in prison to what comes after. “Christ did not die for the good and beautiful. It is easy enough to die for the good and beautiful; the hard thing is to die for the miserable and corrupt.”Through it all, Rodrigues feels a kinship with Christ on His road to the Passion. Through it all, he questions God, wondering why He is silent in the face of such severe persecution. Why does God allow those who would follow Him to suffer such appalling treatment, to the point that they weaken and apostasize, trampling the fumie image of the Christ in their desperation to stop the pain? And had these people sacrificed their eternal souls in this moment of exhausted, devastated weakness?“But pity was not action. It was not love. Pity, like passion, was no more than a kind of instinct.”I thought the repetition of silence as a theme was brilliantly handled. It was powerful, and made the entire work more meditative than I would have expected. The comparisons Rodrigues drew between himself and the Christ he so loved were also powerful. But it was in the final comparison between the two, and the answer to the silence, that I found the most intense spiritual significance.There will be spoilers from here on out. If you haven’t read this book (or watched the movie) yet, but would like to, this is where you should scroll away.When Rodrigues discovers that Ferrara truly did recant, and why, he still can’t quite accept it. But when he is put in the same situation, he finds that he cannot make any other choice. For Ferrara was indeed broken by torture, but not his own. Japanese Christians were being tortured in Ferrara’s place, even if said Christians had already recanted their faith. The torture would continue until the priest himself recanted. You see, the Japanese government didn’t care about breaking the converts; they knew that in breaking the priests, they had a better chance of eradicating Christianity completely. And if a religion preaches mercy as their core value, what better way to break a priest than have him choose between saving the lives of the people being tortured in his place, or preserving their priestly pride by refusing to trample on an image of Christ? “Trample! Trample! It is to be trampled on by you that I am here.”When Rodrigues faces the same test, he finds that he cannot choose but to trample. In the climactic scene of the entire book, as Rodrigues finally understands what is happening and accepts that he will have to apostasize, he has this moment where he is staring at the fumie and believes that Christ tells him to trample. He comes to understand that Christ would have done the same, that His pride would never have eclipsed His mercy. It is here that Rodrigues understands God was never silent, that He was suffering right alongside Rodrigues and Ferrara and every Japanese Christian. It is here Rodrigues accepts that there is more than one form of martyrdom, and that he is tasked to suffer that which is least glorious, the martyrdom of his character instead of that of his body. In the end, this is a story about recognizing the heroism of the martyrs of Japan, and at the same time offering grace and forgiveness to those Christians who bowed under the strain.“but our Lord was not silent. Even if he had been silent, my life until this day would have spoken of Him.”Silence is incredibly difficult but equally edifying. It was a perfect book to read over Lent. Not only did grace pour from the page, but the craftsmanship was immaculate. The mindfulness over the inclusion of the silence motif and the comparisons between Christ and Rodrigues really enriched the story being told. Even the gradual shift from first person to third and back felt important. This is a work in translation, and I was very impressed by the work of the translator. I will say that I got bogged down in the middle, which is the only thing that kept me from giving this 5 full stars. It’s a brilliant tale, and one I think every Christian or philosophical thinker should experience in some form....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 23, 2024","Mar 09, 2024","Feb 23, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25663949-silence

From the world building to the plot to the characters, it felt wholly unique from any other fantasy stoI’ve never read anything quite like Raybearer. From the world building to the plot to the characters, it felt wholly unique from any other fantasy story I’ve experienced. And it was beautiful. Powerful. Fierce. I can’t believe this was a debut novel. I’m honestly in awe.Tarisai grew up in Swana in a gilded cage, given all of the privileges of royalty while always remaining trapped and alone, apart from her tutors and servants, all of whom feared her. Her Hallow, or magical power with which she was born, is an ability to see memories carried by any object or person she touches. She longed for her mother, known only as The Lady, to truly see her, and to love her. Instead, The Lady has raised Tarisai to be a weapon, to get to close the Crown Prince of Aritsar, infiltrate his Council of Eleven, and kill him when she loves him most. Under this curse, Tarisai finds herself thrust into a world unlike any she could have imagined, trying desperately to guard the family she’s always craved against the most insidious enemy of all: herself.I found Tarisai an absolutely fascinating character. Her struggle against herself, her naturing warring against her nurture, makes her incredibly sympathetic. I love the way she sees the world, and I love the friends she makes. I was especially taken with Sanjeet and Kirah, the member’s the of the Council of Eleven with whom Tar is the closest, as well as Dayo, the Crown Prince and Raybearer to whom the Council is bound. Sanjeet is a giant of a Dhyrmish boy who wants to use his Hallow, which lets him see the weaknesses and injuries in anyone he meets, to heal. Instead, he’s been trained to kill. Kirah is a Blessid girl, whose Hallow allows her to heal with songs. Dayo is so unlike his father, sweet and good and loving. He’s a Raybearer, who is strengthened by his Council to be unkillable by anything but old age — or by the hand of one of his Council. Each Emperor of Aritsar is a Raybearer is gifted this near immortality through their magical bond with their chosen Council. Council members have to love their Raybearer with their whole heart in order to become one with their Emperor’s Ray. Through this Ray, all of the Council siblings can share thoughts and feelings. It’s a bond closer than blood, so much so that, once you are part of a Council, you must tay close to your Council siblings or suffer a debilitating Council sickness. I adore found family tropes, and this is one of the most unique approaches to that I've come across. There must be one Council member from each of the 11 realms of Aritsar. There’s one other realm, Songland, but it is not considered part of the Empire and is cursed. Each member of the Council must have one of the aforementioned Hallows, and I found them simply lovely in their variety. No Hallow is exactly the same as someone else’s. That’s one of the things that made the magic in this book so unique. There’s no set system. It’s wild, and give out as the deity of this world, Am the Storyteller, deems fit. This made for one of the most interesting and unique fantasy worlds I’ve ever visited. One of my favorite things about this story is the emphasis on embracing who you are, and all of the facets that make you that person. In this story, cultural identity is incredibly important. Each of the twelve realms of Aritsar has a strong cultural identity, displayed in the songs they sing and the drums they play and the patterns and cloth they wear. When the Empire decides to push hard for unity, the first thing they do is try to suppress and destroy all of these expressions of identity, burning drums and songs and fabrics and doling out more uniform replacements. There’s a line from later in the book that I found powerful: “Uniformity is not unity. Silence is not peace.” We are the most united when we embrace our differences instead of trying to erase them.I loved everything about this book. The world was unlike any other I’ve read. The characters stole my heart. It’s been a long time since I loved a protagonist so completely as I did Tarisai. The writing was perfect for the story being told, lyrical without the prose ever supplanting the plot. It’s a powerful tale of justice and loyalty and identity, and I can’t wait to see how the story ends in Redemptor, the second book of the duology....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 22, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Feb 22, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50158128-raybearer

According to the jacket copy, MarActual rating: 4.5 stars.What If It’s True? is a beautiful examination of the life of Christ and the words He spoke. According to the jacket copy, Martin began wrestling with a handful of questions regarding the Bible years before writing this book:What if every single word of this story is absolutely true and I can trust it?What if the King of the universe is speaking directly to me through the words of His book?And if I believe His Word is true, how should I respond?This book is his attempt to answer those questions. He tackles the fundamentals of the Christian faith with grace and depth, digging deep where it would be so much easier to skim the surface. I found his views thought-provoking, enlightening, and firmly rooted in Scripture.I expected the highlight of this book to be the writing itself, as its author was already so well-known for his fiction when he wrote it. But, while the writing was exceptional, I was blown away by Martin’s inclusion of Scripture. You expect a book like this to be littered with Bible verses and references, but Martin also managed to weave Scripture seamlessly into nearly every paragraph in the book. This wasn’t just a list of references. I could tell as I was reading that Martin has spend a tremendous amount of time in the Word, and that he has let it saturate his life, his mind, his speech. These quotations never felt forced; they were as natural as breathing.Usually when reading spiritual nonfiction I have to keep my guard up just a tad. I’ll appreciate when the author makes a good point, and I’ll find things to learn and grow from within the text, but I’m also wary of theological fallacies, of opinion masquerading as fact, of areas where I just can’t agree with the author’s findings because they ring false. I never once encountered anything like that in this book. My theology perfectly aligned with everything Martin wrote. I found myself internally saying Amen often. I also loved the written prayers he included at the end of each chapter, and how much Scripture was woven in there, as well.There were only a couple of elements that kept me from giving this 5 full stars, and those were incredibly subjective. While I thought Martin’s prose was beautiful, there were a few times when he added in a modern but outdated colloquialism, like “my goose is cooked,” or “I’m tripping over my bottom lip,” or “licking his chops,” that I could tell were meant to make a scene more conversational, but which actually made me cringe just a little. Those took me out of the book. Also, I got so bogged down in the middle of the book that I set it aside for months. Not that what was being said wasn’t fantastic; it was. It was just a bit boggy in those middle chapters for me personally.At the time of writing this book, Martin had penned thirteen novels, but this was his first work of nonfiction. He’s done more since then, and I fully intend to read them all. I also plan to go back and try his fiction, as I loved his way with words. There’s a depth to his writing that I find moving. As his novels are by and large all very highly rated and respected, I’m excited to experience his telling of a tale all his own. But he did a brilliant job breaking down portions of The Greatest Story Ever Told, and I can see myself returning to particular chapters of this book over and over, for the rest of my life....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Jan 2024,"Feb 22, 2024","Feb 20, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38915909-what-if-it-s-true

As a Protestant, Lent isn’t something I ever observed or even knBread and Wine is a collection of reflections on Lent and Easter and why both matter. As a Protestant, Lent isn’t something I ever observed or even knew much about until the last few years. The same can be said of Advent. But something I’ve come to respect deeply about Catholicism are the sacred rhythms of their year. Evangelicals tend to see Easter and Christmas as important days, sure, but they’re only a day each. Catholics (and some of the more ritualistic Protestant faiths) see the importance of meditating on these events instead of flying through them, of observing a season of preparing the heart for the celebrations. I love this, and it’s something I’m trying to institute in my own life. One of the biggest ways I’m doing this is through reading such meditative works as the writings showcased in Bread and Wine.In this book, we have a collection of 72 brief essays or excerpts about the life, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, as well as a handful of poems. No author has more than one inclusion. While there were authors included that I already loved and was familiar with, like C.S. Lewis, Madeline L’Engle, N.T. Wright, G.K. Chesterton, Philip Yancey, and more, I was also introduced to an incredible amount of new-to-me writers, or those I’ve heard of but whose work I’ve never read. Among these were Amy Carmichael, Frederic Buechner, Søren Kierkegaard, and Dorothy Sayers. As with any collection including so many authors, the pieces varied wildly in terms of quality. None were terrible, but some were certainly better than others. There are about twenty that I loved enough to mark so that I could return to them easily. My favorites of these were written by: Barbara Cawthorne Crafton, Kahlil Gibran, Dorothy Sayers, Peter Kreeft, Brennan Manning, Frederica Mathewes-Green, Philip Yancey, Amy Carmichael, Barbara Brown Taylor, and (a poem by) John Updike. I found some of these profoundly moving, or thought-provoking, or both. Many were penned by people from different faith backgrounds from mine, which helped me stretch myself. Even if I didn’t agree with every single piece theologically, they still made me think and look outside of my own narrow beliefs. Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Bread and Wine, and I feel like it did a lot to help prepare my heart to celebrate the Resurrection. The same company has another book, Watch for the Light, that is similar readings for Advent and Christmas, and I will absolutely be buying myself a copy before December. I can see both of these being books that I revisit in part or whole on a yearly basis....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 17, 2024","Mar 26, 2024","Feb 17, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/228072.Bread_and_Wine

While not every single installment has been among my favorite stories in terms of plot, I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of catching up with Eve and Roarke. Admittedly, the cases are better in some books than they are in others. I felt that this particular installment featured a really solid case. But even better, there was a wonderful balance between the procedural elements and the relational ones. That’s a balance that Eve has worked hard for over the dozens of novels before this one, and I love seeing it finally coming to fruition here. She’s allowing herself to breathe and enjoy life, even in the midst of whatever murder she is trying to solve. After everything she’s been through, it’s beautiful to see. Also, I loved that Roarke was more present in the story than he had been in the last few books. I love their marriage, and the way they’ve softened each other over the years. Both characters shined brightly in this book, demonstrating their kindness and affection to each other, their inner circle, and even to total strangers. It was my favorite element of the entire story.Then there’s the case itself. Teenage girls are being targeted at random at huge events for teens, starting at a concert given by Avenue A. The randomly selected targets are injected with a deadly cocktail of pure heroin, ketamine, a date rape drug, and syphilis, just to add insult into the mix. The very randomness of the case made it difficult to solve. But you always know going into any book in this series that Eve will catch her killer by the end. Something that always impresses me is Nora’s ability to make you care deeply for a character in only a couple of pages, before killing them off. She did that multiple times in this book, but most compellingly in the life of our first victim, Jenna, a sixteen year old aspiring musician. I felt that the world had been robbed of a great talent, even though she had never truly existed in the first place. That shows incredible talent, in my opinion.I deeply appreciate the fact that Nora churns out these books with such regularity. It was a joy getting to spend time with this cast of characters again. The case was compelling, and I was emotionally invested the entire time.

I binged all three currently published installments in three days. I think That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Human improves upon its predecessor, That Time I Got Drunk and Yeeted a Love Potion at a Werewolf, without quite measuring up to the book that started it all, That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Demon. That first book was just a lot of fun and, while the other two installments were also enjoyment, they didn’t quite capture that same magic.I’m not going to mention the female lead of this book by name, as that’s kind of a spoiler for previous books. But she was a lot of fun, with just as much sass and snark as I’ve come to expect from Lemming’s leading ladies. And the demon once again falls first, which is a trope I enjoy. Said demon is also charming, funny, kind of clueless, and sometimes absolutely terrifying. Which is a winning combination in a love interest. The two have some great chemistry. This book wasn’t quite as spicy as its predecessor, and I was actually okay with that. Book two was a little much.The amount of tropes in this series is kind of insane. But in a fun way. In this installment alone we had fated mates, marriage of convenience, he falls first, and many more. What I’m not a fan of is the miscommunication or lack of communication trope, which was the driving force behind a lot of the plot in this particular book. If there hadn’t been so much humor in the story, it would have been a major turn-off. However, seeing as the entire series is hilarious, I let it slide.Mead Mishaps is such a funny, frothy, spicy, cozy fantasy series. There are definitely stakes, and a significant amount of bloodshed, but you also can tell from the tone of the storytelling that everything is going to work out in the end. And sometimes a steamy happily ever after is exactly what you need. That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Demon was my favorite, but I had a serious amount of fun with the entire series.

As soon as I finished That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Demon, I immediately started That Time I Got Drunk and Yeeted a Love Potion at a Werewolf. And it was just about as cute as its predecessor. Though way, way spicier. The first book was definitely open door, don’t get me wrong. But this book blew the door completely off. You know that TikTok sound that goes “What happened to hello? How are you? My name is?” That echoed in my head as I read one of the raunchiest scenes I’ve ever read in traditionally published fiction right around a third of the way into a very short book. I’m not complaining. I’m just warning you. Be prepared.I liked Brie and Felix, but didn’t feel like they captured quite the same magic as Cinnamon and Fallon. I thought that Brie’s protestations made less sense, and her capitulation came too easily. Then again, she is a serious spicy romance reader herself, and was living her best life. Hard to fault her for that. My favorite aspect was actually the introduction of a new character: the snarky, horny, sentient sword, Alexis. She was fabulous.This entire story felt just a tad rushed to me, in comparison with the first Mead Mishaps book. But was it still fun? Also-freaking-luting. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it, and immediately moved on to the most recently published installment, That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Human.

But it also sounded light and absolutely adorable. I’ve discovered a love for stories with a cozy fantasy feel, but that have actual stakes and big adventures. Adventures don’t come much bigger than the one in this book. And yet the adventure wasn’t the true heart of the story; the romance was. I generally prefer my romance to be more on the periphery, but I had no problem making an exception here. Because Cinnamon and Fallon are hilarious together. And hot. Scorching, even.Comedic books can be very hit or miss for me. That Time I Got and Saved a Demon was a direct hit. I laughed out loud in certain parts of this story. The cast grows wider and wilder and weirder as the plot progresses, and every addition added more humor. But Cinnamon and Fallon were definitely the stars of the show. This luscious homebody of a spice farmer who hates adventure and the demon she saves get up to some serious shenanigans. The fact that their chemistry is through the roof doesn’t hurt. (This got pretty darn spicy, so consider yourself warned if detailed sex scenes are not your thing.) The banter between the two was immensely entertaining. In fact, all of the dialogue in the story was pretty fantastic.Did I roll my eyes on multiple occasions? Yes. There were parts of the story that felt too convenient, or too over the top, even for a book this fantastical and frothy. I could also tell that the author is a TikTok user, as multiple popular soundbites wormed their way into the story. I wasn’t mad about it. At all. It added to my entertainment. But it also threw me out of the story from time to time, as I could actually hear the references in my head. It was kind of distracting. Fun, but distracting.By and large, this is just a really fun, fast-paced, addictive story. It’s charming and frothy and just plain delightful. I finished this book and immediately began the second in the series, That Time I Got Drunk and Yeeted a Love Potion at a Werewolf. Which, as an aside, has to be one of the wildest titles I’ve ever witnessed. I can see why Mead Mishaps is so popular. That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Demon is a smile on a page.

I love our cultural identity, and nothing encapsulates what makes us so special quite as much as New Orleans. But when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 and the levees broke, Nola suffered some truly catastrophic damage. While the city has been mostly rebuilt, the scar remains. The Ballad of Perilous Graves is a fantastical take on the city and the storm, with music at its heart.I was intrigued by The Ballad of Perilous Graves as soon as I heard of it, but it sat unread on my shelf for a long time. Just as books about books tend to be very hit or miss for me, since its a topic so close to my heart, books about Louisiana often leave me vaguely disappointed. There’s something about Louisiana that is magical and instantly recognizable, but for some reason that often proves difficult to capture on the page. Not so here. Jennings beautifully captured Nola in all of its wild, dirty, symphonic glory. Maybe it takes the presence of actual magic to get the feel of New Orleans across. And always, always, there should be music.The magical music in this story had to be my favorite element. Songs were personified and interacting with the city. Death is also a huge part of New Orleans culture, from the cemetery tours to voodoo to just the sheer history of the place. That aspect was phenomenally represented here, with the dead mingling with the living in the forms of haints and zombies and more. There was even a dead side of town that felt completely right. But it was the music running through the veins of the city and the story that really captured me.There were some wonderful characters here, but Perry, our eponymous character, was definitely my favorite. His journey, joined by his little sister Brendy and their friend Peaches, was fascinating to follow. But Casey, our other main perspective character, was where the story lost me. It wasn’t Casey himself that was the problem, exactly. I just found his portion of the story far more difficult to follow. Which leads me to what didn’t work for me about this book.The setting was exquisitely rendered, but the story itself was a mess. It felt jumbled and incredibly difficult to follow. Sometimes I wouldn’t figure out what was going on in a particular scene until chapters later. I felt like I was barely treading water when it came to the actual plot, which just doesn’t make for an enjoyable reading experience. I was reminded of a painting that is wonderful from a distance, with your eyes slightly unfocussed, but when you come closer and really look at individual elements, it falls apart.I would give this book 5 stars for vibes and setting, and 2 stars for the actual progression of the story. So I’m cutting it right in the middle with a 3.5 star rating. Even though the plot left me feeling dissatisfied, The Ballad of Perilous Graves is worth reading for its depiction of New Orleans alone. Nola is so lovingly, powerfully, honestly rendered here. It’s one of the best fictional representations of what makes Louisiana special that I’ve ever read....more",Notes are private!,1,4,1,"Feb 09, 2024","Feb 17, 2024","Feb 09, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60376501-the-ballad-of-perilous-graves

While I thought that it took a bit longer for the plot to take off than with most of the other installments in the Skyward series, it more than made up for it with the expected Sanderlanche at the end. This book was tense, heartbreaking, hopeful, and incredibly engaging. What a solid end to a solid story.Because this is the finale in a series, I won’t be discussing any specifics. Instead, I want to talk about some of the elements I loved most. A huge part of the entire series is the addressing of the question of what makes a person. It’s about acknowledging someone’s worth, even when they couldn’t be more different than you. To demonstrate this, Sanderson crafted some incredibly unique alien races. I was charmed by the kitsen, tiny foxlike beings with a samurai-inspired culture. I fell in love with the taynix, the compassionate slugs that house such power. There are races made of crystals, giant lizard people who are bonded to trees, small crablike creatures in giant suits, and so many more. There are the mysterious, terrifying delvers. And, of course, there are the humans. The defiant, fallible, brilliantly brave humans. The way so many of these peoples come together is beautiful.Which brings me to my favorite aspect of the entire series: the friendships. Across boundaries of class structure or of species, across the galaxy, found families are formed. Whether it’s between Skyward flight, or between a girl and her ship, or her tiny fox ninja, or her parrot of a slug, these friendships are what made this story so special to me. These connections gave me so many feelings. I also love how much emphasis is put on finding out who you are, and fighting for your right to be that person. It’s also about finding where you belong, and the people you belong with. There’s significant character development over the course of the series, but it always feels honest. While the battles and subterfuge and warfare are all engaging, those elements aren’t what this series is about; it’s about humanity, it all its many forms.That being said, Sanderson did a brilliant job with the action sequences. I’ve always had a difficult time following battles. Take those battles off of the ground, and I’m even more lost. But I was never lost here. I was always able to follow every maneuver. And I appreciate how much emotion Sanderson is always able to attach to these action scenes. I was moved to tears multiple times in the climactic scenes of this book.I thoroughly enjoyed the Skyward series, and Defiant was a wonderful way to wrap things up. While it got a bit of a slow start, it made for any incredibly strong finish. I’m excited to see where Sanderson takes readers in his follow-up series, Skyward Legacy....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 05, 2024","Feb 09, 2024","Feb 05, 2024",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/60742080-defiant

It was a really solid collection, with far more hits than misses, and I felt that there was a wonderful cohesion to the collection as a whole. I loved the dark fairy tale vibes. But that’s pretty much all I can come up with. Short story collections are difficult to rate and . I feel that each story deserves its own attention. So, instead of giving an overarching , I’m going to include the notes I kept as I read each story. They’re rough, and some are basically just quotes, but they’re what stood out to me as I was reading. If you want to know if I think the collection is worth your time, the answer is yes. If you want to know what I thought of each story, you can find that below, along with my rating of each.Sundown at the Eternal Staircase: 3[ ] Right off the bat, Nethercott has a fascinating writing style. I was reminded of Neil Gaiman and Kelly Link, but Nethercott's voice is also completely unique.[ ] I like the cyclical nature of the story; it was fitting for a tale focussed around a supernatural stairway.[ ] However, while I was interested in the structure and the staircase itself, the story didn't do much for me. It felt half-formed.A Diviner's Abecedarian: 5[ ] The alphabet setup of this is wonderful. A story in tiny vignettes.[ ] Serious Coven vibes, but younger.[ ] I like how none of the six girls in the group is ever named. Instead, they are ""the one of us with the long blonde hair"" or ""the one of us with the hoop earrings.""[ ] This kind of groupthink, as well as the shared belief of your own imaginings and how special you are collectively, and the mean girl behavior, feel wholly accurate regarding girls of that age.[ ] But how much of their ""magic"" is imagined, and how much is in some way real?[ ] We are also give a subtle glance into what it's like to be the New Girl, the outsider in a group like this.[ ] Loved this one. Incredibly unique!The Thread Boy: 5[ ] This one felt very much like a fairytale in tone and style.[ ] The constant sewing imagery was a lovely touch.[ ] A lovely, somewhat maudlin look at how we can't help but leave a piece of ourselves behind with every relationship, experience, and place that matters. Those ties can hurt, but they're also what make life so beautiful.Fox Jaw: 1.5[ ] ""It's true--you can't really be angry with someone without loving them first. Sort of the way that you can't cook a meal without heating the pan. You have to care to the point that the grease starts spitting up at you in pinpricks, and then, only then, can the anger start.""[ ] You can't give other people pieces of yourself. You need all of them. And yet, we can't help but give ourselves away, anyway. Those who take the most deserve the least.[ ] This story is really strange. And not necessarily in a good way. It's unusual and poetic, and oddly repellent. The War of Fog: 3.5[ ] ""The more I grow to love a man, the less I tend to like him.""[ ] ""War cannot be imagined, for those who have not witnessed it cannot truly fathom it, and for those who have borne witness--it is no longer an imagining. It is a boot print permanently crushed into the heart.""[ ] ""No war could be more sanguinary. More storied. Yes, this is THE War. The only war that has ever been or will be--because it is ours. In this way, war is like love.""[ ] This story felt very metaphysical, describing a war in a time loop, but only from a peripheral viewpoint. A fascinating concept that I wish I'd been quicker to grasp. Drowning Lessons: 3[ ] ""My sister has drowned 37 times."" What an opener.[ ] ""Maybe this is the difference between want and yearn: Want can be flipped on and off like a fuse. Want can be indulged in or set aside. Yearn is something else. You can hear it in the shape of the word.""[ ] ""If nobody really knows you, then no one knows if you’re telling the truth. And if no one knows if you’re telling the truth, you can decide what the truth is, and what it isn’t. You have the control. Even when the water is rising.""[ ] Odd. Sad. Lonely.The Autumn Kill: 4[ ] The tone here makes me think of Greek myth, as if the narrator is a huntress of Artemis. And then it swaps to a setting rooted in modern reality, with a dystopian vibe.[ ] ""I was killed once, too—swept from my mother’s bed and carved into a huntress. My neighbors sharpened my hands into bayonets. Turned my hip to dagger sheath. My teeth, they filed down to points. They made me chant the song a spine sings when it breaks. Little lullaby. Then they married me to the Hunter’s Moon, and I wore a dog-jaw crown.""[ ] ""Please shut up about the end of the world. Yes, the world changed. It does not matter how or when. All worlds end, at some point, and new ones sprout from them.""[ ] ""We use the debris of our old lives as weapons. Everything can be a weapon, if held skillfully.""[ ] Dark. Sad. Fierce. Resigned. Defiant.Fifty Beasts to Break Your Heart: 3[ ] A bestiary, but an exceedingly odd one. Written by florists, for when flowers aren't meaningful enough, or can't convey what needs to be understood.[ ] ""Monsters and flowers aren't much different.""[ ] ""But what to do when the primrose is not enough? When the greenhouse can no longrt contain a client's longing? Then--a bolder bouquet is needed.""[ ] Some of the wording gave me Gaiman vibes. Some creatures reminded me of Studio Ghibli films, like Spirited Away.[ ] There is a bit of a through-plot binding this piece together, but it's a weird one.[ ] Some of the illustrations feel like fever dreams.A Lily is a Lily: 4[ ] ""As everyone knows, when a person is missed enough, a ghost is born.""[ ] ""Like any gaseous form, she could expand and contract to fill the container of his heart in whatever way it needed to be filled.""[ ] ""Every detail of her too sharp, too true, too present. She left nothing to long for, to reach toward, and miss.""[ ] Can you love the memory of someone so much that the reality of them is a disappointment?[ ] Sweet, maudlin, sad.Dear Henrietta: 3.5[ ] ""Have you ever kept a secret for no good reason? Maybe it wasn’t juicy enough to tell. Maybe there was no one you liked well enough to tell it to. Or maybe you kept the secret so well, you even kept it from yourself—and when you reached to retrieve it, the secret hovered on the edge of your memory like an insect, batting and batting against a screen door, but fluttering off when you tried to catch it in the cage of your fingers.""[ ] This felt like an a24 movie. Very odd and inexplicably creepy. Unsettling. Possessions: 3.5[ ] ""I heard once that everybody dies twice—once when their heart stops, and again when their name is spoken for the last time. But there is another sort of dying in between, a crueler death: when those you love begin to make choices they would never make if you were there. If you were alive. Things that would be thoughtless, brutal even, but in your absence, become benign.""[ ] Another sad, existentially disturbing little story.Homebody: 4[ ] 2nd person. Always a risk. Tends to work better for short stories than longer form fiction, though.[ ] ""The first moment you saw Marlow, you didn’t love him. Then in the second moment, you did."" - A lovely way to convey falling in love. But sometimes, those first instincts are correct.[ ] This relationship felt dangerous to me from the first night, bound to gradually become more and more toxic and controlling.[ ] The subtle shift from feeling pretty to feeling less, all because of one remark. A textbook opening line of abuse.[ ] This story is all about how much of yourself you will give away or tamp down in order to please a person, and how that level of capitulation is rarely enough to keep them. Incredibly sad.A Haunted Calendar: 2.5[ ] ""Day 6 Ghost (noun): The suspended sensation of watching a wineglass tilt off a table’s edge—knowing it will shatter, but being powerless to stop it.""[ ] ""Day 25 Fact: Ghosts do not belong only to the dead. They belong to whatever is absent. A sweetheart. A misplaced key. A hometown you fled in a glinting jet plane while swearing never, never to return.""[ ] Some of these entries feel like those 2 sentence horror stories.

The tension, the pacing, the doling out of revelations. The large and varied cast of characters, none of whom you can ever trust completely. The way everything comes together in the end and how, when done really well, you can see where the author had given you so many clues, most of which go unnoticed until viewed in hindsight. But for every good mystery, there are dozens of subpar ones. When you find a mystery author you can trust to deliver, you still with them. Antony Horowitz is one of those I full intend to stick with.I couple of years ago I read my first Horowitz novel, Magpie Murders. Not only did I love it while I was reading it, I continued thinking about it months after I read the final pages. I thought it was exceptionally well done. And the limited series does by Masterpiece Mystery was possibly even better. As Horowitz adapted the story for screen himself, this was completely unsurprising to me. After having loved both the book and screen adaptation of Magpie Murders so much, I was already pretty certain that I could trust Horowitz as a writer. Having now read The Word is Murder, all doubt as been removed. At first, I thought the entire concept behind this book was kind of weird. I love the idea of a writer teaming up with a detective to solve a crime, don’t get me wrong. One of my favorite comfort tv series is Castle. But the author in Horowitz’s story being Horowitz himself? I wasn’t sure how well that was going to work. I love when authors break the fourth wall successfully, but it’s hard to pull off well. As soon as Horowitz began inserting discourse about his other works, I had to fight off my skepticism. However, he ended up growing on me as a character. It was interesting seeing how he would balance his own voice within the story. There were times when I wasn’t sure how reliable a narrator he was, which was a fun writing choice. I found the entire novel lightly campy, in the very best way possible.And then there’s Hawthorne himself. Our detective is almost wholly unlikeable. He might be brilliant, but he plays things so close to the vest that it’s difficult to determine. I found him unpleasant much of the time, and downright awful periodically. He’s incredibly abrasive, and I found him difficult to understand. Much the same difficulties Horowitz himself had. But he grew on me as he grew on Horowitz. The case we follow was never boring, and actually ended up going in a completely different direction than the one I predicted. This misdirection was made even more entertaining by the fact that Horowitz was just as befuddled. I really appreciated how he recapped the clues he himself had written without even registering them as clues. That was an interesting touch that felt somewhat unique.As for the writing, I fell in love with Horowitz’s style on the first page. Again. He has such an easy, classy, charming way with words. And he’s clever. I found myself feeling everything he was feeling as a character, which says a lot for his craft. I also really appreciated the stylistic difference between chapter 1 and the rest of the book, as the we are unaware of Horowitz’s personal presence in the case in that first chapter, but have been introduced to him as a character immediately after.The dynamic between Horowitz and Hawthorne was an unusual one, and it kept my attention from start to finish. I was invested in the case, as well as in Horowitz’s conveyance of it. The Word is Murder is just a really solid mystery all around. It’s fun and clever and perfectly paced. I will definitely be reading more in this series!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 30, 2024",Feb 2024,"Jan 30, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36204075-the-word-is-murder

There is a huge cast of characters, with no single protagonist or antagonist. Multiple people fit into both of those camps. The plot is almost ephemeral, proving very difficult to grasp and follow in some places. We get a lot of back stories for seemingly minor characters. And yet, everything somehow comes together in the end. The very lackadaisical telling of it feels like an important aspect of the story. It’s book well worth reading, but it’s by no means easy.I got lost in the minutia of this story, and not in a good way. There were so many briefly mentioned secondary characters, and so much detail, that I felt like I was barely keeping my head above water in certain portions. The plot was incredibly meandering, to the point where it disappeared for chapters at a time. However, there is a section in the book where a particular character is sharing a story with others in the cast as she eats a piece of pie. By the time she’s finished, she has somehow given the group a plan to break a boy out of a horrible facility, and has even provided a map through her dissected pie, all without saying a direct word about it. I feel like that scene, which was in the back half of the book, did a lot to help me understand McBride’s storytelling method for this particular work. He spins a story without ever directly telling you anything. You hear people’s stories, and you watch as events unfold. It’s up to you to piece everything together from the breadcrumbs McBride drops.I had never thought about the intersection of Jews and Blacks during this period of American history, and I found it fascinating. In the 1930s, when the story is set, both groups were still very much looked down upon by whites, and both tended to live grouped close to each other. I loved seeing the intersection of these two groups, and how they banded together in this small town when such unity was needed.Among both groups were a wonderfully varied and engaging cast of characters. My very favorite was Chona. Chona is a wonderful character, one who is ahead of her time in her view of people who are different than her. She is a Jew who sees her Black neighbors not as lesser in any way, but as fascinating individuals worthy of the same treatment as anyone else. She’s a fighter, and I love her. I also loved DoDo, the deaf Black boy who becomes so central to the story. And I was captivated by Nate, who seems so steady but can be absolutely terrifying when called for. There’s Moshe, Chona’s theater owner husband; Malachi, the dancing Jew who waltzes in when Moshe needs a friend; Addy, Chona’s Black caretaker and wife to Nate, both of whom are DoDo’s adopted parents; Fatty, the Black with a seemingly endless amount of odd jobs; Doc Roberts, the white doctor in town who doesn’t see himself as racist, but who absolutely is, and who is the source of so much pain in the book. There are many more, as there was a huge and wildly varied cast that was difficult to keep straight, but these were the standouts for me.There were elements of this story that were absolutely heartbreaking. And yet, strangely, I could never feel as sad as those scenes should have merited. There's something about McBride's storytelling that feels tongue-in-cheek and humorous, even in spaces where levity clashes with the story being told. This kept the book from feeling too heavy, which I appreciated, but it was somewhat jarring. I remember this also being the case with Deacon King Kong when I read it, though I think that peculiar tone worked better there, in my opinion.I saw other ers compare this book to jazz music, and I think that’s accurate. Jazz music abhors structure, and The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store meandered and crescendoed and built in ways and places I didn’t expect and couldn’t predict. Jazz is something that I appreciate and respect, especially as a musician, but it’s not a genre that really resonates with me. It’ll never be the type of music I’m drawn to. And that’s how I felt about this book. I respect and appreciate it, but the style and structure didn’t really speak to me....more",Notes are private!,1,6,1,"Jan 24, 2024","Feb 03, 2024","Jan 24, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65678550-the-heaven-earth-grocery-store

There they are given a quest of mythic proportions: find three keys to free the souls of three demigoddesses over the course of three months, and each woman will win a million dollars. But, of course, there are stakes. Should they accept the quest but fail to deliver, they will each lose an undisclosed year of their lives. The women, Mallory, Dana, and Zoe, must believe in the seemingly impossible and band together in order to complete their task and win the prize. This third installment is Zoe’s story. She has the most pressure on her, as both of her friends have already succeeded in finding their keys. She’s also the only member of the triad with someone who has to come before her search or herself: her 9 year-old son, Simon. Zoe got pregnant at sixteen, but she refused to raise her child in the same run-down trailer park where she grew up. She left and, through a lot of hard work, made a great life for herself and Simon. She pinched and scraped as a hair stylist to buy a diamond-in-the-rough of a house and turn it into a lovely, charming, cozy home. And now she’s opening her own place, after years of dreaming and planning. In spite of the stressful search for the key, her life is going better than she could have hoped. Now, if she could just figure out what to do about Bradley.Bradley Vane, completing the triad of male friends who have served as romantic leads, is the heir to the HomeMakers chain, which is a bit like Lowe’s or Home Depot. He is swimming in money, and that is all Zoe sees at first. Which is unfortunate, because she wants absolutely nothing to do with rich guys; been there, done that. So, poor Bradley starts off on the wrong foot with a woman whose face he fell in love with years ago, when he saw her likeness in a painting. Luckily, Bradley is a hard worker, and he’s up to the task of winning her over. It helps that he’s completely in love with Simon, bonding with the boy over video games. Zoe is so courageous. She is the fiercest of the three, so it’s fitting that she must find the Key of Valor. She’s a gorgeous, creative, hardworking mama bear, and I have so much respect for her as a character. I adore her relationship with her son. Simon is brimming with personality, and I was delighted with him every time he took centerstage. Their little family was just a joy to visit.I also love the friendship that buds between Mallory, Dana, and Zoe. I also absolutely adore the business venture they embark upon together in the form of Indulgence, a combination art gallery, bookstore, and salon. It just sounds incredible, and is the fictional shop I have daydreamed about the most in my life. One of Nora’s strengths as a writer is her easy way with poetic descriptions of places, and that is on brilliant display in this trilogy, not only in Indulgence, but in the houses of our various characters as well as Warrior’s Peak, the aforementioned mysterious mansion. Nora paints beautiful pictures with her words here.While I’m sure there are plenty of legitimate critiques that could be made of this book and the rest of the trilogy, I have no notes for this story.

Here’s what hooked me: “A young woman descends into a seductive magical underworld of power-hungry scholars, fickle gods and monsters bent on revenge to break her family's curse in this spellbinding contemporary fantasy debut.” There are so many things that grab me in that little synopsis. A “seductive, magical underworld?” Sign me up. “Power-hungry scholars?” Forever and always. Fickle gods and family curses? Yes, please. While I did get all of those things, the story itself didn’t land quite as solidly for me as I had hoped it would. This story brought to mind a multitude of others. I was reminded of The Ten Thousand Doors of January in bits and pieces of the writing style, as well as in the key and door motifs. Strange the Dreamer came to mind in terms of tone and texture, and even the story itself. There was a whiff of The Starless Sea, a subtle hint of The Night Circus. By and large, these are books that I adore. So to say that my expectations for The City of Stardust were through the roof would be an understatement. And high expectations are always risky.I found this to be one of those odd stories that is strongest in the middle. It got off to a bit of a slow start, and the finish felt shaky and not wholly formed. But the middle 200 pages or so were incredibly engaging. This was the quest portion of the tale, and it was well crafted and well delivered. It was here that I found our main characters, Violet and Aleksander, to be at their most compelling. The various settings were all beautifully rendered. I felt that the pacing and tension, both in terms of plot and romantic undertones, were wonderfully balanced in this section. I could have overlooked the weaker beginning had the ending not unraveled. At least, it did so in my eyes. The tension dissipated where it should have been the tightest.I liked The City of Stardust, and there were aspects of it that I absolutely love. The descriptions of Violet’s bookish childhood was fantastic. I loved Ambrose and Gabriel, Violet’s uncles, though I actually wish they had been given more time on the page. I was fascinated by the hidden world of Fidelis, and the scholarly underworld that had found its way from that world into our own. Aleksander was a very intriguing character, and I was never quite sure where he was going to fall in terms of relationship with Violet. The mythos here was pretty fascinating, and the supernatural entities were a wonderful blend of awe-inspiring and terrifying. Georgia Summers created something lovely in The City of Stardust, if a touch unbalanced in terms of pacing and a maintenance of tension. I might have felt a bit ambivalent about the way things wrapped up, but by and large I think this was a solid debut. If everything that comes from Summers’ pen is this lovely, I can’t wait to read whatever she puts out next!...more",Notes are private!,1,8,1,"Jan 23, 2024","Jan 30, 2024","Jan 23, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/145624782-the-city-of-stardust

The women, Mallory, Dana, and Zoe, must believe in the seemingly impossible and band together in order to complete their task and win the prize. This second installment is Dana’s story, and she is the Nora Roberts heroine who, throughout her entire body of work, I relate to the most. Dana is obsessed with books in the same way I am. Consider the quotes below:“She surrounded herself with books at work and at home. Her living space was a testament to her first and abiding love with shelves jammed with books tables crowded with them. She saw them not only as knowledge entertainment comfort even sanity but as a kind of artful decoration. ”“...If I don't have twenty or thirty books right here, waiting to be read, I start jonesing. That's my compulsion.”I would say I need to have ten times that amount waiting to be read for the first time, but otherwise Dana and I are in total agreement. She has a book for every occasion, and that makes her a kindred spirit for me. Then there’s Jordan, her brother’s best friend and her first love, who left her to pursue his writing career. He’s back, and he’s still gorgeous. And she’s still royally pissed at him. But he’s grown a lot, and so has she. They have to find new footing together as the gang continues their search for the second key. Dana’s key. I love how Nora writes Dana’s love for books, as well as Jordan’s passion for penning them. There is an enormous love of story permeating this entire installment, which is why it is my favorite of the three, though every single one of them is a 5 star book for me. The second-chance romance is wonderful, as is the character development from not only Dana and Jordan, but from all six of our main characters. The search for the key is compelling, and the tense climax of this book is my favorite in the series. And then there’s the library at the end. It’s truly what dreams are made of.I also love the friendship between Mallory, Dana, and Zoe.

The women, Mallory, Dana, and Zoe, must believe in the seemingly impossible and band together in order to complete their task and win the prize. Our main character of this first book is Mallory, an art dealer with the heart and soul of an artist who has always mourned the fact that she doesn’t have the gift to produce great art herself. But she takes her love for art and shares it with the world in a different way, helping others find the art that speaks to them. I love the way Nora describes art. The power of it. The making of it. The love of it. She’s had many novels featuring artists and those who work with art, and I’m always wowed by the way she weaves the love her characters feel for art, and the magic of the art itself, into her stories.As with all of Nora’s books, there is a strong romantic element. The romantic interest in this book is Flynn, a reporter running the town’s only newspaper. He and his big mutt, Moe, don’t sweep Mallory off her feet as much as literally knock them out from under her on their first meeting. Both Flynn and Moe are charming and brimming with personality, but it takes Mallory a while to warm up to them. When she does, she falls hard. And fast. I really like the progression of their relationship, and their dynamic with one another. They just click. I also love the friendship that buds between Mallory, Dana, and Zoe.

It’s one of the most magical worlds every created, and it has captivated my imagination since I first met Aslan in elementary school. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve revisited that world, whether through rereading the entire series or dipping my toes back into a single book. But I would be lying if I didn’t confess that there are portions of the books that I’ve never quite understood. I could grasp why Father Christmas visited Narnia, even if there was no Christ or Nativity in Narnia; it demonstrated the passing of the White Witch’s tyranny. And yet, his presence still threw me. But not nearly as much as the presence of Bacchus in Prince Caspian, or Father Time in The Last Battle, or a host of other small inclusions in the series as a whole. If Narnia is about Jesus, as Lewis stated, how did these others fit in?“There is a spirit linking all these different things just as in the real world the Spirit of Christ is to be seen both in the Creator and in His creation.”“We “enjoy” the heavenly atmosphere in each book—breathing it, smelling it, tasting it, allowing it to fill and inform our whole imaginative experience.”When I was rereading Narnia at the end of 2023, I was listening to the C.S. Lewis Book Club Podcast alongside it. They kept mentioning a book called Planet Narnia, and how the findings of Michael Ward shed so much light on the series. The Narnia Code is a shorter, tighter version of that book. Scholars had for years been searching for what bound the seven Narnia books together, outside of just the setting. There was obviously some through-line, something binding everything together. We feel that when we read it. And yet, no one was ever able to put their finger on it. It wasn’t the seven deadly sins, or the seven virtues, or anything else linked to the number seven. Or so we thought, until Michael stumbled upon the answer.“If we don’t understand where we have come from, we won’t really understand where we are or where we’re going. It’s vital to keep alive a knowledge of old ways of thinking in order to keep fully alive our present way of thinking.”Lewis loved medieval cosmology. While he didn’t believe that the universe was physically set up that way, since science had proved otherwise, he loved the depth of meaning attached to the heavenly bodies in pre-Copernican cosmology. At that point in time, we believed that the Earth was fixed in place, and that celestial bodies revolved around us. These seven bodies, the only ones knows at the time, were: Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Saturn. Each of these celestial bodies were given a host of attributes, and those attributes were on display in those born under each body, or those under its influence at any given time. “Modern science tends to think in terms of matter and mechanism and measurements. But pre-Copernican science tended to think also in terms of purposes and points and persons. Lewis thought it was a mistake to allow the two sets of quests to get split apart from each other. To be fully human we need to ask and try to answer both sets of questions, not just one set.”This belief might be outdated, but it was rich in meaning. Lewis was fascinated by it, and wove it into every aspect of Narnia. Each book corresponds to a different celestial body, and shows some different facet of Aslan’s character. We see Him, and thus Jesus, as King, Commander, Light, Mirror, Word, Life, and Mystery. “By using more than one image for God, we remind ourselves that any image is only temporary; it must be corrected and relieved by other images. These images serve our minds; they do not save our souls. A fork is not food.”Which book corresponds to which planet? That’s what this book is about, and it brought so much rich insight and clarity to the entire series for me. I loved my time with The Narnia Code, and I don’t want to spoil the joy of discovery for anyone else. It’s absolutely worth reading. And it will make you fall in love with Narnia all over again. If you want to discover these insights for yourself, stop reading here. But if you want to know these links without experiencing the book for yourself, I’ll end this  with Ward’s seven point summary:“In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, the children become kings and queens under the royal crown of Jupiter.In Prince Caspian, they become knights and forest folk under the wooden shield of Mars.In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, they drink light and slay dragons under the Sun’s golden embrace.In The Silver Chair, they avoid lunacy and reflect truth beneath the mirroring Moon.In The Horse and His Boy, they learn true speech under the living and active word of Mercury.In The Magician’s Nephew, they witness creation, laugh, and learn to love the Morning Star (Venus).And in The Last Battle, under Saturn’s awful and awe-full influence, they learn the final lesson: ‘Blessed are those who die in the Lord.’”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 17, 2024","Feb 06, 2024","Jan 17, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8690897-the-narnia-code

I’ve slept a lot since then, so I remembered very little about it. This book feels like an entire trilogy woven into a singular book. The characters are all radically different from one another. There are three romances developing at the same time, all of which are fun and compelling. And the plot itself, the mystery and thrill of the search for the Three Fates, was fascinating and addictive.I do have to say that this book feels a bit dated compared to her more recent work. Not only has her writing itself improved through the years, this book felt like the late nineties or early aughts. There were cigarettes everywhere, which is now far less common, and the internal monologues of the male characters sometimes came across as vaguely sexist. Her male main characters today feel much less “protect the little woman” than the men in Three Fates. That’s not to say they weren’t still excellent characters. They were! All six of our main characters were unique and charming in their own way. I was especially fond of Tia, who grew tremendously over the course of the plot, and Cleo, who softened just as significantly. I also adored the friendship that developed between the two. All three romances were lovely, if plagued by the occasional touch of melodrama. And the found family that the six crafted for themselves was wonderful. Nora has a way with found families.The history underpinning the plot, that of the Three Fates themselves as well as that of the families impacted by the sinking of the Lusitania, was fascinating. Nora did a brilliant job weaving all of these elements together, and the story never lost my attention for even a moment.

Glaspey does exactly what the extended title promises: he takes us through the fascinating stories behind great works of art, literature, music, and film, and shows us the spiritual background underpinning them all. From Handel’s Messiah to Bob Dylan’s Infidels, from Rembrandt to modern art, from John Bunyan to Flannery O’Connor, the scope in terms of time frame and breadth of subject matter was incredibly engaging. I was always interested to see what I would get to learn about each day, and I loved seeing the faith behind the art. Each chapter covered the artwork itself in the first half before diving into a brief biography of the artist, including their faith journey. In less than fifteen minutes a day, I gained a wealth of knowledge about, and a far deeper appreciation for, sacred art in all its wildly varied forms. There were days when I actually wished that the chapter was longer. If you want just a brief overview of how faith has shaped so many famous works of art, music, literature, and film, I would absolutely recommend this book!

I had higher hopes for Great Expectations, as I tend to very much enjoy Dickens’ writing style. I adore A Christmas Carol and consider it to be one of my favorite, and most reread, books. In the past, I have read and liked David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Bleak House. I’m happy to report that I enjoyed Great Expectations just as much. The story had a bit of a slow start, and I found a lot of the characters wholly unlikeable. Unfortunately, this included Pip, our main character, for nearly two thirds of the novel. I found Pip to be incredibly selfish for the majority of the book, especially after he is given his “great expectations.” However, he grew tremendously in the third act of his story, and I ended up coming to respect him. When he finally saw outside of himself and his expectations, he grew from a selfish boy into a good man.For the first third of the story, the only characters with any redeeming qualities were Joe and Biddy, both of whom were good as gold and worth more than all of the other characters put together. Joe is an illiterate blacksmith and the closest thing Pip has to a father. He protects Pip from the world the best he can, and is one of the most forgiving characters in fiction. Biddy is closer to Pip’s age. She is incredibly intelligent, soaking up any education she can by proxy, and has a keep grasp on the inner workings of the human heart.In the second act we are introduced to two more worthy characters, Herbert and Wemmick, The two could not be more different, but both were excellent friends to Pip in their own ways. Herbert is poor, but genteel and kind and just an upstanding person. Wemmick is almost two separate people, one at work and one at home. I was afraid he was going to be another Uriah Heep, but happily he was not. Instead, he is a proto-Goth obsessed with death and “portable property,” who very much marches to the beat of his own drum. His home has a drawbridge. He’s incredibly sweet with his deaf father, whom he calls the Aged. I just loved every time he appeared on the page.But far outweighing the likable characters were the unlikable one. There’s Pumblechook, who is haughty and believes himself to be magnanimous, which couldn’t be further from the truth. There’s the infamous Miss Havisham, who I found incredibly disturbing in her rotting bridal gown. Estella, Miss Havisham’s ward, is a diamond incarnate, gorgeous but cold as ice. Mr. Jaggers is a cold, cruel, unfeeling lawyer who somehow still has his own code of morality. Orlick, Joe’s apprentice blacksmith, is the most menacing of the lot. And then there are escaped convicts and harsh relatives and so on. While there was a pretty compelling plot here, especially toward the end, this is definitely a character-driven novel. Dickens truly excelled at his character creation. Nearly the entire cast of this book was unique and memorable, which tends to be the case for all of his books I’ve read so far. I also love his way with words. The writing here is witty and clever and subtly amusing. Our narrator is an older Pip, who seems so unlike the Pip we first meet that the two almost feel like separate characters. Alongside the four characters I mentioned as being likable, narrator Pip was among my favorite characters. I enjoyed Great Expectations so much more than I expected. Even with my positive track record with books from Dickens, I always go into hefty classics like this with low expectations. And I’m also elated when I’m proven wrong, and am pleasantly surprised instead. This was a novel of mystery and intrigue and morality, all presented through fantastically memorable characters, the principal of which grows tremendously over the course of his story. It’s a tale well worth reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,Jan 2024,"Jan 18, 2024","Jan 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6296632-great-expectations

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve read A Christmas Carol, and I’m planning to read it again before this Christmas. Last year I watched the film, The Man Who Invented Christmas, about the story behind Dickens writing his famous Christmas story, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know it was inspired by a book of the same name, but when I saw this title, Mr. Dickens and His Carol, I was both enchanted and intrigued, and decided to try Silva’s take on the tale instead. I’m so glad that I did, because this book was a joy to read from start to finish.Our story follows Charles Dickens over the weeks leading up to one particular Christmas. When his current novel fails to perform up to the level of his prior works, his publishers essentially blackmail him into writing a Christmas book within just a few weeks, or he would have his wages garnished significantly. With an already alarming number of demands on his finances, coming from all sides, Dickens has a bit of a panicked breakdown of sorts. He is feeling less of the Christmas spirit than ever before, acting so out of character that he actually drives his wife to leave with the children for Scotland. Alone, and running from everyone’s demands on his money, can Dickens find enough inspiration to pen the Christmas story he so desperately needs to get himself out of his situation?I absolutely loved Silva’s take on Dickens. He felt balanced, and embodied his characters so well. It was a joy seeing what inspired certain names and scenes and plot points of this story I’ve loved all my life. Dickens was a great collector of names, and it was so much fun to watch him come across so many of his most famous ones. There was such whimsy to this story, even at its darkest points.The writing here is charming and clever, with quippy plays on words and evocative imagery. And yet there’s a depth of feeling to the story, as well. I felt that the quippy prose came near to negating that depth on occasion, tempering the turmoil Dickens was feeling instead of letting us stew in it alongside him. I also find it a bit difficult to suspend my disbelief when an author adds elements of magical realism or the supernatural into events that actually occurred, but that’s a personal struggle. Other than those two qualities, this was a nearly perfect book for me. Silva stated in her author’s note that this book is “most of all, a fan letter, a love letter, to the “Inimitable Boz” himself that says, “I know you were a flawed man who had a heart as big as the world. That you saw Christmas as a time to reconnect with out humanity and revel in even our smallest blessings. And that you lived with so much darkness, inside and out, but leaned—urgently, frantically—always toward the light.” That’s a beautiful sentiment, and one that rings true to me.

The world of the Archipelagos, a land witImpossible Creatures is the best modern children’s fantasy I’ve read since the first of the Nevermoor books. The world of the Archipelagos, a land within our world that’s hidden from view, is simply magical. It’s where all of the creatures of myth and legend exist, fed by the magic of the glimourie that runs through the islands and their waters like veins. When the glimourie begins to fade and creatures start dying, it’s up to an orphan girl with a flying coat and a boy from the outside world to figure out what’s happening and stop the decay before it’s too late. What follows is a gorgeous, sweeping adventure, filled with peril and mystery and so much heart.The writing here is a wonderful blend of easy and lovely, a perfect combination for a children’s book. It reminded me of Narnia in that way. I think that Impossible Creaturescould stand the test of time in a way few modern children’s books likely will. There is an incredibly magical and compelling story here, but there are also some difficult but important themes. Too often it seems like modern children’s fiction feels this pressure to be “safe,” but children face death and loss and hardship just as grown-ups do. Having stories like this one, that show heroic sacrifices and hard knocks and how to grieve properly, can be a powerful tool for a child experiencing big, difficult emotions for the first time. I appreciated that just because a character was lovable and important didn’t mean they were safe. It broke my heart, but certain losses here made the story so much more powerful to me.I loved the characters. We have Christopher, the boy from the outside who finds his way to the Archipelagos after rescuing a baby griffin from drowning. He is brave and kind and has a way with animals both mundane and magical. Mal, the girl from the Archipelagos who first found the griffin and raised him, is a scrappy orphan with a flying coat. She has suffered much, but she is fierce and tenacious and much more open-hearted than one would expect. The friendship between the two is something special. The, we have Nighthand, a Berserker turned pirate, who is far kinder than I would have expected, and Irian, a marine scientist and a lovely, mysterious woman. These two adults, along with some fascinating mythical creatures, join Christopher and Mal on their mission to save they glimourie, and thus the Archipelagos.I was drawn in by the gorgeous cover art and a blurb on the front that struck me as…unlikely. Michael Morpurgo was quoted as saying, “There was Tolkien, there is Pullman, and now there is Katherine Rundell.” These seemed like some pretty unfair comparisons to draw, as those are very large shoes to fill. And yet, as I read, I could absolutely see Morpurgo’s point. There’s a timeless quality to both the story itself and Rundell’s craftsmanship that I believe will give this book that level of staying power. Impossible Creatures is a beautiful story with so much heart. There is darkness here, and sacrifice, and tears, but there is also so much joy. This is a story that I’ll be thinking about for a long time, and I’m already looking forward to sharing it with my niece when she’s old enough for it. ...more",Notes are private!,2,37,1,"Dec 06, 2023","Dec 08, 2023","Dec 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/134979103-impossible-creatures

I’m not the biggest young adult or sci-fi fan, but this series is something special. Even outside of the Cosmere, even in a genre that isn’t my favorite, Sanderson can do no wrong. The way these characters, especially Spensa, have grown over the course of the series so far is incredibly compelling, as are every new character Sanderson adds into each installment. The world building is phenomenal, and the descriptions of the different alien races and worlds are endlessly fascinating. Sanderson’s imagination knows no bounds, and it’s a joy to read.One of the things I love most about this series it the fact that each book is so radically different from the others in terms of setting and specific plot, while maintaining its overarching plot and tone beautifully. This blend of individuality and continuity works so well for the story being told. As stated above, Spensa has grown tremendously since we first met her in Skyward. This book picks up immediately after the last events of Starsight, and introduces us to a radically different, and often disturbing new setting: the Nowhere.

The writing was fine. The pacing was fine. The characters were at least somewhat interesting. The plot wasn’t what I was hoping for, but it wasn’t terrible. I just felt that the synopsis had so much potential, and that the ball was dropped. In a month, I won’t remember anything about The Last Days of the Midnight Ramblers.I was so excited for this book. I love books about bands and music and the drama behind the songs. That’s what I got with Daisy Jones and The Six, and I adored every minute of it. And that’s what I was expecting from The Last Days of the Midnight Ramblers. Unfortunately, that’s not what I got.  This is billed as the story of a ghost writer helping two of the biggest personalities associated with the band as they decide to tell their stories, fifty years after tragedy changed the band forever. While that is technically true, the plot focussed for more on the ghost writer herself than the band, and that was the main source of my disappointment. I hate to draw unfair comparisons between this book and Daisy Jones and The Six, but that story was so centered on the band and the music that they made that you kind of forgot that the writer was even present. Here, the writer is the focus of her own story. I get it, ghost writers are people too, and they experience some wild and unique things in their job. I could definitely be interested in the story of a ghost writer, if I hadn’t been promised something else.The mystery of what happened to one of the founding members of the band on that fateful night fifty years ago, and who might have been involved, is for sure at the heart of the story. But this was far more about Mari’s detective work than anything else. Mari, the ghost writer, was definitely the main character. Which I might have been able to forgive if I hadn’t found her wholly unlikeable. And, most disappointing of all, there was no music truly present. A song or sound might be mentioned in passing, but music didn’t just take a back seat in this story; it was in the trunk, or tied to the roof of the car. It was the least musical music book I’ve ever read.The story being told here was, as I stated earlier, fine. It just wasn’t what I was led to expect. I don’t feel like reading it was a waste of my time, per se, but I couldn’t help but be disappointed. The Last Days of the Midnight Ramblers could have been a showstopper.

The worldwide excitement and camaraderie it elicited wouldThe Year of Sanderson has been a readerly event that I’ll remember for the rest of my life. The worldwide excitement and camaraderie it elicited would be memorable alone. But the four new, unexpected stories we were gifted will keep enchanting readers for years and decades to come. I adored Yumi and the Nightmare Painter, and loved Tress and the Emerald Sea. I wasn’t a huge fan of The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook to Surviving Medieval England, but that was a personal preference thing; I’m not a big fan of Pratchett or Adams, who were the big inspirations behind that particular story. Then came The Sunlit Man. I think this is the first time I’ve felt conflicted about a Cosmere book. While there was a lot here to love by the end of the story, it was also bafflingly difficult to keep up with in the beginning. I ended up really liking it, but it’s the Secret Project book I’m least likely to recommend to others, because it requires the most foreknowledge.The Sunlit Man is the most expert level Cosmere novel I’ve read. I feel like, in order to fully appreciate this story, one would need a coppermind filled with every term in the Cosmere as well as a working knowledge of the future. If you have no familiarity with the majority of the currently published Cosmere works, I’m not sure how entertaining a read this would be. It certainly wouldn’t be a very fulfilling one. I ended up having a lot of fun with it, but there was a pretty steep learning curve. It’s been a while since I read certain parts of the Cosmere, so I had to dig deep to remember.This is our first introduction to a more modern era of the Cosmere, and I found the possibilities in that regard fascinating. The various worlds are now connected in more ways than one, including a Cosmere-wide space race as technology races forward. Reading this made me incredibly excited for the future of the Cosmere, specifically for the third Mistborn series and beyond. Nomad is an interesting main character with a profoundly important background that is gradually revealed over time. There were a lot of great characters, actually. Aux and Elegy and Rebeke and Zeal and the Greater Good were all interesting and varied. There was a compelling, disturbing villain and an unusual, unique plot. I also loved the religion present in the story, though I won’t go into detail, as it relates back to another world in the Cosmere. Overall, I ended up really enjoying this book, though it took me far longer to read than most of Sanderson’s work. I think that’s in part because the beginning did kind of feel like work. Also, the breakneck pace was kind of exhausting, oddly enough. However, I think this is a book that will hold up admirably to rereading. The connections it makes between various worlds in the Cosmere were wonderful and intriguing and I can see them meaning even more as future stories are published. The Cosmere is my favorite fictional place in existence, and I can’t wait to see even more of the beautiful, infinitely creative pieces of it Sanderson gives us in years to come....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 31, 2023","Nov 14, 2023","Oct 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60531420-the-sunlit-man

The first two are to be read after Starsight, and the third is to be read during or after Cytonic. Each predominantly follows a specific secondary character. Sunreach follows FM, a member of Spensa’s flight I’ve always found intriguing but somewhat mysterious. ReDawn follows Alanik, the alien who Spensa masqueraded as in Starsight, as se returns home. And Evershore follows Jorgen, callsign Jerkface, Spensa’s flightleader and rival-turned-romantic interest. While I enjoyed all three novellas, and appreciated what each brought to the series, Evershore was definitely my favorite. I loved the character development all three stories provided, but Jorgen’s arc was the most moving. Below are my brief thoughts on all three stories.Sunreach: I thoroughly enjoyed my time in FM’s head. I’ve always found her an interesting character, and I appreciate the way she views life. Getting to see what was happening during the climax of Starsight from the perspective of one who stayed on Detritus filled in some blanks and answered some of the questions I was left with after finishing that book. Also, the budding romance on the periphery of this story is just so sweet. And finally, the slugs are fascinating, and I loved getting to know more about them!ReDawn: This story is different in that we are getting our first nonhuman perspective in Alanik. She was a very important character in Starsight who had very little actual time on the page. Her home world is fascinating and utterly foreign, unlike any other alien planet I’ve encountered in fiction. It felt like a sci-fi Ferngully, where the trees were not only absolutely massive but floated above the core of the gas giant they call their home planet. I thought Sanderson did a great job showcasing the similarities and differences between the two peoples.Evershore: My favorite story in the collection, and the only one to be read after Cytonic. While all three novellas were important, this one felt like it was crucial. The development we see in Jorgen’s character is superb. And the cytonic awakening and grown was fascinating. I loved getting to learn more about the kitsen culture, and to see three planets’ worth of different races banding together against the powers that have plagued their peoples for so long. There was a wonderful emphasis on dealing with grief here that I found very poignant. All in all, a very strong novella that made me ever more excited to read the conclusion of the series....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 31, 2023","Dec 08, 2023","Oct 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59471329-skyward-flight

Bennett’s Divine Cities trilogy is my favorite completed trilogy of all time, and The Troupe is one of my favorite standalones. I still need to read more of his backlist, including the last two books in the Founders series and American Elsewhere, but I have really enjoyed everything I’ve read from him. Mix my trust in him as an author with the idea of Sherlock and Watson in a dark fantasy world and I am sold!Our story opens with Dinios Kol, our perspective character and riff on John Watson, inspecting the scene of a suspicious, and incredibly disturbing, death. He is an engraver, someone augmented and supplemented to remember every syllable of conversation, every inch of a crime scene. Which is incredibly handy for Anagosa Dolabra, the semi-homebound Inspector to whom he is apprenticed. Ana is just as much Sherlock as Din is Watson. Early on in the story, the similarities were so strong that they felt almost like caricatures. Especially Ana. She was almost laughably a genderbent Holmes, complete with Sherlock’s same brand of barely contained mania. She even plays a stringed instrument on occasion and deeply desired psychedelics as a method for warding off boredom. However, as the story progressed both characters became more nuanced, more interesting in and of themselves. The murder Din engraves and shares with Ana is but the tip of the iceberg of a larger conspiracy, one that brings them to the fraught, dangerous edges of the Empire. Here they are in close proximity to the sea wall, the only thing keeping invading titans from making landfall and wreaking havoc. When the wall is breached, Din and Ana must solve their multilayered, twisted mystery before there’s no city left to protect. Unfortunately, Din and Ana are Iudex, which is essentially Internal Affairs for the Empire’s military. This means that they aren’t popular, to say the least, and that everyone seems intent on hiding things from them, even when doing so places the entire Empire in greater danger.I found this entire world fascinating. From the beginning, we are introduced to fascinating, magical, somewhat macabre flora that the people of this world utilize in all kinds of interesting ways. The ‘science’ of engraving is incredibly interesting, as are the other Sublime arts. Sublimes accept radical augmentations to their bodies. These augmentations give them some insane abilities, but always at a cost. There are cracklers, soldiers and workers who are incredibly strong, to the point that even their skeletons have to be augmented to bear the weight, resulting in a crackling sound to their movements. Engravers tend to go slightly mad from all of the information their brains are required to hold. There are those who have incredibly acute senses of smell, or touch. And all of these augmentations come from the blood of the very titans that so threaten the land.As mentioned above, both Din and Ana grew as characters throughout the story. I came to especially like Din, who surprised me multiple times both with his engraving and his ability to put things together in ways most engravers could not. He had a strong sense of morality, but also knew when it was necessary to bend or break some rules. And right around the halfway mark of the book, there is a fight scene featuring Din that I thought was exceptional. Ana had to juggle so much information. She always had a reason for keeping things close to the chest that I actually found believable. I wouldn’t say that I came to like her, but it was a near thing. She was never boring. There was one other side character that I very much enjoyed: Miljin. He was very much his own person, but reminded me of characters like Logen Ninefingers.All in all, this was a pretty compelling story. The world was always fascinating, and the mystery element was well balanced and well paced. The characters were compelling and grew as their story progressed. I like that Bennett tied the story up neatly while still leaving himself plenty of room to create further installments. It took me a little while to get into this book, but I came to enjoy it. I’ll definitely be reading whatever Bennett publishes next in the series....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jan 05, 2024","Jan 15, 2024","Oct 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/150247395-the-tainted-cup

From the first page, Lestat was more charming and intelligent and moral and interesting than he ever came across in the first book. Which makes me wonder how much of my distaste for him came from Louis being an unreliable narrator with a grudge, and how much Lestat changed over the course of his long rest. And how trustworthy is Lestat himself as a narrator? It’s fascinating that the least sympathetic character in Interview with the Vampire is so vibrant and multifaceted when seen through his own eyes and words. It’s also fascinating that the most compelling and sympathetic character in that first book is so horrifying and eventually so cold in this one. Even Louis seemed more interesting in this book than in his own. The difference between these characters depending on who was narrating is probably the most intriguing aspect of the series so far, in my opinion, and that makes me so much more interested in continuing. Who’s telling the truth? Is anyone? I don’t know who to trust, and for this particular series I think that was absolutely the right decision.“There’s something vampiric about rock music.”I love the way Lestat viewed the 80s. He sees an innocence to the rebellious spirit that so permeates the decade. There’s a joy to the chaos of it that speaks to his soul. And the idea of a vampire fronting a rock band makes so much sense to me. Getting his back story in his own words was a revelation, but I really loved how he connected with the “present” upon awaking. The lore he discovers about his own kind is also incredibly compelling, and I’m very curious to see how that knowledge plays itself out in further installments.Speaking of further installments, I’m pretty glad that I have the third book on hand, because The Vampire Lestat ended on a bit of a cliffhanger. I had no intention of immediately diving into the next book, but I don’t think I have much choice. I really want to know what happens next. Which surprises me, because I thought the first book was fine, and this second book, while very good in places, got boggy in the middle. But I can now absolutely see why this series is so beloved by so many. The characters are fascinating, and I want to know everything there is to know about them. I want to read about those who were even briefly mentioned.

Our framework revolves around a man delivering a strange box to the town of GGoblin is collection of six novellas held together by a framework story. Our framework revolves around a man delivering a strange box to the town of Goblin right at midnight. Each of the novellas takes place in the odd town, and has in common an obsession that leads to madness. The town of Goblin itself is fascinating, and I would love to know more. What’s up with the unceasing rain? Is there something magic in the water? And what exactly are the Goblin police, and why are they so utterly terrifying? Do we get answers? Not really. But even the questions are fun.Now, onto the novellas. They were a bit of a mixed bag, but each had something interesting to offer.A Man in Slices: This was a weird one. A disturbed man is asked to prove his love to his girlfriend by sending her pieces of himself. We get the story from the perspective of the man’s one and only friend since childhood, and we see the honor in and danger of befriending the dangerous. This was one of my least favorites in the book. It wasn’t bad, per se, or boring. Something about it just didn’t really work for me.Kamp: Our titular character, Walter Kamp, is afraid of everything. More specifically, he’s afraid of being scared to death. In an attempt to prevent anything from catching him off-guard, he has completely upended his life, quitting his job as a beloved history teacher and “renovating” his apartment, removing anything that could provide a hiding place for a ghost. There are no walls left, even around the bathroom. His bed is plexiglass. But even though he’s completely unhinged in this regard, his also charming and sweet and a great storyteller. His was an odd tale, but a tense one in its own way.Happy Birthday, Hunter!: Neal Nash, our aforementioned birthday boy, is a famed big-game hunter whose wife Barbara throws his an incredibly extravagant 60th birthday party. And yet, while Neal is lavished in gifts and attention, he can’t stop thinking about one thing, a bird no one has ever bagged: the Great Owl of the forbidden North Woods, right next to Goblin itself. His obsession is lethal. I was reminded of one of my favorite short stories, “The Most Dangerous Game,” but the ending of Malerman’s story bothered me. It rang true for the character, but I was bothered.Presto: Roman Emperor is the greatest magician in the world to young Peter’s mind. So when he announces a midnight magic show in Peter’s hometown of Goblin, he’s thrilled. But Roman has a dark secret: his magic is no trick. I really enjoyed learning about Roman’s history, and how his show came to be. Again, obsession is at the core of this story. However, that obsession really worked here. I was fascinated.A Mix-Up at the Zoo: Dirk is a tour guide, both at the Goblin Zoo and at the local slaughterhouse. There’s something about him that draws people in as much as the animals he discusses with the on the zoo tours. This something is captivating but dark, and seems to give him an odd kinship with the caged animals. Not all cages have bars, it seems. And when Dirk starts falling deeper into this darkness, the lines delineating each portion of his life begin to blur. This story was sad and deep and one of my favorites in the collection.The Hedges: Wayne Sherman is Goblin’s artist in residence. He created the imposing topiaries that greet you when you enter the town, as well as countless others for citizens rich and poor. But his most famous work, the work serves as the town’s largest tourist attraction, is the Hedges, a seemingly unsolvable labyrinth. Wayne thought the secret he hid in the middle would always be safe, but the impossible has happened: someone just solved the Hedges. The someone is a little girl bent on telling his secret to the oft-mentioned and incredibly disturbing Goblin Police. This story was incredibly tense, and yet it was also the loveliest. Wayne’s memories of his wife were beautiful, and I loved the pace at which their history was revealed. “The Hedges” also contained some of the most gorgeous wedding vows ever. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.While I said this was a mixed bag, and it was, it was also a very even collection. Even the stories that weren’t my favorites still had merit, and were fairly interesting reads. Even the stories I really liked, I never quite loved. This is a solid 4-star read, I think. I’ve seen some fairly negative s, but I think one reason this worked as well as it did for me is because it was my introduction to Malerman. I really like his writing style, so I can see myself going back and reading Bird Box and Malorie eventually. If they’re as much better than Goblin as so many other ers claim, I think I have a lot to look forward to....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 28, 2023","Nov 04, 2023","Oct 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54610996-goblin

I was pretty excited when Hazelwood announced her first foray into paranormal romance. And somewhat hesitant. While I thoroughly enjoyed The Love Hypothesis, I haven’t been able to get into any of her work since. I was hopeful that a shift in genre would change things, and I was absolutely correct. Bride had me in its thrall from the very first page. I couldn’t put it down.Misery Lark is being used from political gain. Again. As a child, she was made the Vampyre Collateral to the Humans, growing up among a people who hated and feared her kind. Her presence guaranteed her people’s good behavior for the entirety of her childhood. She thought the had aged out, and has been passing for Human in their land because she’s no longer accepted by Vampyres, either. But she is being used for leverage once again, this time being given as a Vampyre bride to the Alpha of the Weres in pursuit of peace between their peoples. Misery seems to be living up to her name.I really enjoyed the interplay between Misery and Lowe Moreland, her Alpha husband. It took a good while for them to share much space together on the page, but I actually appreciated the slow burn of that. Especially since there was never really a dull moment in terms of plot. But the chemistry between the two leads whenever they were together was through the roof. Often awkward, but through the roof. That would have been enough to keep me reading, but it was the world that had me so invested. Hazelwood created a pretty fascinating set of societies. I was actually reminded of Anne Bishop’s The Others the tiniest bit. In set up, not in tone. I liked that the Vampyres and Weres are born, not created. It’s genetics that sets the three races in this world apart, and that made for a much more interesting story, in my opinion.I also just really love Hazelwood’s writing style. There’s something easy and addictive about it. And yet, the easy tone in no way meant a sacrifice in depth when it came to her characters. Some writers can tell you all of the secret hopes and fears of their characters in a way that still comes across as shallow somehow. Hazelwood takes the opposite approach. We glean these depths from watching the characters. She does a fantastic job of showing, not just telling. There was plenty of tension here, both in terms of plot and romance. The romantic tension was through the roof. The aforementioned chemistry mixed with the slow burn of said romance made each scene the two shared rife with tension. And while the sex scenes might’ve been a bit messy, they were undeniably hot. As a side note there, this is the first time I’ve read knotting in a mainstream book. So consider yourself warned if that’s not your thing. I’ve not encountered that outside of fan fiction, really, so it was a surprise, to say the least.Is this a modern masterpiece? No. It’s not going to revolutionize the genre or anything like that. But I enjoyed my time with it immensely. Sometimes a book isn’t trying to be brilliant; it’s just shooting for fun. And this book is the most fun I’ve had reading in a long time. If I could erase yesterday and reread this again for the first time, I would, just for the sheer joy of the experience. I preordered a physical copy for when it releases in February, because I can see this becoming a comfort reread.

Brimming with melodrama. This is the vampire story that has informed all others for nearly 50 years now. I picked up Interview with the Vampire mostly because it’s the most famous book I can think of both set in and written in my home state of Louisiana. It’s one of those books I feel like I should have read by now. There were things I really liked about this, and I can see why it has accrued and maintained such popularity. The writing was lovely, and I can see why it has so often been labeled erotic. There’s something lush and sensual about Rice’s prose. I also, of course, loved the setting. Rice captured New Orleans beautifully. Topics like love and sexuality and immortality are all broached with great aplomb. All of the major characters, from Louis to Lestat to Claudia to Armand, are terribly tragic in some way, and I found them all compelling, though deeply flawed in various ways. I also really liked the framework of Louis sharing his story with a reporter in the somewhat modern day. It’s hard to imagine that what began as a short story became an enduring series spanning over a dozen full-length novels and various spin-offs, but that’s exactly the history behind Interview with the Vampire. However, there were also things that very much did not work for me. Let’s start with the characters. I found Lestat distasteful, and am completely baffled by the fact that the majority of this series is dedicated to him. I intend to read further someday simply to find out why, and to see if I can tolerate him better in further works. Louis is kind of a terrible vampire for most of the story. He’s morose and self-pitying and I had little use for him, which is unfortunate as he’s the narrator of the tale. The entire idea behind Claudia is deeply distressing, especially the sexuality subtly attached to her later in the story. All in all, I found the most appealing vampire to be Armand, and I’m pretty sure that’s because I didn’t spend as much time with him.I also really struggled with the slow pace of this book. It completely makes sense for the story being told, but I had a hard time maintaining my interest through the middle of the novel. I’m almost positive that serves the story, as it demonstrates the ennui Louis suffers as a vampire, but it came dangerously close to crossing the line from meandering to plodding. One thing I have to give Interview with the Vampire is its staying power. This book and the series that follows has had a huge impact on popular culture. Every single other vampire story that has made any kind of splash has been informed in some way by Rice’s work. It’s foundational to the genre. I can’t say that I enjoyed every minute I spent with this book, but I did find it educational, and I very much appreciated it.

A protagonist who adores some of the same books and music that have shaped me as a person? A supernatural plot line that allows for a deep dive into Native culture while also serving as a metaphor for facing and overcoming trauma? Yes please. And I meshed with the writing immediately, so I’m happy to report that it was exactly what I hoped it would be.Kari is an urban Indian who is obsessed with Stephen King books and heavy metal. Especially The Shining and Megadeath, respectively. She’s very cool, and yet her life seems very small and empty when we first meet her. She thirty-five with no major relationships outside of her cousin who also functions as a best friend and her father who barely functions at all. She doesn’t have a true career, instead holding down a couple of odd jobs waitressing and bartending. She goes to the occasional metal show, reads and rereads horror novels, and that’s about it. Until a family heirloom is given to her, one with ties to the mother who left when Kari was only two days old. Kari has always hated her mom for leaving, but she suddenly has to reevaluate those feelings when she finds that the heirloom bracelet is haunted by the seemingly murdered ghost of its last owner: Kari’s mother. Now Kari is on the hunt for answers regarding her mother’s disappearance in hopes of not being haunted for the rest of her life.So much of this story is about breaking the cycle of generational trauma, about dragging skeletons out of the closet and into the light. And I love that. I wish the supernatural elements had felt a little less metaphorical in nature by the end of the story, but that’s personal preference. I also found the interplay between Kari, her cousin Debby, and Debby’s awful husband completely obnoxious. It really grated on me, and I was always impatient to get back to what I considered the actual plot. Debby made me roll my eyes way more often than I care to admit. But the rest of the story made up for it.White Horse did not disappoint. It’s a story about healing and embracing who you are, and yet the story never suffered at the hands of the message.

Sequels are so hard to , especially when even the barest of details could potentially spoil the predecessor for those who have not read it. In light of that, this  is going to be fairly vague. But if you want to know absolutely nothing, you might want to skip this one.In Starsight, Sanderson is showing us the universe outside of Detritus. And it is a far more expansive and varied place that I anticipated. We meet a plethora of alien races, and I found every single one of them fascinating. The imagination Sanderson possesses baffles me in its sheer expanse, and I feel very fortunate to live in a time and place where I get to reap the benefits of those imaginings. We see so much growth in Spensa as she explores a new setting. She has matured tremendously and is really coming into her own by this point. I was really impressed with the mental and emotional growth, especially. We meet new characters who are incredibly interesting, though I did miss some of the original cast at times. I love that Sanderson always includes deep, important questions and topics in his stories. Here, there is a lot of discussion of prejudice and how the misunderstandings of generations past can continue to fester and divide long after the original disagreement is forgotten. We see grudges clung to and forgiveness offered. We see how radically different groups of people can come together, while there can be an alarming amount of infighting between those who should be the most similar. One of my favorite things about Sanderson’s work is that I know I can trust him. I know that, in a multipart series, each book will have a fairly satisfying ending while also leaving me excited for the next installment. He balances that line between cliffhanger and resolution beautifully. I also know that I can trust him morally. I can find comfort and enjoyment in his work because I know that, no matter how bleak things might look in the moment, good is going to win out in any story he pens. While there is some truly fantastic grimdark out there that I have come to love, my heart will always be with authors who give me this kind of moral and emotional solace. Even when I know that the victory is going to be hard won, the knowledge that good will triumph someway, somehow, is always appreciated.While I think I will always prefer fantasy to sci-fi, I’ve been very much enjoying Sanderson’s foray into space.

Hatchet is one of my favorite books ever. I love a good survival story, and that one captured my imagination as a child and has never let it go. But what Trisha McFarland goes through makes Brian Robeson’s experience sound like a picnic. Nine year old Trisha’s mom decides to take her and her brother on a hike down the Appalachian trail. When her brother and mom can’t stop arguing long enough to hear anything Trisha has to say, including the fact that she has to pee, she falls behind on the trail. Her journey from there is fraught with peril and King’s signature brand of uncanny. While Trisha is doing her power to stay alive, something is stalking her, letting her fear ripen. But Trisha finds hope in herself and in Tom Gordon, her favorite baseball player. She adores him, and finds him walking alongside her on her path toward survival.This is a short little book, but it’s a very tense story. Trisha goes through some truly horrific things, but she’s incredibly resilient. The way she copes with everything that happens to her while never giving up, no matter how terrible things look, is inspiring. She’s quite the kid, and I think King wrote her well. She even made me care about baseball, which I’m pretty sure has never happened in my entire life.There were some lines and scenes that didn’t age well, but that’s pretty standard for a King book. The creeping terror of the uncanny lurking in the background was also very true to form. Overall, I think this is a pretty solid work from King.

I’ve read sWhat Moves the Dead is both a direct retelling and an expansion of one of Poe’s most famous short stories, The Fall of the House of Usher. I’ve read so many “retellings” in recent years that are really just inspired by a work, not an actual retelling of that story. I was so pleased to find this is an actual retelling. I’ve always been fascinated by Poe’s work. He’s the grandfather of the macabre in my opinion, and The Fall of the House of Usher is one of his more disturbing works. However, I always wished for a bit more from it, for most explanation behind what is going on in that house. Kingfisher had the same response to the story, and she addressed it by expanding the story herself. And she did so very well.I loved getting some actual explanation as to what is going on with the Usher siblings and why the house and surrounding land is so…wrong. Kingfisher’s imagined reasons were just the right balance of plausible and peculiar. I won’t get into what those reasons were, so as not to spoil this novella, but I will say that this little book house some of the creepiest fungi and most disturbing hares I’ve ever come across. If you loved Mexican Gothic, you should definitely give this book a try. Kingfisher stayed very true to Poe’s original story. And any changes or additions she made stayed true, for the most part. There were some new characters introduced, and our nameless narrator is given a name and identity and background here. However, I have to confess that the addition of extra pronouns that don’t exist really threw me out of the story. They were alien and difficult to keep straight in my mind, especially regarding the tenses of each. It also felt like an odd touch of modernity in a classic story, but that’s simply my subjective opinion.I very much enjoyed What Moves the Dead, both for it’s approach to retelling a classic tale and for its deeply disturbing, Gothic atmosphere and tone.

Not only is the man a brilliant artist, he has a deft hand and quick wit when it comes to storytelling. Krampus was the first book I had ever read by him, and it was one of my top reads of 2021. This book didn’t hit me quite as hard, but it did prove to me that Krampus was definitely not a one-off. Slewfoot is an exploration of control through religion, the subjugation of women under the patriarchy, the dangers of suppression when mingled with superstition, and the near mystical ability of nature to heal herself from wounds inflicted by man. And on top of all that, it’s just a fun, if brutal, story.“Angels must often do dark deeds in the name of the Lord.”Our story takes places in Connecticut in 1666, in a small Puritanical colony. Abitha and her husband are trying to earn the rights to their land when Edward’s brother and landlord, Wallace, sells the land out from under them. After being forced to honor his deal with his brother instead by the ministers of the colony, Wallace is thrilled when tragedy strikes and Abitha is left a widow. But Abitha refuses to give up the land without a fight, instead pledging to pay off the debt and secure the land herself, in her husband’s name. Wallace is dead set against this, and will do anything to see Abitha fail. But Abitha isn’t as alone or unsupported as she appears.“It seemed at times as though they took great joy in others’ failings, as it made them appear the better, the more pious, more likely to be included when the great rapture finally came and God gathered his flock to him.”One of the things I love most about Brom is his balance. His stories are by turn beautiful and brutal, charming and grotesque. Nature is benevolent and malicious in equal measures, and those who call the wilds their home are innocent while also being fiercely bloodthirsty when such is called for. He also brilliantly presents the dichotomy between organized religion and more nature-based, traditional folklore and belief systems. I found this fascinating in Krampus, and equally as fascinating in Slewfoot. The wild magic he wrote into this book was lovely and terrifying. Yet another dichotomy that I really appreciated. “That is not what you want, that is what you need. You are not made out of needs, you are made out of your dreams and desires.”Brom also did a wonderful job with his characters. There were some, like Wallace, who were completely and utterly despicable. There were other townsfolk, like Reverend Carter and the sheriff, who were more layered. The wildfolk were suitably creepy and impish and childlike, and I was fascinated by Brom’s artistic renderings of them. Then there were Abitha and Samson. These characters were incredibly multifaceted. I ached watching them struggle, and I loved watching their relationship change over the course of the novel.“It’s not that complicated… Just do your best to treat others as you wish to be treated. What more needs to be said? … Puritans tended to make most moral matters as complicated as possible.”I love Jesus, but I would never have survived in Puritanical New England. I would have been labeled a witch before I hit my twenties. We might have our share of issues in the current age, but I’m fervently thankful for the freedoms I have as a woman, that would not have been available to me in any past era. This is almost always my takeaway from historical fiction, and Slewfoot was no exception. This was definitely a “down with the patriarchy, down with the establishment” kind of book. Which could have felt awkward in the hands of some male authors, but Brom wrote a wonderfully multifaceted female main character in Abitha. There’s a saying I heard recently: “I support women’s rights, but more importantly, I support women’s wrongs.” That’s a perfect description of this book. “It is time to be magnificent.”The horror elements in this were so well done. There was no doubt that this was truly a horror novel, complete with some horrific gore, but it wasn’t too gory to stomach.

I honestly disliked the series when I first tried it, but I loved Gaiman enough to keep reading. If you would have told me that I would keep coming back to it, I would have been skeptical, to say the least. But there’s something about this story that just grips me, that captured my imagination and still hasn’t let it go. I’ve consumed this through the physical comics, through the audiobook, and through the Netflix series. But this read through I combined the physical with the Audible Original audio production, and it was by far the most immersive reading experience of my life. Some of the issues that make up this book are absolutely brutal. Some are lovely and elegant. And sometimes the two are immediately back-to-back. 24 Hours remains one of the most horrific things I’ve ever read, and The Sound of Her Wings is one of the most beautiful and inspiring. I love the presentation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and am utterly appalled at the thought Calliope’s story. Listening to the full-cast audio, complete with sound effects, while reading along in the physical, sucked me into the story in a way I’ve never encountered before. I love tandem reading the audio and physical versions of a book at the same time, but I’ve never had the opportunity to do so with a graphic novel. The addition of art into the fray just took the entire reading experience to another level. I can’t say this is a 5 star read for. me. While I love it in part, I will always have some issues with it.

I think the cover art of this book is absolutely gorgeous, and just the right amount of off. Happily, the story it contained was much the same. I immediately fell in love with the writing. There’s a lushness to both prose and description that I found captivating. For instance, the description of Grey Hollow’s wardrobe creations painted brilliant pictures in my mind in ways that appealed to all of my senses. And yet, mixed into that beauty was a serious sense of wrongness, of something grotesque squirming beneath the surface. Which is exactly what a gothic horror novel should be. House of Hollow is a terrific example of gothic horror done right.“We loved each other with potent, fervent fury. Animal fury. Monstrous fury.My sisters. My blood. My skin. What a gruesome bond we shared.”What draws me to gothic horror time and again is an appreciation for the atmosphere of that type of tale well told. The best way I can describe that atmosphere, that tone, is as a decayed decadence, lush beauty that is rotten at the core. The Thirteenth Tale and The Last Tale of the Flower Bride are both exemplary examples of this in adult fiction, and House of Hollow is equally brilliant in the young adult realm. All three stories deliver a beauty that makes you ache, as well as a tense darkness beneath it that makes you feel ever so slightly sick to read it. That balance is what I appreciate the most about gothic horror.Is this a perfect book? No. There is some story here, and it’s pretty fast-paced. But by and large, this is a tale that leans heavily on vibes to carry the reader through to the end. I have no problem with books that are all vibe, little plot, as my love for The Night Circus can attest. However, I know that’s a balance that some readers really struggle with. I will say that, because of the fast pace and the tidy page count, I think even those who require a lot of plot to get through a story could enjoy House of Hollow. But I was here for the vibes, and I enjoyed ever second of them. The relationship between the three sisters was both lovely and incredibly toxic. It was fascinating, and awful, and difficult to look away from. Like a car crash. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with House of Hollow, which surprised me a bit as I have a love/hate relationship with YA as a whole. I will definitely be seeking out more YA horror, because I loved how fast this moved and how completely engrossed I was. I can’t remember the last time I read a nearly 300 page book in 24 hours.

The story is told from three alternating perspectives: Mortimer, the displaced library cat; Evan, a 5th grader looking to solve a mystery; and Al, about whom little can be said without giving away some major (if fairly predictable) plot twists. Our story begins with the creation of a Little Free Library and is a love letter to books and the bonds they forge between readers. More specifically, this is an ode to the importance of libraries, and it is lovingly rendered. I’m a big fan of middle grade novels, especially those that embrace a love of bookishness. This particular book skewed more on the younger end of middle grade, and thus I would recommend it more to 4th and 5th graders than I would to those nearing their teens. It came across as a bit simplistic, and I wish there had been a deeper dive into the meat of the story.

And I’ve actually been a fan of the series since I was 16, over half of my lifetime ago. These books have been a bond between my mother and my grandmother and I for years. We all adore Nora Roberts and everything she writes, including this lone series that she publishes under a pen name. As of this book, we are now 57 novels in, and I’m still not tired of Eve and Roarke and Peabody and the rest. They are a family unto themselves now, and they are so well drawn that they feel like members of my own family, as well. This series is so special to me, and I can’t see myself ever forming this kind of emotional attachment to another long, episodic series. In this particular installment, Eve is investigating the death of a retired cop, one who made a lot of enemies while captain of Internal Affairs. As he toed a hard line but was truly above reproach in his work, Eve finds herself facing down her own prejudice against the office, and seeing why Internal Affairs is so vital. While the case was an interesting one, with lots of facets, it wasn’t the true star of the show. As with every single installment in this series, the real star is the relationships Eve has developed and the family she was reluctantly built for herself and Roarke. Their romance remains solid and lovely and real. Their found family is packed with variety and charm and personality, and no end of love for one another. These are the reasons I return to this series eagerly every time a new installment is published. The crimes are always interesting and well paced. But the characters are what make the In Death series so special.I thoroughly enjoyed Payback in Death. The pacing was great, the case was compelling, and the characters were, as always, absolutely superb. I can’t believe this is the 57th installment in this series! And I can’t wait to read however many more of them Nora decides to write.(A big thank you to St. Martin’s Press for the complimentary physical copy of this book. The gift in no way impacted my views on the novel, but it did very much matter. When I started ing books in 2016, one of my lofty ambitions was to open my mailbox one day and find a Nora Roberts book waiting for me, courtesy of the publisher. While it arrived under Nora’s pen name instead, it was still just as emotional a moment as I could have anticipated. Receiving a book from one of my favorite authors was truly a dream come true.

Iron Gold and Dark Age were very good, but they were missing the spark that made the originals so special. Light Bringer recaptured that spark. While there is still an appalling amount of bloodshed and loss and betrayal, there is also growth and joy and hope. And that razor thin balance is what makes this series so special. There are incredibly high stakes, and the world is so dark, but the bright spots make the fight worth it.Light Bringer picks up shortly after the events of Dark Age, with much the same cast. There have been some significant losses, so I won’t mention any particular characters. What I will say, however, is that the characters have something here that they haven’t really had in the last two books: growth. There is significant character development and maturation here, and that made all the difference in my attachment to the story. Finally, I felt that I had someone to root for. More than one someone, in fact. This new maturity radically changed my investment in the story for the better. It made everything, from bitter battles to joyful reunions, feel worth it. The bitter was learned from, and the joy was earned.Red Rising is one of the tensest series I’ve ever read. There is always something terrible brewing. And yet it hasn’t gotten tedious or repetitive, which is proof of Brown’s superb storytelling. I’m still emotional over these characters, and somehow still shocked by twists and betrayals, even if I saw the signs. I am so attached to this world and its people, even as I see the multitude of problems wracking both.Six books into a series where the author has no problem killing off major players, there’s not much I can say about the actual story here. So, instead, I’ll just say that I’m thrilled to have loved reading this so much.

I found the plotlines for each of the stories Faraway and Forever is a collection of five science fiction novellas penned from a Christian worldview. I found the plotlines for each of the stories interesting to varying degrees. Of the five, “Half the Sky” and “The Wishbringer” were definitely the standouts, with “The Wishbringer” being the most original in the collection. “The Wishbringer” follows a journalist as he finds his way into another dimension, one populated by a lone farmer who plants the wishes of the people of earth and tends them until the Good Lord decides they’re ready to be harvested and returned to their wishers. It was a sweet and thought-provoking story that I can foresee myself thinking about for weeks to come.While I enjoyed these stories, I did have a couple of issues with the writing. Specifically, with the dialogue. While there were no grammatical mistakes or editing gaffes that I noticed, the dialogue between characters felt stiff to me. It was missing the ease and spark that make a conversation convincing. I went into this book hoping for something like Ted Chiang’s Stories of Your Life and Others, or The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell. While the ideas were there, the effortless depth and poetic beauty of prose shared by those authors wasn’t present here. I also have some qualms about the worldview and theology behind these stories. I recognize that I tend to judge any work billed as “Christian” more harshly in this respect than I do works written from literally any other worldview. If someone is presenting their work as Christian, I think it’s important that the theology they present through their work align with the teachings of Jesus. This collection felt shaky in that respect, a bit too New Age and progressive for my traditional understanding of my faith. But that is a very subjective view.Faraway and Forever gave me a lot to think about, and that’s my favorite thing about this type of science fiction. The science here was interesting and well presented, but wasn’t so erudite that I couldn’t follow where it was leading. The stories themselves were varied and thought-provoking and compelling from start to finish. Despite my qualms over its theology and my nitpicking of the conversational writing, I enjoyed my time with this book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 12, 2023","Aug 16, 2023","Aug 12, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/121320247-faraway-and-forever

I didn’t meet Anne Shirley until I was in my twenties, but we are became fast friends immediately. And I have visited her so often since that I have no qualms about claiming her as a kindred spirit. After reading Rachel Dodge’s The Secret Garden Devotional alongside Hodgson’s classic novel, I suspected that she might also be a kindred spirit. After reading The Anne of Green Gables Devotional alongside Montgomery’s masterpiece, I have no doubt of it. Both of the aforementioned devotionals added delight and insight and thoughtfulness to stories that I already loved, and Dodge accomplished this by relating both to the Greatest Story Ever Told. I enjoyed every single page of this little book, and it deepened the love I already had for Anne Shirley.In addition to the devotional matching up with each chapter of Anne of Green Gables, there is also a prayer, personal application, and scripture for each day. Scattered throughout are darling little illustrations, highlighting some of the standout moments of the story. Finally, Dodge included a fun little appendix at the end with Anne’s thoughts on various topics and themes. It’s an utterly charming little book, as is the one Dodge penned to accompany The Secret Garden. After loving both of these so much, I ordered the last in the series (so far), The Little Women Devotional, and I have high hopes that it will actually improve my relationship with that particular classic. I hope Dodge pens more of these in the future, because they are treasures that I fully intend to revisit often.A couple of side notes. First, there are audio versions of both this book and The Secret Garden Devotional that also include the book that inspired each in the same audiobook, with a chapter of the devotion following a chapter of the novel. These were both beautifully done, and I highly recommend them if you are more of an audiobook reader. Second, I experienced both of these devotional journeys with my mom, and that made the experience even more special.

The prose is lovely. There’s just the right amount of humor. The plot is mysterious and tense and playful in equal measures. The characters were unique and well fleshed out, with a lot of interesting interactions between them. And the romance was soft and subtle and slow, but still incredibly powerful.If you’re already a fan of the Cosmere, there are so many little references to catch.

Psyche and Eros couldn’t be more different in tone and telling, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed this iteration, as well. McNamara made some interesting choices in terms of setting and character inclusion that baffled me a bit, but her style was easy and engaging and a lot of fun to read.This is one of my favorite Greek myths, as it’s one of the few where the female is the hero in her own tale and wins her own happy ending. She fights for it, and hard, but she does see victory in the end. I thought that McNamara presented it very well. The romance was fun and sweet with just the right amount of tension for the story to really work. Psyche is a strong character, and even though she is not generally a warrior in classic tellings of the tale, I thought her ferocity balanced well with her kindness, and both worked beautifully for the story. Eros was presented as more likable and fleshed-out that is typical, which I appreciated, as well. And I love how thoroughly the author embraced the magic of the time and place.The things that threw me were largely the timeline and family ties. McNamara decided to have this tale take place at the same time as the prelude to and beginning of the Trojan War, which made the story feel a bit too jam-packed with important characters. Agamemnon and Menelaus were given a third brother, who became Psyche’s father, and all three were the sons of Perseus in this tale instead of Atreus. Penelope was Helen’s sister instead of cousin, and Clytemnestra became merely the surly sister-in-law. It was weird for me, and took me out of the story a bit. McNamara explains her decision in the afterword, but I think this book would work best if you could divorce yourself from what you know of Greek myth and enter the story as a clean slate, so to speak.The writing of this book was excellent, but in a far different way than Circe or Clytemnestra or weightier books in the Greek myth retelling world. Psyche and Eros is an incredibly fast, easy read, one that felt young adult or new adult, but in the best of ways. It was all about the story, not about the prose or the philosophy or the emotion. It was a compelling story very well told, and that was all it needed to be.I very much enjoyed this book, even though some of the writing decisions tossed me out of the story for a while. I highly recommend it, especially if you’re less familiar with Greek mythology, or if you’re looking for a fun, fast read. I’ll definitely be reading more of McNamara’s work! ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 24, 2023","Jul 25, 2023","Jul 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62292422-psyche-and-eros

He has a way of telling stories that are focussed almost entirely on one individual and yet feel weighty, as important issues are seen and experienced through these characters. David Copperfield is a prime example of this. Since seeing Demon Copperhead touted as a modern, American retelling of that story, I’ve been both excited to dig in and nervous that it would fall short. Fall short it absolutely did not. This was my first Kingsolver, but it definitely won’t be my last. Her writing is powerful and passionate, and the voice of Demon is one that I’ll remember for years to come.Demon Copperhead takes place in the southern Appalachian region of the U.S., and focuses on our title character, born Damon but called Demon by everyone who knows him. His life starts off hard, born to an alcoholic teenage mom in a rundown trailer, but it just get worse from there. This book showcases the failings of the foster system, the lasting harm of the mining industry on poor rural parts of the country, the beginnings of the opioid crisis and meth epidemic, as well as other important issues facing this part of the world. And yet, even with all of those heavy topics in play, this is very much the story of Demon. We see these other elements through his eyes and his interactions with them. I was very impressed by Kingsolver’s ability to retell David Copperfield in all the salient plot points while still making sure that Demon’s story was wholly his own. There was so much dimension to his character. If you’ve read David Copperfield, the parallels are incredibly satisfying. But if you haven’t, Demon Copperhead stands strong in its own, and you won’t feel as if you’re missing anything. The writing, the setting, the voice, and the character development were all stellar.The one drawback of this book for me was the weight. While there were brief flashes of humor in conversations or Demon’s narration, this story is nearly unrelentingly dark. It was very difficult to read at times, to the point of actually inducing nausea at one point. I deeply respect this and am very glad that I read it, but I’ll have to be in a very specific mood to ever revisit Demon....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 19, 2023","Jul 31, 2023","Jul 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead

This is one of the most drastic examples of purple prose of over-writing I’ve ever encountered, and somehow I had blocked that out. There were about 5 times as many adjectives as were necessary or even prudent. There were in fact so many descriptors that whatever was being described had a tendency to get lost in the muddle. I also felt that Alec leaned too heavily on the melodrama. This is already an incredibly dramatic story, simply as it’s told in the Bible. But Alec made it feel so over the top that none of the emotions rang true. That would be a shame in any case, but is doubly so when applied to a tale with such power. As a Christian, it’s a story that I view as wholly true, so having a scent of falsehood wafting through it because the author is trying so hard to make it more is honestly a bit offensive.What’s sad is that I remember loving this book. There are scenes that have lived rent-free in my head for a decade, and which only deepened my love for the true story that inspired the narrative. I don’t know if I’m a tougher literary critic than I once was, or if I’ve become more spiritually discerning with age and experience, but this book just rubbed me the wrong way on a reread. If felt just slightly off theologically, but not enough to be anything close to sacrilegious. I still really respect this series, and treasure it for the impact it made on me when I was younger, but it’s far from perfect. I can cut the first book some slack because there’s not a ton of source material for the fall of Lucifer. But this book is all about the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. There’s plenty of source material there, so I find myself less forgiving, especially since it’s the most important story in existence. If you’d like to read fiction based around the life of Jesus, there are better books out there. But again, I appreciate the classic fantasy styling of this series, especially these first two installments....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 15, 2023","Jul 21, 2023","Jul 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5982463-messiah

Which is saying something, as there were so many excellent books published this year. But Harrow’s debut, The Ten Thousand Doors of January, is my favorite standalone novel of all time, so my expectations were sky high. Those expectations could have set me up for failure. They didn’t. While the two novels couldn’t be more different, Starling House is just as powerful and beautiful as The Ten Thousand Doors of January. It just has much sharper teeth.Opal will do anything to take care of her little brother, Jasper. Since their mom died eleven years ago, it’s been just the two of them against the world. More specifically, it’s been the two of them against their small, backwards hometown of Eden, Kentucky. Opal lied her own childhood away so that she could become Jasper’s legal guardian. The two call a ratty motel room home, and by day Opal is scraping together everything she can from her crappy job at Tractor Supply to buy Jasper a new life at a private boarding school, far from Eden and its judgmentality. By night, she dreams. She dreams of sharp claws and sharper teeth. She dreams of the childhood book that captured her imagination, Underland, and its dark fairytales. But always, she dreams of Starling House. Starling House, the big haunted mansion that rules the nightmares and imaginations of the bigoted, small-minded townspeople. Starling House, the birthplace of monsters and the last bastion of hope against them.While not dark academia, I would immediately recommend Starling House to anyone who loves Leigh Bardugo’s Ninth House and Hell Bent. If you love Alex Stern, you’re going to absolutely adore Opal. Both have bruised hearts that they protect with bleeding knuckles. Both are scrappy, fierce and braver than they believe. Both will lie while staring you right in the eye, a crooked smirk on their lips. Both will fight tooth and nail for what they need and for those they love. But Opal isn’t the only wonderful character in this book. Arthur Sterling grabbed me by the heart and didn’t let me go. His loneliness made me ache. He tried so hard to bury his kindness behind gruffness, but he never quite succeeded. Both Opal and Arthur are broken. Beautifully so. Their brokenness is what makes them so believably multifaceted, so compelling and sympathetic. Both are terrified of wanting, of chasing anything more than their most basic of needs. But oh, how they want. And then there’s the house! When we first meet Starling House, it is run down and surly, almost like a feral cat. But when it begins to feel loved and treasured for the first time in too long, it slowly begins to shine. I love near-sentient places, and Starling House is one of the best. It has so much personality. And it dreams. I was reminded of Mike Flanagan’s reimagining of The Haunting of Hill House, if Hill House had an artsy, lovechild of a younger sister. The mythos surrounding the house is fascinating, as is that surrounding the Starlings in all their wild variety and stalwart service. If Starling House started sending me dreams, I would be hard pressed not to pick up the sword of the Wardens of Starling House. This book is kind of difficult to pigeonhole into a genre. It’s Gothic in texture, if not in tone. It’s lightly horror, but the descriptions of even the horrific are so lovely that it pulls the sting from the bite. It’s a mystery, for sure, with a puzzle box of a house and more hiding outside and beneath it. There is a scene that is one of the hottest, most achingly romantic scenes I’ve ever read. It made my breath hitch on multiple levels. And yet, with as romantic as portions of this book are, I wouldn’t quite call it a romance, either. It’s weighty and entrancing and completely its own beast, and I love it for being exactly what it is.Harrow infused this story with so much depth. It’s about being who you choose to be, no matter who others say you are. It’s about not being defined by a name. It’s about what makes a home, and how four walls can’t contain it. It’s about finding the line between a want and a need, and learning to jump that division with both eyes open. It’s about standing for what you love and what you don’t, even if the world never recognizes your sacrifice. It’s about finding the courage to face your dreams after a lifetime of turning your back on them.I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Harrow’s writing. In The Ten Thousand Doors of January, her prose was achingly lovely. I called her a “Wordsmith, a sorceress wielding a pen in place of a wand.” I stand by that description, though it was expressed far differently in Starling House. The prose is still effortlessly literary without an ounce of pretension. However, Harrow’s writing in Starling House has more of an edge to it, a bite that feels more modern and hungry than her debut. In other words, she found a way to retain the magic of her prose while shifting her voice to perfectly suit the story she had to tell. Harrow is a brilliantly gifted weaver of words, and is quite possibly the most talented writer of a generation, in my opinion.(Side note: I tandem read a digital galley while listening to the audiobook, and I have to say that the audio was stellar. Natalie Naudus did a brilliant job with the narration. She portrayed both Opal and Arthur and even the supporting cast with remarkable aplomb. Listening to this while reading along was a completely immersive experience that I would highly recommend.)I adored Starling House with every fiber of my being. To me, it’s a perfect book. Full stop. No notes. I fell in love with Opal and Arthur, with the supporting cast and with the House itself. The mythos was just as captivating as the storytelling. I loved every sentence of this, and I’m already looking forward to rereading it. If ever a book deserves a place on my favorites shelf next to The Ten Thousand Doors of January, it’s this one....more",Notes are private!,2,29,1,"Sep 17, 2023","Sep 21, 2023","Jul 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65213595-starling-house

HoweverI received a copy of this novel from the publisher, Orbit Books, in exchange for an honest .Ithaca was one of my favorite books of 2022. However, I was thrown at the end of the book when I discovered that, unlike most Greek myth retellings, it was not a standalone novel but the first of a trilogy. I have been eagerly awaiting House of Odysseus since finishing those final pages of Ithaca, and am thrilled to announce that it lived up to its predecessor in every single way. This series follows the story of Penelope during the 20 year absence of her husband, King Odysseus of Ithaca. Ithaca presents this story from the perspective of Hera, Queen of Queens, as she observes what’s going on in Penelope’s life and how those happens overlap with the last days of Clytemnestra, Hera’s darling. House of Odysseus picks up where Ithaca left off, but now from the perspective of Aphrodite as her favorite, Helen, weaves her way back into Penelope’s story.Aphrodite is generally portrayed as conniving and cruel, wielding love as a weapon. In House of Odysseus, she knows that she is viewed as such, but within her mind we see that she does truly find something to love about everyone. It’s sweet and lovely and more than a little sad, as she holds so much love inside herself so as not to make others feel more uncomfortable around her than they are already. I’ve never been a fan of Aphrodite, but this book softened my heart toward her in exactly the same way Ithaca softened me toward Hera. North has a gift here, of bringing dimension and sympathy to classical characters. She also has a fabulous voice to here writing, including a knack for finding a balance between a classical feel and a slightly irreverent tone. I love her writing in this series so much. It is deft and clever and, again, impeccably balanced. It harkens back to its source material while also feeling fresh and vibrant and original. There’s a lot of depth here, and some truly inspiring speeches. There is a very compelling mystery and some serious tension to the plot and pacing. But the story never feels heavy, even though it quite easily could. The characters are compelling and multifaceted, and North did a wonderful job of making me care about them. This is also hands down one of the most feminist works I’ve ever read. I’ve loved the recent trend of taking such classic, masculine myths and examining the women of those tales, giving them voice and agency for the first time in millennia. Works like Circe and Stone Blind and Clytemnestra have done this beautifully, with power and poignancy. But the Songs of Penelope series has done this with a broader scope, showing the vitality of an entire island of women instead of a select handful or a single woman. I love that it has also included the major goddesses, Hera and Aphrodite, Athena and Artemis, giving more dimension to these deities, as well. And our titular queen, Penelope, is more than a match for her wily husband. Reading about her cleverness has been a joy.I loved everything about House of Odysseus, and will be counting down the days until the final installment is released. The Last Song of Penelope promises to be an absolutely fantastic finale, if it lives up to its two predecessors. And if it does, this will become my favorite historical trilogy of all time, and quite likely my favorite Greek myth retelling. Which is really saying something, as that’s one of my favorite subgenres. North has done something really special with this series, and I can’t wait to see how the story ends....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 06, 2023","Sep 13, 2023","Jul 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61346131-house-of-odysseus

Tordotcom has been kind enough to facilitate that tradition for the past 6 years by sending me a galley copy of each installment before its publication, usually in January. It’s always one of my most exciting pieces of book mail of the year. Some installments have been more successful (for me) than others. Unfortunately, Mislaid in Parts Half-Known is not one of those more successful installments. While not in anyway a bad book, it was missing the magic of the eighth installment, Lost in the Moment and Found. It’s the book that I expected after the seventh installment, Where the Drowned Girls Go, though it could never have have worked without learning Antsy’s story in Lost in the Moment. And yet, even though this was the book I’ve been expecting, it fell a bit flat for me. I think that, in comparison with previous books, the tale being told here had too much story packed into too small a space. We had so many threads coming together in one slim book that the plot felt muddled. We had so many important characters from the past sharing the page that all of them felt somehow lost in the shuffle. And not lost in the way that attracts Doors. They felt less real than they have in the past. Because some of these characters departed the mortal coil in prior books only to return, I won’t be discussing anyone by name except for Antsy. The sole protagonist of Lost in the Moment and Found, she is also the reluctant star of the show here. Abilities she developed in that book are the focal point of this one. Through her, we get reacquainted with Eleanor’s Home for Wayward Children, as well as getting to revisit some worlds and meet others for the very first time. As always, McGuire’s settings are one of the greatest strengths of the series. Her representation is also a huge strength but, while it there was plenty of that here, I felt like she relied too heavily on the characters’ backgrounds in previous novellas for that to come through quite as strongly as normal. If I was going to draw comparisons between this book and any of the others, I would tie it most closely to Beneath the Sugar Sky or Come Tumbling Down. Some novellas in this series stand beautifully on their own. The aforementioned do not. Mislaid in Parts Half-Known relies on every single installment that came before it. If you’ve not read the other eight, and if they’re not fairly fresh on your mind, you will be missing a lot. There were some good messages here, about how the abuse in your past does not excuse abuse done by your hand and that, while we can’t fix the injuries of our own past, we can use them to protect the present and future for others. There was the series-spanning emphasis on finding who you are and embracing it, no matter what the world has to say about it. These are positive, uplifting messages, but they were hazy beneath the muddled plot.While this wasn’t one of my favorite installments, it wasn’t a bad book. I think that the books in this series that are the strongest are those that can stand alone. When the storylines come together, the characters and messages seem less powerful instead of more. But regardless, I’m so thankful for this series, and I’m already looking forward to wherever McGuire takes it next!...more",Notes are private!,2,6,1,Jan 2024,"Jan 04, 2024","Jul 06, 2023",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/57185869-mislaid-in-parts-half-known

In this book, Yancey shines a light on our collective failures in this regard, while also highlighting some smaller scale successes in the demonstration of grace and love to the world at large. We have so much room fro improvement, but we’re not without hope. I was very moved by this book. It encouraged and convicted and challenged in fairly equal measures. And I found Yancey to be a very compelling storyteller. This is the kind of nonfiction I appreciate the most, where I feel like I’m being taught through stories instead of being preached at for close to 300 pages. Because Yancey is a journalist who has interviewed people from all over the world and from all walks of life, this felt very balanced. I didn’t feel like there was a particular political agenda, and Christianity was presented very honestly, with both warts and beauty marks on display. While I got just a tad bogged down in the middle of the book, I really appreciated the care with with Yancey presented hot-button issues like race and homosexuality and abortion, as well as the fact that he made sure that readers knew that the failings of Christians weren’t the failings of Christ.

Or in this case, the origin of sin. Specifically, the origin of the first fall, the fall which in turn led to the fall of man. Little is said about the fall of Lucifer in Scripture. Most of what we think we know of Satan comes not from the Bible, but from Milton’s Paradise Lost. Thus The Fall of Lucifer, while inspired by Scripture, understandably draws much of its inspiration from Paradise Lost. In fact, it reads a bit like if Tolkien had penned Paradise Lost in place of Milton.While there is a framework of modern archaeology supporting the story, the main narrative begins with Lucifer yet unfallen, in heaven with Michael and Gabriel. The three are presented as brothers, high princes of Yehovah, Heaven’s King of Kings. It is here where I draw the comparison to Tolkien’s work. Heaven before Lucifer falls, taking a third of the angelic hosts down with him, feels much like the elven courts of Middle Earth. There is an emphasis on beauty and elegance and physical grace that the two settings share. It’s these physical descriptions of Heaven that so enchanted me the first time I read this book, and I still find them captivating. I also love that Heaven is presented as being so scientific in its approach to creation. There are laboratories full of angels, preforming tests and experiments so that they can find how to best carry out Yehovah’s divine will. I find this fascinating, and it rings of truth to me. God is endlessly creative, but He’s also the inventor of everything that led to the birth of the various sciences. There’s no divorce between science and art. Not when it comes to God.While I adore the descriptions in this book, and the science, and the concept behind the story, I do have a few issues with it. First and foremost, there are some details that I think are slight theological fallacies when followed all the way down. For instance, I don’t believe there is age or death in Heaven, though both are kind of taken for granted in the narrative. And the presentation of Lucifer as so sympathetic could be difficult for a new Christian to understand. I thoroughly enjoy this book. I’ve read it four times, and I love the entire series. While I might have a few qualms with it, but the Chronicle of Brothers series is one that I just find myself returning to again and again. I would recommend this most to either secular readers who have a more than passing interest in Christian lore, or mature Christians who know the facts of the Bible and can separate those from the musings of man. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 16, 2023","Jun 19, 2023","Jun 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6309635-the-fall-of-lucifer

I’ve owned a copy for years, but I This is one of those books that I missed as a child, and that I’ve been meaning to read for most of my adult life. I’ve owned a copy for years, but I just never quite felt compelled to pick it up. But after finally reading Understood Betsy and absolutely adoring it, I decided that, at long last, it was time to meet Caddie. I was delighted to make her acquaintance.Caddie Woodlawn has been oft compared to the Little House on the Prairie series, and for good reason. Both are inspired by the childhoods of real women. Caddie, like Laura, is the daughter of strong pioneer parents who have built a life for themselves and their large brood far from everything they once knew. Like Laura, Caddie is a bright girl who is indulged by her father and is a bit of a tomboy, which leads to her finding her way into various scrapes that are often humorous but with some type of moralistic bend to them. There is also dialogue on the “Indian problem” of the time, but it’s in this dialogue that Caddie’s experience and Laura’s part ways. While I like the Ingles, they are, for the most part, products of their time when it comes to their views regarding people of other races as somewhat less than the white man. Not so with Caddie’s father. He is far quicker to defend and aid his Indian neighbors, not because it’s the “Christian” thing to do or because the Indians can’t do things for themselves, but because they are people, and all people matter. He recognizes that, while their way of life is different, it is no less valid. He also recognizes that they were on the land first, and sees the unfairness of white people toward those who don’t look and act and speak exactly the same as they do. And he passes those views down to Caddie. She is loyal and brave and fair, and I like her far more than Laura because of it. She takes a stand for the Indians in her area, not because she has a “white savior complex” or because it’s charitable, but because they are her friends and are deserving of loyalty.I also thought this book was better written than the Little House series. What I love about the story of the Ingles is the incredibly detailed descriptions of the mechanics of pioneer life. I love hearing about the harvesting and putting up of crops for the winter, of the intricacies of butter and cheese-making, of how cozy a tiny cabin can be when winter comes. But there is not much character development there, as so much of the narrative relies on those technical aspects. While we get a few of those kinds of details in Caddie’s story, it’s much more introspective, and the characters feel far better developed. Caddie and her brothers and their father are so well fleshed-out that they almost leap from the page, with Mrs. Woodlawn and Caddie’s sisters not all that far behind them. This makes for a much more compelling story, and one that I found myself incredibly invested in. And the writing itself had more personality than that in the Little House books.I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Caddie Woodlawn, and I can tell it’s one that I’ll revisit when I need something pure and bright and comforting. I can see why many readers prefer it to the Little House books, though I see the value in both. But if I had to choose between spending time with Laura or Caddie, I’d pick Caddie....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 12, 2023","Jun 16, 2023","Jun 12, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/205821.Caddie_Woodlawn

This book has done more for my own understanding of what I believe and why I believe it than any other book outside of the Bible itself. It’s a brilliant work of philosophy, theology, and apologetics. I’ve read this book 4 times now, and it never fails to reveal something new to me and help me to grow in some way.This essay collection, all focussed around Christianity, began as fireside radio chats Lewis gave in 1942. The way Lewis starts out with the broadest questions, those about the existence of a Creator and morality and time, and narrows his scope down to the internal changes in behavior and views a Christian undergoes as he draws closer to that Creator, feels like the most natural progression in the world. While very much a work of apologetics, nothing within this book ever comes across as preachy. Instead, Lewis presents his arguments much as lectures from teacher to student. You might disagree, but you will go away thinking.If you’re a Christian who doesn’t know exactly how to defend your own faith, who might know what you believe but questions why you believe certain things, I can’t recommend this book highly enough.

I’ve inhaled them since my mom taught me to read when I was four. If I could get my hands on it, I read it. A Little Princess, The Boxcar Children, Heidi, The Secret Garden, A Wrinkle in Time, The Chronicles of Narnia, Gulliver’s Travels, and The Swiss Family Robinson were all early favorites. And yet, a lot of others slipped through the cracks of my childhood without my having met them. There are too many wonderful stories in the world to ever hope to read them all. But I’m slowly trying to cover all the ground I can. For instance, I didn’t meet Anne Shirley of Green Gables, or Laura Ingalls from the Little House on the Prairie, until I was an adult. Yet I loved them no less for the belated introductions. I can now add Elizabeth Ann to the roster.I’ve seen the title Understood Betsy plenty of times. A copy has even resided on my bookshelf for a few years. But I can’t say the premise ever really drew me in. For some reason I decided on a whim to pick this up, and I couldn’t have been more surprised and delighted. The surface premise isn’t exactly unique; a pampered, coddled city girl finds herself forced to live with a country branch of her family for whatever reason. But the telling of the story in this case was wonderful. Something in the writing style was just pure magic, a joy to read alone and surely an even greater one to read aloud. The cadence of prose lilts and meanders beautifully The personality of the near-omniscient narrator shines through and adds an extra element of fun and charm to the story. And the love the dreaded “Putney cousins” feel for Betsy, as they call her, just blazes from the page. Life on their farm is quaint and cozy. And the way Betsy grows and blossoms over the course of her story is truly lovely. Understood Betsy is one of those rare perfect books. There’s not a single thing about it I would change, unless it was to give it a sequel, just so I could have more time with Betsy and Cousin Ann and Aunt Abigail and Uncle Henry.

I love her standalones. I love her J.D. Robb series, following murder cop Eve Dallas in the late 2050s and 2060s. But her trilogies and quartets are the stories I truly sink into the most. While I have loved her last couple of trilogies, where she was doing new and exciting things outside of her norm by going more fantasy-heavy, I was also excited to hear that she would be going back to her roots, so to speak, with her newest offering, The Lost Bride Trilogy. Firmly rooted in reality with a healthy dash of the supernatural, it’s a romance and a mystery and, if Inheritance is any indication, a compulsively rereadable story that is going to stick with readers long after they read the final pages.In Inheritance we meet Sonya right as her life comes crashing down around her ears. She comes home to find her fiancé in bed with her cousin. To make matters worse, said (now former) fiancé works in the same office as Sonya and embarks upon making her life a living hell after she refuses to see reason and forgive him for “slipping.” But when a cliché in the form of a long lost, wealthy, recently deceased uncle falls in Sonya’s lap, leaving her his (their) family home, a mansion by the sea, Sonya embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. The house is perfect. And very, very haunted. But with the support of her wonderful mother, her best friend Cleo, and the new friends she makes in her new town, Sonya is determined to make this manor her home. Most of the ghosts are happy to have her. But one will stop at nothing to drive her out.There is a very compelling mystery at the heart of the story, that of the Lost Brides of the manor. Seven brides have died in the house within the first year of their marriages, multiple on the actual day of their weddings. A bride per generation. The ghosts of brides and their killer reside in the house, alongside who knows how many others. And yet, most of these ghosts are fairly cheerful. My favorite is one who plays DJ, always playing just exactly the right song for the moment through Sonya’s phone or tablet. That addition brought me joy all the way through the book. As did the manor itself. It’s a house with a ton of character and charm and hidden depths, with just the right amount of creep factor. I could happily live in that library.The characters here are wonderful, as always. I love the chemistry between our main character and her love interest. I love the family dynamics of Sonya and her mother, as well as those of the Doyle family of lawyers who brought Sonya to her new home. I adore the friendship between Sonya and Cleo, who won me over immediately as a fellow Louisiana native. And then there are the dogs. There are three dogs in this book, and all three are wonderful. Nora has a way with dogs, and hers always seem like characters in their own right. What I didn’t love as much was the cliffhanger ending. Strangely, while the two stories have very little in common, Inheritance had almost exactly the same ending as The Awakening, book 1 of her last trilogy. It’s a striking ending, but it’s a frustrating place to wait for over a year until I can get the second installment in my hands. But other than that, there’s not a thing I would change about this book. It was absolutely fantastic, and I seriously cannot wait to find out what happens next....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 11, 2023","Sep 13, 2023","Jun 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65213377-inheritance

This is my first experience with his work and, while there were aspects of Gods of the Wyldwood is the first installment in a trilogy from RJ Barker. This is my first experience with his work and, while there were aspects of it that I struggled with, I’m sure it won’t be my last. The world of Crua is incredibly unique, utterly unlike anything else I’ve ever read. However, I think the story suffered a bit at the hands of the world building. There seemed to barely be a plot at all for the first half of the book. And while there was an immense amount of the narrative dedicated to the world itself, very little of that was spent explaining anything to the reader. It felt info-dumpy from the sheer amount of time spent learning about the world, but it also felt as if readers are simply tossed into shark-infested waters and expected to swim. This is one of the oddest things I’ve ever read.The world is a bit Lovecraftian in setup. The flora and fauna are utterly alien, and incredibly weird. There are tentacles galore, along with animals that float via gas bladders and vines that float. These things combined made for a tough world to picture until I finally envisioned an underwater realm, but without the water. The Wyrdwood at the heart of this world is greatly feared, and with good reason. Everything in it seems thirsty for blood. And yet, as it’s described at night, it’s also a place of breathtaking beauty. Think Ferngully, or Avatar’s Pandora. It’s luminous, and seeing it sounds almost worth the risk of death and dismemberment.There is also an abundance of odd names and terminology, which was nearly impossible to keep straight. The social structure and positioning was also unusual and difficult to wrap my mind around. The family setup, with firstwives, secondwives, firsthusbands, secondhusbands, and so on, is interesting but difficult for my monogamous mind to comprehend. And then there are trions, those who are neither male nor female, husband nor wife, but something uniquely their own and prized for those differences. One of our main secondary characters is a trion, and they were pretty fascinating. But our main character, Cahan, is by far the most interesting character in the story. He reminded me of Logen Ninefingers, or of Clay from Kings of the Wyld, in how he thought and kept himself a bit a part. But he is also wholly his own. While the story was slow to start, he did grow a good deal as the narrative progressed. Other characters I enjoyed were Udinny, a monk of a relatively unknown god, and Segur, who is something of a pet to Cahan but who I still can’t come close to envisioning in my mind.Besides the fact that this over 600 page book seemed to have a 300 page introduction, my biggest problem with Gods of the Wyldwood was the writing itself. I’m not sure if they were stylistic choices or things that might be edited out of the final, finished copy, but the grammar was just about as wild as the Wyldwood itself. The amount of fragments, run-on sentences, and improperly compounded sentences was appalling. And don’t even get me started on the comma splices, which littered just about every single paragraph in the book. Again, I think these things might be stylistic choices, not a lack or knowledge or poor craftsmanship, they threw me constantly. Barker has an incredibly creative mind. The world he crafted is truly unlike anything else I’ve come across in the fantasy genre. But it’s my belief that he was so enamored by he world he created that the characters and story took a back seat, and it showed in the storytelling. I’m not sold on this series yet, but I would at least attempt to read the sequel. And I still have high hopes for his Tide Child trilogy, which I have sitting on my shelf in its entirety. Here’s to hoping I can gel more with his writing in that series than I did with this particular book....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,Jun 2023,"Jun 16, 2023","Jun 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63066020-gods-of-the-wyrdwood

It sounded like such a charming place, brimming with big personalities, saturated in gorgeous landscapes, and containing a surprisingly robust literary scene. And Love, of course. Love is so wonderfully present in this little village. This is the kind of magical realism that I love, where the magical element is mostly emotional but definitely still magical. What an absolutely charming story.Confession time: I thought this book sounded overly saccharine. While I love books about books, the description of this one sounded like it would pull a bait-and-switch on me. I’ve lost count of the number of books that present themselves as a love letter to books, only to drop the very element that attracted me in the first place as soon as the plot kicks in. I always feel cheated. Thankfully, that’s not at all what happened in The Little Village of Book Lovers. The love and importance of books permeated this story all the way through. On top of that, it’s actually a book about a book within another book about books - The Little Paris Bookshop, which I’ve not yet read but cannot wait to remedy. There were so many wise and beautiful things said about books and stories within the pages of this one. I highlighted so much in my Kindle copy, and I had to immediately order a physical edition, so that I can repeat the process there. Here’s an example:“Books turn people into time travelers, shape shifters, body switchers, mind readers, and immortals, and therefore books are the last great alchemy of our age.”Beautiful, isn’t it? For some reason, this book doesn’t have the best of ratings. I’m not sure why, because I thought it was just lovely. Maybe bordering on saccharine, but I thought it toed that line well. The plot never dragged, even if it was light in places. However, those portions felt necessary to weaving the setting and the atmosphere tightly around the reader, and the atmosphere is what made the tale so magical. And then there are the characters. As I stated above, these characters are brimming with personality. Marie-Jeanne, our main character, is pretty wonderful. She gets an interesting start in life, wrapping her fist around the finger of Love personified while still an infant. This surprising contact with Love shifts her entire life, letting her see Love’s mark on others, which no one but Love itself is supposed to be able to see. Marie-Jeanne is an orphan raised by a childless couple, Elsa and Frances. Elsa is terrified of love, and that fear has made her hard. Frances is balances that out with his softness. When he gets the idea to start a mobile library through their surrounding area, life throughout the village and beyond is never the same. I loved Marie-Jeanne’s thirst for books, and her unique outlook on life. I loved the elaborate descriptions of the secondary characters, and how this mobile library impacted them. I loved seeing these people change and soften and grow over the course of the story. And I love that the story is narrated by Love, who is unable to look away from the little human that gripped Love in her fist. The Little Village of Book Lovers is a story I can see myself returning again and again, whenever I need some comfort or to be reminded of the magic held within the covers of a book. And I can’t wait to read more of Nina George’s work. She has a beautiful way with words, and it’s obvious that she absolutely adore books. I feel like I found a kindred spirit....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 16, 2024","Jan 20, 2024","May 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63024265-the-little-village-of-book-lovers

While I can definitely understand where such comparisons could beThe Gifts was recommended for lovers of The Essex Serpent, which I adored last year. While I can definitely understand where such comparisons could be drawn, this book didn’t live up to The Essex Serpent, in my opinion. And because that’s what drew me to the book to begin with, I found myself a bit disappointed in it, though it wasn’t at all a bad story.The elements of The Essex Serpent that made it so great were the thoughtful prose, the philosophical and religious ponderings, and the possible supernatural event at the heart of the story that never resolved itself. I loved the epistolary portions of the book, as well as the romantic tension. It was a slow, meandering tale that captivated me, giving a lot of food for thought without providing clear-cut answers. The setting was dark and moody and vaguely gothic, and I loved exploring it through the lens of a naturalist, as our main character viewed herself. That setting, combined with the potential presence of a supernatural element, are the main similarities between The Essex Serpentt and The Gifts. But where the former fostered deep thought and never answered the question of whether the supernatural was truly present or not, the latter was more plot-driven, and the supernatural was unquestionably present. Some important topics, like race and gender and religion, are touched on in The Gifts, but are not delved into in any meaningful way.The Gifts is woven primarily from five main perspectives, four of whom are talented women in their fields. But as this takes place in England in the 1840s, those talents are not encouraged or even acknowledged by the majority of their male counterparts. The fifth common perspective is that of a male surgeon, and I found him absolutely despicable. As I was meant to. I could tell he was meant to be more nuanced than I read him, but I found him fairly unredeemable. I found the female perspectives interesting, but none of them ever fully won me over emotionally. And because we knew with certainty what was happening in certain perspectives, the use of these same events as mysteries to be solved by other perspective characters felt tiresome. There were decisions made that had me rolling my eyes, and events that felt entirely to convenient in terms of timing. Even had the central supernatural core of the story been removed, I would have still found the plot and timing unbelievable.There were things I enjoyed about this book. While it took me a while to warm up to it, the storytelling was fairly compelling. The world was well fleshed out and believably rendered. There was a small romantic side plot that was sweet, and a pretty satisfying ending. However, I think I would have enjoyed this book more had I not heard it compared to The Essex Serpent. But if you’re a fan of historical fiction and are looking for something darker with an element of magical realism, I think you might enjoy The Gifts very much....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 25, 2023","May 29, 2023","May 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62985051-the-gifts

This is both a love letter to and a reckoning with those books. Here we have honest, historically accurate representation, highlighting the struggles minorities faced during a period that has been so romanticized in popular culture. “They were in favor of fairness and justice as long as it wasn’t too inconvenient or uncomfortable.”Park did an astounding amount of research, especially among various Indigenous tribes, so as to ensure the greatest historical accuracy possible. I was tremendously impressed by how much work went into this slim book. It was definitely a labor of love.

When I heard a friend talking about Dracula Daily, I thought this might be how I could finally get through it. I was correct. While this is by no means now among my favorite classics, I’m glad to have read it. And receiving the next fragment to my inbox each day that aligned with when said fragment was dated in the book was a lot of fun. It made me feel like part of the story in a way that was very unique.What do I say about a book that has so shaped pop culture past and present? First of all, I was surprised by how little time Dracula himself spent on the page. I understand it, because this is an epistolary novel and we are getting our information largely from letters and diary entries, but I still found it surprising. I was also surprised by the very anticlimactic ending. I just expected more from a story that has rooted itself so firmly into our cultural psyche. And the colloquialisms bothered me immensely. That’s a writing choice that I just can’t seem to ever appreciate, no matter how hard I try.I do have to say that I was also pleasantly surprised in various ways. Mina’s character was much more present, and more highly respected by the men in her life, than I expected. There was a sincerity to the camaraderie between Mina, Jonathan, Dr. Seward, Quincey, Arthur, and Van Helsing that was incredibly charming. I also found the book to be far more blatantly Christian in theme and language than I anticipated. This wasn’t a bad book, but it in no way compares to others often equated with it, like Frankenstein and The Picture of Dorian Gray. There’s a beauty to the writing in those two works that feels absent here, in my opinion. I know that there are people who absolutely adore this book, but I sadly don’t fall into that camp. I can respect it. I can even appreciate large portions of it. But Dracula doesn’t speak to my soul in the same way as Frankenstein.

Fifteen year old Anequs, ourTo Shape a Dragon’s Breath is young adult Indigenous fantasy set in a world remarkably similar to ours, but with dragons. Fifteen year old Anequs, our main character, is a Masquapuag girl who finds herself bonded to the first Nampeshiwe dragon to be hatched on their land in generations, marking Anequs as the first Nampeshiweisit, or dragon companion, in recent memory. Her people are thrilled, but the Anglish, who conquered the land many years ago, have very specific ideas for how a dragon and her dragoneer should operate. In order to keep her dragon from being put to death as a feral, Anequs enrolls in a prestigious dragon academy on the mainland. Here, she is confronted for the first time with the nearly insurmountable differences between her people and the Anglish, who have so many unspoken rules about society and what makes a person civilized. Anequs must learn to navigate this new, baffling world, while also trying to learn everything she needs to know in order to bring her dragon home, and somehow managing to not lose herself and her heritage in the process.I’m a sucker for a book about dragons, and anything dealing with academia has my immediate attention. Pair that with discourse on colonialism, beautiful depictions of Indigenous life, and a main character I can root for, and I’m sold. This book delivered all of those elements with great aplomb, along with social commentary that both fascinated and enraged. I loved that the world was essentially our own, with the setting similar to America at the cusp of the Industrial Revolution. However, in this version of the world, besides the fact that dragons existed, Christianity never rose to power. The Anglish are essentially Vikings, with their governmental setup and religion, though the names of the Norse gods have been very subtly changed. Subtle name and word alterations are a huge part of Blackgoose’s world building here. Our Freya and Odin are Fyra and Joden in their world. Witchcraft is witskraft. Algebra is aljabr, and geometry is anglereckoning. These little differences threw me at first, and felt unnecessary if the differences between this world and our own were so thinly veiled, but I gradually acclimated to them. Anequs is a wonderful character, and I could have read about her relationship with Kasaqua, her dragon, forever. The dragons in this book all sounded beautiful, and I love that there were so many different breeds included, but Kasaqua definitely felt the most unique. I love how much time we got with her as a hatchling, and it was bittersweet witnessing her grow. And Anequs is such a self-assured, loyal, upstanding, brave person. I adored every scene set on her home island of Masquapuag, and I loved getting to learn so much about her culture.It was the Anglish culture that I found distasteful. The emphasis on propriety and adhering to unspoken societal expectations was almost as tedious for me as it was for Anequs when she was among them. It was the amount of time spent on this culture, as well as the fact that Blackgoose could become very info-dumpy with her world building under the guise of the school setting, that had me putting the book down quite often. There were a couple of points where I bogged down enough to consider not picking the book back up, but I’m very glad that I stuck with it.This is a book with a ton of representation, and none of it felt forced. The city in which Anequs attends school is a melting pot, and we see people of all races and religions, as well as the prejudice that sadly follows such diversity. Multiple sexualities are represented, though we see how those things are closeted out of fear in Anglish society while being accepted without question by the “nackie” (Native) society. And finally, we have some neurodivergent representation in the form of one of my favorite side characters, Sander, as well as the first time I’ve ever encountered fidgets in a fantasy novel. I thought those were a lovely touch.I ended up very much enjoying To Shape a Dragon’s Breath, even though I felt it was a bit too long and involved too much info-dumping in the worldbuilding. This is such a unique story, and I’m thrilled that Indigenous fiction is coming more to the fore.

Conroy is often on lists of modern classics, so I have his books shelved next to Barbara Kingsolver and Larry McMurtry and Rosalinde Pilcher, all of whom are also unread. The only reason I decided to pick this up is that a wonderful Goodreads friend, Caleb, messaged me a personal recommendation for it.

These people and these places felt incredibly real to me. The scope and span were incredibly impressive, covering everything from the Holocaust to the Vietnam War and beyond. But at its core, this is a coming-of-age story, and one of the best I’ve ever read. It’s the story of a fantastic friendship and what happened to shatter it.The plotting and breadth of story and character development were all stellar, as was the pacing and the writing itself and the strong sense of place evoked by that writing.

Whether in rage or shocking description, this angry collection is raw and erudite and often difficult to swallow. Olds definitely had something to say in her poems, which I could feel even in those entries whose meanings I couldn’t intuit. I think Olds also enjoys the utilization of the shock factor; there were a few stanzas that actually managed to shock an audible gasp from me, which I consider fairly difficult to achieve as I’ve read pretty widely for the entirety of my adult life. There were motifs that repeated themselves throughout different portions of the collection, which I found clever, but the choices of motifs, from the omnipresence of rodents to the over abundance of dashes, were often off-putting to me personally. I appreciate the concrete language Olds uses, but the messages weren’t always clear to me. The earlier poems, those written during Quarantine, felt almost bombastic, forcefully angry without clearly conveying the “why” of that rage. The second section, Amherst Balladz, is the only section that really threw me stylistically. There was an over abundance of dashes, a style choice that I have never vibed with outside of Emily Dickenson’s work. But the back half of the collection, particularly the final section of Elegies, was more intelligible and relatable for me personally. The rage that so permeates was softened here, and was more glaringly focussed on a single topic: loss. This resonated, as loss is something I very much understand. Olds and I have radically different worldviews, but I don’t think that is what hampered my enjoyment of the collection. I appreciated being let into Olds’s pain, and I mourn the vast and varied traumas she has faced and overcome since childhood. I respect this collection, and Olds as a poet. But I found no enjoyment here, nothing that sparked any strong positive emotion. I include righteous anger in that list. All I felt was discomfort, and I wasn’t in the right headspace to appreciate it.

I thought the premise sounded fun, and my mom had already read it and loved it. So why was I nervous to pick it up? Whelan is my favorite female audiobook narrator, and there is something about approaching a beloved artist through a new medium that inspires trepidation, at least for me. What if this person whose art I adore in a particular medium is less gifted in another? Will that adversely impact my experience with them in the art of theirs I already love? Those are the questions that run through my mind, but I needn’t have feared when it came to Whelan; it turns out she’s just as fantastic an author as she is a narrator.Whelan’s writing is wonderful, brimming with charm and wit. She spins a layered, multifaceted story that touches on a plethora of deep topics. And she doesn’t skate the surface; she delves. I went in expected/hoping for a cute romance that offered some insight into the world of audiobook narration. I definitely got those things in spades, with strong helpings of humor and angst and an almost meta self-awareness. But there was also discourse on the abiding, residual emotional trauma of accident-induced deformity, long after the physical wounds become scars. We watch the horrors of evolving dementia and witness the callousness of Hollywood. It’s an incredibly insightful book.But I would be lying if I didn’t confess that the romance was the absolute star of the show for me. I loved watching that relationship bloom, and I really appreciated Whelan’s use of common romance tropes as well as her characters’ self-awareness of them. This book to me approached romance in the same way Austen approached gothic fiction in Northanger Abbey; it is both commentary on and love letter to the genre. Also, the love interest is incredibly hot on multiple levels. There was an epistolary portion of the book, and the relationship, that was simply delightful.Whelan also did a brilliant job on the narration. I stated above that she is my favorite female audiobook narrator, but there was something incredibly special about hearing her read her own work. She gave herself so much room to shine here, and shine she did. I also really loved the peak behind the curtain we were offered into the audiobook world. I’ve come to love audiobooks over the past few years, so this was one of my favorite aspects of the book.It’s been a while since I had a book that was an easy 5 stars. No waffling on the rating. No notes. Nothing I would change. This is one of those books. Had I owned a physical copy, I would have hugged it after finishing the final pages. I just loved every single thing about it.

In this novella Ester, our main character, is seeking to quiet her tragic past by proving herself as a ruhker, one of the few highly trained individuals in her kingdom who can handle rocs. These magnificent, gigantic birds are like creatures pulled straight from myth, and are the only natural predator of the monsters that so plague this kingdom: manticores.The relationship between ruhker and roc mirrors that of falconer and falcon, but on a much more dangerous level. These creatures are gorgeous but incredibly mercurial and even more deadly, and must be handled with great finesse, dedication, and devotion. We see how Ester’s life revolves around her roc, Zahra, and what other relationships Ester manages to in the midst of her demanding calling. The characters and world were very interesting, and Lee conveyed the passion of the ruhkers for their birds and their profession beautifully. There was true artistry to the ending, and how that ending managed to both address various plights raised throughout the book while also providing plenty of room for thought and extrapolation.

Unfortunately for me, I’m simply never clicked with comedic speculative fiction.I’ve tried multiple times, but I’ve never read a Pratchett novel in its entirety with the exception of Good Omens, which I read because I’m a Gaiman completionist. And the only reason I was able to finish the first of Adams’s Hitchhiker’s Guide books is that I swapped over to the audio narrated by Stephen Fry, who I could happily listen to recite a phone book. I can appreciate these writers, and respect their work, but it’s not a storytelling style that brings me any kind of pleasure. (Yet. I hope this changes with age, because I want to like it; I just haven’t yet succeeded on that front.)So to say that I struggled with this book, which is a lovely stylistic ode to the comedic speculative fiction so beloved by so many, would be an understatement. Even though this is a book by my favorite author ever, I still found myself dreading picking it up and struggling to read more than a few pages at a time. Thankfully, but about the halfway point, Sanderson’s patented brilliance with world building and character development had begun to win me over, and I was able to fly through the back half of the book in a single day. Even if I didn’t resonate with the story, I was absolutely delighted by the art. Steve Argyle not only did some truly exquisite full page art pieces for this story, he also contributed a bounty of marginalia that made flipping through the pages a delight. I have no doubt that this is going to be a treasure in physical form and, even if this wasn’t my favorite story to ever slide from Sanderson’s pen to the printed page, I’m excited that it will have a home on my shelf....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Apr 04, 2023","Apr 09, 2023","Apr 04, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60531410-the-frugal-wizard-s-handbook-for-surviving-medieval-england

I love the near-future setting, I love the procedural setup, but most of all, I love the characters. By 56 books in with the same core cast, I know these people intimately. They feel more real to me than some people I know in real life. I also love the episodic nature, how each case is self-contained to a single book, while we get to see how the lives of the central cast are progressing and changing from book to book.This particular story deals with the celebrity world. When a hugely beloved actor dies of cyanide poisoning at the party he was throwing with his equally famous actress wife, Eve has to determine which half of the power couple was truly the intended target as she weaves through this world of glitz and glamour and long-held grudges. Just because you’re famous doesn’t mean you aren’t willing to get your hands dirty for revenge’s sake if opportunity presents itself. I found the central story of this particular installment a bit lackluster in comparison to some other books in the series. However, I readily admit that this is due in large part to the fact that I am in no way enamored with the celebrity realm. I see what Roberts was doing with this installment, though. The past few books have dealt with heavy, dark, disturbing content, and this provided a bit of a breather for both the reader and the characters. Even if I wasn’t deeply invested in the case, there were a few interesting twists, and I’m always incredibly happy to catch up with the characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 22, 2023","Mar 31, 2023","Mar 22, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60864807-encore-in-death

Even though I can see why it worked so well for them, I’m sad to say that it fell a bit flat for me. This gothic romantic fantasy is an interesting story with a pretty unique premise and setting. However, I found myself unable to connect to the writing or the characters.Our main character, Elspeth Spindle, was afflicted with a magical fever as a child. Nearly all children who suffer this fever are killed by order of the king, for fear of what magic will fun in their veins if they survive. However, Elspeth’s father hid her away, making her one of the few fever-afflicted to survive into adulthood. In the kingdom of Blunder, magical Providence Cards rule the hearts of the society. When Elspeth touches one such card, she finds that her magic allows her to absorb something of the card’s essence. In the case of the card she touched, that was the soul of a Nightmare. With a creature of myth sharing her mind, Elspeth never feels safe, and wants nothing more than to hide away in the woods. But when family and society dictate she attend a royal birthday celebration, her life will change yet again, and will never be the same.I like the idea of the Providence Cards, and the powers they offer. Blunder and the salty mists and the Spirit of the Wood are all suitably creepy and atmospheric. But there was something about Gillig’s prose that simply didn’t work for me. It felt stiff and vaguely juvenile. This is not technically a young adult book, and there is a somewhat descriptive sex scene at one point, the writing felt more akin to young adult works to me than to the adult fantasy I tend to read. The exception to this was actually the bits of poetry littering the book, both at the beginning of chapters and in the dialogue between Elspeth and the Nightmare. These bits were my favorite thing about Gillig’s writing.And then there are the characters. While we spent much time in Elspeth’s head as discussions were had between herself and the Nightmare, I was never able to connect with her as a character. That disconnect extended to every member of the supporting cast, as well. I appreciated that the central romance didn’t involve a love triangle in any way, and I liked both Elspeth and Ravyn, but they felt very flat to me.Even though I had some issues with this book, the cliffhanger ending is going to compel me to read the next installment whenever it becomes available. I have a feeling that this would have been a stronger story had it been condensed into a standalone, but that’s merely my opinion. Again, I can see why so many people have loved this book, and I wish I were one of them.

Sometimes I’m able to guess the big twist or outcome or both within the first 100 pages, and then lose my patience with the rest of the narrative and the cast for not getting there faster. Sometimes the author includes wild twists for the sake of sensationalism that come out of left and field couldn’t have been predicted. Both types of mystery novels drive me a little crazy. The Guest List was neither of those. Told in a way that leaves you guessing without the sensationalism and populated with an interesting group of characters, I was invested through the final pages.“In my experience, those who have the greatest respect for the rules also take the most enjoyment in breaking them.”Foley has this narrative dexterity that vaguely brought to mind Agatha Christie if she wrote in 2020. The story is told via divided timeline, but that division is in actuality less than 48 hours. The narrative jumps back and forth between the immediate aftermath of something awful happening at a end of a wedding, though we don’t know what that something awful is, and the lead up to said wedding, starting the day prior. The leading-up portion of the book is where we spend most of our time, and where we get to know the main characters: Jules, the bride; Olivia, the bridesmaid; Johnno, the best man; Aoife, the wedding planner; and Hannah, the plus one. As we spend more time with these characters, learning their pain and fears and motivations, it becomes harder to predict who will be victim or perpetrator or neither. But everyone has a reason to want someone dead. The cast was compelling and pretty well balanced. In just about every character, there were attributes that made me like them and flaws that spoke of long-abiding inner demons. As the book moved into its fever pitch at the end, I truly didn’t know who would strike the killing blow. This varied, tortured, likable cast is the way in which this novel felt most reminiscent of Christie to me.“And I'm not worried about it being haunted. I have my own ghosts. I carry them with me wherever I go.” The wedding of Jules, a lifestyle magazine editor, and Will, the star of a survival show, is a big deal. Though the two aren’t massive celebrities, they’re famous enough to rate a fairy tale celebrity wedding on a secluded island. The guest list is exclusive, and it promises to be an event to remember. I loved the setting, a remote island off the coast of Ireland. It was moody and ominous and the perfect site for a mystery/thriller. The wedding part of the premise was fine, though I’m not a huge fan of stories in which the narrative hinges on a wedding. It’s a choice that feels overused to me, though Foley utilized it to great affect in this novel. Social media played a pretty large role in the lives of some of the characters, and there’s something about a strong inclusion of such things that I feel impedes novels like this from feeling potentially timeless, but that’s a personal opinion.“So to luck. And to making your own luck... or giving it a little helping hand, when it needs it.” I enjoyed The Guest List. I didn’t love it, and it wouldn’t have been my choice for mystery of the year. I think Stuart Turton’s The Devil and the Dark Water totally deserves that honor, in my eyes at least if not in the eyes of Goodreads. But I don’t regret picking it up, and I found it interesting enough to add more of Foley’s work to my TBR. If you’re looking for an atmospheric mystery set very much in today’s world, with an interesting cast and a plot that is neither too easy nor impossible to predict, The Guest List might be just what you’re craving.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52656911-the-guest-list

I never get tired of school stories, especially when there’s magic involved. And giving kids a way to see themselves in that setting is just a beautiful thing. As much as Harry Potter shaped me as a reader, I recognize that it’s pretty lacking in the diversity department. Clayton saw that, as well, and addressed it beautifully.This is the story of Ella, the first Conjuror to be invited to attend the Arcanum Training Institute, where Marveller children from all across the world attend to hone their craft and learn what their own Marvel will be. Marvel and Conjure are two radically different magic systems, and Conjure has always been looked down upon by the Marveller world. Conjure magic would be a bit more akin to voodoo in our own world, focussed around the Underworld and being hubbed in New Orleans. Conjure actually reminded me a good bit of Root as found in Tracy Deonn’s Legendborn Cycle. It’s a lovely system, respecting nature and utilizing song. Anytime music is tied into magic, I’m immediately on board.But back to Ella. This eleven year-old girl is a hopeful bridge between the two worlds. She’s been invited to learn about the Marvellers and find out what her own Marvel might be. Ella is immediately enchanted by the world, and I can absolutely see why. The Institute is stunning in every way. It’s in the clouds, which immediately makes it even more magical. Everything from the dorms to the cafeteria, from the grounds to the classes, just sounds like my every childhood imagining of a magic school. There are five subsets of Marvels, revolving around the five senses, and Ella can’t wait to discovers what her Marvel will be.But as I said earlier, Marvellers and Conjure folk don’t see eye-to-eye. Ella is judged immediately, but kids and teachers alike. It doesn’t matter who hard she works, she is always looked down upon and accused of bad behavior. This level of prejudice is infuriating, especially as Conjure parallels and is a direct part of the African American community. Marvellers come from all over the world, so the school is already a diverse place. Thus, the prejudice doesn’t feel exactly racial in nature, but it definitely targets a specific heritage. Ella battles against this prejudice and mistreatment throughout the story to the best of her ability, considering her age. And she handles it with grace.While I really loved the setting of this book, and the diversity of the cast, I did have a few problems with the story. The pacing of the plot didn’t feel like it matched the time table being laid out by the author, in my opinion. She would mention that something had happened, and that three weeks later they were just moving onto the next step. I understand this for some things, but for others it just really didn’t ring true. I also found the villain pretty unbelievable, and there were some other reveals that either felt like anyone could have seen them coming from a mile away, or that really didn’t make sense with the information given. Finally, I didn’t feel compelled to pick this back up after putting it down. This is a book that should have taken me no time at all to read, but I found myself easily distracted from it.The Marvellers is an interesting, unique magic school story that is both a window and a mirror for kids of every background. The setting is phenomenal, and so is the diverse representation offered within the pages. The Institute is a easy addition to my “fictional places I would love to visit” list. I love that this story exists. Whatever drawbacks I found within it, I would absolutely and without hesitation press this into the hands of any young reader, especially those who don’t often see themselves in magical settings. This is the kind of middle grade story that I think will work best for its intended age group, but I would still be interested to see what happens next for Ella and her friends at the Institute. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Mar 11, 2023","Mar 17, 2023","Mar 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56896065-the-marvellers

Sam, our snarky perspective character, is an archaeo-entomologist. Bugs are kind of her thing. When a job is postponed because remains are found on site, Sam finds herself without a place to stay and decides it would be a good time to visit her mom in North Carolina. But something is off. Her mom has redecorated the house to look exactly like it did before Gran Mae, Sam’s exceptionally mean grandmother, passed away 20 years ago. All of the bright colors her mom loved are gone. Her mom now asks the blessing before every meal and refuses to curse or say anything critical of her own deceased mother. All of which is incredibly out of character. Sam is worried that her mom is suffering delayed mourning or, worse, the onset of dementia. But when Sam starts noticing some really odd things around the house, and when dark family secrets begin coming to light, she is forced to reevaluate.This story was suitably creepy, and a bit subversive with its tactics. I’ve never read anything else that painted vultures in such a positive light and roses in such a disturbing one. I was reminded of Grady Hendrix when it came to the actual horror elements, but without whatever it is about his work that I find inexplicably off-putting. And I absolutely loved Sam as a narrator. She is snarky and funny and easy to root for. However, I did have a serious complaint about this book. The pacing is just weird. The front half of the book is almost painfully slow at times, to the point that I would have put it down if not for Sam’s charming, sarcastic commentary. Things really picked up in the back half, though, to the point that the ending felt rushed. I couldn’t put it down at that point, but I found myself annoyed at how quickly everything resolved in the end. A House with Good Bones was my first T. Kingfisher experience. Though I had a few issues with it, this definitely won’t be my last book from her. The voice in this book was fantastic, and kept me reading even when I felt the pacing was really off.

Every contribution to the book, no matter the format chosen, was raw and real and brutally honest before God, while still maintaining and promoting a reverence of Him.

I can see where some portions of this, and even the simple presence of some of the contributors, could make some conservative Christians uncomfortable. But discomfort fosters growth, and exposure to those radically different from us who nevertheless share our faith is a phenomenal reminder to see people through the eyes of Jesus instead of our own.As with any compilation comprising so many contributors, this is a bit of mixed bag in terms of quality and craftsmanship. However, I found it overwhelmingly poignant and powerful. Rhythm of Prayer is comforting and thought-provoking and just exactly harkens back to the prayer circles it hoped to evoke, but with room at the table for women of all colors, classes, and sexualities.

I’ll be honest; right around the time the fecal monsters appeared I decided I was done with Saga after this volume. However, Hazel’s commentary along with the directions the plots took near the end caused me to reconsider. I guess I’ll stick with the series for a while longer....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Jan 25, 2018not set","Jan 25, 2018not set","Mar 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43307890-saga-volume-8

While some comparisons could definitely be drawn, Alone is radically different. First of all, it’s a novel-in-verse, comprised of 179 poems across 400 pages. The format was very unexpected, and it took me a while to acclimate. But once I did, I was won over completely. That format was a bold choice, but it was one that worked incredibly well for the story.Our twelve year-old protagonist is not surviving in the wilds but in suburbia, after the government moves everyone out in the night and she is left behind. The how and why are explained in the book, but suffice it to say that she is panicked when she finds herself alone. With only her neighbor’s dog George for company, she learns to navigate life alone, providing for herself and George the best she can. She might be twelve when we meet her, but she grows up fast, becoming incredibly resourceful as she first relies on what she remembers from camping with her dad and then discovers her greatest resource of all: the library.The poetic format of this book made our main character’s head a fascinating place to be. Because of the formatting, the story managed to be both fast-paced and deeply introspective, which was a very compelling blend. There was so much food for thought here, and a lot of emotion vicariously experienced. The poetry makes more and more sense as a storytelling method as the tale progresses. There were some really interesting tie-ins to Island of the Blue Dolphins, which I would advice reading prior to this if you have any interest in it, as it is spoiled thoroughly in Alone. I was completely captivated by Alone, and ended up consuming it in one sitting. Some of the content is pretty difficult, as one would expect from this type of story. Because of that content, I would recommend this book to older, mature children, as well as adults who enjoy middle grade fiction. I loved it, and am happy to shelve it alongside childhood favorites like Hatchet and Island of the Blue Dolphins and My Side of the Mountain. Alone is absolutely a story worth reading and discussing and sharing with others. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 02, 2023","Mar 06, 2023","Mar 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49202861-alone

A story about a magical library runs a close second. The Book That Wouldn’t Burn contains both. My excitement over this book when announced was threefold: the cover is stunning, I adore stories centered around books and libraries, and I have thoroughly enjoyed Lawrence’s writing in the past. I’m happy to report that I wasn’t disappointed, in spite of my high expectations. The Book That Wouldn’t Burn is a very thought-provoking story, full of adventure and tension and romance and compelling characters, as well as some lovely discourse on stories and why they matter. The setting for this story is an immense library at the center of the world, and possibly the universe. We see it through multiple time periods, at the rise and fall of various civilizations. Within this library is a special book that leads one of our two perspective characters hundreds of years into the past to cross paths with our other main character. Both of these characters were likable and sympathetic, though incredibly different from one another. The story begins by following Livira, a child of the Dust who, through some truly terrible circumstances, finds herself landing on her feet and calling the Library home. Her thirst for knowledge knows no bounds, and she’s determined to learn as much as she can about the Library and the books it houses. Hundreds of years in the future we follow Evar who, along with his “siblings,” also calls the Library home, but in a very different way. For one thing, Livira can leave the Library; she lives there and works there, but she isn’t trapped there. Evar, on the other hand, has been searching for a way out ever since he sprang from the Mechanism, where he had been trapped for who knows how long. He remembers nothing from before, but he knows he’s meant to find someone. He and the four other children who had been sucked into the Mechanism and spit out untold years later were raised by the Library and have never stepped outside of it. We know from the synopsis that Livira and Evar eventually meet, but we have no idea how or when in the story that meeting will take place. This lends the story some wonderful tension, and an added layer of mystery. I found the Library itself absolutely fascinating, and it remains very mysterious even after the close of the book. It’s massive and dangerous and always an adventure. I can’t wait to learn more about it in the next installment.I enjoyed both main characters, as well as the supporting cast, but Livira stole the show for me. She’s tenacious and plucky and so incredibly smart. When she gets knocked down, she gets right back up again. Her memory is second to none. And she’s wonderfully loyal. Self-sacrificingly so. I fell in love with her immediately, and loved watching her grow. Evar is a quieter character, softer somehow but even more dangerous. I’m interested to see where the next leg of the journey takes him. My favorite element of this book, though I loved the characters and was invested in their story, was the commentary of books and stories and storytelling. This Library is a nexus between worlds, which means that we get certain elements of our own stories leaking through. There were instances where the characters quoted or referred to a well-known story like Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz or the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and those brought me so much joy. Lawrence even cheekily quoted his own work in some of the epigraphs at the beginnings of chapters, which delighted me. The Library itself brought to mind The Starless Sea and The Library at Mount Char and the Great Library series. But there are also beautiful, thoughtful musings on stories themselves, what they mean to us and how they live on even when their pages crumble and their ink fades. I was very thankful to have a digital copy of this book, as I found myself highlighting and annotating constantly.The one complaint I have about this book is the pacing. It meanders for most of the book, though the scenes are definitely not devoid of action and tension. However, the ending felt rushed in comparison, and almost muddied by how much was happening in such few pages. I found myself having a difficult time following the story in those final scenes, which was a shame. However, I found the ending very compelling, and satisfying enough to make up for the cliffhanger element. I’m very excited for the second installment, and hope we’ll get it fairly quickly....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"May 19, 2023","May 30, 2023","Mar 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61612864-the-book-that-wouldn-t-burn

I love the optimism, the wholesomeness, the knowledge that (more often than not) everything is going to work out in the end. There’s a purity to books written for children that will always resonate with me, no matter how old I get. When I can find an adult novel that delivers those same vibes, I’m beyond excited. And that is exactly what The Wishing Game is, in my opinion: it’s a middle grade novel written for grown-ups.Our story begins is a fairly hopeless scenario. Our main character, Lucy Hart, has only one true desire in the world; she wants to adopt Christopher, a seven year-old former student of hers who she fell in love with and fostered for a week after his parents died. But Lucy doesn’t have the funds, or the home, or the transportation that would help her even begin to qualify as a foster placement for Christopher, much less prove that she is capable of being his Forever Home. But when Jack Masterson, the author of Lucy’s childhood favorite series of books (that she still absolutely adores), invites her to Clock Island to play a game that could change her life in huge ways, she jumps at the chance. Maybe, just maybe, her wish can come true after all.Clock Island is a magical place, made more magical by the dozens of books set there. I desperately wish the Clock Island books actually existed. I envision this series being something like Nancy Drew if written by Roald Dahl or Norman Juster, mysterious and whimsical in equal measures. They sound enchanting. And so do their covers. I love how important the cover art is to the Clock Island series, and how much of a role it takes in the story itself. I found the entire cast a delight, especially Lucy, Christopher, Jack, and Hugo, the artist behind the Clock Island covers. The success of the cast rode on the fact that they were all very well fleshed-out and lovable, as well as the fact that the dialogue was incredibly strong.There was this flow to every conversation that felt realistic to me. The banter is quick and bright and clever. Honestly, the writing all around was very strong.While I found the first half of this book a bit slow for the overall length, that was my only real complaint. I love the emphasis placed on forgiveness and fresh starts and facing your fears. This book drives home the idea that no wish is too big if you’re willing to work for it, and that it’s never too late to shoot for your dream. There’s a lovely found family element, as well, which I’m always a sucker for. I wish I could visit Clock Island, whether in real life or in the fictional series of books around which this particular book is based. The Wishing Game is a hug of a book, and I found myself utterly charmed by it. It’s a reminder that pain doesn’t last forever, and that families come in all kinds of shape.

I was very impressed with her writing style, which flowed easily and was just a pleasure to read. Sinking into this story felt effortless, which to me is a mark of wonderful storytelling. I was actually reminded a bit of Brandon Sanderson in terms of readability, which is some of the highest praise I can give. But while the story and world building and character development all started off very strong, things fell apart a bit for me as the story progressed and certain tropes came to the fore.Lore is a highly unusual girl, and she knows it. Raised in the catacombs beneath the city of Dellaire, she has an innate and highly unusual ability: she can channel Mortem, the magic born by death, in ways no one else can. Mortem is dangerous and unpredictable and as feared as it is prized. Many in this world ingest careful doses of poison in order to balance keenly between life and death, though such poisons are illegal. Lore is making her living as a poison-runner when she finds herself drafted by the powers-that-be to help them solve a deadly mystery. Plucked from the streets and dropped into court politics and religious intrigue, Lore quickly finds herself in over her head and pulled between two men: Gabe, the disgraced duke-turned-monk of the Presque Mort who serves as her guard and imaginary cousin; and Bastian, the Sun Prince she has been summoned to investigate. Whitten’s style is so much fun to read. It’s smooth and easy, her prose disappearing behind the story so that it plays out like a movie in the mind. At the same time, the internal voice she gives Lore, our perspective character, is absolutely delightful. Lore is strong and snarky and a joy to follow through her story. She’s far from perfect, and totally embraces that fact, while laughing in the face of anyone who is blind to her failings or their own. However, her voice and character become muddled as she falls into one of my least favorite tropes: the dreaded love triangle.It’s this love triangle that dampened my enthusiasm for the story. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, especially since I had at least an initial fondness for all three characters. However, as the love triangle began to take centerstage, the world building and character development and the story itself all seemed to suffer for it. I also wasn’t the biggest fan of how things wrapped up. That being said, I did enjoy The Foxglove King for the most part, and I definitely enjoyed it enough to continue the series whenever Whitten releases the next installment. This is an interesting story with fun characters set in a unique world, and it’s very well written.

So high, in fact, that I kept putting off reading it because I just knew it was going to be my new favorite book. Anticipating a book that strongly almost always sets it up for failure on a personal level, which is unfortunately the case here. It’s not Slocumb’s fault that this book didn’t land for me. I blame myself entirely.In The Violin Conspiracy we follow Ray, a Black American violinist on the cusp of competing in the most selective and prestigious music competition on the planet. The classical Olympics, if you will. Mere months before the competition, Ray’s violin is stolen and held for ransom. This would be devastating for any musician, but the violin in question here happens to be a ten million dollar Stradivarius. After being introduced to the “thriller” aspect of this fine arts thriller, we are then taken back in time to follow the rise of Ray’s career and how the Strad came into his possession. Ray’s story is fascinating and infuriating in equal measures. His drive and passion for his craft is laudable. The love he had for music was evident on every page. But the treatment he suffered, the lack of support from his family and the racism that fought him every step of the way, were enraging. Especially considering that many of these scenes of blatant racial prejudice were inspired by the author’s own experiences as a Black musician in a still very white-dominated arena. I love the story being told here, but I wasn’t as enamored with the actual telling of it. The writing felt slightly juvenile, lacking the elegance I hoped for and, for some reason, expected from a fine arts thriller. The prose wasn’t lyrical, lacking the musicality I associate with books about music. I did, however, really appreciate getting a look into the life of a professional classical musician. Those passages were absolutely fascinating, as was the author’s descriptions of music. It was apparent that the author is a musician first and foremost, one who decided to share a fascinating story from the realm he knows and loves with the world in a wholly different way from the music that slides from his bow and through his instrument.Aside from my issues with the writing, my other largest complaint is with the predictability of the mystery at the heart of the book. I figured out the culprit almost immediately, which made the characters’ pace in reaching the same conclusion frustrating. Also, Ray made some frankly stupid decisions toward the end of the book that I can commiserate with, but that also drove me nuts.Unfortunately, The Violin Conspiracy didn’t live up to the ridiculously high expectations I set for it. However, I still recognize that this is a unique story told by and from an uncommon perspective, that of a Black classical musician. It’s a very accessible look into a world often viewed as haughty and high-brow, and I understand why it’s already beloved, a mere year after publication. And it inspired me to look into more fine arts thrillers, which I didn’t even realize were a thing!...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 15, 2023","Feb 22, 2023","Feb 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58386733-the-violin-conspiracy

I loved the title and the cover and the premise, and while I’ve never read anything from Martha Wells, her Murderbot Diaries series is highly loved and lauded by those I trust. I’m much more of a fantasy reader than a sci-fi reader, so when I saw that she was writing a fantasy, I knew that I wanted to read it as soon as possible. And I’m happy to report that, in spite of those sky-high expectations, I was not disappointed. Witch King is a high-octave quest through a very original world littered with compelling characters, captivating locales, and some deeply disturbing magic and monsters. But, at its core, it is the ultimate story of found family, one of the best I’ve ever read. Kai is a life-sucking, body-snatching demon with an ooey-gooey center. He might be nigh on impossible to kill, and he can take some seriously hard knocks without stopping until he is the last being standing. But when it comes to those he loves? He will do absolutely anything for them. Even if that means going to essentially the ends of the earth and battling hoards of opponents to reach them. Because that’s what the quest is here. Kai is not seeking gold or glory or even vengeance; he just wants to find the missing members of the family he built for himself and reunite them.Our story begins in a tomb. Kai’s tomb. Demons are severely weakened by water, and he finds himself in an elaborate water trap, with no clue as to how he got there or how long he’s been there. After freeing himself and his best friend, a witch named Ziede, they seek to find Ziede’s wife and brother-in-law, and to learn who betrayed them and why. The storytelling here felt incredibly unique to me. The pace is somehow both slow and propulsive, with action on nearly every page. There is no intensive world building; Wells doesn’t hold her readers’ hands, but rather reveals things organically as the story progresses. For some reason the world felt vaguely Egyptian to me in terms of setting, but that was the only similarity I can draw between this book and anything else I’ve ever read. There were so many different classes of beings, and we learn little snippets and snatches about them as that information becomes relevant to the plot. This is a story that demands and rewards patience. While the book starts off incredibly strong with Kai’s escape from his own tomb, and there are action sequences aplenty, there’s something meandering about the plot itself as it unfolds. We flip every other chapter between Kai’s present and his past, how he came to be called the Witch King and how he built this family for himself out of the ashes of loss. I was equally invested in both timelines. The combination imbued the book with an element of mystery that really worked for me.Wells is a marvelous crafter of character. Kai was multifaceted and somehow wholly unexpected. I fell in love with him, and was charmed by the people he loved. I could have spent endless days with him. And yet, we get very little inner monologue from any of these characters, including Kai. He still felt like a mystery to me, even though the entire story was told from his perspective. Everything I learned about his character, about his inner conflict and his love for his friends and his determination to protect them against all odds, I felt as if I learned from outside observation. When people talk about how an author should “show not tell” in their work, this could serve as an excellent example of an author doing exactly that, with great aplomb.I thoroughly enjoyed Witch King, even when I was feeling slightly lost. Wells created something truly special with Kai, and with the world in which he lives. I would love to visit him again someday, should Wells ever decide to revisit the world. But even if she doesn’t, this was a wonderfully contained story that left me feeling content after I read the final pages. If her character writing is this good in everything she pens, I can’t wait to go back and reader her Murderbot Diaries....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"May 18, 2023","May 24, 2023","Feb 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61885085-witch-king

First, I absolutely adored the author’s previous work, Dear Edward. Second, the cover is stunning and powerful and just speaks to me. Third, this was being billed as paying homage to Little Women, which is a story I’ve always enjoyed. While it was indeed a riff on the classic tale, I was a bit disappointed in the story Napolitano was telling. While it was very well written and had some wonderfully deep, introspective passages, it just wasn’t for me.This is a family drama. Emphasis on the drama. I loved the relationship between the four sisters when we first met them. But things go downhill quickly. As members of the family start dying or moving away or just extricating themselves from each other’s lives, I was left feeling like the love they had proclaimed unconditional seemed to have an awful lot of conditions on it. The characters were all well fleshed-out and interesting, but I found a couple of them pretty unlikeable. Unfortunately, my least favorite character in the entire book was one of the perspective characters. Every decision she made baffled and angered me in equal measures. I did like the nods to Little Women that were tucked into this book, especially the more subtle ones that weren’t realized by and commented upon by the sisters themselves. However, I also couldn’t help but feel that this story took something that was pure and sweet and twisted it into something that was ugly from certain angles. I know that real life and real relationships are often ugly, but I don’t know how much lovers of Little Women are going to appreciate this approach to one of their favorite stories.There were some lovely moments in here, and I appreciated the discussion of love and forgiveness and letting go of guilt. I enjoyed the emphasis on learning from your past in order to strengthen your future, and how you can’t do that if you refuse to look openly at said past. There were some difficult topics covered in this novel that I thought were handled well, and respectfully. I also loved the importance of art to the story, and how the cover actually meant something to the book.However, the story overall was slow to the point of plodding, and was often incredibly frustrated. The characters drove me crazy. I can’t imagine loving someone but refusing to let them be part of my life. Open communication could have fixed so many of this family’s problems. People who love slow-moving family dramas are most likely going to find a lot to love here.

Everything that was being built up in the previous two books felt like it came to fruition here. We were given fascinating answers about the world and how it came to have its Fifth Seasons. We come to understand what stone eaters are, what magic is, something of where orogeny came from, and why society is so oppressive and divided. The blend of science fiction and fantasy was impeccable, and very unique. I found the ending very satisfying. Jemisin’s voice is a marvel, and I have thoroughly enjoyed diving into her writing. I still felt a bit of emotional disconnect from the climactic scenes, but that’s really my only complaint about the book, and the series as a whole. Honestly, there’s not much more that I feel I can say about The Stone Sky, as it’s the third book in a trilogy and I don’t want to spoil anything from earlier books. I’ll say instead that this is an incredibly strong trilogy, and I can see why all three installments won the Hugo.

And yet it also strongly brought to mind some other stories. ParticuThe Saint of Bright Doors is unlike anything else I’ve ever read in some regards. And yet it also strongly brought to mind some other stories. Particularly, American Gods. On the surface, this is a strange comparison. The settings have absolutely nothing in common; The Saint of Bright Doors is very much a South Asian story, while American Gods is, obviously, firmly rooted in America. But there is something about Fetter and his approach to life that reminded me strongly of Shadow. But seem disconnected from reality in some way. Both are wielded by powers they don’t understand, but who they can’t seem to help but go along with. Both endure some serious weirdness. Reading both books felt something like a dark, gritty fever dream. This is the kind of book that you can’t expect to follow completely. There aren’t a lot of explanations, and even those we are given feel difficult to grasp. The best way to enjoy this type of book is to let yourself float through it, much as Fetter does. The world building is both stellar and baffling, as is the mythos underpinning everything. Fetter’s parents are terrifying in their power and incomprehensibility. Fetter has been trained by his mother from birth toward the sole purpose of killing his father, who is as close to a god as one can become. His life is fraught with danger and fear and impossible tasks. He finds a bit of camaraderie in the city in the form of a support group for unchosen ones, people with some kind of divine heritage who did not end up becoming the next Chosen One of their respective religions. And then he finds the Bright Doors, door throughout the city that have been transmuted in some way, and his fascination with them becomes nearly all-consuming. That is, until the task for which he was groomed suddenly reinserts itself into his life.This is a world of transcendence and demons, of castes and pogroms. It’s a dark world, but a fascinating and colorful one. I could feel the religious and societal inspirations from the author’s heritage. The ephemeral feel of the story from Fetter’s perspective, as someone who drifts through life in a way, was difficult to connect with at first. Thankfully, it grew on me. And then there was a twist of storytelling at the end that made that unmoored tone suddenly make sense, which really elevated the story for me. I thoroughly enjoyed The Saint of Bright Doors. It was refreshingly original, in spite of those comparisons I drew between it and American Gods. Because while those similarities in main characters exist, the stories themselves are radically different. Especially in terms of setting and world building. That being said, if you happen to love American Gods, I think The Saint of Bright Doors could be your next favorite book.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, Tordotcom, in exchange for an honest .

That concept intrigued me, as I’ve always be fairly fascinated by that particular fairytale. When I finally got my hands on the book (and my ears on it, thanks to Libro.fm’s influencer program) it was actually far different that whatever I was expecting. So different, in fact, that I was originally very conflicted about it. I was repelled by the person who seemed like the central character, and judgmental of those who had allowed themselves to fall under her spell. But I was also deeply invested in these two perspective characters, and completely captivated by the writing. The prose here is among the most beautiful I’ve ever experienced. The writing is lush and decadent and almost erotic, like the caress of crushed velvet against bare skin. It’s almost too pretty, bordering on purple, but that seemed to work well for the story. The stunning storytelling, mixed with the dark story being told, brought to mind Pan’s Labyrinth. That’s honestly the best comparison I can draw. Both stories are dark and tragic but oddly beautiful all the same.I originally felt like the relationships in this book were all a bit toxic, and too dark, but that was the point, which became clearer to me the further into the book I read. This story showcases the dangers of co-dependency, of allowing yourself to be entranced by darkness and then compelled to remain in it. It showcases abuse in interesting ways, specifically with gaslighting and sabotage in order to ensure that the abuser remains the only refuge of the abused, and that there is no trustworthy means of escape. We are shown how poisonous love can be when mingled with obsession, possessiveness, and madness. This story also showcases how poisonous imagination can be if not tempered with reality. Can you cling so tightly to your dreams that you miss out on everything else life might have for you? The answer is yes. All of the fantastical elements of this tale seem directly linked to the characters’ desire to experience the fantastic, which left me questioning whether all of the magic in the story was solely in the minds of those experiencing it. How much of the magic here is real, and how much is simply tricks of the minds that desire so strongly to be tricked?I ended up loving The Last Tale of the Flower Bride in ways that I would never have guessed when I first flipped open its pages. It’s one of the most beautifully written stories I’ve experienced, and it was far deeper and more philosophical than it appears on the surface. This is the gnarled underbelly of a fairytale, and exposition of the dangers of living in dreams. It’s an exploration of abusive relationships that we wouldn’t view as abusive on the surface, and an exposure of madness that masquerades as imagination. It’s ugly in very purposeful ways. It’s terribly tragic and cautiously hopeful. I absolutely loved it, and can guarantee that I’ll be revisiting it.

This second installment sucked me in so much faster and more completely than its predecessor. All of the introduction and subtle world building of the first book felt like it really paid off in The Obelisk Gate. I’m beginning to understand the world more, particularly orogeny and the perspective characters, who I won’t be discussing at all as I feel like even the mention of them could potentially spoil The Fifth Season for anyone who has yet to read it. Instead, I’ll say that I’m finding them more compelling than I did in the first book, and am more connected to and emotionally invested in their stories and their outcomes. The “magic” here is absolutely fascinating and feels wholly unique. Which is doubly impressive considering that this is such an apocalyptic/dystopian story. I also really love Jemisin’s writing, particularly the snarky, near omniscient asides we get on occasion. There were even revelations that genuinely surprised me, which is always a plus. My one qualm with this book, and why I’m giving it 4.5 stars instead of 5 full stars, is with the climactic scenes. I felt oddly disconnected from them, which was disappointing considering how much my investment in the story and characters had grown.

I had just finished reading Stone Blind, which is now quite possibly my favorite mythological retelling I’ve ever read, and which deals with the exact same myth. However, Heywood’s approach is as different from Haynes’ novel as two books with the same story at their core could possibly be, so I decided to go ahead and pick it up. I thought it would make for an interesting little book flight, allowing me to see the the same story from radically opposing angles. I was right, in a sense, but I found that I couldn’t help but compare the two books, to the detriment of this one.It’s an interesting idea, rewriting a myth like that of Perseus and Medusa in a way that completely removes magic and the supernatural from every single element of the story. There is not a single fantastical element in this entire book. No gods, no magic, nothing. But, at least in my opinion, it made for a hollow retelling, especially of a story that is so heavily rooted in the fantastical. It was interesting to see how Heywood would take such solidly impossible aspects of the tale, like Perseus’s conception and the entire story of Medusa, and make them more historically plausible. But there was no joy in the reading of it.The myth of Perseus and Medusa has always been a dark one, but it felt far darker without any divine aid or intervention upon which to place the blame for Perseus’s “heroic” actions. Which was likely the very point Heywood was seeking to make. But while I appreciate the trend of taking heroic tales and shining a harsher light on the hero and his actions, this was so extreme that I couldn’t understand how anyone suffered Perseus, much less felt anything like awe or respect or love for him. Every single one of his actions was appalling and senseless, to the point where it felt like someone needed to put him down for the sake of the world’s safety. This also resulting in the three women in his life, from whom we get the story, coming across as unreliable, unsympathetic, and weak, which I’m fairly certain was not the intent. I felt nothing for Danae, or Andromeda, or even Medusa, and I know I was meant to. But their decisions in part led to Perseus’s choices, and I couldn’t help but feel like they had asked for it in some way. Which ENRAGED me, as I would never blame a victim for their own trauma. It was this that led to my distaste for the storytelling turning into near hatred. What kept me from giving this book a single star instead of the 2 upon which I settled was the core point Heywood sought to enforce throughout the book. Stories are powerful. The stories we weave and proclaim are what will be remembered, even if they are false. And, when those lies are the core of our own stories, we will often begin to believe they are true. Heywood demonstrated this undeniably. While I disliked this book intensely, I can think of a lot of readers who will not share my views. Which is one of the things I love most about the book world. So if you’ve been on the hunt for a mythological retelling that strips away every ounce of the fantastic to give you a much more plausible iteration of the story, then I believe you could love this.

This is one of my favorite little niche subgenres, which means that I get very excited over new offerings while also being easily disappointed by them. It turns out I’ve been looking for one specific type without being able to properly verbalize what that type might be. I found it. Natalie Haynes’ Stone Blind is the perfect blend of historical and fantastic. This is a very feminist retelling, lacing the story with righteous anger and snark and sorrow in near equal measure. The structure of the story, and the varying tones and perspectives through which it is being told, is incredibly compelling. Stone Blind is a brilliant retelling and reshaping of Medusa’s story, and there’s not a single thing I would change about it.While the story of Medusa is obviously a sad one, I was pleasantly surprised by how much humor and sarcasm Haynes wove into the story. The tone here is more akin to Claire North’s Ithaca than to the works of Madeline Miller or Jennifer Saint. Though conveying a story that is often stressful and tragic, there’s a sass and level of sarcasm to the telling of it that is delightful. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, but it also doesn’t belittle the more tragic elements. There were portions of the story, specifically of Perseus while on his quest, that made me actually laugh out loud. Whichever tone Haynes reached for, she conveyed perfectly. The writing was simply exquisite.Speaking of Perseus, I love this trend of taking heroes of old and shoving them into harsher, less flattering light. Perseus in this story is portrayed as selfish, entitled, and a coward at the core, only able to accomplish works of greatness because of the tools he is given by the gods. As I’ve always thought his attack on Medusa, after she had already been raped by one god and cursed by another, was akin to kicking a puppy (though admittedly a highly deadly one), I really liked this shift in his portrayal. I also love the discourse on what makes a monster, and how wrong we as humans often get the answer. The relationship between Medusa and her Gorgon sisters was a beautiful one, the warmest and softest element of the story. I tandem read the physical book and the audio, which was read by the author. I don’t always love author narrations, but Haynes is a brilliant narrator with a beautiful voice. The audio for this was absolutely impeccable, and in my opinion improved upon the story. Hearing Haynes’ portrayal of these perspectives was wonderful, but my very favorite element of the audio was how it allowed Haynes to showcase the particularly snarky passages. Witnessing that tone on both paper and audio sharpened the wit.I loved everything about Stone Blind. It’s a beautifully balanced mythological retelling that manages to feel like a fresh take on a timeless tale while also choosing to not shy away from the more magical elements. This reminded me of sitting down with big books of mythology when I was a child, but if I had magically been given the “true story” by one of the figures involved. It was entrancing and entertaining while also filling me with rage and sorrow. Any time such a well-known story can told in a way that elicits such powerful emotions in the reader, the author has achieved something truly special. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 20, 2023","Jan 27, 2023","Jan 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60445291-stone-blind

""No two persons ever read the same book or saw the same pictures.""The Writings of Madame Swetchine, 1860Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. I’ve read plenty of books that made my heart ache, but very few that made my heart feel seen. There is something remarkably soothing about No Two Persons, this quiet novel told in vignettes. From beginning to end, one thought rang in me, heart, mind, and soul: “Ah. There you are.” I can’t articulate how it made me feel. The feeling it inspired isn’t big or showy, but it’s a feeling I’ve been seeking my entire life. Whatever that feeling may be, I’m incredibly thankful to have experienced it. And I hope other readers will have the same healing, soothing, quiet experience of being seen by what you love.“I think each story has its own life. In the beginning, it lives in the writer’s mind, and it grows and changes while it’s there. Changes the writer, too, I’d bet… At some point it’s written down, and that’s the book readers hold in their hands. But the story isn’t done, because it goes on the live in the readers’ heads, in a way that’s particular to each of them. We’re all caretakers of the stories, Alice. Writers are just the lucky ones that get to know them first.”The storytelling here is exceptional, and feels very unique. We follow a different person in each chapter, who are only bound together by their experience with a particular book, Theo, penned by the first character we meet. I would have bought this entire book for that first section alone, which said some brilliant things about stories and storytelling. But each perspective with engaging and insightful, and I was blown away by how brilliantly drawn and lifelike I found each of these individuals. And even though these characters are all radically different in every way, there began to be surprising connections between them further into the book. The story is a tapestry, tying the characters together in interesting, sometimes cyclical ways. Not only are there shared experiences between these characters and the titular character of the book that binds them, but some of them actually impact the story of another in small, unexpected, meaningful ways.“Sometimes what she wrote felt more real than truth. But maybe that’s what writing was, in the end—a way to get to the bedrock, the oxygen. To search out the possible.”I love books that make me feel, and this book definitely made me feel things. I wanted nothing more than to reach into the book and pull out my own copy of Theo, to see how the story that was so impactful for these characters might also impact me.  I also love how the title comes into play, how no two of these characters experience Theo the same way or draw the same things from its pages. But not one of them is left unchanged by it.“Wandering is a gift given only to the lost.”“Inspiration. Because wasn’t that what art was all about, in the end? Mentally shoplifting your way through the world around you, the thoughts inside you? Looking for the thing that makes it all click. Makes it all start. Makes it all worthwhile and whole and good again.That could take a while. You might have to wander, but that didn’t mean you were lost.”This is exactly what I’m always subconsciously hoping to find whenever I pick up a book about books. No Two Persons is all about the power of story to reveal and connect and heal, and how that journey can be radically different for each person who picks up the same book. And that emphasis on the importance of story, particular this one specific story, is the binding element of the entire work. Some books proclaim themselves to be a “love letter to book lovers” or an “ode to the power of story,” but they almost without fail forsake that promise as the plot takes over. Not so with No Two Persons. The book within this book is the plot, and nothing ever usurps it.  Because it’s a quiet, thoughtful, meditative work, I don’t know that it will sing into the soul of every reader as it did mine. But that’s the entire point of the story here. No two persons ever read the same book in the same way. I’m just incredibly thankful to have experienced it in the way that I did. It’s my favorite book I’ve read all year....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 24, 2023","Apr 27, 2023","Jan 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60196684-no-two-persons

And I’m so glad that I did, because the story it houses is exceptional. This family saga follows three generations of Weyward women across 5 centuries. We follow Altha, who is on trial for witchcraft in 1619; Violet, a teen in 1942 who has never been off of the family estate and yet still ended up suffering mistreatment; and Kate, fleeing from an abusive relationship in 2019, after finding out she’s pregnant and refusing to bring a child into such a toxic environment. This is a fiercely feminist story across all three time periods. I would summarize each of the three stories as follows: hell hath no fury like a woman abused who has finally had enough, but with a little bit of witchcraft. The patriarchy is undoubtedly the enemy in every branch of this story, and yet Hart manages to convey this in a way that doesn’t portray every male of the species as inherently evil.I loved the affinity each of the women had for nature, and how nature fights for them when called. This affinity, combined with the way the stories begin to mingle toward the end of the novel and finally tie together in the conclusion, are what sets this tale apart as Gothic magical realism instead of a straight Gothic mystery containing a family drama. It was a really interesting balance.The writing is lovely without being lyrical, because the prose wasn’t the focus. The settings were beautifully described without getting lost in detail, and were very atmospheric. Especially Weyward Cottage. The characters’ development were all different enough to not get confused with one another while also following similar familial patterns. Characters, setting, and writing all took a backseat to the stories being woven, and I loved how Hart braided the three together in the end.I was fortunate enough to get an early audio copy of this through libro.fm’s ALC program, so I was able to tandem read the audio alongside the digital copy. That’s always my favorite way to read, as I find it incredibly immersive. All three storylines here were voiced by different narrators, all of whom did a lovely joy. Whatever your preferred format, I highly recommend Weyward.

Circe is a perennial favorite, Stone Blind and Ithaca both recently blew me away, and Olympus Texas is the most unique retelling I’ve ever read. Because I’ve read so many exceptional retellings, I’m a tad picky when deciding which ones to pick up. I’ve come to realize that those that try to completely remove the magic and the gods from the stories, such as Claire Heywood’s work, really don’t work for me. But when I find an author of retellings whom I feel like I can trust, I latch on. Jennifer Saint is one such author. I preordered Atalanta as soon as it was announced, and I’m happy to report that it didn’t disappoint. Like her two previous works, I found Atalanta a solid, immersive retelling, even if it didn’t quite become an instant favorite.Atalanta is the story of the eponymous princess who was abandoned as a baby by her father, nursed by a bear, raised by Artemis among her nymphs, and served as the only female Argonaut under Jason. She was a huntress unparalleled by any but the goddess of the hunt herself. She was faster and fleeter of foot than any mortal man. And she was essentially erased from the myths of Jason and the Argonauts for the crime of being a woman. I found her story fascinating, largely because I was less familiar with it than I am many of the Greek myths. While I knew the basics of Jason and the Argonauts, it’s not a myth that I found particularly compelling, so I’m not as well versed in it as I am regarding The Iliad and The Odyssey, the tasks of Heracles or the inception of the pantheon of gods. That made the story more engaging for me, especially as it was told solely through the eyes of Atalanta.As with all of Saint’s retellings to date, this is a very feminist retelling of a typically male-dominated story, focussed on the women who have always been in the periphery of said story but who are generally overlooked. I absolutely love this trend of giving voice to the women who are often seen as either a plague, a prop, or a prize for the men in the story to defeat, utilize, or win. Saint presents Atalanta as a fascinating character who develops more nuance the longer she is out of her forest and surrounded by other humans instead of nymphs and bears and goddesses. I loved her affinity with nature, especially dogs, and her inherent belief in herself and her abilities. There were decisions she made that irked me, and character traits that had me rolling my eyes, but all in all I found her compelling and easy to root for, even if she could be remarkably hard-headed.I had a lot of fun reading Atalanta, and appreciated the added benefit of it enticing me to read more about the characters involved and seek out some of their original myths. Greek myth retellings has become one of my absolute favorite subgenres, and all three of Saint’s works have more than earned their place on my shelf. I don’t know that this will have the same staying power as some I’ve read, or be as wonderfully absorbing on a reread, but I very much enjoyed my time with it....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 08, 2023","May 13, 2023","Jan 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61884838-atalanta

I love H.G. Parry. Her debut, The Unlikely Escape of Uriah Heep, is one of my favorite standalones of all time. It is a love letter to book lovers, and I can’t recommend it highly enough. I have yet to finish reading her Shadow Histories, her incredibly well-researched (but dense) duology, but I was thrilled at the prospect of having another standalone from her. I didn’t love it quite as much as I hoped I would, as there was something about the plot and pacing that didn’t quite compel me to burn my way through the story, but The Magician’s Daughter was an absolute delight to read.“Magic was perilous in ways that couldn’t be predicted. You never knew what you might fall into.”Bridget, who goes by Biddy, has been raised on the magically hidden island of Hy-Brasil by a mage and his rabbit familiar. To say this is an odd upbringing would be an understatement, but Biddy knows she is loved. Perhaps more isolated than she would like, but definitely loved. However, when the council of mages catches up with Rowan, Biddy’s guardian, life on this secluded island off the coast of Ireland begins to fall apart. Magic is vanishing from the world, and the council believes that Rowan has information they need to find more of it. With Rowan in danger, Biddy endeavors to help Rowan find those answers, and maybe return magic back to the world, by leaving Hy-Brasil for the first time in her memory and visiting London, where answers to Rowan’s problems and to Biddy’s own origins might be found.“Magic doesn’t give you credit for someone else’s sacrifice.”There’s something about Parry’s storytelling that is incredibly cozy. Almost from page 1 I just wanted to cuddle into a big comfy chair with a soft blanket and a mug of hot chocolate and stay inside this story for ages. I was immediately taken by the odd found family in which Biddy finds herself with Rowan and Hutch. They’re without a doubt an unusual group, but the love between them all is palpable. While Biddy might have grown up without her parents, her life was never lacking love and the joy and freedom of discovery that love offered her. I also dearly loved the setting of Hy-Brasil, with its dilapidated castle and jam-packed library and abundance of black rabbits. It’s one of those fictional locales I would love to visit. Parry also did a great job portraying 1912 London when the story shifted settings, but I have to confess that I missed Hy-Brasil.“She was a half-wild thing of ink and grass and sea breezes, raised by books and rabbit and fairy lore, and that was all she cared to be.”The characters and setting were definitely the stars of the show here. Biddy, our main character, is sixteen when we meet her and is beginning to feel stifled by the island. She loves it, of course, but she is desperate to see something of the world. She is bookish by nature, as the only way she has ever left Hy-Brasil is through the pages of the books Rowan brings her, and that bookishness is what initially won me over. I love the above description of her. But she obviously grows and changes throughout the book and, while that growth was very well done and I respected the woman into which Biddy grew, I missed the bookish girl I first met. Rowan is one of those delightful fictional men who remind me Howl Pendragon, and I mean that in the best possible way. He bungles things often by rarely apologizes, covering mistakes with humor and bravado, or the more than occasional sulk. He’s proud and seemingly self-absorbed but, at his core, he is caring and good and would lay down his life in a heartbeat for those he loves. And then there’s Hutch. I’m a sucker for a good animal companion, and Hutch definitely fits the bill. He is nurturing and protective and fiercely loyal, whether in rabbit for or his far less common human one. He is a being of pure magic who is intrinsically bound to Rowan. I loved the bond between the two, and I loved how they always did their best to never make Biddy feel excluded from their relationship. “Magic needed conviction. It asked for your whole heart, and promised nothing back.”Have I mentioned how much I adore Parry’s craftsmanship? She was a beautiful way with words that had me reading certain sentences over and over again, just to admire all of their facets. You can also tell how very much books and stories matter to her, and that love shines through in her storytelling. It’s always a joy to read a story penned by someone who deeply values stories themselves, and that was definitely the case here. “Death isn’t a habit you develop, you know, like tobacco or whiskey. It only takes once.”The Magician’s Daughter is a beautiful, heartfelt historical fantasy that focuses on found family and what lies at the heart of magic. The writing and characters and setting all shown so brightly that the plot and pacing got a little lost in their glow. At least, such was the case for me. This is a book that I can foresee myself cuddling up with and rereading when I’m sick or sad or just need to escape to somewhere lovely, but where life isn’t as unbelievably easy as it is in some cozier fantasy that doesn’t deal in high stakes stories. The stakes are definitely high here. But the story is lovely just the same.All quotations taken from uncorrected proof and are subject to change upon publication.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 18, 2023","Jan 26, 2023","Jan 18, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58349172-the-magician-s-daughter

The more you love someone, the more willing you are to show them your throat.”The Crane Husband is a retelling of and new spin on the Japanese folktale, “The Crane Wife.” While this was an interesting riff on a classic, well-known story, I found it unrelentingly sad. Our perspective character is an unnamed, fifteen year old girl living with her artist mother and six year old brother, Michael. This girl has been the caretaker of the family since her father passed away, ensuring that her mother’s art sold so that there was money in the bank and food on the table. Their mother isn’t a bad mother, but she is flighty and absorbed in her art and the affairs she has so often. But none of these romantic entanglements have any real impact on the lives of the family. That is, until the crane comes to stay.“Art, true art, exists only to transform. And it is only truly art when it does transform. The maker. The viewer. Everyone.”The day the crane walks in on their mother’s arm, the family’s lives start falling apart. Their mother is now consumed by the unhealthy, abusive relationship to the point of neglecting the sale of her art and the care of her children. As our perspective character does her best to keep herself and Michael fed, their mother falls further and further into her “love” for the crane and into one particular piece of art that consumes both her and the crane, as she tries and fails to get it right. Child services is knocking at the door, and our main character will do anything to keep herself and Michael from being separated.“Love opens the city gates wide, and allows all manner of horrors right inside.”This is a very deep tale, impeccably well written. Topics like abuse and neglect in all their guises, toxic relationships, the vulnerability of love, and the transformative nature of art are all presented and discussed in lovely ways. We see how love can make it impossible to leave a situation, and yet how sometimes is not enough to make one stay. The family folklore here is that women tended to only stay long enough for their children to fend for themselves before flying away, but how that paradigm had shifted when our perspective character’s father had died too young. There’s some subtext about the roles in which we see ourselves and whether others will remember us in the way we want to be seen, or if we over-inflate our own importance in the lives of others. In other words, there’s a lot of food for thought here.“She said it was a sin to butcher an animal that you didn’t love first.”So why, when this is an interesting and philosophical story well crafted, did I not enjoy it more? It goes back to the unrelenting sadness I mentioned earlier. The mixture of maudlin and whimsical tones reminded me of The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which I love. But that story has moments of light relieving the dark. There were no such moments here. This made for a story that felt far too heavy, especially considering the brief page count. I was left feeling utterly bereft. If there was hope in these pages, it never rang true enough to me to make a lasting impression. “What’s the point of a thing? It doesn’t live or breathe or love. The only value we must keep close to our hearts is the living.”The Crane Husband is a creative, powerful new take on a familiar tale. Many people are going to absolutely love this story, and might even find a type of catharsis or healing in its pages. I am unfortunately not among that number, but I still respect what Barnhill crafted here. While this novella might not have landed well for me, I look forward to reading Barnhill’s middle grade work.All quotations were taken from an uncorrected proof and are subject to change upon the book’s official publication....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jan 17, 2023","Jan 17, 2023","Jan 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60784308-the-crane-husband

A specific plot line was left unresolved and I was desperate for answers. So when I finally had a copy of Hell Bent. in my hands, I was nervous that there was no way it could live up to my absurdly high expectations. But man, did Bardugo ever deliver. If possible, I loved this even more than I did its predecessor, which was one of my favorite reads of 2019. If Hell Bent isn’t on my list of favorites for 2023, I’ll be shocked.“Life is cruel. Magic is real. And I’m not ready to die.” Because so much of Hell Bent’s narrative is tied to that open-ended secondary plot line from Ninth House, I won’t be discussing specifics of the story itself. Instead, I want to focus primarily on the characters. From the beginning of Ninth House to the end of Hell Bent, Alex Stern has grown tremendously. While still a heroine with a “bruised heart and bleeding knuckles” as Joe Hill so eloquently described her, that heart is beginning to heal even as her knuckles are callousing over. There is a lot she still has to face down and deal with, both internally and externally, but she’s getting better and better at not supressing the emotions that comes with those showdowns. Her past may be catching up with her, but she no longer feels as though she has to face it alone. She’s built a bit of a reluctant found family for herself. This supporting cast of characters has also grown and changed significantly, specifically Dawes and Turner. I’ve grown to truly love every member of this motley crew, down to the Lethe house of Il Bastone, which has a personality all its own. “And what tools did Alex have? A little magic. A talent for misfortune. The ability to take a beating. It would have to be enough. 'This is my home,' she vowed, and nothing will take it from me.”Like Ninth House, a mystery propels the plot of this story. But where Ninth House is a murder mystery at its heart, Hell Bent is a puzzle box. Which was incredibly apt, as demons are core to the story being told, and demons in Bardugo’s world are obsessed with puzzles. I love this world that is exactly like ours with a dark, supernatural twist, and I love that the setting is such a solid part of the story, to the extent that it’s basically its own character. There is also a ritual that, as it was being planned, reminded me of a heist story in the best way. This part of the story elicited the same feelings as the heist portions of Mistborn and The Lies of Locke Lamora.“Stories exist in all worlds. They are immutable. Like gold.” The way Bardugo blends genres here is incredibly satisfying. The Alex Stern novels are dark academia, but they are also mysteries, supernatural thrillers, and urban fantasy. In fact, I’d venture to say that this series could scratch the same itch as Dresden and Mercy Thompson and other urban fantasy series of the like while also delivering more complex stories with greater substance. (Side note: This is nothing at all against Dresden or Mercy Thompson. I love and appreciate both. But the Alex Stern novels thus far strike me as a bit meatier.) And with how Bardugo is choosing to end these novels, with a wrapped up central plot combined with an open-ended secondary plot paving the way for the next installment, I can see a lot of readers who love episodic series like Dresden coming to adore this series, as well. I’m already among them.“That was the problem with love. It was hard to unlearn, no matter how harsh the lesson.”Hell Bent is a brilliant, well balanced, tense, thoughtful, perfectly paced follow up to Ninth House. This is exactly what I have always wanted from both dark academia and urban fantasy, though I’ve never been able to properly verbalize that desire. The fact that both are beautifully packaged in the same story is more than I ever could have hoped for. These books are dark and dense (though never slow, in my opinion) and they’re not going to be for everyone. But I feel like they were written just for me. And isn’t that exactly how the best stories make you feel?...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jan 16, 2023","Jan 20, 2023","Jan 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60652997-hell-bent

She is a commoner living on a backwater island. When the man she loves is taken from her, she decides to find him, and along the way we see Tress grow from ordinary girl into extraordinary woman.Sanderson said that he was inspired while watching The Princess Bride with his family to ask the question “What… if Buttercup had gone searching for Wesley, instead of immediately giving him up for dead?” I can not think of a better premise, and he answered that question wonderfully well in Tress’s story. I love the idea of subverting the damsel-in-distress and the knight-in-shining-armor tropes in this way. While I loved the premise of this story, what immediately won me over was the tone. I’ve grown to love Hoid as a storyteller whenever he spins a tale in the Stormlight Archives or other Cosmere works, but this is the first full-length novel we’ve gotten told entirely in his voice. And what a perfect voice it was for this type of story. One of the things that makes The Princess Bride so special is the balance of sweetness and snark in the narration, as well as the innate humor of the nearly omniscient narrator. Sanderson captured that beautifully hear. The humorous fairytale tone was my favorite aspect of the entire novel.An area where I believe Sanderson really excels is in his characters, and Tress of the Emerald Sea is no exception. Tress herself is an incredible character, driven but level-headed, brave but by no means fearless. I loved her growth in this book, and seeing her really find herself and come into her own. But the supporting cast was also amazing, especially Fort and Salay and Ann. The found family woven together by this pirate crew is one of my favorites I’ve come across in a long while. And then there are the Cosmere tie-ins. Not only did we get an introduction to another planet in the Cosmere and the beginnings of some explanations about aether, we also got characters from various Cosmere worlds with which Sanderson fans are already familiair. These appearances thrilled me, and I thoroughly enjoyed the call-backs to stories I already love. There were a couple of small issues that kept this book from being a full 5 star read for me, but they are very subjective. (Update: after thinking about this book all month, I decided it was a full 5 star read. I see where I was coming from, but I just love it.) Firstly, there’s a reveal at the end that I feel most readers will have figured out well before the 100 page mark, and the fact that it was surprising to our main character in any way made me exasperated with her. Which she very much didn’t deserve, as she didn’t have a nearly omniscient narrator dropping hints to her as the readers have. This was my biggest gripe, though I understand why Sanderson chose to write the story that way. I thoroughly enjoyed Tress of the Emerald Sea, and I will absolutely be reading it again. I can’t wait to get my hands on the physical copy, as the art throughout the book was beautiful, even in the digital form. This definitely deserves to be shelved alongside The Princess Bride and Neil Gaiman’s Stardust. I think it would make a brilliant movie in the vein, as well, nestling in beside those aforementioned predecessors. It’s a story for all ages, one that I could even see becoming a family read-aloud in the future for Sanderson fans, a way they could begin sharing their love for the Cosmere with the readers they raise....more",Notes are private!,2,40,1,Jan 2023,"Jan 04, 2023","Jan 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60531406-tress-of-the-emerald-sea

Roza Vallo, the reigning queen of the horror genre has invited five talented young women who aspire to be Roza’s protégés into her infamous mansion, Blackbriar, for a month-long writing retreat. While there, each woman will have to start a completely new novel and write 3,000 words per day in order to stay in the competition they walked into without even knowing it existed. Because this retreat is more than just an opportunity for Roza to critique their work; she has promised a 7-figure publishing contract and a book tour with herself to whichever of the five pens and completes the best novel in their month together. The pressure is on, and the claws are coming out.Alex, our perspective character, is thrilled to have this chance with her favorite author. However, her problems are two-fold. First, her ex-best friend, Wren, with whom she had a huge falling out, is also one of the five women at the retreat. Second, Alex has suffered from severe writer’s block for the year since her terrible parting with Wren. If she wants to stay, she’s going to have to overcome both of these obstacles. And fast. I found the premise and setting of this story fascinating. There were twists that I didn’t see coming, and the back half of the novel was propulsive and fairly well paced. However, these successes were undermined by unlikable characters and very weak dialogue. I didn’t find a single character with whom I could form any type of attachment, Roza and Alex included. The dialogue was severely lacking in comparison with the rest of the prose. Conversations in the book felt stilted, stages, and just not true to life in any way. The rest of the narrative was fine, but the dialogue often threw me out of the story. I also found the front half of the story a bit plodding.The Writing Retreat is a story that is going to appeal to a wide swath of readers. I can see this being on the “Best Of” lists at the end of the year, especially in the thriller category. This is a brilliantly feminist story that would pass the Bechdel test with flying colors, and it straddles the line between thriller and horror, real and supernatural, in really fun ways. A lot of people are going to love this book.

I was blown away by the craftsmanship of that story, by the depth of character development and the strong sense of place. To say that I had high hopes for Towles’s newest work, The Lincoln Highway, would be an understatement. Unfortunately, those hopes and expectations weren’t met. While this is still a story with brilliantly developed characters and strong writing, it simply didn’t live up to A Gentleman in Moscow, in my opinion.This is the story of Emmett Watson, a young man who has been released from the Salina juvenile work farm a few months early due to a combination of good behavior and the death of his father. Now orphaned, Emmett must take up the care of his brother, Billy, and the two decide to make a fresh start since the bank has foreclosed on the family farm. They plan to follow the Lincoln Highway from Nebraska to San Francisco. But their plans are derailed by Duchess and Woolly, two of Emmett’s roommates from Salina. All four boys are in for a wild, unforgettable adventure.The characterization here is brilliant. All four of the main characters are impeccably well drawn and sympathetic to varying degrees, as are the various side characters we meet. Unfortunately, the two boys in whose heads we spend the most time, and around whose actions the plot relies the most heavily, were my least favorites. Emmett and Duchess are something of foils of one another, and both had traits that appealed to me. But by the end of the novel I was tired of both, and found myself wanting to skim through their points of view in order to get back to Woolly or Billy or even some of the side characters. The plot of this book felt lacking in comparison to its size. This is a nearly 600 page story that could have been cut down by at least 150 pages. A Gentleman in Moscow was slow, but the speed there made sense. We were spending years with a man who had been sentenced to live out the rest of his life in a hotel. But here, the entirety of the book takes place over the course of 9 days, spanning from Nebraska to New York. There’s no reason this should have felt as plodding or bloated as it did. The writing and the characters saved it. There were some scenes that were compelling, but there was a lot of filler in between them. And then there was the resolution. Which, honestly, I kind of hated. This was a 4 star book before the ending, which for me knocked half a star off of that rating. I get what Towles was trying to convey. And I think he succeeded. But I found his choices incredibly unsatisfying after spending so much time with this story. The ending was very in keeping with literary fiction, I suppose.While I have many complaints, there were still things I loved about this book. Some very profound observations were made in refreshingly simple ways through the eyes and inner thoughts of certain characters, specifically Woolly and Sally. And the relationship between Billy and Ulysses, both of whom I loved every time they stepped onto the page, was lovely, as was Billy’s attachment to his favorite book. I loved how much said book actually helped propel the plot. There were parallels between certain characters that were fascinating and thought-provoking. I just wish the book had been shorter and more tightly plotted.

I love the core of the story here: a dad challenges himself and his 4th grade daughter to a 100 day streak of reading together every night without missing a day. They actually stretched The Streak into 3,218 days, from that day in 4th grade until Alice left for college. This is such a unique bond, and I love the idea of a father/daughter relationship being dominated and defined by this shared love of books.However, the writing here, specifically the dialogue, really threw me off. Alice wrote this memoir of The Streak in her early 20s, so we’re getting this relationship from her perspective. Which is absolutely fine. But the dialogue felt overly precious, to the point where it almost rang false. I don’t know Alice or her dad, obviously; it’s quite possible that they actually do talk like this. But I found the cutesy-ness of it, for lack of a better descriptor, overly saccharine to the point of unbelievability, and it made it very hard for me to feel connected to the story. Whatever my qualms with it may be, there is a wonderful message tucked into this memoir, and that is that we should share with others what matters to us, and that books should be at the top of that list. There are some sweet little pledges in the back that I found heartwarming, and that definitely made me yearn to sit down and read to the kids in my life.

Not enough peace. 2 stars.”Alas, I can’t leave it there. I respect any novel that has stood the test of time to become a classic. And War and Peace is one of the first classics that comes to mind when you hear the term. It’s the literary Everest that many readers attempt to scale sometime within their lifetime. I’m glad to be able to say that I’ve conquered it, though it took me nearly a year to do so. However, I can’t say that I got very much out of it.I’ve read many classics that I’ve absolutely loved. Some of them nearly life-changing. Frankenstein. Jane Eyre. A Little Princess. Mere Christianity. Anne of Green Gables. The Scarlet Pimpernel. A Christmas Carol. Murder on the Orient Express. The Picture of Dorian Gray. A Study in Scarlet. The Count of Monte Cristo. Les Miserables. But War and Peace will not joining those ranks. If I were to describe this book in one word, that word would be self-indulgent. The story would have been far more powerful if it had been condensed considerably, in my opinion.The peacetime portions of the story, those following specific characters and their relationships, was fairly interesting. I did grow to care about many of this over the course of this insanely long book. The time we spent with them outside of the war could feel almost like Austen or Wharton or some such, though with admittedly less humor and style. However, these peacetime portions comprised maybe a quarter of the total story. The rest of dedicated to war.I actually don’t mind reading about warfare. Some of my favorite authors write absolutely phenomenal battle scenes. However, War and Peace had more to do with the campaign than any actual fighting. When it comes to the politics of war, a peak behind the curtain might be interesting, but an extended stay is exceptionally tedious. I feel like I spent a decade behind the curtain. I hope I never again read a book where the epilogue itself is a solid hundred pages, comprised of two parts and nearly thirty chapters. And the second part of said epilogue was a philosophical treatise on how war comes to be, and how we relate it for future generations. This was the worst portion of the book for me personally, because it was exceptionally boring and yet so close to being over. I’m glad that I didn’t give up, but mostly just because I respect myself for sticking with it.

First and foremost, it’s historical fiction, set in 1717 Venice. The lush, clever writing invites readers to place it in the literary fiction camp, while the darkly romantic tone and tension house it firmly in gothic fiction, which blends with the more fantastical elements to tip it into magical realism or even fantasy territory and, since much of this dark story takes place in a school setting, dark academia could be included for good measure. All of this could have made for a muddled story, and it did in a few instances. But overall, this is a story unlike anything else I’ve ever read.There’s an elegance to this story because of the beautiful, unusual setting. However, one of my favorite elements of the book was that Venice was not simply the setting, but an actual character in her own right. And a deeply disturbing one, at that. All of the fantastical elements of the story were based around this idea of Venice having a life and mind of her own, and I found that aspect of the story absolutely fascinating. This is, at its core, a story of obsession. Luisa is obsessed with music, and wants nothing more than to be the best violinist in Venice, but her nerves get in the way. She’s an orphan, valued only for her musical talent at the Pieta she calls home. She has never quite fit in, and longs to belong to someone. Then she meets Maddalena, the daughter of a noble family sent to the Pieta to study music and improve her marriage prospects after scandal strikes. Maddalena is obsessed as well, but not with music; it’s Luisa who consumes her heart and mind. The friendship between the two borders on the romantic, which is completely impermissible at the Pieta. We see obsession close in on madness. We see deals struck for selfish gain. We see romance blossom and backs stabbed. It’s a fascinating, if dark, look into a society and time I know little about. I felt that the narrative unraveled a bit toward the end, and lost itself a couple of times earlier in the story, but I was always interested enough to continue reading.

However, there were a number of literary references and something to the writing that still led me to believe that this is an adult novel instead of a middle grade one. There are a lot of Dickens references, great and small. As this book was written in part to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Dickens’ death, that makes total sense. But The Wizard of Oz was also obviously a great source of inspiration for the plot itself. There are also multiple nods to Lewis’s Narnia, which I found delightful. These tips of the hat to tales that I’m so familiar with and have loved for so much of my life were definitely my favorite element of the book.While I loved the tone and the references, I had a couple of qualms with this book. The characters were entertaining, but all of them, even Dhikilo, felt like they had they little depth. Every character felt like a mere prop to the story Faber wanted to tell instead of their own independent personage. I was also disappointed by the resolution. Even though it was the ending the story needed, the way Faber got us there felt like a cop out in some way. There was this big build up and then… nothing. The end just happened. It was a bit of a let down, at least for me personally. D: A Tale of Two Worlds is not a perfect book, but it is a fun one. Quirky is the best description I can think of to give it. This is a story that could be enjoyed by anyone of any age. If you have some familiarity with the works of Dickens, so much the better, as you will pick up on a lot of little nods and references. But if you don’t, that won’t at all hinder your enjoyment of the book. I might have been disappointed in how the ending was handled, but it was as happy a resolution as could be hoped for. If you want something unique and cozy that you know will end well, pick this one up....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 13, 2022","Dec 20, 2022","Dec 13, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43811184-d

It imagines a world much like ours, but where faeries have actually been proven to exist. There’s a Victorian charm to the tone and setting that were wonderfully cozy. While the story got off to a bit of a slow start and took a little while to win me over, I ended up finding it delightful.Emily Wilde is determined to be the first scholar to publish an encyclopaedia of faeries, accounting for all of the disparate types that have been experienced by herself and others. She plans to finish it on a research excursion to the frozen north, which she will find inhospitable in more ways than one. Will her dogged perseverance be enough? And when her co-worker/rival/reluctant friend Wendell Bambleby shows up to her frigid, miserable cabin unannounced, will she accept his help or cling stubbornly to her solitude?One of my favorite elements of this novel was the characters. Emily’s voice and the tone of the writing remind me of the Veronica Speedwell series. However, Emily is far more erudite and awkward and antisocial. To be frank, she is a bit of a curmudgeon, though an incredibly intelligent one. I found her absolutely, and unintentionally on her end, charming once I got to know her. Wendell Bambleby is remarkably similar to Howl Pendragon from Diana Wynne Jones’ Howl’s Moving Castle. He is flamboyant, entitled, charming, rude, easily depressed, and very high maintenance. I love him. I also really appreciate how he grew and deepened as the story progressed from something approaching a caricature into an engaging and sympathetic character in his own right. The rest of the secondary cast was also varied and engaging. A wonderful found family develops from them that I found utterly heartwarming. That’s one of my very favorite tropes, and it was done wonderfully in this book.I also very much enjoyed Fawcett’s approach to the various types of faeries. These came across as very classic, in the sense that I was reminded much more of original fairy tales than I was of something like A Court of Thorns and Roses. The use of this more Brothers Grimm or Andrew Lang iteration of fey managed to be both nostalgic and refreshing. These were faeries in wild variety, but they all shared in common a complete lack of any commonality with humanity, as well as a lack of understanding and regard for any in the mortal world. These beings see humans as tools or toys, and nothing more. There was one obvious exception to this rule, but mentioning it specifically would most definitely spoil the story. Regardless, this chasm between human and fey explains how and why mankind has a desire to study and catalogue these immortals.I’m very glad that I picked up Emily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Faeries when I did, and that I stuck with it even though it took a little while to draw me in completely. This was a cozy fantasy story that still had some very high stakes. There was a touch of romance here, but nothing at all descriptive. The cast of characters was fun and varied and came together to form a lovely found family. And the world building around the faeries was fascinating. I very highly recommend this book, especially if you’re looking for a cozy winter read with humor and fantastical elements....more",Notes are private!,1,12,1,"Dec 13, 2022","Dec 20, 2022","Dec 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60657589-emily-wilde-s-encyclopaedia-of-faeries

ThI love the idea of taking a classic character and allowing a plethora of talented authors to revisit said character and breathe new life into them. The variety that can be given to this character when others are allowed access to their voice, the depth that can be added to an already loved fictional entity, is astounded. Yes, such collections can go horribly wrong and can adversely affect the character in the minds of readers if handled improperly, so there’s always a danger in allowing this kind of artistic freedom. But when they’re successful, they revitalize an already beloved figure. And that’s what thankfully occurred in this collection. Here we have twelve remarkably talented authors riffing on one of the mystery genre’s most dearly loved amateur detective, Miss Jane Marple. I enjoyed most all of these stories; even those I didn’t absolutely love still weren’t bad. Below are micro-s for each story, along with a few notes regarding the audio version, which I was given through Libro.fm’s influencer program. I’m not sure I would have enjoyed this collection quite as much had I not tandem read the audiobook with the ebook, as I thoroughly enjoyed all of the narrators attached to the project.“Evil in Small Places” by Lucy Foley (read by Alex Kingston): 4.5 starsLoved this one. Tightly plotted and unexpected. However, it did use the dreaded cliche of a line: “she let out the breath she didn’t realize she was holding.” Which immediately took me out of the story. But I came right back into it, so little harm done there. Christie would have been proud of this one. And Kingston did a brilliant job with the narration.“The Second Murder at the Vicarage” by Val McDermid (read by Adrian Scarborough): 3.5 starsI really enjoyed revisiting the scene and characters of The Murder at the Vicarage. I don’t think the story would have been nearly as fun without that prior knowledge. However, the case felt rushed, and the solution wasn’t one that could have been come to without being told, as Christie stories are meant to be. Scarborough’s narration brought the characters to life, though, so I added half a star to the rating.“Miss Marple Takes Manhattan” by Alyssa Cole (read by Adjoa Andoh): 5 starsThe voice in this one was so much fun. We’re actually inside Miss Marple’s mind instead of simply observing her, and I loved the internalized snark. I’ve not read enough of Christie’s Marple stories to know if this tone was accurate, but it felt very likely and authentic to me.“The Unravelling” by Natalie Haynes (read by Imogen Stubbs): 3.5 starsWe start in the midst of the story, which made it a bit difficult to follow. That being said, there’s a depth to the story and an elegance to the writing that elevated it. And, of course, it related back to mythology in a way. This is, after all, Natalie Haynes. I’ve never read her work, but I own multiple books my her. Based on her craftsmanship here, those books just became a priority.“Miss Marple’s Christmas” by Ruth Ware (read by Alison Steadman): 3.5 starsThis story felt very classic, especially with the holiday setting. However, I found it too predictable and easy to solve to be convincingly Christie. The tone and the writing, however, were very on point. As odd as it sounds, whodunits like this that are set around Christmas feel incredibly cozy to me, so I’m glad this was part of the collection.“The Open Mind” by Naomi Alderman (read by Jodhi May): 2.5 starsI like this story more in theory than in execution. I found it oddly dark for a Marple story, with the proported sexual assault and drug use. It also came across as weirdly moralizing, which was a turn-off. The culprit was also easy to predict, as their behavior would have made no sense otherwise. “The Jade Empress” by Jean Kwok (read by Chipo Chung): 4.5 starsWhile this story took a little bit to grow on me, but I ended up really appreciating it. The encapsulating cruise setting is always a good one, as the killer can’t escape immediately after committing the murder. The subtext of racism gave additional depth to the story. There was something achingly heartfelt about this one.“A Deadly Wedding Day” by Dreda Say Mitchell (read by Cathy Tyson): 5 starsFascinated and poetic. I was surprised by the complexity of this one. And I wasn’t able to predict the resolution, which is always refreshing. The addition of a secondary lady detective at Miss Marple’s side was fun, as well. This one was one of my favorites!“Murder at the Villa Rosa” by Elly Griffiths (read by Ramon Tikaram): 4 starsHighly unusual, but interesting and compelling. Miss Marple was barely present, so I’m not sure how much of a Miss Marple story it was, but it was still a fun story. There was something about the tone that reminded me of Poe in the very beginning, but that shifted as we got further into the story. While odd, I enjoyed this one.“The Murdering Sort” by Karen M. McManus (read by Tanya Reynolds): 4 starsI got strong Knives Out vibes from this one. The family dynamics, as well as the murder committed, were very similar in tone and execution. There was a sweetness to the relationship between Miss Marple and her great-niece that I really appreciated, as well.“The Mystery of the Acid Soil” by Kate Mosse (read by Celia Imrie): 4.5 starsAn incredibly solid story. It felt very in keeping with both Christie’s style and Marple’s character. I love that the solution to the mystery revolved around Miss Marple’s knowledge of gardening. I had no problem guessing the crimes and the resolution, but I still enjoyed the journey to get there.“The Disappearance” by Leigh Bardugo (read by Miriam Margolyes): 5 starsI love that this showed a bit of a different side of Jane Marple. There was a maudlin air to it that felt appropriate somehow, and I didn’t find the resolution easy to predict. I found it one of the stronger stories in the collection, which surprised me for some reason. I wasn’t expecting such a tight mystery in this tone from Bardugo.I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this collection, and I can see myself rereading it in the future. Short stories in the mystery genre weren’t something I had much prior experience with outside of Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes short stories, but I loved having mysteries packed into such a tight, brief package. Short-form mystery is something I’m going to have to seek out more of in the future. While I would recommend reading The Murder at the Vicarage before diving into this collection, no other prior knowledge of Christie’s beloved character is needed.

I knew she was a beloved character, but this was my first experience with the fabulously observant spinster. And I have to say that I absolutely understand her following. Jane Marple is a delight, and following her keen mind was wonderfully rewarding, even if the rest of the story was a bit forgettable.St. Mary Mead is one of the quaintest and coziest settings I’ve ever come across in fiction, and I can see where it has been an influence to many in the mystery genre. I was immediately reminded of Anthony Horowitz’s Saxby-on-Avon, which was obviously and lovingly inspired by St. Mary Mead. This sleepy little English village is rocked when a murder occurs at, you guessed it, the local vicarage. The vicar (and our narrator), Leonard Clement, was away from home when said murder occurred. Colonel Protheroe, a local magistrate disliked by many, is the deceased in question and had been waiting for the vicar to return home. It turns out that nearly everyone in the village had reason to want Protheroe dead, but who is truly responsible? That is what Miss Marple aims to find out.This is a very eclectic, often charming cast of characters, and I very much enjoyed getting to know them. I found the characters, the setting, and the writing all incredibly cozy, which is one of the things I love most about Christie's mysteries. However, the case itself in this one felt just a bit lackluster to me. Not that Christie didn’t handle it with her usual aplomb; it was cleverly handled and nearly impossible to predict.

While very cute, it doesn’t do justice to the story it contains, conveying something similar in feel to a rom-com instead of what the cover truly hides, which is an empowering historical fiction novel that is by turns heart-wrenching and hilarious. And always, always, so smart. This is a feminist manifesto of the highest, most egalitarian caliber, while also telling a wonderfully compelling story with even more compelling characters.When we meet Elizabeth Zott in 1961, she is a single mother and the host of the cooking show that has taken America by storm. She’s incredibly famous, and she hates every single minute of it. You see, Elizabeth is not a television personality; she’s a chemist, and she hates where she’s ended up. From there, we journey a few years into her past and she how she ended up a household name, largely against her will. We witness her rise and fall in the male-dominated scientific world of the 1950s, as she does her best to stand against the patriarchy and sexism that define every layer of America at that time. She will not be silenced. She will not be shoved into a corner. She is more than her looks or her sex. She is a scientist, and she will stop at nothing to have herself and her work taken seriously.So how did such a staunchly independent, career-minded woman end up as a single mother in a time when pregnancy was the death sentence to any woman’s career? That’s one of the main driving forces of the book. Where Elizabeth could have been bitter toward the child who cost her so much, she was incredibly loving instead. I was shocked by how wonderful a mother she turned out to be, but I shouldn’t have been. The even larger narrative of this book is that women contain multitudes, and are so much more capable than they were viewed in Elizabeth’s era or any time period before or since.While Elizabeth might have felt trapped or resentful of her unexpected culinary career in the limelight, she definitely made the most of it. She never gave in to the pressures to look or act in any way that wasn’t true to herself. Which meant that her cooking show was far more scientific in nature than anything the public had ever experienced. Instead of being found boring, Elizabeth’s approach sparked something of a cultural revolution. Aside from Elizabeth, who was a phenomenal lead, we had a plethora of other fun and well fleshed-out characters. Mad, Elizabeth’s daughter, was a precocious delight, obsessed with subjects far outside the realm of what was considered “normal” for little girls. Harriet, Elizabeth’s neighbor and eventual best friend, was blunt and loving and longed to be loved in return. She was a tremendous help to Elizabeth, and I loved her for it. And then there was 6:30, Elizabeth’s dog and my absolute favorite character. I love animal companions, especially when we get inside their minds. 6:30 is a wonderful example of that. He’s an incredibly intelligent dog, and I loved getting his thoughts and views on what was happening in Elizabeth’s life.Various aspects of this novel, the time period and the women in scientific fields, battling against the patriarchy to have their contributions recognized, reminded me of two other works. Namely, Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly, and These Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal. So if you’ve read those and are looking for something to scratch a similar itch, I highly recommend Lessons in Chemistry. While I really liked the other two aforementioned books, Lessons in Chemistry surpassed them in ways. At least, in my opinion.

How did he process everything he had experienced? What happened on Rahkat after he was finally able to return home? Children of God delivered those answers and more. However, I found it more difficult to engage with than its predecessor. My biggest complaint about The Sparrow was the pacing. While an undeniably compelling story, it moved incredibly slowly. That was doubly true of Children of God. It was even slower-paced. Weirdly so. Things were happening, but the pacing felt like wading through molasses. I was tempted multiple times to just put it down and see if I could find answers through SparkNotes or something. I wanted to know how things turned out, but I really struggled to get there. The writing was still excellent. There were so many profound, thought-provoking passages that there was no way to save them all without highlighting entire pages of text. But this philosophical bent, mixed with the maddeningly slow pacing, resulted in me reading this almost more along the lines of a religious set than a novel, which was a disservice to the story being told. There were still compelling characters and a fascinating world and high stakes here, but I didn’t connect with any of these aspects as deeply as I would have liked.After finally muscling my way through the story, I found myself oddly unsatisfied with the conclusion. While I think it wrapped up well, it lacked the emotional impact and payoff that I craved after having witnessed so much trauma and occasional outright cruelty suffered by the characters. That much pain felt as if it justified a more profound and impactful resolution.While I might have focussed the majority of this  on my problems with the book, I did still find the reading of it a mostly positive experience. I struggled, but I’m still very glad that I read it. The answers I sought were here, even if I had to wade through even more suffering to find them. I love the questions raised about God in this duology, and the fact that we’re not fed any specific view or answers.

The prologue of this book, comprised of the first ten pages, is one of the most powerful and moving essays I’ve ever read. Even before the story itself had begun, I understood how profoundly important this book was, and I completely understood why it was so lauded and both nominee and winner of such a variety of awards.This story follows twelve disparate prospective characters who all have one thing in common: they are all heading to the Big Oakland Powwow. Whether they know much about their heritage or not, whatever their interest level in it might be, this gathering and shared identity are what bind them. I found all of the characters interesting, though I think this would have been a stronger story with half as many minds to jump between. But that’s personal preference. They were all very believable and varied and well written. However, I have to confess that I found the front half stronger than the back half. While I understand what Orange was going for once our massive cast of prospective characters finally all met at the powwow around which the story revolved, I found it tedious to read. I also find the ambiguous literary ending decision to be hit or miss and, in this case, I felt that it was a miss.

Even the books she puts out that I find a bit forgettable, I still enjoy reading them. But Identity is one of her best in quite a while. I was deeply invested and on the edge of my seat. While I would categorize most of her work as romance, in more recent years she has shifted to mysteries or thrillers of fantasy or family dramas with a romantic subplot. Identity is a perfect example of this, focusing more on the identity theft and suspense elements, as well as the importance of family and putting down roots, for the majority of the book. That’s not to say that the romance wasn’t there and important; it was on both counts, and it was a wonderful romance with a love interest I really enjoyed. I found this book really satisfying on just about every level. The ending felt slightly rushed and slightly tidy, but happily endings often do. Morgan is a wonderful main character, a strong woman with goals who wants more than anything to finally put down roots. When her life is upended and she has to move in with her mother and grandmother, she finds those roots where she never even thought to look for them. Morgan is a bartender, and is passionate about her work. One thing I love about Nora is how she gives all of her characters a passion for their profession, and she does so in a way that makes me interested in those professions. I would have never thought I’d find bartending kind of fascinating, but I did. The emphasis on family businesses and community also captivated me, as it always does in her work.My favorite element of this book was the emphasis on family. I loved seeing three generations of women bonded so closely. As an aside, I read Identity at the same time as my mother and grandmother were reading it, which added to all of our enjoyment. And we all mutually found the antagonist absolutely terrifying. The combination of charm and psychopathy brought to mind Ted Bundy. And said character’s devolution throughout the story was convincingly disturbing. And identity theft seems darker, real, and even scarier to me now.I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading Identity. It’s one of my favorite books from Nora in recent years, which is saying a lot as I’ve dearly loved some of her newest standalone novels. If you’re looking for a suspenseful story about an interesting topic, with lovable characters and an emphasis on family and community and careers that inspire passion, as well as a really fun romance, then look no farther.

It sounds exactly up my alley. Speculative fiction of any sort with religion at its center always appeals to me. But something about the premise of this both drew me in and repelled me in equal measures. It sounded fascinating, yes, but it also sounded heavy and devastating and tough. And to be honest, I just haven’t been in the right mindset for something that weighty in the past few years. I’ve read plenty of dense and dark, plenty that made me think deeply. But it’s been a hard few years where my faith has been my solace, and I didn’t feel comfortable having that source of solace so ruthlessly examined when I was already so raw. But I decided that I was finally ready, and I’m very glad I did. I was correct; this book was more than tough, it was occasionally torturous. There were times I had to step away from the story for days at a time and read something, anything else, because I was so upset by Emilio’s story and experiences. But it was a very rewarding read. I feel stronger in my faith for having held it under such intense scrutiny alongside Emilio, as he relived that which no one else could imagine, because no one else had survived. The most basic premise is this: Intelligent life outside of our planet has been verified through our picking up of musical transmissions from the Alpha Centuri system. But instead of first contact being made by scientists or some kind of interplanetary delegation representing Earth’s political powerhouses, the Jesuits sent a crew as ambassadors from Christ. We know from the very beginning that, of the 8 original crew members who embarked, only one returned alive. And that one, a priest named Emilio Sandoz, is incredibly broken in mind, body, and spirit. As the Jesuit Society begins to slowly and painfully extract the truth from Emilio, we see exactly what highs he experiences and to what incredulous lows he was sentenced. In the midst of all of this, the loss of the family he had built for himself, the horrid suffering and the hateful misunderstanding of his fellow man when he returned alone but alive, where was God? That is the central question of the book, and it’s one that Emilio struggles with desperately.There are no easy answers here, no neat bow tying up the story at the end of the book. Russell did a phenomenal job of balance the triumph and the tragedy, the belief and the pain and the loss, in such a way that her own personal worldview never took centerstage. Instead, the questions she presented were open-ended and unflinching. If Emilio had embarked on this mission under the prompting of God, leading everyone he loved to so violent an end, then what God could be so cruel and why should He be worshipped? But if God had not ordained all of this suffering, then how could Emilio continue to exist under the weight of blame he must shoulder alone? These are intense questions that we, alongside Emilio, do not find answered at the end of The Sparrow. But my hope is that some of these, at least, will be answered in the sequel, Children of God. Which I began reading as soon as I closed The Sparrow.Outside of the intense religious and philosophical questions raised by the book, there was also a fantastic world full of fascinating beings. They were very original in ways, but I was reminded of Wells’ The Time Machine in others. Which I won’t go into for fear of spoiling the book. Suffice it to say that I was never bored when we finally reached Rahkat. The writing was also incredible. While I found the pacing maddeningly slow at times, especially in the first half of the book, the prose was always beautiful. Russell has a serious way with dialogue that made these characters, especially those comprising this found family of space-traveling missionaries, feel like real people. I grew incredibly attached, even knowing how things would end.The Sparrow is a brilliant novel. It’s not perfect; there are some definite pacing issues, at least in my opinion. And while I did appreciate the questions raised, the weight of them was often tough to stomach. But the ideas and the writing and the characters, and those questions that I struggled with so much, are all exceptional, and exceptionally well executed. I’m both excited and filled with trepidation to see how Emilio’s story wraps up in Children of God. Hopefully there are answers and peace waiting there, in the ruins....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Nov 10, 2022","Nov 25, 2022","Nov 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/334176.The_Sparrow

I knew the band, as most do, for their song “Come and Get Your Love,” featured in the first Guardians of the Galaxy film. With this resurgence came an opportunity for the band’s fascinating story to be told, and I find it very interesting that a comic format was chosen for such weighty material. It’s a story well balanced and well told, and I think this was the perfect medium through which to share that story with the world.Redbone was the first all American Indian rock and roll band. Their founding members, brothers Pat and Lolly Vegas, passed as Mexican for years when they first entered the music scene. In the 60s they shared a stage with acts like Sonny and Cher, The Doors, and Jimi Hendrix, the latter of whom helped plant the idea of an all Native band in their minds. The band experienced a good bit of popularity in the 1970s, especially in Europe. They songs were often viewed as “too political” in the US, unfortunately. But they rose to fame around the same time as the American Indian Movement (AIM) came into being, and they did their very best to lend their name and music and support to the movement in whatever ways they could. I learned so much about very aspects of Native life that I knew a bit about, but not nearly enough. For instance, I learned how late into the 20th century forced assimilation boarding schools were still heavily in operation. I learned more about Wounded Knee, and it blows my mind that such horrendous treatment was not only still ongoing at that time, but still exists today. I feel like a much more informed human being for having read this book.While this was incredibly informative, I do with the story had been plumbed a bit deeper, and that the art style had been a touch less abstract. But, while not my favorite graphic novel I’ve read, Redbone is one of the ones I have no doubt I will think back on the most.

Elatsoe, or Ellie to her friends and family, is a seventeen year-old Lipan Apache girl with a really cool ability: following in the footsteps of her ancestors, she can call forth the dead. She most commonly utilizes this dangerous knowledge through the resurrection of her ghost dog, Kirby. He was her best friend in life, and that hasn’t changed since his passing. Ellie also has a human best friend, Jay, cheerleader and research extraordinaire. When death strikes Ellie’s family she, along with help from Jay and Kirby and lots of friends and family along the way, must solve the mystery of the murder before more of her family is endangered.Ellie was a delight of a character. She has a subtly sunny personality, optimistic without naivety. I loved her relationship with Kirby, and her easy friendship with Jay. Ellie is driven by a love of family, a thirsty mind, and a desire to prove herself, to herself most of all. She’s also asexual which meant, though she is seventeen in this story, the lack of romantic subplot gave said story a more middle-grade feel in terms of tone. Which I absolutely loved, because it allowed me to give my entire focus to the story and the characters. Ellie’s mind was a lovely place to be, and I very much enjoyed my time spent inside her head. I could easily read an entire series of books following her adventures.Throughout the book, we are given stories about Six-Great, Elatsoe’s ancestor. These were absolutely fascinating, and I loved how they tied into Ellie’s own story. They were a wonderful reminder to learn from the past. I also really loved how much I learned about the Lipan Apache people and their history. And yet this information was conveyed in such a way that it didn’t feel like I was learning, which is a difficult balance to strike. Elatsoe is a brilliant, fast-paced, fun-to-read mystery, with lots of heart and lovable characters and an emotional ending. I loved the way everything wrapped up.

I’ve heard nothing about this A Coin for the Ferryman, even though it was published in March of this year. I was intrigued by the title and the premise and requested the audiobook earlier this month, and started listening as soon as I was approved. While not a perfect book, it was a lot of fun!The premise here is kind of wacky: time travel has been privately discovered, and a tentative plan to build a team and “borrow” Julius Caesar from the moments before his death on this Ides of March. Because of the distance from the event, they’ll be able to host and interview Caesar over the course of 4 days before returning him to the exact moment from which he was extracted. The dream team to be compiled must include: a couple of engineers to run the technology, a doctor to ensure that Caesar doesn’t croak before his historically appointed death, and a couple of classicists with whom Caesar can actually converse. Because, you know, Latin. As luck would have it, the person best at conversational Latin happens to be a young, beautiful college student named Cassandra. In hopes that her beauty will draw Caesar in and that her grasp of the language will make him more compliant, she is drafted to become the final member of the team.I really like the story itself. However, the first half, over 250 pages of this book, is just the preparation for Caesar’s arrival. This felt like an excessive amount of build-up. The book is 540 pages, and I feel like it would have been a much stronger, tighter story if edited down to under 400 pages. It just felt unnecessarily bloated. Secondly, I feel like with a book of this length, the characters should have been more multifaceted. While I liked our main perspective character, Cassandra, she came across as almost flawless. The rest of the characters could almost seem like caricatures in various portions of the story. I didn’t find them unlikeable, per se, but they felt oddly flat for how long was spent laying out the details of each. I also found some of the interpersonal relationships unbelievable. Chemistry that was implied between various members of the cast felt a bit forced and unlikely. But again, the story itself was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the concept, and the appearance of Julius Caesar really spiced everything up. He was definitely the star of the show, along with Cassandra. There were some truly funny moments, and quite a few madcap scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. Even if there were a few things I didn’t love about the execution, I found the idea so wonderfully original that I would absolutely recommend it to others. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 05, 2022","Nov 15, 2022","Nov 05, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58485662-a-coin-for-the-ferryman

I originally loved A River Enchanted but had a few issues with it. But upon reading A Fire Endless, all of those issues have evaporated. I think this might be the closest thing to a perfect duology I’ve ever consumed. The balance hear is exquisite, the writing became more and more lyrically beautiful as the story progressed, and there’s just something to be said for a tale of hope and healing; those are woefully infrequent, and I was thrilled to find such a story within the pages of the Elements of Cadence duology.A Fire Endless picks up right where A River Enchanted left off. As this is the case and I don’t want to potentially spoil the first book, I’m not going to discuss any specifics of the plot. I will say instead that there was instant tension here on multiple fronts, as we pick up fro the climax of the first half of the story. I love how seamlessly Ross wove her story in these two books; they do truly feel like two halves of one longer story that couldn’t quite fit itself into one bound volume. Even considering the aforementioned tension, and the increasingly high stakes, there’s something wonderfully cozy and wholesome about the world Ross crafted within the isle of Cadence. It might be broken, but the potential it carries shines incredibly brightly. The characters who grew on me so slowly in A River Enchanted had my whole heart in A Fire Endless. Jack and Adaira, Torin and Sidra, Mirin and Frae and others we are introduced to in this second installment, are all wonderful, imperfect characters who I loved rooting for. Our story fractured into various plot-lines here, but I was equally invested in all of them. I love when a story with shifting points of view can accomplish this level of readerly investment across the board, where there’s no temptation to skin through one point of view so the reader can get back to the perspective that interests them most. Just like the characters have grown on me, so have their relationships. There are multiple relationships here, but the two that are most core to the story are that of Jack and Adaira, and that of Torin and Sidra. Both are beautifully handled, and the growth of both couples from the beginning of the first book through this one is breathtaking. Scenes between the couples are a little less fade-to-black than they were in A River Enchanted, but they’re still very tasteful and far from graphic. These are not spicy romances, but they’re beautifully heartfelt one. The bedroom scenes here are less about the mechanics and more about the emotions involved.Speaking of romance, I feel like that word truly encapsulates the entirety of the duology. Not just in terms of the relationships themselves, but regarding the setting, and the magic, and the writing itself. The tone of the narrative is intensely romantic. Reading this made my heart hurt, but in the best way possible. Something about the loveliness of Ross’s craftsmanship and creativity made me yearn. The focus of this entire story is one of healing. Whether that is the healing of an individual’s physical body, the healing of romantic or familial relationships, the healing of the earth or the healing of a nation, every quest embarked upon is done with healing as treasure to be attained. I love how we see this in such a variety of ways in both the physical realm and the spiritual realm. And I still love so much how one of the ways healing comes here is through music. That resonates with me so strongly. There were certain scenes toward the end that made my heart ache, but in such a cathartic way. Ross wrapped up the story beautifully; there’s nothing I would change.A Fire Endless is an exquisitely lovely end to the Elements of Cadence duology. Ross’s writing is gorgeous, lyrically so, and I can’t wait to read more from her. If you’re looking for a lush, Celtic-inspired fantasy with elemental magic, heartfelt romance, an emphasis on music and a perfect balance struck between high stakes and a cozy setting, I can’t recommend this duology fervently enough. This is a story that I can’t wait to have on my physical shelves, so I can revisit it again and again.

One of the blurbs proclaimed it “a fresh, haunting take on dark academia,” while the publisher blurb claimed it is “an exhilarating, atmospheric campus thriller reminiscent of The Secret History.” I read those lines and was immediately sold. However, there’s nothing dark academia about this. There’s a murder on a college campus, yes, but that’s all it has in common with the subgenre, in my opinion. This is much more a mystery/police procedural with a campus setting than it is an actual campus novel. The comparisons to The Secret History feel wholly unfounded, as what made that book so special was the philosophy, the poetic writing, and the observations of one both inside a secret society and yet somehow on the periphery, as well as the inverted mystery where we know who did what from the beginning of the book and are endeavoring to learn the why. The Resemblance delivered none of that depth, none of those layers, and left me incredibly frustrated by the time I finally reached the end.This is the story of Detective Marlitt Kaplin, who is incredibly eager to prove herself to her sexist boss and, when a hit-and-run murder almost literally falls in her lap while she’s visiting her professor mother on the University of Georgia campus, she’ll do anything to keep her claws in the case. I found Marlitt so intensely unlikable and unsympathetic that my feelings for her nearly devolved into hatred by the story’s end. Even when she faced horrible situations, I could find no empathy for her. For someone so determined to solve a murder, she did everything possible to sabotage herself and the case. Inside her head was an insufferable, infuriating place to be. And while her hatred for fraternities might have been well founded, her handling of that hatred in light of her job was laughably poor. There are certain thrillers where you can see the “twists” coming from a mile off, and this was one of those for me. An oblivious perspective character (I can’t bear to call her a protagonist) who is supposed to be intelligent and good at her job completely missing clues that are glaringly obvious to the reader is always an exasperating experience, one that occurred time and again for me while reading this. I will say that there was one final reveal at the end of the book that I didn’t predict, but it also had nothing to do with the rest of the story, relating solely to our main character. I think this reveal was supposed to shine a light on the inner workings of her subconscious, but it felt like a cheap trick for shock value to me. If I were to describe this book in one word, it would be ""tired."" I felt like everything in this book had been done before. But better.The writing here was perfectly serviceable. There were a handful of instances of poetic, philosophical prose, but instead of adding to the story, they threw me out of it, as they in no way fit the story being told. It felt as if the author had thought of something pretty and profound and determined to shoehorn it in somewhere, regardless of how it distracted from the plot. These instances somehow felt both pretentious and clumsy, which is a really odd pairing. But other than the aforementioned handful of lines, the writing was good enough to keep me reading, in spite of my distaste.I ran through a gamut of emotions from the time I first started this book to the moment I finally finished it. I went from being excited, to feeling cautiously optimistic that things would improve, to viewing the book as the epitome of adequate, to being so frustrated that I was audibly groaning and rolling my eyes at every decision Merlitt made. In spite of how it was billed, I haven’t read a book less “right for me” in quite some time. HOWEVER, I would like to point out that I have a very love/hate, hit-or-miss relationship with thrillers. So, if you’re a lover of thrillers looking for something set on a college campus, The Resemblance just might be for you....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Nov 2022,"Nov 05, 2022","Nov 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808048-the-resemblance

I found it very interesting to follow her career from the very beginning, and to see how her style changed and solidified as she grew into her own voice. I’m not a huge fan of this type of blank free verse, as I tend to gravitate towards poetry with a meter and rhythm I can hear in my mind, but that’s a personal preference. Her work grew on me as I progressed further into her career. There were quite a few pieces in the final portion of this collection, The Triumph of Achilles, that I quite enjoyed. Some of these were “Baskets,” “The Reproach,” and “A Parable.” Something I’ve realized about myself as a reader of poetry is that I’ll always appreciate works that are retellings or inspired in some way by a myth or a folktale or an actual historical event, which I think is why this last book of poems in the collection resonated more with me than the first three. While I didn’t enjoy the entire collection as much as I had hoped to, I do very much respect Glück’s work, and it’s easy to see why she’s so lauded.

Whether it was the prose or the setting or the characters themselves, something about this book didn’t immediately grab me. But once I connected with it, I was all the way in. The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is one of the most fun pirate adventures I’ve ever embarked upon, and is hands-down the best I’ve read that is set in our own world.Amina is a middle-aged retired pirate captain who just wants to raise her daughter in peace. But when an offer she can’t refuse for a multitude of reasons quite literally barges through her front door, she finds herself getting the band back together for one last job. Throughout the book Amina struggles mightily with her sense of responsibility, to her daughter and her crew and her faith, and how those various responsibilities are often at odds. I found this struggle fascinating and compelling, and it lent Amina a lot of additional depth.Not that she needs any help with being an insanely compelling character. Amina herself is larger-than-life in every way. She loves her daughter fervently, and would do anything to keep her safe. This felt like a very unique motivation for a pirate captain. Amina’s Islamic faith is also central to who she is as a person. Throughout the book she wrestles with the morality of piracy, as well as her wandering eye for men, because of that faith. Anytime a character’s faith is at the core of their being, I am flooded with empathy for and camaraderie with them, whether it’s the same faith as my own or one that the world sees as opposing what I believe. I loved the faith element to Amina, and to the story as I whole. It introduced me to a mythology and place to which I have little exposure, and I loved every minute of it.The entire cast is utterly delightful, brimming with personality and flair while all being radically different from one another. But those differences can’t temper their obvious affection for one another, and for the less-than-honest life of piracy they all tried to leave behind. I love that this is an older cast, and that they have weathered much together. I also love that they don’t all share the same faith. There are Christians and Hindus and Muslims all aboard one ship, and they all respect one another’s faiths. I found this coexistence incredibly heartening.There is an incredibly strong sense of place to this story, as well. Chakraborty does an excellent job shaping her world within the confines of the one we know, while also blowing a metaphysical hole in it and expanding into a spiritual realm. I’ve read embarrassingly few books set around the Indian Ocean and Arab peninsula, but that’s going to change after having read The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi. None of the other books I’ve read with a similar setting have captivated me so fully.I mentioned that religion is a large presence in this book. That presence is not only felt in the characters, but in the story being told. Myth suffuses the story, and we see faith and spiritual artifacts being wielded as weapons. That element of the story delighted me to no end. I was fascinated by every piece of myth, by every holy weapon, but every creature and monster of lore. Amina’s pirate crew being set against such things made them the underdog, and who doesn’t love to root for an underdog?I ended up loving this book so much, and I’m afraid that would not have been the case without the aid of the audiobook. Tandem reading the physical while listening to the audio is my favorite way to read, because it makes for an incredibly immersive experience. It is that immersion that won me over to Amina’s story. The audiobook for this is incredibly well done. Both narrators were great but Lameece Issaq, who reads the majority of the book from Amina’s perspective, did a truly brilliant job. I would highly recommend this story in any format, but most especially in audio.The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi lives up to its glorious cover. Amina is the weathered female pirate captain I never knew I needed in my life. She is brash and wily and dogged and, above all, faithful. I love her so much. While this is a standalone, I would love to see more stories featuring Amina and her crew, whether those adventures are in their past or their future. It might have taken my a little while to warm up to this story, but it won me over heart and soul by the final pages....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Feb 24, 2023","Mar 08, 2023","Oct 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61294937-the-adventures-of-amina-al-sirafi

The setting was lush, a balance of both familiar and fresh. The cast was varied, with some very interesting characters; some were even lovable. The magic was wild and enchanting and costly, and fascinatingly different across the island. The plot and the mystery element were intriguing enough to keep me invested while letting the setting and lore and characters be the true stars of the show. And the romance was beautifully balanced, core to the story without ever overwhelming the plot. There were multiple slow-burn relationships in these pages that didn’t capture me at first, but my investment in them grew as the story progressed. While it did take me a while to warm up to various aspects of this book, I grew to love it.Our story follows Jack, a Tamerlaine of Cadence who was sent to the mainland to become a bard. His laird has called him home, in need of his musical talents. But Jack’s parentage, with his single mother and unknown father, made him feel judged and found wanting in the land of his birth, so he is hesitant to return. But the draw of duty is too much to ignore, so he leaves the life he has made for himself for the home where he never felt accepted. Once there, Jack finds himself face to face with the heiress of his side of the divided isle, a woman who, as a girl, was his nemesis. While the two might not see eye to eye, they are bound by a shared purpose: find the girls who are being kidnapped from their homes. It is this mystery, of who is taking the girls and why, that drives the story. But romance and magic, politics and a history fraught with division, are equally important tot the tale being spun.The isle of Cadence is fascinating, with its multi-layered division between the east in the west; politics and ideology and history all divide them, but that division is also seen in tangible, and magical, ways. In the distant past, when a potential alliance between the Tamerlaines (of the east) and the Breccans (of the west) ended in tragedy and war, the island was divided by magic. One side would be lush and fertile, but the cost of magic would be steep. The other side could practice magical crafts with ease, but would strive against the land itself to no avail, never able to grow enough food to feed their people through winter. And the divide between the two is something of a magical leyline; any crossing of it immediately alerts the watchers of the boundary. Both sides have things the other needs, but neither is willing to enact a treaty, as neither feels they can trust the other to honor it. Outside of the division, the half of the Cadence where we spend our story is just exceptionally lovely. I was very much reminded of Scotland. As I was meant to be. The magic was wonderful, if devastating it its cost: enchanted blades whose wounds could inflict fear or truth, and plaids woven with secrets that acted as armor or kept one warmer than it should. Magic here wasn’t a spell, but an enchantment entwined with the very best of a craft. I loved the work and artistry required, and also the passion and talent that made these items their most powerful. But then there was the music, which was absolutely my favorite part. The idea of music calling to the various types of elemental spirits was exceptionally lovely, and I was utterly captivated by both premise and execution.It took a little time for the characters to grow on me, but grow on me they absolutely did. By the end of the novel, I was very fond of captain of the guard Torin, his healer wife Sidra, Jack’s weaver mother Mirin and his little sister Frae. But the obvious stars of the show were future Laird of the East Adaira and our bard main character, Jack. I have a weakness for bards as main characters, especially when their music is a large part of the plot. That’s exactly what was promised here, and Ross delivered on that promise with great aplomb. I thought A River Enchanted was just as enchanting as the title lead me to hope. The balance of cozy vibes and stakes with some weight and resonance was pretty impeccable, and the setting and lore were wonderfully lush. I’m so glad that music was actually a focus here, and I can’t wait to see how the Elements of Cadence duology wraps up in A Fire Endless.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Oct 21, 2022",Nov 2022,"Oct 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58132544-a-river-enchanted

As a whole, I think it might be a t20th Century Ghosts is not the first short story collection I’ve read by Hill, but it’s the first one he released. As a whole, I think it might be a touch stronger than Full Throttle, a more recent short story collection of his I read in 2019. However, I also found the individual stories largely less memorable. It was more even across the board, but that meant that there were fewer that stood out to me. That being said, I really enjoyed my time with this collection, and there wasn’t a single story that I legitimately hated. In a collection of 15 stories, I’d say that’s a pretty fantastic achievement. Below are micro-s of each story.Best New Horror - 4.5 stars	An editor falls in love with a very dark story by an even more mysterious author, and becomes obsessed with finding him. I love how the ending of the story mirrored in tone and inevitability the story that our main character was so infatuated with. This was a dark one, that would make a great movie.20th Century Ghost - 3 stars	A theater is haunted, but the ghost in question just wants to talk about movies. I found it perfectly maudlin. The melancholy air makes the entire story. I love the idea that those who are literally haunted by their pasts came together not to exorcize it, but to honor it. The pacing was a tad off, and the telling itself was uneven and occasionally difficult to follow, but I really liked the feel.Pop Art - 3.5 stars	A boy’s childhood best friend is inflatable. No, really. This was such a weird concept that it took my brain a few pages to come to terms with Art not being imaginary. But I became very taken by the friendship at the story's core, as well as seeing Art try to navigate life in a world that is so potentially deadly for him. It ended up being very sad, but lovely.You will Hear the Locust Sing - 2 stars	It’s The Metamorphosis, but with a willing participant. Love how evocative of Kafka this is from the first line. The main character's excitement over the transformation was uncomfortable. I can't say I enjoyed this one. It was definitely horror, but not the kind I prefer. But it was like a train wreck; I couldn't look away.Abraham's Boys - 3 stars	This is a loose Dracula sequel, following Abraham Van Helsing’s sons, Max and Rudy. It demonstrates that even those viewed as heroes often harbor dark secrets, and can be villains behind closed doors. Honestly, it was a bit traumatic. I actually liked the undercurrent of the story, an older brother trying to protect the younger from their abusive father, than I did the vampire hunting angle. Because the darkest monsters are always fully human.Better Than Home - 3.5 stars	Just a boy and his dad bonding over baseball, in spite of the defects plaguing them both. This was another story that made me sad, even though it wasn't necessarily a sad story. I just wanted to give Homer and his dad both a big hug and a safe space to be who they are and love the games they love. There wasn’t much plot here, but it didn’t need one.The Black Phone - 4 stars	The basis for the recent movie of the same name. A boy is kidnapped and locked in a prison cell of a basement, but a boxy black phone is weirdly hanging on the wall. I ended up liking this one so much more than I expected. The ending was fabulous, and I loved the poetry of it. It wasn't perfect, but it was a truly excellent little horror story.In the Rundown - 3.5 stars	An unlikeable man finds himself in a terrifying situation that could never have been foreseen. I actually think this is one of the most disturbing stories in the collection, purely because nothing supernatural occurs and the events are technically plausible. I both love and hate how open-ended and open to interpretation it is. Wyatt was an interesting character, but the situation in which he found himself was really the star of the show here.The Cape - 2.5 stars	A kid teases his older brother for no longer wanting to be a superhero, and an accident occurs. Weird events surrounding that accident set the tone for the rest of our main character’s life. I found the description of his brother not wanting to be a hero anymore, and wishing people would forget he ever had, a sad thought. Not just putting away childish things, but being embarrassed you were ever a child to begin with. But as they grew up, the main character’s obsession with the past became more and more ominous. The ending was unexpectedly dark.Last Breath - 4.5 stars	This story revolves around a museum full of seemingly empty jars, and the doctor who fills them with their invisible treasures. The entire concept here, of capturing the silence of someone's last breath in a jar as a way to immortalize them, is absolutely fascinating. The ending was just the right touch of macabre. While fairly short for the collection, it's one of my favorites.Dead Wood - 5 stars	My favorite story in the collection, and it’s by far the shortest. The thought of ghostly trees appeals to me deeply. I loved this one so much. It was only 2 pages long, but those 2 pages were packed with depth and loveliness and that melancholy that I love so much in very specific horror. How it came back around to human relationships in the end, and the way Hill made these phantom trees a metaphor, was simply beautiful.The Widow's Breakfast - 3.5 stars	Very evocative of Steinbeck. We follow a hobo during the Depression, after he had just lost his traveling buddy. We see grief and loss from multiple angles as he meets the titular widow and her daughters. I found the ending weirdly fascinating, and the social commentary throughout was quietly profound. I enjoyed it so much more than I anticipated when I started. Bobby Conroy Comes Back from the Dead - 4 stars	I don’t have a good description for this one that wouldn’t kill part of the experience. But I will say that I love how jarring that opening is, how it leaves you completely befuddled until the end of the second paragraph. At least, it did me. The story was such a weird, utterly engaging slice-of-life. I was deeply invested in the undercurrent of lost romance, and I loved the ending. That last line was perfect!My Father's Mask - 2 stars	This one was very, very weird. A boy’s parents bring him to a family cabin filled with masks, and things just get stranger from there. I think I followed it for the most part, but I can't say I really enjoyed it. I still found it interesting, though. It was a little like an acid-trip to Wonderland.Voluntary Committal - 4.5 stars	The longest, and one of the most interesting, stories in the collection. Our main character describes losing his best friend and his brother, though the losses were separated by years. His brother, Morris, was likely on the autistic spectrum and was a creative savant, building incredible things out of materials others would throw away. I was utterly fascinated by Morris's creations, and by him as a character. I love how you could tell he deeply loved his brother, he just had a different way of showing it. I could have read a full novel version of this story, but the length felt right.Again, this was a solid collection, and it’s one I can see myself revisiting. Hill is just as gifted in the art of short form story-telling as his father, and I’m very glad to have read 20th Century Ghosts. It was a perfect October read.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Oct 16, 2022","Oct 31, 2022","Oct 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/373915.20th_Century_Ghosts

The premise is fascinating, and CroniI enjoyed one of Cronin’s earlier works, The Passage, a great deal, so I had pretty high hopes for The Ferryman. The premise is fascinating, and Cronin has proven himself more than capable with his prose. Literary speculative fiction is a sweet spot for me, so I jumped at the chance to read this prior to publication. Sadly, while all of the building blocks of a good story were there, I didn’t connect with this book at all. I struggled through it over the course of three weeks, where in the past I’ve read books of similar length in closer to three days. As I said above, the premise was fantastic, and Cronin is a great writer. However, I think Cronin got too wrapped up in his own craft, and the story suffered for it. This would have been a far stronger book if it had been at least 200 pages shorter. The pace was soul-breakingly slow, and my experience with it was the epitome of a slog; I felt like I was trudging through a bog, searching desperately for a path out. The concepts were great, and the tone was suitably creepy for the plot, but the characters were insufferable as a whole, and I just wanted it to be over.That said, I know there are going to be readers who love this, and I wish them every enjoyment with it. It’s unequivocally a book with merit.

But I hate to write an author off without giving them at least two tries, so I decided Ghostwritten would be our second chance, to see if we could mesh as artist and consumer. I’m happy to report that we can! While the collection as a whole was a 4 star read, two of these novellas are among my favorite horror stories I’ve ever read, and I can’t wait to read them again next October.Below are my brief thoughts on each story. The Skin of Her Teeth: 5 stars Brilliant from start to finish. This is the story of a story that refuses to be altered, and I loved every minute of it. I think it might be one of my favorite horror shorts I’ve ever read. It’s definitely my favorite book-related horror I’ve encountered. I would buy a physical copy of this book for this story alone.The Dark Brothers’ Last Ride: 4 starsA story of a delivery trip gone wrong. And very, very weird. I actively disliked Tommy, but I think I was supposed to. It took me a little while to warm up to this story after having so deeply loved “The Skin of Her Teeth,” but it won me over. The un-rightness of the route followed on the trip was palpably creepy, and was my favorite part of the story. The book was also suitably disturbing, but I was in it for the abandoned towns and off-brand gas station snacks.This Book Belongs to Olo: 5 starsOlo is a very creepy child. Like, unbelievably creepy. And yet, the balance Malfi was able to strike with him was astounding. I was deeply disturbed by him, and yet I also felt an incredible amount of sympathy for him. His little homemade pop-up book was terrifying, and I loved everything about it. I also really loved Peyton; she was a powerful character, in spite of how little time on the page she actually had. This story is the reason I gave in and did indeed buy myself a physical copy of this book.The Story: 3 stars.I felt like this was the least original story in the collection. It was fine. The tension ratcheted up well, and Malfi evoked a great sense of impending madness and claustrophobia as the story progressed, but it seemed like a tale I’ve encountered multiple times before; it was just wearing a different dress, if you know what I mean.I love all of the little details these stories share that tie them together. Those might be a shared background character, or a poem that crops up across stories, or a weird colloquialism used in multiple tales. Sometimes it’s a simple as a baseball. These touches and tie-ins made me unreasonably happy. Overall, while half of the collection was definitely stronger, I found all of the stories at least somewhat enjoyable. I’m very glad that I gave Malfi another shot, and that this was the book I chose to try. I loved two of these stories so much that I immediately had to have a copy for my shelves, which says it all. I’ll definitely be reading more of Malfi in the future....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 08, 2022","Oct 14, 2022","Oct 08, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61040037-ghostwritten

Throw a sentient, mostly evil weapon into the mix and you have the premise of The Sword Defiant, the first installment in Gareth Hanrahan’s Lands of the Firstborn trilogy.I love the idea behind this story. I love the examination of classic fantasy tropes from slightly different angles, and that’s exactly what this book was. It would make an excellent starter book for readers just starting to get more invested in fantasy as a genre, who have maybe only had experience with titans like The Lord of the Rings and other classics. There were a couple of little twists that were fun reveals, and the battle scenes were pretty well done. I was definitely invested enough in the story to want to pick up the second installment whenever it becomes available, because I have less of an idea where the plot is heading from here.However, I did have some issues with this book. It felt either overly long, and could have been a stronger story if shortened by a hundred or so pages, or it could have been tightened and lengthened into a more solid standalone instead of drawn out into a trilogy. I also found myself having a difficult time forming much of any kind of emotional connection to a single character, much less to all those about whom I could tell I was meant to care. I didn’t feel that there was much if any significant character development, and that made me care less about the twists and turns of the plot. For me, this was a fun, if borderline forgettable, foundational beginning to what I hope will be a series that develops greater depth and demands greater emotional investment in further installments. I enjoyed it enough to continue the series, but I’m not totally sold as of yet. However, I can see the idea of this story enchanting less jaded readers....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 03, 2023","May 08, 2023","Oct 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62315620-the-sword-defiant

But it’s a series that my almost 30-year-old cousin still dearly loves, and he convinced me to give them a go as an adult with plenty of horror now under my readerly belt. He chose 4 of his favorites for me to read over the course of the month of October, one per week. The Haunted Mask was his first selection.This was so much more fun than I expected. The pacing was great, and the premise made total sense for the age of the protagonist. I didn’t absolutely adore Carly Beth, but I found her plight sympathetic. She felt like a wholly believable 11-year-old girl. Her determination to be the scarer for once instead of the scared was relatable. And the mask she used to attain her revenge? Incredibly creepy.What I didn’t expect was the presence of a moral to the story. Stine did a brilliant job of not beating his young readers over the head with said moral, but instead allowing it to subtly permeate the narrative. Here, Stine guides his readers to an understanding that they should value who they are, flaws and all, and to value the love in their lives instead of dwelling on the ways they’ve been slighted. I also appreciated how things ended, with everything wrapping up nicely while also leaving a door open for further creepiness off-page in that particular story.I enjoyed The Haunted Mask so much more than I thought I would, and I’m looking forward to more nostalgia-laced Halloween reads in the Goosebumps series....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 06, 2022","Oct 06, 2022","Oct 06, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/308540.The_Haunted_Mask

I have a very distinct memory of Christmas when I was 8 years old. My parents gave me a box of Great Illustrated Classics each year, and that was the year of the spooky books. Frankenstein, Dracula and The Picture of Dorian Gray were all included. And, most notably, so was Edgar Allan Poe’s Tales of Mystery and Terror. In this memory, I’m laying on my bed, listening to the Backstreet Boys CD I had just unwrapped while reading “The Tell-Tale Heart” for the very first time. My earliest experience with poetry outside of Dr. Seuss was my grandfather quoting the entirety of “Annabel Lee” from memory. So to say that I have a soft spot for Poe’s work would be a vast understatement. While this collection itself is a mixed bag, as most “selected poetry” collections are, I found it overwhelmingly solid. My favorite poems remain “The Raven” and Annabel Lee,” but I encountered some that were new to me that I very much enjoyed. Even on the poems that weren’t my favorites, where Poe seemed to have gotten lost in his own cadence and lovely language to the point that he lost the thread of story he was trying to spin, I was captivated by the rhythm. His cadence is just always so perfect, so easy to hear even in the silence of your own mind.

It’s also one of the most original horror novels I’ve come across. I was gripped from start to finish, and I was deeply invested in the characters. It was horror on a cosmic level, while also being horror at the simplest and most vital level: that in which someone is at war with themselves. It didn’t even feel bloated, despite it length. And there were a few scenes that genuinely scared me, or disturbed me, or grossed me out. Or all of the above in one fell swoop. It was out there, but in the best way.I was so hesitant to pick this book up. Not because I thought it would scare me, but because I had such a disappointing experience with Wanderers, Wendig’s previous book. It wasn’t a bad book; on the contrary, it was very well written. But I was not only unable to connect with it, but was strangely repelled by it. Wendig’s political views were so palpable in his narrative that it came across as preachy, and that’s not something I ever enjoy, regardless of the worldview from which it’s written. So much of this story is about finding the potential to break free of the cycle of generational trauma and abuse. It’s about recognizing the cancer of pain within yourself and others and doing what you can to exorcise that cancer in any way you can. Can we judge someone based on their potential, whether for good or ill? Or can we only evaluate the actions they’ve already taken? With which viewpoint does the most hope and optimism lie? If I hadn’t listened to this on audio, it might have been a 4 read for me instead of a 4.5, but the narration was simply brilliant. Co-narrators Xe Sands and George Newbern did an incredible job breathing life into every single character. The only negative thing I have to say is that the ending didn’t feel quite as tight in terms of writing and plotting as the rest of the book. The change was nearly negligible, but it was there. At least, it was for me.Overall, this was an incredibly satisfying horror story that radically altered my opinion of its author. I’m so glad to have read it, and to have enjoyed it so thoroughly. It’s a book that I can see myself happily recommending to others. And often.

I was enraptured by the writing, the characters, the hints of magical realism, and the deeper historical context this gave me for a period I thought I knew well. Fajardo-Anstine managed to pack an incredibly rich, emotional, sprawling story into a remarkably short, tight package.This is, at its core, the story of Luz Lopez, the eponymous woman of light. Luz is seventeen going on eighteen when we meet her. She and her older brother, Diego, are using their gifts for reading tea leaves and performing with rattlesnakes, respectively, to bring in a little extra income for themselves and their aunt Maria Josie, the woman who took them in when they were very young. Denver in the 1930s is not a friendly place for people of their heritage, and it’s not an easy economy for anyone. Things are very tight, but they have their small apartment and their community and each other. Most of the narrative follows Luz as she transitions into womanhood, while we learn about her family’s history periodically through her story.While I was entranced by the story of Pidre, the foundation of the Lopez family, I became disenchanted with the story of Luz, our main protagonist, the further along the story progressed. She went from being someone who made things happen to someone who just let life happen to her, which was an incredibly frustrating change to witness. Pidre, on the other hand, was a wonderful character, and I could have happily read an entire book about him instead. I loved the subtleties of this story. The mistreatment people of color suffered during the time periods covered in this book was blatant and informative, but there were some other deep topics that were addressed in quieter ways. Cycles of trauma for instance, and how radically different people who experience the same trauma can respond to it. There was an underlying discourse about love in all its forms, and how true romantic love can differ widely from person to person, relationship to relationship, and how often one can misread their own feelings. There were also some lovely inclusions of magical realism, from the more blatant magic of Luz’s reading of tea leaves to the more subtle way Diego handled and befriended snakes.There are certain choices that I never understand, and one of those was made close to the end of this novel. It was this decision that ushered in the chaos and heartache that followed. I was so frustrated by this, because the situation was entirely avoidable. In fact, I was so irritated by this turn of events and how the story wrapped up that I found my entire experience with the book retroactively soured. Not completely, mind you, but enough to knock a full star off of my rating.Woman of Light wasn’t perfect, but it was beautiful anyway. I feel like I learned a lot without feeling like I was being preached at, which can be a difficult balance to strike. It made me thirsty for more sprawling family stories, which isn’t a type of book I generally crave.

Divine Rivals proved that theory to be incredibly accurate. I adored this book from start to finish. Ross’s prose here is lovely without ever feeling purple, and is incredibly easy to sink into. The voice she gives her central character, and the beautiful writing found in the letters that make up much of the story, were both brilliantly done and charmed me completely. Iris Winnow and Roman C. Kitt are fighting for the single columnist promotion up for grabs at the Oath Gazette. Eighteen year-old Iris is gifted and tenacious but under tremendous strain. Her brother, who had been fighting on the frontlines of a war between gods, is now missing in action. Their mother is drowning her sorrows and draining their scant funds, meaning that Iris often goes to work and to bed hungry, despite her hard work. Roman Kitt is the nineteen year-old heir-apparent to a new-money family, and is trying to make a name for himself in order to bolster respect from the elite, which is what his father craves above all. Iris and Roman are fiercely competitive and often bump heads, but soon find themselves connected in a very unusual way.Like The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy, this story has elements of You’ve Got Mail, but in a fantasy setting. Our main characters, Iris and Roman, develop an unlikely connection through magical typewriters and heart-baring letters. However, much like You’ve Got Mail, only one knows the identity of the other, and the ways in which that knowledge effects their rivalry is by turns funny and sweet. I’m not a fan of miscommunication as a trope, but this is, for some reason, an exception. Speaking of tropes, this is also one of the best rivals-to-lovers stories I’ve ever experienced. The romance here was just impeccable. It was sweet without being saccharine, and it made my heart ache in the best way.I love when a fantasy world is not stuck in the magical equivalent of the dark ages. The existence of human progression and technological advancement in a fantastical world is woefully underrepresented in the genre as a whole, and I absolutely adore when a writer bucks that norm. This book did that incredibly well. We have a world that is obviously not our own, with gods and magic coexisting with typewriters and trains. And the war element was also well handled. It was interesting seeing a magical war through the eyes of journalists, those fighting with words instead of taking up arms. There were so many elements about this world and the story setup that I loved.That being said, there were a few instances were plot progression felt less organic than the rest of the story and more like devices being forced to fit so that the plot would move along as the author dictated. But for the most part, this was a story that felt believable, even in the midst of the fantastic. I will say that the cliffhanger ending made me want to pull my own hair out from sheer frustration, but that also shows how deeply I was invested in the story. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel.

Here we are given a cozy academic setting, an interesting magic system based entirely upon music, a fun and loveably quirky cast of characters, and a well-paced story that wraps up happily at the end of the book. While I’m excited to read further in the series, this first installment could absolutely be treated as a standalone.Amelia Jones wants one thing in life: to become a Maestro like her mother, who died when Amelia was very young. In order to make this happen, she has to attend a music academy and do well. But not just any music academy will do. Amelia’s mom graduated from the Mystwick School of Musicraft, one of the most prestigious academies in the world. And Amelia dreams of nothing but getting accepted. When a series of unusual events lands Amelia a place in her dream school, she has a short amount of time to prove to the faculty that she belongs there as much as the rest of her class. But it’s not only the school she must convince. Something — or someone — is doing their best to sabatoge Amelia. These mishaps, combined with Amelia’s lack of faith in herself, could undermine her natural talent and see her cast out of school if she can’t find a way to overcome them and believe that she is worthy of her place at Mystwick.I loved Musicraft as a concept. In Amelia’s world, music is the one and only source of magic. Different instruments and compositions and genres create different types of spells, and a song only becomes a spell with the proper intent behind it. For instance, rock music produces illusion magic, and the language of trees seems to be Canon in D. Lone musicians can work small magic, but the most powerful spells call for a full orchestra. There are a handful of very sensible rules accompanying this magic system, and Khoury does a marvelous job demonstrating what happens when those rules are broken. One of the most important of these rules is “With all your soul do play your part, for magic rises from the heart.” In other words, a musician must feel what they play, and believe in their song’s ability to accomplish the spell they are casting. When I was a little girl, just starting to sing in front of audiences, my mom would always give me the same piece of advice before I took the stage: sing it like you mean it. And that seems to be the core tenet of Musicraft. You must play with feeling. The notes themselves don’t matter. The intent and the passion are what turn a song into something magical. This book scratched the same itch as Harry Potter and Nevermoor, but possibly aimed at a slightly younger audience. The writing was a bit more simplistic, despite all of the musical terminology, and the story was fairly predictable outside of the musical element. However, I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone, young or old, who loves middle grade fantasy series with a school setting. Specifically Nevermoor, as the magic is bright and colorful and paints the world of the story the same. I found Amelia’s story delightful. Even when she doubted herself, she never stopped trying her hardest. She’s probably one of the most dedicated protagonists in this type of series I’ve come across, and I loved her for that. I’ll most definitely be following her story as the series progresses....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 15, 2022","Sep 17, 2022","Sep 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43803346-the-mystwick-school-of-musicraft

Some of my favorite books of recent years have been Circe, Stone Blind, Ithaca, and Stephen Fry’s Mythos. I also have a love for any book that takes a misunderstood figure, real or fictional, hero or villain, and gives said figure more dimension, showing a different side of their often well-known story. When these loves are paired together alongside a healthy dose of feminine rage, I’m immediately sold. Which is why I pre-ordered Clytemnestra almost as soon as I heard of its upcoming release. While I’ve been disappointed by Greek myth retellings in the past, Clytemnestra was everything I was hoping it would be, and more.Clytemnestra was one of literature’s very first villainesses. She is frequently viewed with hatred, and as her claim to fame was murdering her husband, King Agamemnon, after he had been away at war for ten years, this is an understandable stance to take on the surface. But she is a figure who, like Medusa and Medea and so many other women in Greek myth, is often maligned without second thought. This book delves into Clytemnestra as an individual, following her girlhood and progressing into her forcible marriage to Agamemnon. We see the trauma she suffers at his hand, capped off by the sacrifice of her eldest daughter so that Agamemnon’s ships could catch a wind to Troy. Is it any wonder that she plotted revenge, and took it when the chance was offered?What I love most about this novel is the nuance given to Clytemnestra. She could easily have been presented as conniving, or a bitter woman scorned one time too many. She is both of these things, but she’s also fierce and strong and resilient. She is an excellent, dedicated mother, and a brilliant queen. She is a woman of dimension, depth, facets. I deeply appreciated the fact that we were given so much of her childhood in the narrative. Spartan girls experience life in far different ways than other Greek girls. Clytemnestra and Helen and their sisters grew up fighting and sparring everyday, with weapons and without. Bouts were brutal, sometimes delivering broken bones or even death, but always, at the very least, resulting in bruises and blood spilt. This is the childhood that shaped Clytemnestra. While I knew the ins and outs of this story fairly well, I found that knowledge only added to my experience with the book instead of making me impatient in any way. Knowing what would happen ratcheted up the tension. The pacing here was very well done; for an over 400 page book on such a familiar story, I never felt as if it were dragging in any way. I’ve also struggled in the past with myth retellings that seek to write out the gods and magic from the narrative, as that seems to leech some of the character from the stories. The Shadow of Perseus by Claire Heywood comes to mind. I tend to prefer books like Circe and Stone Blind that embrace the weirdness of Greek myth and utilize the pantheon and the magical elements to basically house a historical fantasy tale. Clytemnestra is neither of those things. There is never an attempt made to explain away the gods. They are not present in the plot for the simple reason that Clytemnestra does not believe in them. There was no need to justify this belief; it simply was. And because of that, we’re not shown any magical elements of the story. This worked really well, and never felt forced in any way.I enjoyed everything about this. I thought it was brilliantly written. The ending felt a bit rushed in comparison to the rest of the story, but don’t climactic scenes usually feel feverishly fast, both in the minds of readers and the lives of those experiencing them? I loved learning more about Clytemnestra. I loved seeing her as a ferociously devoted sister and mother, a woman who cared about women and was willing to be seen as a villain. I especially appreciated the vile depiction of Agamemnon, as I’ve always despised him in any story he in which he appears. In a world where women were treated as treasure to despoil and property to horde, Clytemnestra claimed her own autonomy. Kudos to her....more",Notes are private!,2,42,1,"Jun 19, 2023","Jun 28, 2023","Sep 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61361681-clytemnestra

I found it a refreshingly original take on Arthurian legend with a wonderful heroine and a refreshingly diverse cast. It delved into some incredibly heavy but important topics in ways that only added more depth and power to the story being told. And because of that, I was very excited for Bloodmarked. While still a good book, it unfortunately suffered from second book syndrome, in my opinion, and didn’t deliver as potent a tale as its predecessor. It’s still absolutely worth reading, but I had a few complaints.Firstly, this book felt more like a young adult fantasy novel than Legendborn in some cliche ways. Bree exhibits an unfortunate amount of that young adult “I’ll do what I want and damn the consequences” mentality while being shocked when said consequences actually materialize. This is one of the things that most frustrates me about young adult novels. Well, that and love triangles. One of which is also present in this book. I also strongly dislike miscommunication and lack of communication as tropes, both of which made multiple appearances throughout the plot. I also found Bloodmarked a bit bloated. This is a long book, and quite a bit of it felt like filler. This negated some of the propulsive power for the first book. Had it been edited down a hundred pages or so, I think it would have been a much stronger story. It also weirdly felt like the ending and some of the big reveal moments were too rushed to have the impact they needed to have on the reader. The pacing was just a bit off for the entirety of the book.However, there was still a lot to love about Bloodmarked. Our cast of characters is still wonderful and diverse and incredibly sympathetic. I was deeply invested in Bree and everyone in her tight-knit crew. We were also introducing to some fascinated new places; namely, the Crossroads bar and the former plantation now known as Volition that provides refuge to Rootcrafters. These additions breathed new life into the story, as did the new characters that came with them.Bloodmarked wasn’t a perfect book, but it was still a very good one. If you haven’t read Legendborn, I highly recommend it. And once you’ve read it, you’ll definitely want to continue following Bree’s story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 07, 2022","Dec 14, 2022","Sep 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59365195-bloodmarked

The tone and writing brought to mind Interview with a Vampire, while the main character’s mental state harkened more to Jack Torrence from Stephen King’s The Shining. The vampires in this novel are very traditional in makeup; there are no innovations in vampirism here. Instead, we have a slow, introspective, deeply philosophical story as our central character struggles with the weight of her immortality. This debut is both contemporary and historical, literary and quietly horrific. The story begins with Anna, the daughter of a gravestone carver in the 1830s. From there we meet Anna’s modern identity, Collette LeSange, as the proprietor of a prestigious private preschool. This is her current life, and we spend half of our time following her story in the present. The other half is spent following her life as Anna and Anya, from her childhood to her vampiric inception to her trudge through human history. In the present we witness Collette’s appetites suddenly and inexplicably change. As she becomes consumed by hunger and the fear of losing her mind or, far worse, her control, we journey alongside her as she contrasts existence with truly living. She is running from the nebulous God of Endings, who may or may not be a product of her frightened mind, and she must decide if running is still worth the effort and pain and heartbreaking loneliness.This is a treatise on the pros and cons of immortality. It’s an exploration of the value of art and relationships. It contrasts a safe existence with a full life, and questions whether that safety is worth the loneliness it carries. The God of Endings is a thought-provoking, beautifully written novel. I found it a bit too long, and I predicted the resolution from very early on in the story, but this is absolutely a tale worth reading.

Not just because the story or characters are exceptional. Not just because the pacing is perfect and the prose is exquisite. Not just because it covers important topics in new ways. No, sometimes the book you’re reading is special because you know that it will go beyond standing the test of time; it’s destined to become a classic. You can see this book not only still being read a century from now, but being discussed in a classroom setting. Babel, or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translator’s Revolution is such a book. It tackles some truly weighty material, specifically colonialism and racism, in profoundly eye-opening ways. It houses a discourse on etymology and translation that is absolutely fascinating. And even while balancing all of these dense topics, Kuang still manages to create an incredible cast of characters that experience a phenomenal among of growth, as well as a perfectly paced, page-turning plot where the stakes are high and the emotions wrought in the reader are even higher. I can’t think of a superlative strong enough to adequately convey how powerful and nigh-on perfect Babel is as a piece of art.“Power did not lie in the tip of a pen. Power did not work against its own interests. Power could only be brought to heel by acts of defiance it could not ignore. With brute, unflinching force. With violence.”Kuang approaches colonialism through a unique lens in Babel, that of language and translation. This approach breathes new life into the topic and allows readers to see the atrocities of colonialism with fresh eyes. These atrocities, both hidden and blatant, have been so often discussed and grazed over that readers, specifically white readers, tend to overlook them. Yes, we acknowledge what a travesty they were, but then we go right along with our lives and move onto something more comfortable upon which to set our thoughts. Which is one of the main points of this novel, I think. White people think of themselves as allies when convenient, and honestly believe that we in this modern age would never so dehumanize our fellow man over something as inherent as skin color or heritage. And yet, how often do we still whitewash history, drifting past the portions most painful to look at as quickly as possible? In this book, Kuang showcases a multitude of ways, both harsh and subtle, in which the British Empire exerted her control upon the colonies she claimed. Specifically, we see how little England cared for the people of these other nations, seeing them as less than human and little more than something to siphon. In this alternate history, silver can house magic when etched with words from multiple languages, catching whatever is lost in translation. Which means that even the very language of a people is something to be harvested and wielded by colonizers against those indigenous to that particular land. The addition of such an integral part of culture as something the Empire sees as a resource to be used as they see fit is an eye-opening demonstration of the parallels between colonialism and rape, the taking by force of what you desire because no one is powerful enough to stay your hand.“But that’s the great contradiction of colonialism… It’s built to destroy that which it prizes most.”This colonialism goes hand in hand with the casual racism with which Robin and his cohorts are plagued during their lives as pawns of the Empire. Even at Oxford, where they are given such generous stipends for their contributions to the School of Translation housed within Babel, they are seen as less than their white counterparts and are expected to cow-tow and perform as their “betters” see fit. Robin is often called an exception, or credit, to his race, as England views the Chinese as lazy and stupid. I can’t imagine having to live under this constant belittlement of heritage and race, and others expecting me to be thankful to have “escaped” the home from which I was taken.“A dream; this was an impossible dream, this fragile, lovely world in which, for the price of his convictions, he had been allowed to remain.”Kuang also demonstrates here how very insular academia can be. When immersed in campus life and classes, it can become all too easy to ignore the problems of the world around you, because you feel so set apart from that world. Someone claimed that this novel was both a love letter and breakup letter to academia, and it truly is. Because while Kaung doesn’t shy away from shining light on the shortcomings and failings of academia, she doesn’t deny its beauty. One can acknowledge the beauty of the broken without excusing the brokenness, which is exactly the balance maintained here.“Languages had to be lived to be understood, and Oxford was, after all, the opposite of life.”One of my favorite lighter elements of the novel was the presentation of the joys of etymology.  I’ve always loved words, both for the stories they can tell and for themselves, so I was delighted to learn about the origins and hidden or forgotten connotations of so many words from so many languages. It was illuminating to say the least. I also loved the discourse surrounded language as an idea and different languages as they relate to each other. In the hands of another, so much erudite information and the abundance of footnotes could have become tedious. But that definitely wasn’t the case with Babel. Kuang maintained a beautiful balance between information and story.“Language was just difference. A thousand different ways of seeing, of moving thought the world. No; a thousand worlds within one. And translation — a necessary endeavour, however futile, to move between them.”I’ve said very little about the story itself, and that’s for a very simple reason: I think readers should go into this book as blind as possible. The synopsis provided in the book itself is more than enough. However, I will say, as vaguely as possible, that I adored the story. It was so tightly tied to all of the topics discussed above that there’s no way it could be parted from them. The plot is slow but steady until it suddenly isn’t, and the ratcheting of the pace was brilliantly done. The characters were diverse and lovable and flawed and deep, and I came to either love or hate all of them. Strong feelings are definitely evoked here, both in regards to the characters and the plot itself. There is high drama, but never for drama’s sake. And the writing is always exquisitely balanced, never flowery but always evocative and powerful.“That’s just what translation is, I think. That’s all speaking is. Listening to the other and trying to see past your own biases to glimpse what they’re trying to say. Showing yourself to the world, and hoping someone else understands.”Babel is one of the most brilliant — and most devastating — works of fiction I’ve ever encountered. I am in awe of every element of this book. The writing is exceptional; the character development is somehow both rich and subtle; the political maneuverings and philosophical conundrums are perfectly balanced with the plot, so as never to bog down the pacing; the etymology is fascinating and impeccably well researched; and the stakes and tension are keenly sharp without ever feeling the slightest bit melodramatic for the sake of drama. Not only is this a very good story incredibly well told, its message is breathtakingly powerful and abundantly clear. Kuang demonstrates the epitome of artistry here. I’ve not read her Poppy War series because I was scared of the darkness, but if the writing is of the same caliber as Babel, I think it will be worth the pain. I’ve found an author whose every word I plan to read, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for her.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Sep 08, 2022","Sep 16, 2022","Sep 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61245927-babel-or-the-necessity-of-violence

Robb book always feels like a chance to catch up with dear friends, while said friends are trying to save the world. And I don’t know that I’ll ever tire of that. Desperation in Death is the 55th full-length installment in the In Death series, and I’m still just as attached to Eve and Roarke and Peabody and the rest as I could ever hope to be. I absolutely love seeing how they’ve grown and changed over the years. While this particular installment dealt with some incredibly difficult and heartbreaking topics, and was very hard to read in some places, it was handled with care and was well worth reading.In Desperation in Death, Eve and the gang find themselves facing down a child sex trafficking organization. Reading what the little girls were going through was devastating, as I know it reflects a horrific truth in our reality. And watching Eve deal with this, and the ways in which it brought her terrible past back to the forefront of her mind, was painful. But something you know going into any Nora Roberts book, even this long series of murder mysteries, is that everything is going to turn out alright in the end. Good is going to ultimately triumph. It’s for that reason I was able to stomach such a hard premise.While a difficult read, Desperation in Death was a solid installment into the series. With any In Death books, I would definitely recommend checking trigger warnings prior to picking them up if you’re a more sensitive reader. Also, while every book can stand on its own because the cases themselves are contained, I don’t think these books would be nearly as enjoyable read out of order.

And they rock at their job for forty years, when they are gently put out to pasture and sent on a retirement cruise. Where it turns out there is a hit out on all four of them. The women are forced into hiding and must figure out who burned them and why, in hopes of saving their lives. And their pensions. That’s the story of Billie, Mary Alice, Natalie, and Helen, and what an entertaining story it is.Billie is our perspective character and the unofficial leader of this group of femme fatales, code-named the Sphinxes. I loved being in her head. She’s far from flawless as a character, but that’s kind of the point. The snark level, both internally and between her and the rest of the cast, was absolutely perfect. While I was invested in the actual plot, it was the sass and humor that won me over so quickly. Everyone was quippy in believable ways, and their timing was just as on point as the pacing of the plot.Something I really loved about this book was the age of the protagonists. There don’t seem to be many works of genre fiction centered around older protagonists, especially older female protagonists. All of our main characters here are in their 60s, and I found that level of life experience really refreshing, especially in such a fast-paced and high risk profession. I loved the blend of action with topics like menopause and breast cancer and outliving a spouse. The balance was pretty good, though I actually wish there had been more of these topics covered throughout the action.I thoroughly enjoyed Killers of a Certain Age. It reminded me very much of the 2010 movie Red, starring Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren, but if Helen replaced her male costars with some other badass women. I love that movie, so I very much mean that comparison as a praise. If you’re looking for something fast-paced and funny, action-packed and feminist, I highly recommend this book.

Here, Sizemore has created a poetic reading journal of sorts. As he journeyed through some of the classics of the Western literary canon, he recorded words and concepts and stylistic choices that stood out to him, and wrote a piece for each of the works he read. I found this absolutely fascinating, if also a slightly mixed bag for my personal taste.Some of these poems were absolutely brilliant. Pieces inspired by Tolstoy and Austen, Carroll and the Brontës and Orwell, were masterful. The way Sizemore was able to evoke the tone and style and message of each author without outright mimicking them was not only commendable, it was utterly fascinating. The breadth of styles encapsulated in this single collection is honestly astounding. But then there were the poems paying homage to writers like Kerouac, Joyce, Vonnegut, Bukowski, and the like. Writers I either actively dislike or have avoided because I knew they wouldn’t appeal to me. Sizemore very successfully conveyed these just as well as he did those that I love and enjoy. But in reading the works evoking these authors, I discovered something about myself; I am evidently a prude. Some of these pieces were so appallingly vulgar in their language and sexual connotations that I found myself clutching my imaginary pearls as I read. That content was so unexpected and jarring that I found myself unable to enjoy those poems. I can appreciate the artistry behind those pieces, but they definitely weren’t to my taste.My rating here is incredibly subjective. For sheer craftsmanship and vision, this is a 5 star collection. For my personal enjoyment, it was a 3 star, because the pieces that made me uncomfortable were in the majority. So I’m splitting it in the middle with my overall rating.

Mythology of any kind fascinates me, but I’ve been obsessed with Greek mythology almost since I learned to read. Because of this love, I often find myself divided on retellings. On the one hand, I love any chance to revisit these stories I love, especially if told in a way that gives me a new perspective. On the other, I tend to judge these a bit harshly because of my love for the source material. But when I find a book that not only retells one of these timeless stories, it breathes new life into it, it becomes an instant favorite.Ithaca? Definitely an instant favorite.Ithaca is the story of, well, Ithaca, as Odysseus has been gone for 17 years and his queen, Penelope, strives to hold the kingdom together. She’s been inundated with suitors, seeking her hand in marriage because, in their minds, she’s quite obviously a widow. Of course, they actually care nothing about Penelope; they all just want to claim her kingdom for their own. Penelope balances on a razor’s edge, trying to keep the suitors fed and content as she constantly claims to be on the cusp of a decision, knowing full well that she can never choose because all of the spurned suitors will surely declare war on Ithaca. Thankfully, Penelope is incredibly clever, and she maintains this balance deftly and with astounding subtlety. But nothing lasts forever, and the suitors are beginning to get restless. As pirates begin periodically raiding this land of women and boys, Penelope is faced with an impossible decision. But as she decides, who will defend Ithaca?Our tale is told in a nearly omniscient, mostly third-person narration through the eyes of Hera, queen of the gods and patron on the Greek queens. She is also a character in her own right, seeking to aid Penelope’s cause as subtly as possible, without drawing the attention of any of the other gods. Especially her husband, Zeus. I loved the mirroring of Penelope’s story with the little we learn of Hera throughout the novel. While I loved Penelope, Hera was definitely the stand-out character here. I’ve always disliked Hera, but in the past year or so I’ve read multiple books that showcased facets of her I had never considered. She has become so much more sympathetic and interesting to me through these works, and I absolutely adored her in Ithaca. I was also fascinated by Hera’s love for Clytemnestra, Penelope’s cousin and queen of Mycenae and murderer of her own husband, King Agamemnon. These are stories that I know well, but North’s writing and characterizations brought them to life in new ways. Speaking of writing, I was incredibly impressed with North’s craftsmanship. She managed to both utilize the classical modes of storytelling used by Homer and his contemporaries while subverting those same modes in ways both thoughtful and irreverent. This could only be done by someone with a firm foundation in the source material who also has a brilliant ability to wield her craft. I’ve tried North’s writing in the past and found that it didn’t click for me as a reader. Either I’m a very different reader now, or she’s altered her style tremendously for this book. Or I was just wrong to begin with. The balance she was able to strike between respecting the material while also delivering snark and sarcasm in a way that brightened the story without ever making light of it, was astounding. There were some very emotional moments when really hard topics were conveyed beautifully, but there were also moments that made me laugh out loud. This was insanely clever, and I can’t wait to read the next installment.Did I mention this is part of a series? Because I didn’t realize that for some reason until I reached the end. I might know where the story is going, but I still want the next book immediately. Alas, The House of Odysseus is at sea until May of 2023. While I do think that Ithaca could be enjoyed on its own, I think that having a background with the foundational works it is retelling made reading this far more rewarding. Ithaca is mostly retelling what was happening in the background of The Odyssey, but it also references The Iliad quite often, as that covers why Odysseus left Ithaca in the first place. The Oresteia, which covers the lives and deaths of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon and their children, Orestes and Elektra, was also an integral part of this story. Had I not been familiar with these, I might have gotten lost in the names and the plot and not noticed the superb writing and how North was playing with form. Which would have been quite the loss on my end, as that was what made this book so special for me. The plot itself was propulsive. I found myself having a very hard time putting this book down while reading it. But housed within that addictive pacing was deep and moving commentary on the lack of autonomy given to Grecian women and how cruelly they were often treated. Parts of this, especially the portions about Clytemnestra’s treatment at the hands of her husband upon his return from Troy, were incredibly difficult to read. And hearing from Hera how much of herself she saw in these queens, how she had experienced the same, really drove home the fact that height of station did nothing to spare these women. North also expressed how the poets of Greece were men, who only immortalized manly things and, when forced to record a story where a woman was at the fore, would find ways to twist it and make her less so that men felt like more. This was beautifully put and very thought-provoking.I loved everything about Ithaca, except for the fact that it’s not the standalone I was for some reason expecting it to be. But this is very much a rereadable book, so no doubt I will enjoy it again before the next installment is released. Not only did Ithaca give me wonderful characters to root for, it did so from stories I’ve known all my life and has thus altered them in my memory. For the better. I now feel this desire to go back to those original sources and revisit their stories from a new perspective. I can’t recommend Ithaca highly enough, especially to those who share my lifelong fascination with Greek myth.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,2,"Aug 28, 2023Aug 27, 2022","Sep 2023Aug 31, 2022","Aug 27, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61918579-ithaca

That’s not to say that the writing is bad; on the contrary, I found the prose and pacing solid, the characters and plot intriguing. However, I liked the building blocks and concepts of this book more than I liked the execution. I felt like Malfi, to go all English Literature class, did a lot more telling in his writing than he did showing. I’m not a fan of being spoon-fed, and I felt a bit of that throughout the novel. The characters’ motivations and thoughts and struggles and fears were all laid bare in the exposition instead of being revealed through their actions. Even though I liked most of the characters and found their back stories interesting, this writing decision kept them from feeling fully three-dimensional to me. This book gave me strong vibes of other stories. I was very much reminded of Stephen King’s IT, especially as regards a group of childhood friends who went through something horrible and supernaturally traumatic coming back together as adults when the dark source of that trauma resurfaces. I was reminded of Joe Hill’s Nos4a2, especially concerning the harvesting of children and the existence of a dark and impossible place hidden from the world but still, inexplicably, real. I was reminded of Ray Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes with the creepy carnival setting and dastardly, otherworldly magician. And I was reminded of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men by Dennis, who I liked but who felt like little more than a mystic version of Lennie. These are all stories that I like or at least appreciate, and I didn’t feel that their use as inspiration here was too overt or mishandled in any way, but it made this particular story feel less original to me, unfortunately.I felt that the strongest portions of Black Mouthwere those that were flashbacks to that life-altering summer the four friends shared as children. There was a nostalgia to the writing there that reminded me of what I loved most about IT and Something Wicked This Way Comes and other books like them. That nostalgia paints the past in rosy hues, even in the midst of horrific events, and I love that mingling of ideas that should be such polar opposites but which somehow instead complement each other in inexpressible ways. It also dug deeply into generational trauma and the breaking of those cycles, which added a power to the story being told that I appreciated.Black Mouth worked better for me in idea than in actuality, but I’m still glad that I read it. I’ve now been exposed to a new-to-me author with a backlist to explore, and I fully intend to do so. Because, while I might have not quite connected to his writing, I’m very interested to see if that disconnect was a one-off. I’m hoping very much that this experience mirrors my early encounters with Stephen King, whose work I once disliked but who is now one of my favorite authors of all time. And, even though I didn’t love Black Mouth, I definitely didn’t dislike it to that extent, so I think this is a promising beginning!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 20, 2022","Sep 06, 2022","Aug 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59120294-black-mouth

Because reading is such a vital part of my life, and something to which I give such a large portion of my time, I try to read things on occasion that push me to think outside of myself. It’s been a long while since I found a book that did that as successfully as Ted Chiang’s Stories of Your Life and Others. I felt as if I were trying to keep my head above water the entire time I was reading it, but in the best way possible. Chiang raises some truly profound moral, theological, and philosophical questions, and he does so in a way that doesn’t lead you to any specific conclusion. Sometimes it’s enough to think and to question, and Chiang’s stories give readers the freedom to do just that. It was completely unclear what type of worldview he was writing from, which I actually loved. More than one of these stories had some heavy religious connotations, but felt neither like proselytization or a subtle ridicule of believers. That is a very difficult balance to strike in one story, let along an entire collection. I am in awe of Chiang’s mind, and was equally awed by every single story housed in this book.The opening story, “Tower of Babylon,” immediately gripped me. The idea of God allowing the completion of the Tower isn’t a new concept, but it’s never been handled in the way Chiang presented it. Here, the build is due to a reverence for Yahweh, not a belief in mankind’s ability to become His equal if they reach heaven. This story follows miners from other kingdoms who have come to break through the vault of Heaven now that the Tower has been completed. The questions asked along the way, and what our protagonist finds on the other side, were fascinating and truly profound.“Understand” reminded me of Flowers for Algernon in the first few pages before jumping to Blake Crouch’s Upgrade, but much earlier and, in my opinion, far more successful despite (or maybe because of) its brevity. The ways in which we see our perspective character’s personality subtly but continually shift as his intelligence skyrockets were extremely interesting. The patterns he observed as his mind broadened were also very intriguing. And the conclusion was wild. The paranoia that almost always comes with such extreme intelligence is always fascinating to witness.“Division by Zero” is probably the story that went the farthest over my head, due in large part to the fact that it centered around math. I did appreciate the discourse around how a faith disproven can break a person. It demonstrated how the hyper-fixation of a brilliant mind can wreck other aspects of their lives. But if I had to choose a least favorite story in the collection, it would be this one.“Story of Your Life” is the entire reason I was interested in this collection in the first place. Arrival is one of my favorite sci-fi movies, so I was very excited to read the source material. The concepts of language and a less linear approach to time as viewed by the heptopods completely gripped my imagination. The idea of seeing all of life at once instead of experiencing it as it unfolds is a baffling but profound one, that gave me a lot of food for thought. I also love how original and utterly unique the heptopods are as an alien race, in every single aspect of themselves. Their form, their written language, and their cognition stretch the mind of our perspective character to its limits. The inclusion of said character’s life with her daughter was lovely and poignant.What’s in a name, and what power can it contain? I’ve always found the idea of golems from Jewish tradition captivating, so “Seventy-Two Letters” really captured my mind, as well. This intersection of religion and technology speaks to me. Seeing belief used for practicality, how science and theology can not only co-exist but help bolster one another, was lovely and inspiring. But this story also shows how the “secularization of the sacred,” so to speak, can lead to man playing God. “The Evolution of Human Science” is one of the shortest stories in the collection, and expresses a world in which the creation has surpassed the creators and rendered them somewhat obsolete. Here we have a world where meta-humans can function at a much higher level of cognition than humans, and their thought processes are baffling to the general population. Humans who were once among the most intelligent beings on the planet find trying to translate the works of meta-humans into something intelligible for the general population a full-time job, leaving their previous scientific jobs to those who are now more capable, all because of human intervention. “Hell is the Absence of God” has to be one of the most profound stories I’ve ever read. In this world, not only is it completely unquestioned that God is real, angelic visitations are fairly common. While miracles accompany these visits, there is also tremendous fallout, leaving others dead or broken in the wake of the supernatural. Souls can also be visibly witnessed either ascending to Heaven or descending to its counterpart. The faith struggle of our main character was painful to witness, and the ending was bleak, but rarely in my life has any work of fiction made me think as deeply. This is undoubtedly a story that will stay with me for the rest of my life.The format of “Liking What You See: A Documentary,” was a lot of fun. It truly was like reading a script for a documentary. I loved the idea behind this. There is an invention that allows you to see people outside of their level of physical attractiveness, and a debate is raging as one university campus tries to decide whether it should be a requirement for all of their students. Seeing so many sides of this debate was illuminating, and made me waver on whether or not I would choose calliagnosia for myself if it existed. I wouldn’t, as I would hate to miss appreciating any form of beauty, but it was interesting to consider.Stories of Your Life and Others is one of the strongest short story collections I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. The stories within it have won a multitude of awards, and been nominated for even more; every single win and nomination was much deserved. Reading this was not exactly fun, but it was rewarding. It was difficult, and I often felt like I wasn’t quite smart enough to grasp the concepts, but the writing itself kept things down-to-earth enough for me to follow. However, even as I struggled, I found each and every story immensely enriching to read. I feel like this collection made me grow, and that seems like a wonderful compliment to pay a book. I can’t recommend it highly enough, though I would like to caution against consuming it too quickly. Let these stories breathe, and give your mind this to ponder. Chiang’s incredible talent is worth giving his work more of your time.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 20, 2022","Aug 27, 2022","Aug 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28503870-stories-of-your-life-and-others

I was told that this book had Howl’s Moving Castle vibes, and I can only see that if I squint, and only as regards that personalities of the main characters. I was also informed that it was basically You’ve Got Mail but in a fantasy world, and I get this comparison even though I’ve never actually watched that movie. (Yes, yes. I know. I promise to rectify that eventually.) While romance hasn’t been my genre of choice this year because I read so much of it last year, I decided to give this a go anyway simply because I thought the premise sounded fun. And I’m so glad that I did, because The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy was a snarky delight of a rom-com housed in a fascinating fantasy world. Mercy Birdsall is doing her best to hold her family’s undertaking business together. One of the only things keeping them afloat right now is a government grant that gives them a stipend any time they take a keyless corpse that was recently reanimated before being put (back) down by a marshal. Unfortunately, one of those marshals is Hart Ralston. Hart and Mercy hated each other at first site, and the venom flies freely every time Hart brings in a body to Mercy’s funeral home. After a particularly nasty run-in, Hart pens an anonymous letter to an ethereal “Friend,” simply out of a need to feel like someone cared enough to listen. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine the letter actually being delivered to a real person, someone else who was just as desperate for a connection. Can you guess who that “friend” is? Obviously, both drama and hilarity ensue from here, leading to a romance as hilarious as it is tender.While I did eventually become invested in the romantic lives of our main characters, I was initially much more interested in their occupations. I found Mercy’s work as an undertaker fascinating, especially given the radical differences between funeral rites and the afterlife in her world as compared to our own. I was also interested in Hart’s job as a marshal and how that compared to traveling marshals in the American West in the late 1800s. The letters between the two struck me as cute but quaint, and bordering on cheesy. But by the middle of the book, I was rooting for them with my whole heart.Both characters had some quirks that made me roll my eyes, but not as much as I did at Mercy’s family. For a family that’s supposedly so close, there was a weird amount of miscommunication and secret-keeping, and it drove me nuts. I felt like those lines of the plot were added in almost exclusively to up the drama factor, but that’s just my opinion. The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy is a fun, frothy, addictive ride with plenty of substance and heart. I very much enjoyed my time with it, and am already pressing it into the hands of others. It made me interested in seeing out more cozy fantasy with rom-com elements, and obviously I now desperately need to watch You’ve Got Mail.

However, I have to confess that those plights are beginning to blur together in my mind, because each book is so formulaic. Almost without fail, the Abbey will be under some sort of siege by unsavory characters looking to enslave those within its walls and steal their home and resources. As this occurs, those most warrior-like from the Abbey are off on a quest far from home to defeat someone or win back an item that in some way correlates to the happenings back home in Mossflower forest and Redwall. And this tends to be under the guidance of the spirit of Martin the Warrior. Do I have any problem with this plot line? Not at all. But I have to admit that it’s becoming a tad redundant this many volumes into the series.One thing I did really appreciate about this book as compared to those preceding it was the fact that the titular hero was a female. Mariel is brave and fierce and feisty and determined and terrifically skilled with a weapon for one untrained. I found her journey an interesting and intense one to witness. But there were a couple of things about this installment in particular that bugged me. First of all, I found the central villain fairly unbelievable. His level of obsession with this bell, to the point of no longer sleeping and then falling prey to madness, made no sense to me. He went from sly to completely mental over the course of a scant few chapters, and it simply didn’t feel believable to me. Even in a story about anthropomorphic animals running an Abbey and waging wars, this bell-induced insanity was where my skepticism couldn’t be kept at bay. There’s also a place near the end of the book where a couple of creatures fight over who has the right to kill another character. This is such a stupid discussion to me, whenever I happen to see it in media. Who cares who can claim the kill, as long as the beast in question is put down in the end? It’s utterly nonsensical and baffles me any time I come across it.I might’ve had qualms with this volume, but I still enjoyed the story and the setting. And, of course, the food. Jacques wrote food descriptions like no one else I’ve ever read, and they never fail to make me hungry for things I’m pretty sure would actually be vile in real life. I also love knowing that everything is going to work out all right in the end, which makes this series perfect for children just getting into fantasy and adults looking for something cozy and nostalgic to provide a brief escape from the darker world of most adult fantasy fiction. Even if this wasn’t a perfect book, it was a fun one, and I’ll definitely be continuing on with the series....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Aug 15, 2022","Aug 19, 2022","Aug 15, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7993.Mariel_of_Redwall

While not yet officially available in the US, it’s been out in the UK since January of 2022, and I had read some mixed s about it. But something about it still called to me, and when the audio became available to request on NetGalley, I jumped at the chance. I’m incredibly glad that I did, because this story was incredible, and I actually don’t know that I would have enjoyed it quite so much in any other format.Our setting is London, 1799. Pandora “Dora” Blake is the orphaned daughter of noted antiquarians who specialized in Grecian artifacts and who died tragically on a dig site when Dora was just a girl. Dora’s uncle, Hezekiah, gained custody of both Dora and her parents’ London shop. There is no love lost between them. Hezekiah has always resented Dora, and Dora despises Hezekiah for running her birthright into the ground and slowly ruining the reputation her parents had built during their lifetime. Dora dreams of designing high-end jewelry and buying herself a life free from Hezekiah’s control. Along the way, Dora meets Edward Lawrence, an aspiring antiquarian, and they determine to help one another. When a Greek pithos of indeterminable age and in pristine condition makes its way to the shop, family secrets and buried trauma slowly, and almost sinisterly, comes to a head. Even though I went into this novel hopeful, I have to confess that I didn’t have very high expectations. I have a serious weakness for anything inspired by Greek mythology, but I also can’t seem to help but judge said inspired stories a bit harshly, as well. And I’m just starting to get into historical fiction, which has always been a very hit-or-miss genre for me. But Pandora was recommended for fans of The Essex Serpent, which made me even more hopeful. My expectations were not only met, but exceeded. I can’t definitely see why it was compared to Sarah Perry’s work, and I can’t wait to get a physical copy to shelf next to The Essex Serpent. While not quite as philosophically profound, Pandora definitely scratched the same itch.I loved the fact that I couldn’t decide whether or not there was a touch of magical realism to this book. Much like The Essex Serpent, it straddles that divide in such a way that you’re never entirely certain. Though, in this case, I’m leaning strongly in the direction of there being just a touch of the supernatural housed within the story. Especially when it comes to the pithos itself. It’s beautiful and somehow disturbing in its perfection, magnetic and repellant. I loved the undercurrent of similarities between Dora and her Grecian namesake. And the identity hinted at for one particular side character near the end of novel was a very fun touch.While Pandora got off to a bit of a slow start, the tension and the atmosphere in this book were absolutely fantastic. I really enjoyed my reading of it. I highly recommend this audio version, as Olivia Vinall did an excellent job. This is one of those stories that I’m not sure I would have enjoyed to quite this extent had I read it with only my eyes instead of my ears. Listening to Pandora gave me strong Dickensian vibes, but with less meandering in the storytelling itself. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction, or a good mystery. It’s a book that I can see myself reading again, and one that I look forward to adding to my physical collection someday.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Aug 11, 2022","Aug 20, 2022","Aug 11, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55676326-pandora

They speak mind to mind, but only if you listen.” Fairy Tale has been one of my most anticipated reads of the 2022 since it was announced. I preordered it in February, the day it first became available. So to say my expectations were sky-high would be an understatement. Reading anything you’ve been looking forward to for that long with your hopes for it residing somewhere in the clouds is always a tenuous undertaking. While Fairy Tale didn’t disappoint, it couldn’t quite live up to the hype in my head. “it’s the stories of our childhood that make the deepest impressions and last the longest.”Something that King does wonderfully well is coming-of-age stories, and that was on full display here. This is, at its core, the story of a boy and his dog. And that core was my absolute favorite thing about the book. I felt a little bit in love with Charlie as a character, and his relationship with Radar was just the sweetest thing. He’s had a lot of struggles in his life, but somehow he is still good. Well, mostly. Charlie is a pure soul with a kernel of darkness at his core. This darkness serves him well on occasion throughout the story, though sometimes he regrets it in hindsight. But he’s overwhelmingly good. The bond he forms with Mr. Bowditch as he seeks to pay it forward, so to speak, after his dad stops drinking, was heartwarming. “There’s a dark well in everyone, I think, and it never goes dry. But you drink from it at your peril. That water is poison.” Speaking of his dad, I loved seeing someone struggling with an addiction without becoming a monster, and actually trying to do better. Alcoholism is used so often in fiction to propel forward a plot, and King himself has used it many times in the past. But there was something refreshing about how it was portrayed so hopefully in Charlie’s dad. The relationship between Charlie and his dad was beautiful, even with its scars. I thought this showed trauma and response to said trauma in a very believable, balanced light.“A brave man helps. A coward just gives presents.”I found Fairy Tale reminiscent of other stories by King; specifically The Talisman and Hearts in Atlantis, both of which are works I adore. The coming-of-age, boy on a journey, portal fantasy with a period of captivity, all reminded me me strongly of The Talisman. Even the tone was similar. And Charlie’s relationship with Mr. Bowditch, and how that relationship revealed an entire hidden world, were very much in keeping with Hearts in Atlantis. For some reason, I actually found that portion, which comprised the first third of the novel, more emotionally compelling than the fantasy aspects that come later in the novel. It was when Charlie finally entered the shaft shown on the front of the U.S. edition that I thought the story would pick up, and yet that’s when I found myself having a harder and harder time focusing on the plot. “You never know where the trapdoors are in your life, do you?”Even if this wasn’t my favorite King book, I did still really like it. And I think it’s going to hold up really well to rereading. King did a lovely job capturing the eponymous fairy tale vibe while still maintaining his unique voice. There were a host of interesting characters, a fascinating world under a dark curse, and plenty of stakes. The protagonist was likable with a ton of heart. But something about the body of the plot seemed to drag. While I found myself thinking about the book often, I wasn’t feeling compelled to keep reading or sacrifice sleep, which is a feeling a tend to associate with King’s work.“Time is the water, Charlie. Life is just the bridge it flows under.”I think my main issue with Fairy Tale is that I firmly believe it would’ve been a far stronger novel if it were about 150 pages or so shorter. King tends to have a problem with bloat in his novels, and this one unfortunately was no exception. It was very good, and I would give it a solid 4 stars, but with some tighter editing it could easily have been one of my favorite books of the year. I actually think I might have enjoyed it more in audio than in print, so I plan to reread in that format sometime in the not-too-distant future. However, I will say that I was very pleased with the ending. King doesn’t always stick the landing, but he did here. He even poked a bit of fun at his readers for wanting a happy ending even as he delivered one.“good people shine brighter in dark times.”It may not sound like it from this , but I did very much enjoy Fairy Tale. It gave a quintessential King story with a wonderful new setting and an even more wonderful protagonist. And I will always have a weakness for any story about a boy and his dog. I just wish the book had been edited down a bit. However, I really can’t wait to reread this, because my expectations won’t be so unreachably high. Which means that I have little doubt that Fairy Tale will blow those more tempered expectations out of the water when I return to it someday.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Sep 23, 2022","Oct 04, 2022","Aug 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60177373-fairy-tale

Spanish cartoonist Jordi Lafebre both wrote and illustrated this himself, and there’s a level of cohesion to the prose and the art that feels incredibly rare to me because of that. I was captured from the very beginning by both the art and the unique format.This is the story of a romance delayed. The book opens with chapter 20, where we see the 37-year delayed date of an older couple who life has kept apart for all that time. Readers are immediately left with questions. Why did they wait so long? What kept them apart? What drew them to one another in the first place? From here, we journey further and further back in their story, finally ending in chapter 1, when the two meet for the very first time.This format for a love story was absolutely brilliant. Starting with the end and working back toward the beginning was a fascinating, refreshing look at what was already a very unconventional romance, mostly kept alive through late-night office phone calls and letters with no return addresses. It was lovely, and somehow still retained an air of mystery even after the final pages of chapter 1. I was both delighted by it and profoundly moved.A couple of things about this graphic novel blew my mind. First of all, this is a translation. While I was made aware of this in my research, it never felt like one to me, which speaks highly of both the original prose and the translation itself. Secondly, Lafebre is a phenomenal artist. The expressiveness in the eyes of his characters blew me away, and the reverse aging of the cast was incredible to behold. The skill and raw talent on display here were truly humbling.I don’t read a ton of graphic novels, and romance hasn’t been my genre of choice this year, but I’m thankful for whatever bookish serendipity brought Always Never into my reading life. It was exquisite, and an absolute delight to read. I’ve already added a physical copy to my wishlist, as this is a story I hope to revisit time and again as I grow older. It gave me an even deeper appreciation for my own love story, and the ease of it, and I want to have access to that lovely reminder on my shelf.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Aug 03, 2022","Aug 05, 2022","Aug 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60465276-always-never

When he reached out offI became friends with Andrew Franks on TikTok before I realized he was an author, because I enjoyed his taste and his content. When he reached out offering a code to the audiobook for Prey Without Ceasing, I was both excited and nervous. I tend to shy away from reading books written by people I’ve developed any kind of relationship with, because I try to be as (kindly) honest as I can be about every book I read, and this has cost me relationships in the past. But the synopsis of this book called to me so strongly that I accepted his offer and also purchased the Kindle book so I could tandem read and make notes. I made the right decision. This was definitely a book worth reading, and I related to portions of it so deeply that it was painful.While I never experienced quite the spiritual turmoil (internal or external) that Dalton underwent in this story, I related to his struggles and doubts and attempts to live out his shaky faith on a profound level. I am incredibly fortunate in that my family was always wonderfully supportive. I was never yelled at or struck or judged and found lacking. My home, and my church, was always a safe space. But the internal struggles and questions Dalton was wrestling with? I’ve been there. I’ve felt that same guilty confusion as I tried to work out my own faith, live it out to the best of my ability, and deal with the stomach-churning disappointment that came anytime I fell short. I am so, so incredibly thankful that I didn’t have the dad Dalton did. Pastor Gary was horrible. He’s the epitome of the legalistic, judgmental, hypocritical Christian that drives so many away from the faith. The minute things he chose to harp on, like light profanity in movies for example, don’t matter even the tiniest bit in the scheme of things. And yet Gary placed so much weight on these unimportant things that it threatened to crush the faith of his (very faithful) son. If I could’ve reached through the pages of this book and smacked him, I totally would have.“I’ve seen a lot of kids grow up and walk away from God because of the way they were treated at church. They walked away because of the reckless way faith was presented to them.”I loved the symbolism in Dalton’s nighttime visit to the church, how it looked rundown and decaying and infested by things that kept to the shadows. However, it still wasn’t without its beauty. Dalton’s “dark night of the soul” was tense, but the horror elements were a bit lighter (and more heavily symbolic) than I would’ve expected. I was reminded a bit of The Visitation and House, books that I loved as a teen.Kellen Boyle did an absolutely fantastic job narrating the audiobook. He captured the feeling of living in the Bible Belt in the American South. His slight drawl was perfect for this story. Reading this was very nostalgic, as it reminded me of the Christian horror novels I loved so much in my youth, from authors like Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti. And, similar to those authors, there were times when the spiritual symbolism and message felt just a tad heavy-handed; it could have used as touch more finesse in the writing, but so could the books I loved from Dekker and Peretti and they were very effective. I also thought that it felt a tiny bit rushed, though I often feel that way about novellas. I really enjoyed Prey Without Ceasing, and felt somehow seen by it. It was quick but still deeply thoughtful, and it brought me back to the time when my faith was young and sometimes shaky. Franks did a great job with it, and the audio version was superb. This is a book that I’ll be pressing into the hands of my cousins and others who have had a similar Christian experience, though I think that even those who don’t share that faith will find it fascinating.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 03, 2022","Aug 04, 2022","Aug 03, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/59662090-prey-without-ceasing

Eliot, who has held that pride of place since I was in high school. While I didn’t love it quite as much as Fierce Fairytales, Great Goddesses was still an incredibly solid collection. It took the classic tales of the Greek gods and goddesses and manages to both reaffirm them and turn them on their head. Here, Gill gives stories we already know depth and new life, while also pondering what these deities would be up to today, if present in our world. We see goddesses finally coming into their own, if in far different ways than they ever envisioned, while certain gods are now facing repercussions for their actions. Great Goddesses is fiercely, unapologetically feminist without vilifying every male character or setting each female on a pedestal. It’s beautifully balanced and beautifully rendered, in every way.Outside of the content, I’d like to take a moment to simply praise Gill for the quality of form in her work. Every piece in this collection, be it poetry or prose, is perfectly clear and easy to follow. Her writing is profound, and yet it’s never ethereal. There’s something very grounded about her voice. It’s this voice and its constancy that has compelled me to crown Gill my favorite poet. I’m astonished that her writing about the inner and supposed lives of beings from ancient myth can be so much easier to follow that someone else’s poetry about nature. There’s a clear story to everything she produces and, though not imbued with any kind of rigid meter as it is written in free verse, there’s a natural rhythm to each piece that draws you steadily along. I’ve never come across another poet whose work is quite such a joy to read.I always appreciate an updating or reimagining to stories already well known, though I tend to be weirdly protective of Greek myth as I have loved it so fervently since I was a child. But Greek reimaginings done well always find a special place in my heart, which is exactly where Great Goddesses now resides, alongside more prosaic works like Olympus Texas and Circe. I especially enjoyed Gill’s “Where are they now?” take on many of these deities. The one involving Hera was particularly touching, as she learned from her past and dedicated her present to helping those who had survived the very abuse she once punished them for enduring.If you’re a fantasy lover who is looking to dip your toes into poetry, look no further than Nikita Gill for your introduction. Whether you choose Great Goddesses or Fierce Fairytales (my favorite) or another that I’ve yet to read, I believe that her poetic style and her choice of topic will make a wonderful first impression. I’m already looking forward to revisiting both collections I’ve read thus far, as well as digging further into her work. Gill’s voice is lovely, and she always have something to say.

Let me explain. Petrik loved this Actual rating: 3.5 stars, rounded up.The First Binding was one of my most hesitantly anticipated books of the year. Let me explain. Petrik loved this book so much, and shared a lot of passages from it as he read, and it sounded like it would scratch my The Name of the Wind itch. And it did, almost too well. Despite the excessive amount of time between publications and the fact that we might never get the rest of Kvothe’s story, The Name of the Wind has been my favorite book for over a decade. I’ve tried to shift favorites, to align myself more with other books or authors I respect immensely, but something about The Name of the Wind captured a piece of my heart and still refuses to return it. So you would think that I’d fall head-over-heels for a well-told story that is so obviously inspired by my favorite novel. And you would be right, but with some serious caveats. This is the story of Ari, who now goes strictly by the title of The Storyteller. He’s on the run from his past while also capitalizing on the mythos surrounding that past, which I found a fascinating balancing act. Our framework story follows Ari’s Storyteller persona in the present day, and I was enraptured by his abilities as a storyteller and the magic that he wove into the telling of his tales. Within that framework we also get the story of Ari’s past, most specifically his childhood up through the first year or so of his education, the very beginnings of the fearsome and nigh on mythological reputation he built for himself.I love a good framework story. Not only does it allow you to become invested in your narrator on multiple fronts, it give said narrator more believable freedom to insert humor and asides into their narration in ways that wouldn’t be nearly as palatable without that constant reminder that they are telling their own story. I thought that Virdi utilized this style of storytelling very well, reminding me again of The Name of the Wind as well as Blood Song and The Empire of the Vampire and so many more fantasy novels that I have loved first and foremost purely because of this format. I find it the wittiest and most enchanting form of storytelling, so I was thrilled to experience another book that wielded it so well.I also loved the philosophical pondering housed in The First Binding. Virdi’s prose isn’t quite lyrical, but it is profound. I found myself highlighting and annotating often, sharing quotes with my husband and coming back to them days later because they were still on my mind. There’s little that I love more in my reading life than a book that makes me think. If a book manages to make me think and feel? That’s a new favorite. The First Binding didn’t quite speak to my heart, but it resonated strongly with my mind.While I was interested in Ari’s story from start to finish, I found myself having a hard time picking the book up because the pacing was agonizingly slow. The First Binding is less of a book and more of a tome, a brick of a novel that demands much of your time. It’s difficult to commit that time to a story that meanders so unhurriedly toward its destination, especially when you have so many other stories calling to you from your shelves. Once Ari finally reached his school days, the pace improved, but then I was faces with another conundrum as the similarities between this story and The Name of the Wind became even more pronounced.So much of this mirrors The Name of the Wind. Perhaps too closely. This feels like more than inspiration. From the poetic view of silence at the beginning of the book, to reputation of the orphaned main character and how they’re running for their past; from the search for the truth behind their heritage and their quest to find information on a supposedly mythological entity that others scoff at while our main character knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that these beings exist, and are malicious, as said beings are responsible for the slaughter of our main character’s birth or adopted families; from buying their way into school to enduring some type of punishment in a way that builds their reputation; from their cleverness to every discipline’s interest in them, outside of the discipline they most want to learn, under the tutelage of a brilliant but probably mad master. Even the cursing is nearly identical. I find these similarities too much at attribute to inspiration. It’s not plagiarism, as the writing was still very my Virdi’s own and the stories weren’t quite an exact match, but it still feels almost like theft to me.Despite my qualms, I did enjoy The First Binding, and I have a feeling that I’ll enjoy rereading it even more. I honestly can’t wait to see what Virdi does with the rest of the series, especially as I believe it will separate itself more and more from The Name of the Wind as Ari’s story progresses. And I’m hoping that, unlike the Kingkiller Chronicles, we’ll actually get Ari’s tale in its entirety before The First Binding reaches its 15th anniversary, which The Name of the Wind celebrated this year. If that is truly the case, perhaps my loyalties will finally swap to someone new, and I just might end up being among Virdi’s biggest fans.

I’ve been looking forward to The Hacienda sinAtmospheric, transportive, and often terrifying, The Hacienda was a captivatingly creepy place to visit. I’ve been looking forward to The Hacienda since before its publication. But, true to form for me, I kept putting it off once I had it in my hands, partly because I have such a plethora of books on my shelf calling my name that leads me to constant distraction, and partly due to a slight fear that I wouldn’t love it as much as so many other readers who had already read it and adored it with every fiber of my being. But the stars finally aligned, and a TikTok friend offered to buddy read it with me. While I didn’t adore it as much as some other readers, I did very much enjoy it. The Hacienda turned out to be far heavier on the horror elements than I was expecting. I came in expecting a gothic novel with touches of horror, but this was, in my opinion, a straight-up horror novel with a gothic setting. And it was a setting that I really loved. Cañas’ decision to set her story in the aftermath of the Mexican War of Independence made the story feel profoundly unique. Though that setting, we are shown how trauma and grief can not only be generational, but something we experience on a national level. It gave the haunting at the center of the story a unique depth, as the hacienda at its core could almost be representative of the haunted air of a nation recovering from a war.Our story centers around Beatriz, second wife of Rodolfo and new mistress of Hacienda San Isidro, the mouldering estate at the heart of a prosperous business. Beatriz sees this as the ultimate opportunity for freedom, for both herself and her mother, after the political murder of her father’s murder. This is not a love match, at least on Beatriz’s end. But the hacienda in question is strangely agressive, and obviously terrifying to the young woman. She seeks the help of the Church and that help comes in the form of Padre Andrés, who once called the hacienda home. There is much more to Andrés than meets the eye, and the two partner together and embark on a journey to reclaim the hacienda from whatever, or whoever, has the estate in its thrall.I thought Beatriz was a totally fine character. She was interesting, at least on the surface, but I never felt a true connection to her. But Andrés is an entirely different matter. I loved him almost immediately and found him a truly fascinating character. But with everything in the novel, from characterization to descriptions of events and locales to even the climax of the plot, I felt a slight disconnect. Everything felt like it stayed surface deep instead of digging deeper. Details felt ephemeral and tended to blur together. While I found this frustrating, it did one thing brilliantly; it caused the entire novel to feel like a gloriously gothic fever dream.While The Hacienda isn’t a new favorite for me, it was a very atmospheric, enjoyable experience. The setting was lush, the writing was lovely, and the horror elements were incredibly strong. I completely agree with the comparisons to both Mexican Gothic and Rebecca, and would highly recommend The Hacienda to any lover of those novels, or anyone looking for something historical, with a touch of romance, that is heavy on the creep factor.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 21, 2022","Jul 28, 2022","Jul 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57840571-the-hacienda

So I was intrigued when I read the synopsis for Haven. Having only read one other book by Donoghue, The Wonder, I wasn’t exactly sure what I would be getting, but I’ve heard excellent things about other novels of hers and decided to risk it, especially since Haven was under 300 pages. I can’t say I regret reading it, but I’m incredibly relieved that it’s over. If the hallmark of a good book is its ability to make you feel, then Haven was excellent. Because I was a simmering stew of rage for the majority of my time with this book.Our story begins with Trian, a very young monk, and Cormac, a far older monk, are recruited by Artt, a noted priest and scholar, to abandon civilization and fulfill Artt’s heavenly vision of founding a monastery on an island untouched by man off the coast of Ireland. I thought this premise sounded fascinating, and I went in expecting some survival and spiritual themes. What I did not expect was my immediate hatred of Artt, or the Prior as the other two monks called him. He was the most impractical, oblivious, self-righteous, irksome “leader” I can imagine in that position. Trian and Cormac were both very sympathetic, which made their suffering at the inept and ambivalent Artt even more infuriating. I didn’t actually check, but I’m pretty sure this book made my blood pressure skyrocket.While I was in a constant state of aggravation, I did come to truly care for Trian and Cormac. Donoghue did a brilliant job crafting these two wildly different characters, and making each uniquely equipped for such a harsh landscape. Trian’s affinity for the water and Cormac’s ingenuity were the only things that kept the three alive, as Artt was completely useless outside of spiritual matters. These two characters were so multifaceted, and both had a convincing depth to them that I really respected. There was a lot of lovely symbolism here, especially in terms of the island’s lone rowan tree and the gross abundance of birds. Despite the material, it wasn’t a boring story. But it was a difficult one, and not just in terms of content. It felt as though there was no real payoff. And, in spite of the fact that the novel was based on and inspired by true events, I never understood the purpose of the book. Whatever Donoghue was trying to communicate here was lost, or overshadowed by my dislike of Artt. I don’t regret having read Haven. But I can’t say that I enjoyed anything about it. I’m mostly just thankful that it’s over. This wasn’t a bad book, but it was a hard one, and I’m not sure it’s going to have a huge indented audience. Hopefully I’m wrong. And hopefully those who do embark on this journey with Artt and Trian and Cormac find it more rewarding than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jul 21, 2022","Jul 28, 2022","Jul 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59801788-haven

I consider it one of my favorite series of all time, and definitely my favorite series of graphic novels I’ve ever read. Every single volume was a 5 star experience. I wouldn’t have changed a single sentence or frame. It’s one of those rare instances where the art and the prose carry equal weight in the story, and something about Rodriguez’s art style stole my heart as surely as Hill’s writing did. I loved every single thing about it.So when this bind-up of all of the prequel side-stories was released in March of this year, I was both incredibly excited and very, very hesitant. Because the Hill/Rodriguez team were still together for this volume, I knew I would have to read it at some point. But I worried that, if the stories and writing weren’t special enough, The Golden Age would somehow cheapen or lessen my memory of the original series. This fear could not have been further from my actual experience. The stories here, of the Locke family from nearly a century before the characters I came to love so much in the main series, do nothing but strengthen and deepen my love for the series. I have a new slew of characters to love, characters who are flawed but wonderfully real and marked by their love for one another. A love that would venture into hell and back for the sake of any who had lost their way.Each of these stories, from the shortest to the longest, felt integral to the overarching story being told. Some were heartwarming, some were bittersweet, and some were horrific and traumatic and honestly appalling. But the way everything tied together at the end made even those painful moments so powerful, and so worth suffering, that I again can’t think of a single frame or sentence I would change.I want to discuss two of the stories in particular. First off, “Open the Moon” was exquisite. The story itself was beautiful, as was the way in which it was told. It made me feel deeply, and I can absolutely see why that standalone issue was nominated for an Eisner. But the star of the show in this collection was “Hell & Gone,” though there is no way it could have stood alone; it builds on every other issue before it in the collection, and ties them all together beautifully. What thrilled me about this part of the story was that it ties in and crosses over with Gaiman’s The Sandman. And it does so profoundly well. Not every crossover is a success, but this one absolutely was. It didn’t ride on the coattails of Gaiman’s story. Instead, it took that mythos and lovingly gave us a completely believable interlude. Hill and Rodriguez re-explained everything readers who had no exposure to Gaiman’s Sandman might need to know, but in ways that didn’t feel redundant to those who have already met and grown to love Dream. And personally, as someone who adores Gaiman’s storytelling but has had a difficult time connecting to the art style in The Sandman comics, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to see some of this world through the gifted pen of Rodriguez. The art was exquisite, and the storytelling lived up to it. I loved getting to reacquaint myself with characters from the world of The Sandman, and I loved even more how seamlessly this story worked in conjunction to the rest of Locke & Key.The Golden Age was a brilliant addition to the Locke & Key series. If you’ve read and loved that series, I strongly suggest picking up this volume. I can’t wait until it’s out in paperback so I can add it to my physical shelf of favorites with the rest of the series. And if you’ve never read Locke & Key but are interested, I think The Golden Age would be a brilliant place to start, as it introduces you to the mythos without giving you any spoilers at all for the main series. So, what I’m saying is, please read this. It’s a beautiful story exquisitely illustrated, and it’s definitely worth your time.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jul 18, 2022","Jul 19, 2022","Jul 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58385159-locke-key

I absolutely love his joie de vivre, his unapologetic enthusiasm for life. The Storyteller is a joyful, irreverent, triumphant look at a life lived hard and fast but well.  And hearing it told in Grohl’s own voice added even more power to a rocking story. This is one of those books that demands to be heard, though I’m also thankful to have a physical copy that I was able to annotate and which provided some wonderful photos of his life to complement the stories.Right off the bat, I love Grohl’s voice. It feels honest and somehow joyful. I love seeing life through his eyes. There’s a beautiful descriptiveness to his writing that makes everything incredibly easy to visualize without feeling too wordy or like he’s trying to hard in any way. It feels effortless.  I especially loved the prologue, and had to go back and read it in physical form so that I could make notes. His discussion of how he wanted to age and why was simply beautiful, as were his meditations on why music has so radically defined his life. Even though it’s not a lifestyle I’ve shared, it’s one that I dreamed about for years, and so I found it weirdly relatable.He describes the drumming of jazz greats as “thunderous expression with graceful precision,” and I thought this was such an eloquent way of putting it. And it’s a description I completely agree with when it comes to the most talented drummers of past and present. “Structured chaos” is the most apt description of jazz I can think of, as well. The story of Dave teaching his daughter to play drums was absolutely lovely. His pride, his trepidation that he wouldn’t be able to figure out how to teach, his nostalgia as seeing her showed him exactly how he had looked when first learning himself, was so much fun to read. You can tell that this is a man who deeply loves his kids.The only thing that bothered me slightly on occasion were his reactions to every musical artist he ever met. Every single one of them is the best of the best, the ultimate artist, the epitome of inspiration in Grohl’s life. I get it, I would without a doubt be completely starstruck by any and all of them, as well, but you can only have so many favorites who inspired you to pursue your passion, right? But that’s a very personal qualm. I’m not Grohl, and I don’t know how much of these recollections are colored by nostalgia, but it felt a little overly all-inclusive in terms of inspirational artists and surreal moments. However, Grohl lives life in a way where he tries his best to take nothing for granted and to always remember how lucky he is, so this fervent joy over each of these wild encounters makes sense. Obviously Grohl anticipated this being an issue with some readers, as he has an entire chapter addressing all of the name-dropping and raging enthusiasm for so many artists. And honestly, upon reflection, I have to confess that I would react the exact same way. So that thing that bothered me a bit at first didn’t bother me at all by the end of the book.This is the kind of genre that demands to be listened to instead of ingested with your eyes, in my opinion. Listening to someone tell you their story in their own words, with their own voice, is such a powerful experience. It makes you feel as if you truly know this person that you’ll more than likely never actually meet face-to-face. Also, there’s actual music added into this particular memoir. There are drum beats and guitar riffs and so on that added tremendously to the experience.I loved The Storyteller, deeply and profoundly. It’s one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read, and definitely the most joyful. While Grohl never shies away from the tragedy that has colored his life, but he chooses to dwell on, and share, the positive. I loved his outlook so much and, even if we don’t share an exact worldview, there’s an incredible amount of overlap. This is a new comfort read for me, and I’m going to do my best to press it into the hands of all of my bandmates. And I’ll definitely be listening to Foo Fighters far more frequently.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 13, 2022","Jul 25, 2022","Jul 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57648017-the-storyteller

I remembered enjoying Donne’s writing in college, and that still held true. He had a lovely way with words. However, I had evidently blocked out how irksome I found his views on women. The majority of the poems in this collection were more secular works, and many of these felt repetitive in terms of content. The writing was always beautiful. The meter was rigid but captivating in its structure. The rhymes and poetic imagery always felt deftly handled. But the content tended to be about either the inconstancy of woman, lust for women, or most often a combination of the two. I rolled my eyes often. Even some of his most famous offerings, such as one of his Songs (“Go and catch a falling star; get with child a mandrake root”) are about the fickle nature of women and their ultimate untrustworthiness. Obviously, as I am a woman, I found this irritating and tedious, especially as the theme continued in entry after entry.That being said, his Holy Sonnets are exceptionally lovely. I’ve always had a soft spot for “Holy Sonnet 14” and for “A Hymn to God the Father,” and I’m so glad those were included in this collection. Their presence was the highlight for me. I didn’t love this collection as much as I was expecting to from memory, but I still found Donne’s writing lovely and his holy works moving.

A proclaimed atheist, McDowell set out to disprove the viability of Christianity while still a college student. What he found on his journey accomplished the very opposite; instead of proving Christianity false to the world, the evidence supporting proved the faith the be unquestionably true to his own mind. Hearing him tell this story at a conference was incredible, and it made me eager to pick of the book that outlined his findings.More Than a Carpenter is a profoundly educational read that I found both enlightening and uplifting. Here lies the evidence McDowell found that so supported Christianity in his mind that it led to his conversion experience. Said information was presented in what I think was a suitably easy way to understand for those who have no experience with the faith, but which is still very interesting for those who have spent their entire lives attending Sunday School. My only complaint is that I was hoping for more of McDowell’s own faith story. There were pieces of it scattered throughout the book, but I would have loved a bit more.I think this would be a wonderful book to press into the hands of anyone from teens to senior citizens who have deep questions about the Christian faith, and I hope to do that very thing with it.

It’s a challenge that not only rocked and radically changed their own city of Raymond, but one that reached out and impacted other, larger cities in the nation, as well. Watching the faith of these characters bloom over the course of the novel, not just in spite of the testing they were experiencing due to their oath but because of it, was incredibly powerful. A handful of characters stand out here, but most especially: Henry Maxwell, the aforementioned minister; Rachel Winslow, a soloist with an incredible voice who now much decide how she will use it; Virginia Page, a young heiress prayerfully deciding how best to use her wealth for Jesus; and Edward Norman, the editor and publisher of a local newspaper. These four were my favorite perspectives to follow, especially those of Rachel and Norman. I did think that Sheldon didn’t show us enough of their inner struggles over their decisions, however. Every single person who took “the pledge” as they called it, save one, stuck to it without wavering, which is lovely but not incredibly realistic. I found every such character beatific to a fault. They reminded me of stained-glass windows: beautifully refracting the light that shown through them but flat in and of themselves.I first read this book when I was 17, and heading to my first out of state church camp. While I struggled some with the writing and the language, it effected me profoundly. I had been wearing a W.W.J.D. bracelet everyday for years without fully understanding the story that inspired the saying. I reread it almost half of my lifetime later as I attended an out of state church camp for the first time as an adult chaperone for my church’s youth group, and it hasn’t lost its power. It was a solemn but inspiring reminder that every life can have an impact, if we will only try to walk in His steps as best we can. This is something that I know I’ve failed at, time and again. But thankfully, we never run out of chances to try again. So that’s what I’m doing for the countless time; trying again to live my life more thoughtfully and intentionally, while asking myself often what Jesus would do in any given situation. While this book did positively impact my life, I would feel dishonest if I didn’t discuss what I see as the drawbacks of the book. Firstly, it’s not actually very well written. I’ve read plenty of classics from the same era that have held up far better, because the author captured something of true conversation in their writing. Everything about this book feels stilted and unrealistic, even for the time in which it was set and written. If ever there was a book that was stiff, it’s this one. And for a book so short, it feels like it lasts forever. It’s very dense.Also, from a theological perspective, Sheldon was very much a proponent of the Social Gospel movement, and it felt as if, based off of my exposure to him through this book alone, he was basically proclaiming that you couldn’t be a true Christian without being involved in social reform. This was more than likely not his intent, it’s just the vibe I get from the book. And while I absolutely agree that faith without works is dead, and that we have to put feet on our faith instead of keeping holed up within the buildings where we worship, something about the social reform arm of this feels a bit invasive or something. Anyway, that’s just a subjective issue on my part. But the writing is the main drawback here, thought the message is powerful enough to overcome it.All of that being said, this is a book that has mattered to me for close to half of my life now. It’s a book I think about often, and I’m glad I decided to return to it. It’s a wonderful reminder that the church is not meant to gather on Sunday mornings and then forget their faith for the rest of the week. We as Christ followers are supposed to go and do and share. Our faith is to be active, and the core of us, and willing to help others in any way we can.

I’m not sure how I missed this one when I was younger. It absolutely would have been one of my favorites as a child, and I completely get why my friend told me I needed to read it. Very seldom have I related to a character quite as strongly as I did Pollyanna, though thankfully my life hasn’t been plagued by nearly as many hardships.I love Pollyanna’s aggressive optimism, and I relate to it profoundly. I might not have been aware of The Game, but I’ve always tried to see the best in every single situation. In that regard, I feel as though Pollyanna could have been a bosom friend, quite like Anne Shirley. People sometimes view this type of optimism as naive or even ignorant, but that’s not a view I’ve ever shared. I think that being optimistic even in the worst of circumstances can be incredibly brave. It’s hard to find a silver lining in a storm cloud, but it’s also immensely rewarding. I think that this is the difference between happiness and joy. Happiness is circumstantial. Joy is a decision and, if you’re a Christian, both a spiritual gift and a discipline. This joy is something I’ve always tried my best to exhibit, even when life is hard and it takes some profound effort. I loved seeing this same decision in Pollyanna, and I think remembering her will help me keep my chin up then next time I’m struggling to find my own optimism.The story itself was so heartwarming and uplifting. Pollyanna’s growth as a character, and the ways in which she impacted her entire community in ways that bonded them and had them coming alongside and supporting Pollyanna herself during her darkest hours, was all simply beautiful. The impact one little life can have on so many is profound. It’s a reminder that encouraged me and gave me pause, as you never know how closely you’re being watched and how deeply your actions and attitudes could effect those around you. I teared up towards the end, as the community came together around Pollyanna and lifted her up, as she had lifted all of them as one time or another..The use of dialect in the dialogue was the only drawback for me, making the book a 4.5 instead of a full 5 star read. I know this was a commonly used writing method in the past to delineate between the upper classes and the lower, less educated common folk, but it always throws me out of the story, because I always feel a touch offended on behalf of the people being so represented.

II’ve been reading a collection of poetry each month this year, and I knew early on that I wanted a collection of Rilke’s to be one of my selections. I had never read a single poem of his, but I love the What Should I Read Next? Podcast with Anne Bogel, and she ends every episode with a quote from him: “Ah, how good it is to be among people who are reading.” Because I’ve heard his name and this quote so many times, I thought that his work would be a good bet for me. I wasn’t wrong. Though I was reading a translation, instead of the original German in which he wrote, I found Rilke’s poetry to be lovely.For the most part, Rilke’s work came across as wonderfully tangible, even when philosophizing and probing into the metaphysical. Something about his poetry, even in translation, feels solid and real where it could easily have come across hazy or ephemeral. I think this has to do in large part with the timelessness of his style. His verses felt classical, nearly ancient in their construction, but in the best way possible. I could easily see him being a favored and studied poet in some novel of dark academia, and yet I could also see certain lines being quoted from the pulpit during a church service. His writing is romantic without being saccharine, and thoughtful while still feeling grounded. Upon further observation, I believe that one of the main reasons his work feels so solid is due to its structure. Even via translation, there’s a firm structure to almost every poem and verse in the majority of this collection. It never feels rigid, but it seems to keep the thoughts corralled in such a way that I never lost track of them. All of his ideas and musings felt securely supported by the structuring. And I could always sense the meter without fail in that same majority, which helped keep me focussed. That’s a huge accomplishment for a work of poetry, or for a translation, but especially for a combination of the two. I really liked the songs from the perspectives of different people, i.e. the blind man, the drunkard, the dwarf, etc. I also loved the verse representing different animals. He also writes beautifully about music periodically in the collection. But I truly loved the poems inspired by and retelling various classical pieces of mythology. This of course added to my view of Rilke being classical and timeless in tone. I did, however, feel like the collection weakened as it progressed. The back half didn’t have nearly the resonance of the first half, though I think this is a common danger with such large collections of poetry encompassing a poet’s life versus a shorter, chapbook-like offering that they compiled themselves regarding a particular theme or style or moment in their writing lives. Overall though, this was a lovely, thoughtful collection that I’m very happy to have added to my shelf....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 05, 2022","Jun 30, 2022","Jun 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46201.The_Selected_Poetry_of_Rainer_Maria_Rilke

He believed that “A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.” And that “No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally – and often far more – worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond.” I agree with his sentiments, though I do also recognize that time and taste can effect a person’s experience with a story, as well. For instance, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I would have adored The Chronicles of Prydain around the age of 8 or so. There’s something wonderfully classic about it, and it would have ignited my imagination had it been one of the first fantasy series that I experienced. But reading it after 25 years of exposure to other fantasy series, especially those I’ve come across in the last 10 years or so, hasn’t delivered anything at all impactful.The reason I still love Redwall and other series from my youth is just that; they were the stories of my youth. I have all of these memories of reading those books and being completely entranced and delighted by them. Because of this, rereading them delivers endorphin-laced nostalgia. But The Chronicles of Prydain doesn’t have that same history with me personally as a reader. I wish that it did. Some books are magical no matter how old you are when you encounter them for the first time. Sadly, that’s not the case for all stories for all readers, and that simply isn’t the case for me with this series, though I really wanted it to be.There was nothing wrong with the story presented in The Castle of Llyr. We have here the presence of beloved characters from the first two installments, as well as the introduction of new characters who grow throughout the narrative. We have a dire quest with wild and unexpected detours along the way. There’s magic and battles and the triumphal of good. But everything felt so predictable and flat and, well, trite, for lack of a better word. It’s amazing that something this fast-paced and short can also feel as if it’s dragging, but that was my experience here. Again, I have absolutely no doubt that this would not have been the case in the slightest had I read this for the first time at 8 instead of 33, but here we are.I think that The Castle of Llyr might be where I part ways with Taran and his friends. I haven’t decided this for certain yet, but it’s becoming more and more difficult to ignore how far outside I am of the target audience. Part of me does want to know how things end, so I might return to Prydain eventually, but I have no pressing need to continue on. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 20, 2022","Jun 22, 2022","Jun 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24779.The_Castle_of_Llyr

The romantic girls like Beauty and the Beast; basic girls like Cinderella; goth girls like Snow White. Only the dying girls like Sleeping Beauty.”A Spindle Splintered is a spitfire of a novella. Here we are introduced to Zinnia Gray, a dying girl who is doomed to expire young. Because of this, Zinnia has been obsessed with the story of Sleeping Beauty since she was a small child, and has basically made that fairy tale her entire personality. On the eve of her twenty-first birthday, as she begins to feel her time running out, Zinnia finds herself thrust into a fantastical, impossible situation. Is she the damsel in this situation, or does she finally get to become the hero?“It's one of the rules for dying girls: if you like something, like it hard, because you don't have a lot of time to waste.”I really liked Zinnia as a character. She was in a truly terrible situation, and she often expressed her anger and depression and the hopelessness she sought to combat. And yet, even with everything she was dealing with, she never came across as morose or even whiny. Her situation seems inescapable, and yet she’s always on the hunt for an out. I also really enjoyed Charm and Primrose, the two major side characters in the book. They were well fleshed-out and multi-dimensional. Harrow has a way of making even bit characters, who have very little time on the page and sometimes disappear without even leaving a name, seem totally tangible and unique, which is one of the things I most appreciate about her work.“I see her choosing now whether to make her love into a cage or a key.”There’s something about Harrow’s writing that is simply magnetic. What makes this even more impressive to me is that her voice differs radically between projects, and yet it maintains that magnetism in a way that feels effortless. The voice she utilized in The Ten Thousand Doors of January resonated more strongly with me than just about any other book I’ve read in my entire life, and I firmly believe that it will always be one of my all-time favorites. The voice in The Once and Future Witches was still magnetic, but didn’t speak to me quite as deeply, and I found that A Spindle Splintered delivered a similar experience. I really enjoyed my time with the story, but I don’t see it sticking with me in the same meaningful way as Harrow’s debut.“Maybe the universe doesn't naturally bend toward justice either; maybe it's only the weight of hands and hearts pulling it true, inch by stubborn inch.”I can’t say much more about A Spindle Splintered without giving the story away, especially considering its very brief length. It was a wonderfully engaging and easily consumable book, which is exactly what I needed when I picked it up. As much as I love a good, meaty tome of a novel, there’s something to be said for brevity. While I didn’t adore A Spindle Splintered in the same way that I did The Ten Thousand Doors of January, I absolutely enjoyed it enough to pick up A Mirror Mended, the next novella in Harrow’s Fractured Fables series. If you’re looking for a bite-sized reimagined fairy tale with a satisfying combination of heart and teeth, A Spindle Splintered is an excellent option.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 16, 2022","Jun 20, 2022","Jun 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56179356-a-spindle-splintered

This particular installment felt like it had a bit more going on than its predecessors, Mossflower and Redwall, while still holding true to the formulaic, but successfully so, format of the books. And it was filled with my three favorite elements of this series: little heroes facing incredible odds and succeeding anyway; heartwarming groups of these characters banding together to solve riddles or fight battles or fix what’s broken, or all of the above; and, of course, the mouth-watering descriptions of food.This story ended up being a battle on multiple fronts, and I was pretty equally invested in all of them. The way Jacques would jump back and forth between said fronts so frequently within a single chapter was both engaging and jarring, which I found an odd but compelling mix. Our cast of characters in this installment felt a good deal larger than the casts of the two books preceding it, purely because of the multiple story arcs and settings. We have Mattimeo and the other Redwall youth who are kidnapped from the Abbey. We have Matthias the Warrior and the other parents and concerned parties who join forces along the way to free their children. We have those left at the Abbey, who suddenly find themselves facing invasion in the face of their warriors being gone. And then we have the various villainous groups on each of these different fronts. There was a lot to keep track of, considering the age group for whom these books are intended, but Jacques somehow ensured that everything was always easy to follow.Something I really appreciated about this particular book is that we finally had a main villain with some canniness. Slagar the fox was a more intelligent and multifaceted villain than those in Mossflower or Redwall, though unfortunately he kind of fell apart at the end. But this is a series intended for children, so the evil have to be obviously evil and ultimately fallible. Something else I really appreciate about this series, and this installment in particular, is that even though this is intended for children and thus you have the security of knowing everything will turn out okay in the end, Jacques doesn’t believe in high stakes with no costs. There are character deaths here, and fairly significant ones. This adds tension to the trials of the main characters, because you’re never quite sure if they’re going to pull through or not, seeing as others have died along the way.Overall, I have to say that Redwall as a whole is proving itself to have held up very well. Three books in, and all have been 4 stars so far. This has been an incredibly nostalgic journey so far for me, and I’m happy that TS and Eon seem to be enjoying themselves, as well. If you’re a fantasy fan looking for a story to share with the kids in your life, or simply looking for something clean and wholesome for yourself, I highly recommend the Redwall series....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 07, 2022","Jun 14, 2022","Jun 07, 2022",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/201342.Mattimeo

King isn’t known for nailing his landings, and thiThe Dark Tower is the pentacle of Stephen King’s magnum opus, and I’ve been terrified to get to it. King isn’t known for nailing his landings, and this one is especially controversial. I was afraid that, after reading 8,781 pages, or 3,951,408 words, on my long road to the Tower, I would be left feeling woefully disappointed, and as if I had wasted my time. I’m here to tell you that, thankfully, that isn’t the case. After reading the final pages of The Dark Tower I can safely say that this is my favorite completed series of all time. I’ve never read anything else like it. The only series that I think will eventually surpass it is Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archives, but it will be well over a decade before that is completed. In the meantime, The Dark Tower stands alone among completed series for me. As it should.“The road and the tale have both been long, would you not say so? The trip has been long and the cost has been high... but no great thing was ever attained easily. A long tale, like a tall Tower, must be built a stone at a time.”There will be some vague spoilers here, though I’ll not mention any name save Roland’s. I simply don’t know how else to discuss a final book in a series so large. Skip to the end or turn back now if you wish to go into or continue this series knowing as little as possible.“Battles that last five minutes spawn legends that live a thousand years.”A sense of foreboding permeated so much of this novel. And the foreshadowing King kept dropping did nothing but further whet my appetite to know what was actually going to happen. As things finally wrapped up and came to a head, he made sure to tell readers, again and again, that there wasn’t going to be a happy ending, and that very few of the characters I had so grown to love would make it to the end of the line. Even with all of the warnings, I was still enraged and devastated repeatedly. But isn’t it the mark of a good story, when you’ve become so attached to characters that you rage and mourn when you lose them? “Do any of us, except in our dreams, truly expect to be reunited with our hearts' deepest loves, even when they leave us only for minutes, and on the most mundane of errands? No, not at all. Each time they go from our sight we in our secret hearts count them as dead.”I’ll not mention any character by name, save the Gunslinger himself, by King wrung out a surprising amount of emotion from me over the course of this book. There was a Communion scene, a Last Supper of the Ka-tet, if you will, that I found incredibly poignant and wonderfully moving. The religious imagery was beautiful and somehow appropriate. The foretold breaking of the Tet was unspeakably devastating, but I found myself so proud of each character and how they faced down their deaths. I was reminded of the movie Young Guns; they all went out in a blaze of glory, as gunslingers should. They stood, and were true, and no more could possibly have been asked of them.“You needn't die happy when your time comes, but you must die satisfied, for you have lived your life from the beginning to the end and ka is always served.”The character development of Roland since his first appearance in The Gunslinger is astounding. And that’s not something that I really noticed as the series progressed. It hit me all at once, a little over halfway through this novel, in a moment that echoed and answered and recast a moment from that first installment. This was one of the moments were King’s storytelling shone the brightest, even in the midst of devastation. We so often view him as a pulpy writer, because of the types of stories he tells and the frequency of his publication. But he is truly gifted in his craft, and this entire book really displays his brilliance. The ways in which he was able to tie together so many little details from so early on in the series proves how deft a writer he is, in my opinion. There were still issues, of course: his villains remain wholly evil instead of multifaceted; his pop culture references and slang become quickly outdated. And I’m still on the fence about how he portrays women and people of color. But overall, King is an incredibly gifted storyteller who has worked hard to develop his craft, and The Dark Tower is a perfect example of exactly what the man can accomplish with words. I’m in awe.“Even if the torture stops, I’ll die. And you’ll die too, for when love leaves the world, hearts are still. Tell them of my love and tell them of my pain and tell them of my hope, which still lives. For this is all I have and all I am and all I ask.”I love King’s voice, especially when the narrator makes himself known, and that was done with especially great aplomb in this book. It gave a Dickensian feel to the novel, reminiscent of the voice I so enjoyed in Black House, which King co-authored with Peter Straub. But in The Dark Tower , that voice is distinctly and only King’s own, which was made doubly fascinating to me by the fact that King himself is a side character in the story. I know this was a controversial decision, but I felt that it leant an incredible power and reality to the story. Since the idea of the Tower has so dominated King’s mind and writing for so many decades, it only makes sense that he would include himself in the narrative, if only to explain his obsession.“Because talent won't be quiet, doesn't know how to be quiet,"" he said. ""Whether it's a talent for safe-cracking, thought-reading, or dividing ten-digit numbers in your head, it screams to be used. It never shuts up. It'll wake you in the middle of your tiredest night, screaming, 'Use me, use me, use me! I'm tired of just sitting here! Use me, fuckhead, use me!”The Dark Tower itself didn’t disappoint. It was distressingly atmospheric, if that description makes sense. It felt so tangible that I found myself more than a little creeped out. And I have a new appreciation for roses after having read this series and witnessed their power in the story. It will be a long time before I can look at a rose without seeing it as potentially magic. Actually, I hope that never changes. Anything that causes you to see magic in reality is worth holding onto. But I digress. The Tower was beautifully disturbing, repellently compelling, and utterly mysterious. I better understand Roland’s drive after having laid eyes upon it.“and so will the world end, I think, a victim of love rather than hate. For love's ever been the more destructive weapon, sure.”It still completely blows my mind that King got this entire world and series from spaghetti Westerns and a narrative poem written in 1855. I’ve read and reread Robert Browning’s “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came” multiple times throughout my journey with this series, and I’m baffled by how King got this massive story from a poem that is 204 lines, or around 1,700 words, long. And I’m not sure I’ll ever look at Clint Eastwood or watch a Western the same way again. They will forever embody the Gunslinger who so grew on me over the course of his long, arduous journey.“And will I tell you that these … lived happily ever after? I will not, for no one ever does. But there was happiness. And they did live.”If you’ve been skipping ahead to avoid spoilers, you’re safe now. Here is where I wrap up my thoughts and bid goodbye (for now) to the Tower.I can’t believe that I’ve finally reached the Dark Tower. It’s been a pretty incredible journey, and is certainly one that I’ll never forget. There are characters I grew to love along the way who I truly believe will always stay with me. This last installment in the series ran me through the gamut of emotions. I was amused, frightened, moved, enraged and devastated. I know the ending is highly controversial, and that many people despise it, but as I neared the final line I broke out in chills so strong they were painful. Was it a perfect ending? Of course not. But I do strongly believe that it was the right one. Ka is a wheel, after all, and so the story goes on. The Tower abides, and so will this story, forever, in my heart.Long days and pleasant nights, friends.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 06, 2022","Jun 15, 2022","Jun 06, 2022",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5091.The_Dark_Tower

A literary mystery revoThe Cartographers is one of those books that I added to my most anticipated list as soon as the cover and blurb were released. A literary mystery revolving around maps and map-making, with a dose of magical realism to boot? That sounded so very much up my alley that I snatched it up as soon as Book of the Month announced it as a March pick, and have been very much looking forward to it. The fact that it was only in my house for a couple of months before picking up is saying something, as even highly anticipated have my massive TBR to compete with before I manage to get to them. But unfortunately, I think my experience with The Cartographers is a case of letting anticipation spoil whatever is being anticipated, because it fell quite flat for me.“Maps are love letters written to times and places their makers had explored.”I loved everything about this on paper. The premise was enticing, and there’s a very intriguing mystery at the story’s core. The cast of characters is vast and varied, and comes with a helping of found family, which is a trope I adore. All of these characters are very passionate about their unusual niche, that is, cartography and maps in general. The magical realism element gave an entirely new meaning to putting a town on the map; I loved the imagination behind the idea. And the writing was solid, which is always a plus. However, there was something about the execution that just didn’t work for me. First and foremost, the pacing felt off. While Shepherd imbued the story with a tension that made it feel as if it was trying to be fast paced, the actual action of the story felt plodding. And it wouldn’t have, had the tone not felt so tense. The mystery elements that should have been so intriguing also fell flat. I was able to guess every single twist or reveal in the entire novel way before the actual reveals, which was frustrating. I even actively tried not to guess, but I couldn’t ignore all of the clues. Perhaps most disappointing for me were the characters. This had the potential to be such a bright, wonderfully varied cast, full of unique individuals with a ton of personality. But that wasn’t the case, in my opinion. Even those described as being so interesting and magnetic felt bland to me in their execution. And this made the found family trope, which I love so much, feel like a wasted effort.Finally, I felt that The Cartographers defied genre in a negative way. It wasn’t mysterious enough to be a mystery, or thrilling enough to constitute a thriller. The fantastical element wasn’t used strongly enough to term fantasy or ever solidly magical realism, in my opinion. The writing wasn’t bad at all, but wasn’t lyrical or polished enough to slot the book into literary fiction, which would have made the book’s inability to fit neatly into a genre a strength instead of a weakness. While I’m disappointed in the overall execution, there were things that I did truly enjoy about The Cartographers. Namely, the maps themselves. I’ve always really loved maps, and have maps and globes scattered throughout my home as decor. The idea of falling into a map is one that I’ve always found incredibly magical. So the thought of a map itself actually altering the real world in some way immediately drew me in. And seeing these maps through the eyes of people who are so passionate about them was a joyous experience. I love any story revolving around one’s passion for their art or profession or the intersection of both, and The Cartographers really catered to that love. The fact that it’s a more unusual field, one not written about as often as writing or music or other visual arts, made this very much a worthwhile read, regardless of how I felt about the actual plot and characters. And I love that maps as an intersection of science and art was discussed with such devotion through Shepherd’s characters. Even though The Cartographers didn’t live up to my expectations, it is still a book that I’m glad to have read.  If you feel any pull toward this story at all, please don’t let my experience drive you away. Use it to better temper your own expectations, and maybe that will improve your own reading experience. But if the idea of a novel with maps as its focal point intrigues you, The Cartographers is exactly what you’re looking for.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 30, 2022","Jun 09, 2022","May 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55004093-the-cartographers

And speaking of the characters, the main “protagonist” is so often a troubled, unreliable female narrator who is billed as highly intelligent but who is constantly making stupid decisions, and I think it’s a trope that has been radically overdone and should be laid to rest. But after hearing Goodnight Beautiful described as brilliant by readers I trust, and being told to go in as blind as possible, I just couldn’t pass this one up when it was offered as a Book of the Month pick. Except, then I didn’t read it for a year and a half. When I finally did pick up Goodnight Beautiful, I was pretty blown away. About a third of the way in, a twist actually shocked a “What?!” out of me. I couldn’t believe I was not only surprised, but that I was surprised so early into the book! And it didn’t let up from there. Molloy gave her readers multiple twists that I, for one, didn’t see coming. It also gave me as a King fan, a Constant Reader, if you will, an extra little thrill that I very much appreciated. I’m going to say next to nothing about the plot or the characters, as I want to give nothing away. What I will say is that Molloy is an incredibly clever author. Her writing is witty, snarky, and well paced. And she takes overdone tropes and flips them on their heads in really interesting ways. I very much enjoyed her style and getting a peak inside her mind, and I’ll absolutely be trying more of her work. Something that I dislike about most thrillers is that they rely so much on heavy-handed misdirection, the unreliability of their narrators, and the inability of their characters to see things that are right in front of them. Goodnight Beautiful had all of those, but in radically different ways than any other thriller I’ve read before. Also, I felt that Molloy truly nailed her ending.Goodnight Beautiful is a thriller unlike anything else I’ve ever read in the genre. It was incredibly clever, the characters were fascinating, the banter was always witty, and there were multiple twists that I didn’t see coming. I can’t think of anything I didn’t like about it. If this book isn’t only my Top Reads of 2022 list, I’ll be surprised. Goodnight Beautiful is a short book that truly packs a punch, and I can’t wait to press it into the hands of other readers in my life....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 30, 2022","Jun 06, 2022","May 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55335716-goodnight-beautiful

However, I found myself pretty disappointed with the book overall.  While I didn’t hate it, I found that the tale and the structure and especially the characters left much to be desired.“Once the forbidden fruit has been tasted, there’s no going back to paradise. For anyone. Even Peter Pan, it seems. Innocence, once lost, is impossible to regain.”This is the story of Holly Darling, granddaughter of Wendy of Peter Pan fame. They’re obviously an incredibly famous family, and are always in the public eye. Holly suffered devastating loss over a decade ago, when she lost her husband and one of her twin sons in a brutal accident that left her and her other son horribly injured. The survivors have gradually recovered, and in seemingly miraculous ways. Holly uses her brilliant mind to, surprisingly, launch a line of skin-care products that take the world by storm. But she has some dark secrets, and those are about to come back to bite her.“I learned long ago that if you wish to keep your loved ones close, you need to let them leave.”I felt a deep dislike for Holly. The desperation she feels to keep her son Jack from growing up seems so odd to me considering the famous story connected with her family name. Surely the past would have taught her better? And the ways in which she uses the blood of her comatose daughter to not only keep her son healthy, which is at least a bit understandable, but to supplement her company’s beauty products, is more than a little despicable. She makes stupid decisions, doesn’t communicate, and does her best to control everyone in her life. I could find nothing in her character to like. To be honest, none of the main characters were likable. I liked Cook and Nan more than the rest, but they felt very peripheral compared to the rest of the cast.“And what’s at the end of age? Death. Which, it transpires, is not such an appealing adventure after all.”Because of Holly’s character traits and the ways in which the author presented her, she felt very similar to the unreliable narrators so often utilized in domestic thrillers. To be honest, this felt less like a fantasy retelling than a domestic thriller couched loosely in some fairytale elements. And, had the book been presented in this way, I would have known to skip it as domestic thrillers don’t often work for me. “Maybe the line between the real world and the magical one isn’t quite as solid as she thinks.”We know from the start that Peter Pan is cast as a villain in this story, which didn’t surprise me a bit; he’s not even a hero in his own tale. What I didn’t count on, however, was how disfigured of body and spirit he would seem, and how small that would make his personality. I saw none of the magnetism he is so known for in his original story, though we are told that it’s present. It felt like Michalski took away everything that was magical about him and his story and tried to tell something new with the husk. He’s utterly despicable here. Irredeemably so.“I’m not saying it will be okay… I’m saying you’ll get through it.”I’ve been a bit harsh so far, and I know it. Until the last 50 pages or so, I thought that Darling Girl was a 2 or 2.5 star read for me. But those last 50 pages redeemed it and brought it up to 3 stars.  I was satisfied by the ending, and it was in these final pages that Michalski truly showcased her skills as a writer. She had some lovely things to say about love and grief and life in general, and referred back to her source material in clever ways. If the entirety of the novel had the same feel as those last 50 pages, it would have been a much more solidly successful story.“Sometimes it’s easier to remember sorrow than joy… Sorrow doesn’t hurt as much.”Again, I didn’t hate this story, though I disliked it for a large chunk of my time with it. The ending was solid, and improved the characters a bit in my eyes. But it’s not a book I’ll be rereading. Before you pick it up, make sure to check trigger warnings, because things get dark. But if you’re a fan of domestic thrillers and would love to see one with a hint of the fantastical, then you’ll most likely really enjoy Darling Girl.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 16, 2022","May 21, 2022","May 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065362-darling-girl

Here we have portals to other worlds, mythical creatures, magic light The Choice is the epic conclusion of Nora Roberts’ Dragon Heart Legacy trilogy. Here we have portals to other worlds, mythical creatures, magic light and dark, and battles between good and evil on both large scale and small. There is a charming, diverse cast of characters, a couple of lovely romances, and a wonderful emphasis on family, whether bound by blood or chosen by heart. In this trilogy and her last, Chronicles of the One, Nora has made a radical departure from the cozy and comfortable storytelling I fell in love with as a teen. I can see where some lifelong fans of her writing might be disappointed in the shift, but I really respect it. This trilogy, and the one published before it, are stories that I would have no qualms recommending to fantasy fans who have never had much interest in Nora’s work.Nora’s recaps are always incredibly beautiful, poetic in a way that sets the tone for the story even though the voice shifts to something more casual afterward. I wish this type of recap was a standard practice with series, especially fantasy series. It’s been Nora’s standard for years. While I love rereading her books, it’s nice that these recaps are there for when I don’t feel like taking the time to reread them before the next installment comes out.As this is the finale of a trilogy, I’m not going to discuss any specifics of the story. Instead, I want to discuss characters. Our main character, Breen, has grown tremendously from when we were first introduced to her in The Awakening. She has found her path, her voice, herself, and she had is dedicated to staying true to that self. She is fierce, loyal, kind, and funny. I love her relationship with her best friend, Marco, who has also grown tremendously from the first book to this one. However, one thing I have to mention is what I found to be an odd lack of chemistry between Breen and her love interest. The chemistry in Nora’s romances is always palpable, but this one fell a bit flat. I think that’s in part due to her greater focus on a romance for Marco, in which there was far more believable chemistry. But Breen’s love interest, while I liked him as a character, made little sense to me in terms of romantic lead. I just never felt it, all the way through the series. Even at the very end, when things are wrapping up, I appreciated how Nora wrote it but still didn’t feel anything regarding that central romance. I found this pretty disappointing, but as I was deeply invested in the rest of the story, I gave it a pass.I do feel like Nora is getting stronger and stronger at her battle scenes, and the build up needed to have them be impactful. The fantasy aspect of this trilogy was very strong, and I was really impressed by how well balanced a portal fantasy it truly was. We spent time in both main worlds, and I cared about what was happening in both. But the fantasy world itself was beautiful, and was the epitome of everything I consider fantasy at my core. There was magic and fey and mythical beings and dragons and so much more. Talamh has joined the ranks of the fictional places I would most love to visit, alongside Narnia and Hogwarts.The Choice was a great ending to a very solid fantasy trilogy. I highly recommend this if you’re looking for a fantasy story with a classic, poetic feel that also includes a lot of diverse representation and a romantic subplot or two. Even when Nora puts you through the wringer during a story, you can also aways trust her to provide a happy ending. And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 13, 2022","Dec 17, 2022","May 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808200-the-choice

And though I still wouldn’t consider it a bad book by any meansSong of Susannah is the penultimate installment in King’s magnum opus, The Dark Tower. And though I still wouldn’t consider it a bad book by any means, I do believe it’s the weakest in the series since The Gunslinger. That being said, I still very much enjoyed my time in this world and with these characters. I was absorbed the entire time, and the tension was palpable. Even when King isn’t at his best, there’s something about his writing that just sucks me in and won’t let me go, even after I’ve read the final pages.“In the Land of Memory the time is always Now.In the Kingdom of Ago, the clocks tick... but their hands never move.There is an Unfound Doorand memory is the key which opens it.”First, let’s talk about what didn’t work for me in this particular installment. The way King writes women isn’t my favorite. Something about it gives me the ick. I feel like he’s not at all sexist or racist, and yet there are unintentional undertones of both in his writing. This is something that I try to overlook, as I’m so enraptured by the stories he tells, but it’s hard to do so when so much of this particular book is coming from the perspective of a black woman. Another drawback to this installment, at least for me, is that the ka-tet has ben divided in three. This division gave the entire novel a disjointed feel that books 2-5 did not suffer. I missed the camaraderie of the group as a whole.“Anger is the most useless emotion… destructive to the mind and hurtful to the heart.”Now, onto the things that I did enjoy. King is killer (no pun intended) at capturing a particular time and place in our reality, which he’s done multiple times over in Song of Susannah. Most of the action takes place in our world across various times and places, and I never had any trouble remembering where and when we were in the narrative. He’s also brilliant as his characterizations. While his handling of Susannah was problematic at times, overall all of the members of the ka-tet, from Roland on down to Oy, are fantastically well fleshed-out and are very sympathetic. I’ve come to care tremendously about all of these characters, whether they’ve been around for one book or all of them. King also did a great job with the horror elements of this book, specifically in the final quarter. Which I’m sure surprises no one. And the action was propulsive, as always.“When you came right down to it, how did anyone know they weren’t a character in some writer’s story, or a transient thought in some bus-riding schmoe’s head, or a momentary mote in God’s eye?”Beyond here lie mild spoilers, so proceed at your own risk. They’re spoilers that I was aware of before even starting my Dark Tower journey, and were actually one of the reasons I was excited to read the series, but if you want to go in totally blind, skip the next paragraph.In this book, Stephen King introduces himself as a character. The hutzpah of this man, to not only writing himself into the story but make himself its creator even within the pages. It’s a level of meta that could have backfired horribly. And did, with many readers. But not with all, and not with me. I love all things meta, so this decision on King’s part appeals to me deeply. My favorite part of this entire book was the inclusion of the Coda at the end of the novel, which gave us some of King’s journal entries as he wrote the series. I can’t wait to see what role he plays in the final installment.“The wind blows and the story comes. Then it stops blowing, and all I can do is wait, same as you. They think I'm in charge, every one of them from the smartest of the critics to the most mentally challenged reader. And that's a real hoot. Because I'm not.”End spoilers.“Pain rises. From the heart to the head pain rises.”I can’t believe we’re coming to the end of the road. Song of Susannah was my 23rd read out of 24 on my journey to the Dark Tower. The end is so close I can almost smell the Rose. I’m ready to see the gang all back together again, and to join them on this final leg of their quest. King has crafted something truly special with this series, and with the ways in which he’s tied in so many of his other works. I just hope that the final reveal is worthy of all the buildup. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 14, 2022","May 19, 2022","May 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12391741-song-of-susannah

The ways in which this book informed an entire genreActual rating: 3.5 stars, rounded up.It’s been fifteen years or more since I last read Peter Pan. The ways in which this book informed an entire genre or age bracket of books is fascinating. The amount of retellings, or stories more loosely inspired by this one, that exist in the world is mind-boggling. I don’t know the exact number, but Peter Pan has undoubtedly been the fount from which near-countless other stories have sprung. It’s one of those tales that just about everyone knows to some extent, but it’s fun to go back and see what is in the actual source material. While the story’s influence is undeniable, I have to confess that this is not among my favorite children’s classics. I feel like there’s no one to really root for aside from Mrs. Darling, and Barrie’s writing sometimes feels as though he was trying to hard to be cheeky and clever. But Peter Pan’s staying power is nearly unmatched, and our society would be just a little dimmer without him in it.Barrie’s writing style is tongue-in-cheek, whimsical nonsense. I love a present narrator, like in a Dickens novel. That’s what we have here, and he has a personality all his own. He sometimes feels a bit forced in comparison to narrators from Dickens or Thackeray, but it was still a fun addition. The writing feels cheeky, for lack of a better word. And yet, there’s also something occasionally mean or malicious about it. The voice can be as unfeeling as it claims that the children within its pages are naturally. I actually found myself comparing it often to Carroll’s writing in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. However, I think the nonsensical setting and plot of Carroll’s novel made this type of tone work a bit more seamlessly with his work. Barrie’s felt off on occasion and wasn’t quite as successful, in my opinion.There is nothing heroic about Peter Pan as a character. He is, ultimately, an eternal child, and he exhibits more of the failings of a child than the more positive attributes of one. He is selfish, and self-absorbed, and above all, a showboat. He cares about nothing and no one more than himself and being admired. He’s callous and forgetful and more than a little cruel. He’s willfully ignorant, as he fears that learning will lead to him possibly growing up. And yet, despite all of his flaws, he there’s something incredibly magnetic about him. He’s charming when he wants to be, and effortlessly charismatic. The way everyone defers to him drives me bonkers, but I guess that’s just part of his powerful personality. Again, Peter Pan is not my favorite children’s classic, but it has definitely stood the test of time. If I were rating for cultural significance, I would give this 5 stars. If I were rating for my own enjoyment, I would give it 3. Thus, I decided to split the difference. This is a whimsical tale in all of its forms, but it’s alway interesting to go back to the original. It gave Peter his wish; with his fame, he will forever be the boy who never grew up....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 12, 2022","May 16, 2022","May 12, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16101115-peter-pan

Talk about settInterpreter of Maladies is Jhumpa Lahiri’s debut short story collection, and was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2000. Talk about setting a high standard for yourself! After having read this, I believe it was absolutely deserving of such a prestigious award. This collection is incredible. It’s a series of vastly different lives, connected only but heritage. Age, sex, lifestyle, career, marital status, income bracket, happiness level, and even the continent on which they currently live varies dramatically from narrator to narrator. The only thing they share is their origin: India. Some were born in America to Indian parents. Some are immigrants, whether willingly or unwillingly. Some live their entire lives in India. But all of them were beautifully real, with a heritage that mattered to some of them more deeply than others, but to all of them at the core. Every single story in the collection was lovely and thoughtful in its way, but a handful stood out as favorites, which I’ll discuss briefly below. “A Temporary Matter” is about an average day in a average life, with one odd thing throwing off the day as one thing has been throwing off the life. It’s the story of grief ungrieved, and how loss can drive apart those it should bring together. And asks if you can always find a way to bridge that chasm, or if there’s a point of no return. It discusses the small ways we let things go after tragedy; messes uncleaned, a lack of motivation, an unwillingness to leave home, a dislike of former routines, etc. This story hit hard, especially with the ages of the couple and the inability to have children when that was something they had so unthinkingly planned for themselves. Lahiri crafted an aching snapshot of a life that was poignant without being maudlin. It felt honest about the pain without reveling in the pain.“Mrs. Sen’s” is the story of Elliot, your average American 11-year-old, and Mrs. Sen, the Indian immigrant who begins babysitting him after school. You learn about her culture through Elliot’s eyes, and you also see her deep longing for home and her silent refusal to adapt to life in a new land. She is determined to keep her traditions and willfully ignorant of things that would make her life in America easier, like learning to drive. Elliot grows to love her, though he never says as much, and he witnesses the ways that homesickness can make one truly sick, and the depression that Mrs. Sen suffers as she longs for home and loathes this new life that is nothing like she expected. I found this story incredibly sad, but deeply thought-provoking.“This Blessed House” was probably my favorite story in the collection. Twinkle is a free spirit, and is impossible for Sanj, her husband and our narrator, to understand. He is a very traditional, erudite man and, when they purchase their first home together, cannot understand Twinkle’s fascination with the various kitschy religion objects the (obviously Catholic) former owners left scattered about. They’re Hindu, he insists, and have no reason in the world to keep such tacky objects for a completely different religion. But Twinkle finds them charming and delightful and wonderfully irreverent, insisting that they not only keep the items but display them, as they are signs that the house is blessed. Set around this disagreement, we see Sanj struggle with the fact that, just sharing a heritage doesn’t mean you actually have anything in common. He had distinct plans, specific things he wanted in a wife, and Twinkle is none of those. Sanj wonders how he ended up here and whether he made a mistake, and yet, though he doesn’t understand the delight she finds in little things, deep down he is obviously charmed by her or he wouldn’t have married her. She’s not classy and elegant and traditional, but she’s full of life. When they throw their first house party, do we watch Sanj fall in love with Twinkle through the eyes of others? I’m still not sure, because the ending was ambiguous, but I like to think so.“The Third and Final Continent” was a beautifully poignant way to end the collection. Our narrator has recently moved to America for a job, and takes a room with an incredibly elderly woman. He’s also recently married, though his wife is barely real to him, as their marriage was arranged and he left shortly after the wedding. This story wasn’t about much of anything, except for the narrator being in awe of this elderly lady and him finding a way to sympathize with and eventually grow to love his wife when she comes to join him in the states. There was just something about the ending that felt beautifully hopeful, his looking back on his life across three continents and how his “ordinary achievements” in the eyes of others are beyond anything he could have imagined for himself. It’s a lovely sentiment.The other five stories in the collection were wonderful, as well. Though strangely, if I had to choose a least favorite, it would be the story for which the collection was named. But all in all, the entire book was a wonderful read. This was one of those rare books that had me pausing to contemplate frequently. It’s also one of the few that had me constantly pausing to jot down notes on my phone. Interpreter of Maladies is a quiet collection, incredibly thoughtful without spelling anything out for the reader. Any conclusions we come to, any deep and philosophical concepts we pick up on, are ours; Lahiri merely facilitated without throwing out any of her own opinions. I love when an author can strike that balance, of provoking deep thought without planting it themselves. If you’ve read The Secret Lives of Church Ladies by Deesha Philyaw and enjoyed it, I think this collection will really speak to you. That’s the only other book I’ve read that collects such disparate lives with one binding feature, and while I enjoyed that one, Interpreter of Maladies hit harder for me....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 10, 2022","May 14, 2022","May 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44165800-interpreter-of-maladies

For some reasonHamnet is one of those novels that I thought sounded incredible when I first heard about it, but that I was always nervous to pick up. For some reason I was under the impression that O’Farrell wrote lighter, more mundane fare, and I wasn’t sure how well such an author would be able to capture a tale so intrinsic to the man we consider one of the greatest writers to ever grace the earth. I could not have been more mistaken. O’Farrell was more than equal to the task. Her writing is exquisite; passionate, lyrical, and resonate. I was awed by the beauty of her prose, and impressed by the story she wove. The present tense voice of both timelines in the story was difficult to adjust to at first. However, I ended up really appreciating this writing decision, as it made both timelines feel like intertwining Acts in a play. This made the reader into an observer, watching the action play out without the players being aware of their audience. This also leant made the story feel vaguely Grecian, as the players in Greek tragedies aren’t aware of their impending suffering, while the audience has known from the very beginning that something terrible is coming, and often know exactly what that terrible something entails. I felt that this air of tragedy and the present tense telling of the story very much called to mind Shakespeare’s own writing.Something I loved about this tale is that Shakespeare is never referred to as such. He is the Latin Tutor, the son of the glover, Agnes’s husband, Hamnet’s father, or the playwright in London. He is not the star of this production. The two leads are Agnes and Hamnet, and unnamed Will takes a backseat to their stories. And yet, he feels more real to me after having read this novel than he ever did after reading or watching something more blatantly focused on him and his life.  I absolutely fell in love with our two leads, but especially with Agnes. O’Farrell gave voice to a woman who is barely a footnote in history, known only for her marriage to Shakespeare. But in this novel, Agnes is tangibly real, an incredibly well developed character and profoundly unique. Is she a witch, or just uncommonly bright in a time when intellect in women was vehemently discouraged? I love how she revels in nature, and reads it so much more clearly than anyone else in her life. Aside for, perhaps, her one full-blooded brother, Bartholomew. Who, as an aside, was such a wonderfully solid character, and I actually wish we would’ve gotten just a bit more of him.Hamnet is a sunbeam personified in the rememberings of others, and yet we meet him in a panic over the sudden sickness of Judith, his twin. His relationship with his twin was both lovely and devastatingly sad. It’s hard getting attached to the character when you know from the very first page that said character is going to die, but O’Farrell made it impossible not to love him. The ways in which O’Farrell portrayed grief were powerful and felt very true. I’ve witnessed the overwhelming grief shown by a mother losing her son, through my mother-in-law as she mourned the loss of my husband’s brother. Agnes’s grief was just as brutal and just as real. The ways in which Agnes sank into a depression and lost sight of what she still had, how she resented the nature she once loved so dearly for not mirroring her emotions, resonated deeply. I was often reminded of Lincoln in the Bardo, a novel that has much in common with this one but was far less raw and real and relatable, at least to me. There were fewer players, and thus fewer distractions, in Hamnet, and that made the grief more powerfully palpable.I loved the windows into life in this time period, whether in the city or on the farm. Both were fascinating and well described. O’Farrell nailed the atmosphere in both homes. And yet, one complaint I have is that some scenes were so overly descriptive that they felt plodding, which shouldn’t have been the case as this novel is less than 400 pages. But the insight given into life in this era made up for the places that bogged down in the details. And there were a few of those details, like the presence of plague masks in England at the time of Hamnet’s death, that I’m not sure were actually historically accurate, though it worked very well as a plot device. These two concerns, especially the faltering pacing, were the sole reasons that this wasn’t a 5 star read for me.Hamnet is a beautiful, tragic story. You know before reading the first page exactly how things will end, and yet it’s still devastating to read O’Farrell’s imaginings of how the loss of a child effects a family, and what that loss looks like when it strikes the heart of someone as famous as William Shakespeare. This foreknowledge is Hamnet’s death was what made this novel truly feel like a Shakespearean tragedy in both form and content. The ending of this book was absolutely stellar, and gave me actual chills. I think Hamlet will be more powerful to me than it has ever been before, and I’m eager to see if I’m right....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"May 09, 2022","May 18, 2022","May 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59444219-hamnet

The world Townsend has built in the city of Nevermoor is absolutely delightful. It is enchanting and magical but by no means safe, and I love that dichotomy. The characters populating the series are just as captivating, and I’m including the antagonists in that description. Morrigan is a very easy protagonist to root for; she’s quirky and lovable and flawed and filled bursting with good intentions. Townsend has created something truly special in this series.The eponymous Hollowpox is a freakish, unexplained and unpredictable plague ravaging the Wunimal population of Nevermoor. The Wunimals are sentient, often incredibly talented animals with varying degrees of more humanoid characteristics. I love the idea of them, and am sure that they also charm and enchant the younger audience for whom they are intended. So when these Wunimals began falling prey to Hollowpox, I was just as concerned as Morrigan and Jupiter and the gang, and just as desperate for answers and a cure. Townsend did a wonderful job of getting me quickly invested in the plot. She also did a fabulous job of using this plague that targeted only the Wunimals to set them at odds with the human population and instill fear and prejudice and a lack of empathy within part of her fictional population. This mirrored the bigotry of the Red Scare and other such real-life issues in interesting ways and would make for a great jumping off point to discuss such ignorant, biased paranoia and suspicion with any child in your life who decided to read these books. I found it very thought provoking, though I have to confess that there were times when I got a tiny bit bogged down in the political machinations of it all, which is the sole reason this book wasn’t a solid 5 star read for me.I loved watching Morrigan get more education in her field, but sometimes I wanted to shake her. She became so consumed by her access to new knowledge that she forgot about the wonderful group of friends and found family she had accumulated. As someone whose first decade or more of existence were marked by an utter lack of love and affection being shown towards her, you would think that it would take longer for Morrigan to begin taking such loving relationships for granted. But, of course, she grows and changes over the course of the narrative, and having that type of failing gave her something from which to learn. But the education portion of her story was truly fascinating. The ways in which she was finally able to learn more about this power at the core of herself was wonderful, and I’m eager for more on that front.The supporting cast of the series is so wonderful. I have come to truly adore Jupiter. He is more than Morrigan’s patron in the Wondrous Society; he is the father figure she deserves. His love for her and Jack and the other important beings in his life is palpable. He’s not without failings, but he just reminded me so much of The Doctor from Doctor Who, specifically a mix of Tennant and Smith, that I can’t help but adore everything about him. I also love Fenestra, the giant, snarky Magnifcat who is Jupiter’s right hand. I love everyone working at the Hotel Deucalion almost as much as I love the Deucalion itself; the hotel is a character in its own right, with tons of personality. I also love Unit 919 and Miss Cheery and the school experience that 919 is sharing. I’m even fascinated by the aforementioned antagonist, who shall remain as nameless as Morrigan’s gift in any of my s of the series. But I’m so entranced by the character, and hopeful that we’ll get more of them in the fourth installment.Hollowpox is a fantastic middle-grade fantasy that I know for a fact is just as much fun for adults as it is for its intended audience. This entire series is a treasure, and is so far incredibly solid across every installment. I’ll be eagerly awaiting the publication of the fourth book, Silverborn, in October, and every other book Townsend blesses us with, both in this series and in anything else she puts to page. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"May 07, 2022","May 12, 2022","May 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56221172-hollowpox

This collection brought to mind the very little Wendell Berry and Marilynne Robinson I’ve read in her reverence for nature. This reverence of the natural world is what bound all of these poems into a more cohesive unit.Some of this, the more structured areas of the collection, I liked very much. Others, the more free flowing, stream-of-consciousness selections, didn’t resonate with me at all. For poems so firmly rooted in the physical realm, they tended to feel very ephemeral, which is a writing choice I always have difficulty connecting with. However, there were certain lines that resonated so strongly. While I might not have fallen in love with her style, I can easily see why it speaks so deeply to others.I went into this collection hoping that I was going to find a new favorite poet in Oliver. I’ve heard such wonderful things about her work, and she has influenced so many artists whose own work I already love dearly. Unfortunately, I just couldn’t quite connect with her style and voice, even if I found her subject matter beautiful. I find myself greatly respecting her, but I don’t see her as someone whose work I’ll be dipping back into with any frequency. That being said, age changes taste, so perhaps I’ll revisit her in a few years and find that we finally resonate with one another....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 03, 2022","May 29, 2022","May 03, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53003428-devotions

But then I read Castle in the Air, and was delighted to find that it was just as charmingly whimsical as the story that spawned it. So I went into House of Many Ways with understandably high hopes. Unfortunately, the trilogy ended on a bit of a low note. While this book wasn’t bad in any sense of the word, it simply didn’t live up to its predecessors. I think my disappointment is in large part due to the fact that House of Many Waysdidn’t have a likable protagonist. While Charmaine Baker did grow throughout the course of the novel, she started out a bit insufferable and never found her way all the way out of it. She starts off spoiled, coddled, and lazy, never mind willfully ignorant when it comes to tasks she finds distasteful, and those traits are still definitely present by the story’s end. And our main side character, Peter, wasn’t much more likable. He had some work ethic, yes, but he was a world-class bumbler who never seemed to learn from his mistakes. Even the returning characters I love so much were irksome on occasion. My favorite character in the entire book was Waif. Who is a dog. And not even a talking one. On paper, the idea behind the House of Many Ways itself was a fun one. However, it didn’t quite hold up in comparison to the Moving Castle that I’ve so grown to love. The House was meant to be confusing and unknowably vast, but sadly it also came across as vague in its construction. There’s something very concrete about Howl’s Castle, even though it’s mysterious and fantastical. The House of Many Ways didn’t share that trait, feeling unfortunately ephemeral and thus impossible to love as fully as the Castle. There were some wonderfully charming magical elements, but it ultimately felt two-dimensional next to the Castle.While I wasn’t as enraptured by House of Many Ways as I had hoped I would be, I still loved Jones’s writing style and world building. There’s just something utterly delightful about her work, even when I have complaints. This series is one I would without hesitation press into the hands of any child who loves whimsy and is delighted by the fantastical. Or any adult who loves the same, and still has a soft spot for more innocent stories like are typically found in middle grade works.

I didn’t expectThis is another of those books that’s been sitting on my shelf for years, but news of an upcoming adaption made me finally pick it up. I didn’t expect to love The Essex Serpent. I bought it at a library sale because the cover is stunning, but it sounded more than a bit slow, and I’m not a huge reader of historical fiction. However, when Tom Hiddleston was cast as one of the leads in the television series, I knew I had to finally dust it off and read it. I’m so incredibly thankful that I did, because this novel was gorgeous. I was incredibly surprised by how much I ended up loving it.“If love were an archer someone had put out its eyes, and it went stumbling about, blindly letting loose its arrows, never meeting its mark.”First off, I have to talk about Perry’s writing style. The prose is dense but lovely, Dickensian in both thoughtfulness and verbosity. It might be wordy, but each of those words matters. Her voice is somehow a fascinating dichotomy of powerful and subtle; powerful in that it’s clear and consistent throughout, and subtle in that it quietly takes a backseat to the narrative and never overwhelms it. Perry does a very good job of showing what characters are thinking and feeling through their own actions instead of simply telling us what emotions are currently ruling them, which I very much appreciated. She also has a deft touch with her descriptions. They’re beautiful and evokative without ever bogging down the reader and dragging them from the story. I have to confess that at least a star of my rating is strictly owing to the awe the writing itself inspired within me.“Not even knowledge takes all the strangeness from the world.” Let me set the scene. London, 1893. Cora Seaborne finds herself suddenly free in a way most women of her time and place never experience. She’s a young, wealthy widow with a sharp, scientific mind and the means by which to travel in search of the ancient but undiscovered. When she hears tale of the Essex Serpent, a mysterious and rarely-sighted creature potentially roaming the backwater marshes, she is drawn to the area in hopes of proving the mystical actually prehistoric. Here she meets William Ransome, the parish parson, and they strike up an unlikely friendship. From here, their lives, and the lives of those they love, will change unerringly and irrevocably.“…you cannot always keep yourself away from things that hurt you. We all wish we could, but we cannot: to live at all is to be bruised.”The writing is, as I already stated, exquisite, and the proposed tale is an interesting one. But then there are the characters, and this cast is where I believe the true magic of the story lies. Cora is a radically uncommon woman, portrayed as almost masculine in her mannerisms and intellect. She has a strained relationship with her young son, Francis, who would likely be on the autism spectrum today. Martha, Francis’s nanny, is brusk and canny in her own right, and is fiercely loyal and protective of her mistress. Dr. Luke Garrett, the physician who attended Cora’s husband until death, strikes up an easy friendship with Cora and swiftly falls in love with her. Stella Ransome, the parson’s wife, immediately takes to Cora when she comes to their village. Stella is beautiful and kind and fragile, and it’s impossible not to love her. Then there’s William Ransome, the aforementioned parson who finds instant, almost unwanted rapport with Cora despite their profound differences. You see, Cora is sure that there is truly a creature in the marsh, while Will refuses to even acknowledge it, calling the superstition plaguing his parish The Trouble instead. And there are even more characters who, though not what I could consider main characters, are wonderfully fleshed out. I was so impressed by the dimensionality with which Perry was able imbue such an extensive cast.“I think it possible to put flesh on the bones of our terrors, most of all when we have turned our back on God.”While the mystery of the Serpent is of course at the forefront of the story and the minds of its characters, I felt that the true theme of the novel was friendship, the different forms it can take and the ways in which it changes. My favorite friendship in the novel was that between Cora and Will, which was the most central to the story. These two have such opposing views on so many aspects of life, and yet they were almost instant bosom friends, to take a term from Anne of Green Gables. Their relationship brought to the narrative the age old question of how well religion can co-exist with science, as well as why they are so often seemingly at odds. This is a topic that has always endlessly fascinated me, and I thought Perry utilized her characters to present a very well balanced argument for both sides, without ever using them as mouthpieces to push her own views. I have the utmost respect for how she was able to let her characters have their own points of view without forcing them to present her own.“We both speak of illuminating the world, but we have different sources of light, you and I.”I had feared that this novel would be slow, and I wasn’t wrong. But I didn’t mind that in the least.  It felt true to life, full of small, quiet dramas that build to larger dramas until quieting down once again. Whether these were individual, medical dramas, interrelational friendship dramas, or the more village-wide dramas of mass superstition boiling to a head, Perry handled all of these in ways that felt organic and realistic. The intersectionality of these dramas, how they all tied into one another while still being very much their own issues, also felt true. This novel gave me so much food for thought in so many ways, and I know I’ll be thinking on it for months to come.“It was necessary to be afraid in order to have courage.”The Essex Serpent is literary fiction of the highest order. What I mean is that the writing is not only beautiful, but is also beautifully wielded to paint a masterpiece of a story, which would never have worked without prose of this caliber. What could have been boring or plodding instead ended up being enchanting and transporting and purposefully meandering. I have the utmost respect for this novel and its author, and am very thankful for the lovely cover that convinced me to pick up a story I thought for sure wouldn’t hold my interest. It’s one of the rare instants where I love being proven wrong.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,May 2022,"May 09, 2022","May 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35820391-the-essex-serpent

But when Maura, Ginny’s Forever Mom, becomes pregnant, and Ginny exhibits some concerning behavior with the electronic plastic baby they give her to practice with, life gets a lot more complicated.Ginny’s fixation on her Baby Doll that was left behind when she was taken from Gloria, her Birth Mom, is the source of nearly all of her behavioral issues with her new family. Nothing they offer her can break this fixation. When the reason behind her fixation finally comes to light, things spiral, bringing the past into Ginny’s present in detrimental ways. Her future is up in the air, and I just desperately wanted her to be okay.This novel made me so sad. Things wrapped up alright, but I spent most of the book just heartbroken for everyone involved in the story. And, honestly, mad at most of them, at least some of the time. Ginny’s is a tough situation, made tougher by her inability to always communicate what she needs to, or always understand what she’s told. I know this would have to be a high-stress situation, especially with a newborn thrown into the mix. But there were times when I just desperately wanted people, especially Maura, to give Ginny a bit more grace and show her more love.Ludwig wrote this book from a place of understanding. He is himself an adoptive parent, and he and his wife adopted a teenager with autism. I thought Ginny’s voice was lovingly, carefully captured. While I can’t know what it’s like to be autistic, and neither can Ludwig from a personal perspective, I felt that he told this story in a way that was respectful, believable, and relatable. I grew to love Ginny, and wanted nothing more than for the people in her life to truly see her. And they did. She was surrounded by a very supportive cast. Mistakes were made, especially in the cases of both Ginny’s Birth Mom and her Forever Mom, but both still felt realistic and sympathetic even when I wanted to shake them for their actions. Ginny Moon is a story, and a character, with a ton of heart. While I struggled with it in the beginning, it ultimately won me over. It was hard to read at times, but the payoff was worth it.

I bought this and the next three books in the series literal years ago, because I thought that the cover art was gorgeous. And there they have sat since I pulled them from their packaging. I very randomly decided this week that they had wasting away, unread and thus unloved, for more than long enough. I’m glad I did, because I ate up this little book in two sittings and enjoyed my time with it. While brief, this is not a light read. They Mostly Come Out at Night is a dark, folklore-inspired fantasy that edges the tiniest bit into horror during certain scenes. Unlike our Disney-fied fairy tales, this is not a story in which they all live happily ever after. There is death here, and more than a little brutality. It’s got teeth. I know this the rest of the series is a loose one, comprised of standalone with very little in common, But I was intrigued enough by the style to continue sometime in the future. Especially considering I already own three more of them.My favorite element of this little book was the inclusion of original folktales between each chapter of the main narrative. This is where Patrick’s voice and style shone the brightest and steadiest. He beautifully captured the tone of a good fairytale, the blend of whimsy and darkness and the singsong quality to the writing. Honestly, I could have happily read a much longer book of just these original folktales. They felt both fresh and timeless, cheeky and serious, and I was very impressed with the balance in their telling. If the rest of the story had felt this effortlessly confident and smooth, it would have been an easy 5 stars. However, the writing in the other two-thirds or more of the book did not in fact have that same ease. There were moments of it, yes, but they were undercut by spans of the book where I felt that I was being told a synopsis of what happened after the fact, instead of being shown the action as it occurred. And, strangely enough, this issue wasn’t the worst during the dream sequences, but during the main narrative.We have two perspective characters, in a sense. First we have Lonan, the village outcast who has been blamed for the brutal death of his own father and others, as well as the mauling of the girl he loved. He never developed his Knack, a useful talent that each person in this area develops into an almost supernatural affinity. These Knacks could be anything, from cooking to healing to blacksmithing. Lonan’s father was a blacksmith with a wonderfully robust Knack, and Lonan should have followed in his footsteps. Instead, his life was highjacked by his rival in the village following the night his father was killed, and Lonan ekes out his life on the fringes. That is, until the dreams begin. This brings us to our secondary perspective character: Adahy. He is the son and heir of the great Magpie King, ruler and protector of the realm. Somehow, Lonan and Adahy are linked, and Lonan begins to see some of the truth behind the myths of the Magpie King. With his village suddenly in greater danger than ever before, Lonan must step out of his obscurity to protect them.I liked Lonan just fine, and found Adahy on the likable side of tolerable. But neither won me over in any kind of meaningful way. Whether this was due to novel length, or writing style, or something else I can’t put my finger on, I couldn’t tell you. I will say that I was far more invested in the aforementioned folktales that were woven in between the chapters. Patrick’s voice in these was charming and witty, and I was always a bit sad when they were over and we had to return to the “real” story. I know this was his debut, so I’m interested to see if his style becomes more seemless in his later novels.They Mostly Come Out at Night was wonderfully different than my usual read. It transported me into a world that was different and interesting, but which I would never want to visit outside of the book’s pages. Knowing that this was a self-published debut made me even more impressed with the overall quality of the book, from the writing to the editing to the cover art and print-type. If you’re a fan of darker fantasy, folklore, and a dash of horror, then I recommend this one. ...more",Notes are private!,1,7,1,"Apr 26, 2022","Apr 30, 2022","Apr 26, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29743933-they-mostly-come-out-at-night

Picking up almost immediately after the ending of The Book of Three, this novel is probably the most well-known of the series, as it was the basis for the 1985 Disney animated feature of the same name. Taran and the friends he made in the first book embark on a new adventure here, this time to help capture, and hopefully destroy, the Black Cauldron, which can birth unkillable zombie warriors and thus raise an unbeatable army if left in the hands of Arwen, their enemy.I have to say, I enjoyed this book a good deal more than The Book of Three. I didn’t find the characters nearly as annoying. Taran has already gone through a good deal of character development by the end of this second novel, and has grown on me tremendously. He’s not nearly as annoying as when he was first introduced, though his temper can still run away with him when he isn’t looking. Eilonwy has grown on me a bit, as well, though she is still often snide and shrewish in ways that make me roll my eyes. But my favorite characters are actually supporting roles: Fflewdur the errant bard with the lie-detecting harp; and Gurgi, the much furrier, cuter, sweeter, braver Gollum-esque being. Gurgi is just freaking adorable. I was iffy on him in the first book, though his manner of speaking softened me up to him. By this book, however, I was a huge fan, and very excited to see him again.I felt like the narration and plot both made more sense in The Black Cauldron than in The Book of Three, and that the pacing was more on point. I read this little book in the span of 24 hours, and I never felt like it dragged in any section. There were plot twists that I predicted from very early on in the story, but instead of being annoyed by having guessed so early, I was gratified when proven correct. This removed some of the tension from the story, but I don’t think that would be the case for the age range that are the intended audience.While this isn’t a series that I was familiar with in my own childhood, I can see why it holds such a special place in the memories of others. Including my husband, who loved these books as a child. If you’re a lover of epic fantasy and looking for an easy-to-digest version through which you can introduce the kids in your life to the genre that holds your heart, this would be a fantastic choice. I’m interested to see where Taran’s journey takes him and his friends next....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 23, 2022","Apr 28, 2022","Apr 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24784.The_Black_Cauldron

This is a series with a wonderfully lovable and multifaceted main character, a diverse and entertaining supporting cast, a delightfully unique setting that manages to feel both inviting and dangerous, plenty of tension, and strong enough writing and pacing to carry such an original story. I’m only two books in, but I would already feel secure in saying that Nevermoor is a nearly perfect middle grade fantasy series that I would happily, and eagerly, press into the hands of any young (or young-at-heart) reader I know.In this book, we start to plumb the secret depths of the Wundrous Society as Morrigan and the rest of Unit 919 embark on the first leg of their schooling. We get to see the relationships that develop between Morrigan and her fellow unit members and teachers, and how hard she has to work in order to win anyone over once they find out the truth of her “knack,” the talent that makes her special and worthy of membership into the Wundrous Society. This would have been a miserable first year for Morrigan if not for her best friend, Hawthorne Swift the dragon rider, and Miss Cheery, Unit 919’s Conductor, who acts as a combination of bus driver and homeroom teacher and guidance counselor. Of all the newly introduced characters, she was my favorite. Her closest competition was actually Hawthorne’s parents, who reminded me of the Weasleys from Harry Potter. They were quirky and charming and utterly delightful for the few pages in which they appeared. Morrigan is a strong, interesting young woman who is far edgier in appearance than she is on the inside, and I find her incredibly easy to cheer on. She has enough flaws to be believable while still being firmly planted on the side of good which, given her talents and situation, is laudable. I have loved seeing her grow and develop over the course of this book and the first, and I can’t wait to see how she changes in the rest of the series. Townsend has done a marvelous job with Morrigan’s voice, maintaining its consistency even as she grows and keeping a balance between her secret hopes and her completely understandable pessimism in light of the life she’s led thus far. I remain fascinated by the land of Nevermoor in general; it sounds like such a delightfully magical place, and I would place it at the very top of the list of fictional places I would love to visit. I’m also intrigued by the Wundrous Society in particular, and was excited to learn more about them in this book. Unfortunately, I felt that the Society’s decision to hold Morrigan at arm’s length in her education kept me as a reader in the dark, as well, which was frustrating. But that’s really the only complaint I have, and the only reason I deducted a half star from my rating. I was happy that we get to spend so much more time in the Hotel Deucalion, and I loved ever minute Jupiter was present. I, like Morrigan, wished I could pin him down and make him stay longer.Wundersmith introduced some intriguing magic and compelling new characters, while never neglecting what we had already been given in the first book. This is a world that I fell in love with immediately, and that love only seems to deepen the longer I spend there.  I can’t wait to see where Townsend takes Morrigan and her Unit next, and what happens with the Deucalion and the Society and all of the wonderful characters who populate both. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 19, 2022","Apr 26, 2022","Apr 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44286528-wundersmith

But I was determined to get past that first book, because I know King views The Dark Tower as his magnum opus and I really wanted to at least try to read that. Then I got to The Drawing of the Three and fell in love it. I couldn’t help but think that it would be the highlight of the entire series for me, but then I read The Wastelands. And Wizard and Glass. And The Wind Through the Keyhole. And I’ve loved them all just as much. Wolves of the Calla was no exception. I would have never thought that a western-horror-fantasy would become one of my favorite series of all time, and yet here we are. If King doesn’t drop the ball in the last two books, this will have quite possibly been the most epic literary experience of my life.Roland and his Ka-Tet find themselves in Calla Bryn Sturgis, a small town in Mid-World that is raided by Wolves once a generation. And that time is upon them again. But the Wolves to raid for money, or supplies. They raid for children. Twins are far more common in the Calla than singletons, as they call them, and one twin from each pair, between the ages of three or so and puberty, will be taken. They aren’t kept forever. Oh no. They’re returned. But they come back broken. Roont, if you will. When Gunslingers come to town, will the Calla finally stand and fight for their children? Or will fear of repercussions keep them docile?I found the Calla and its inhabitants plenty interesting, but I was always fascinated when New York came back into the picture. King made his own multiverse before the MCU popularized the idea. I’ve been taking the scenic route to the Tower, which means that this was book number 22 on my journey instead of number 5. I’ve loved seeing how he manages to connect everything. This is the Cosmere for horror fans. Interconnected series and worlds were why I loved Ted Dekker so much as a teen, but I’m almost positive he had to have gotten some of his inspiration from King. I feel like so many of the fandoms I love with my entire heart owe King at least a nod or something. The connections he has built into his novels are mind-blowing, and I can’t wait to see how he ties things together at the end of the main series. Even if he doesn’t stick the landing, as he is prone to do, the journey itself will have been worth it. But I really, really hope he sticks the landing.If you haven’t yet read ‘Salem’s Lot and ever intend to do so, I strongly recommend you read that before you get to this installment of The Dark Tower. Enough of the plot is summarized here to spoil that novel completely. Also, my having read ‘Salem’s Lot made Wolves of the Calla feel even richer and more special than it would have otherwise. As did my exposure to Hearts in Atlantis. There was more depth and meaning because of that prior knowledge. And, towards the end, it even tied in Black House, which is one I almost skipped because I wasn’t sure it was necessary. It even laid the groundwork for 11/22/63, which was one of the first King novels that I truly loved. There were references to Harry Potter, Star Wars, and even Marvel comics. The nerd in me, the super-fan who loves nothing more than an intellectual Easter egg hunt, was thrilled by this. And I know that some Constant Readers hated the way King wove himself into the end of the series, but I personally was elated. This level of meta-fictionalization and fourth-wall breaking made me absolutely ecstatic and ridiculously excited.I have tandem-read every installment of this series since The Gunslinger. Listening to the audio while reading along is simply the most immersive reading experience I can imagine. This is the first I’ve listened to that wasn’t narrated by Frank Muller. I was sad not to have his wonderful voice in my ears, but he was in a terrible motorcycle accident before he could record this one. King dedicated the book to him and donated all of the proceeds from the audiobook to Muller’s family, which I thought was lovely. Guidall did a good job stepping into some huge shoes that he couldn’t quite fill, and I’ll listen to the final two with him, as well, but Muller gave Roland his true voice.Is this a perfect book? No. Absolutely not. There are things about King’s writing that are problematic or bring-worthy, and those characteristics were present in this book. I can see the flaws. But did I subjectively care? Not a bit. The experience of reading Wolves of the Calla was, like almost all of its predecessors, a 5 star one for me. I loved it, and was excited and deeply invested the entire time I was reading it.Only two steps remain on my journey to the Dark Tower, and I both can’t wait for that final climb and am nervous that I’ll be disappointed with what I’ll find. Much like Roland and his Ka-Tet, I suppose. These characters have won my heart in spite of all their flaws, and I’m with them to the end of the line.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 19, 2022","May 02, 2022","Apr 19, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42399532-wolves-of-the-calla

Yes please! Unfortunately, this book just wasn’t for me. It wasn’t badly written, but the pacing left something to be desired. I also guessed the main twist about 20 pages in, which sucked a lot of the fun out of reading this. And I had some serious problems with the narrator. If it hadn’t been for the setting, and the fact that I used a Book of the Month credit on this, I would’ve put the book down about halfway through and felt no desire to pick it back up again.Claire was twelve the summer her home town of Breaux Bridge was terrorized by a serial killer. His reign of terror ended when Claire found his box of mementos from the girls who had disappeared. A box hidden in the back of her dad’s closet. After his confession, he’s been dead to Claire and her brother, Cooper. And after their mother attempted suicide, doing herself such irreparable harm that she would never speak again, Claire and Cooper basically had to raise themselves. Claire has tried her best to lead a normal life, becoming a psychologist to help others who are going through trauma. She’s even engaged, to a lovely man named Daniel. Her practice and her home are in Baton Rouge, as she couldn’t leave Breaux Bridge fast enough. But as the 20th anniversary of her dad’s crimes nears, teenage girls start disappearing again. This time, in Baton Rouge. And Claire seems to be the only link.I really disliked Claire. She an incredibly unreliable narrator, and makes stupid decision after stupid decision. The unreliable narrator trope is one that I’ve come to dislike in almost every instance in which I’ve read it, and this book was sadly not an exception to that. Honestly, had I known going in that she was such an unreliable, and unlikeable, narrator, I would’ve given this book a pass. For someone with as much education and with the type of cerebral occupation she had, Claire came across as stupid, to put it bluntly. And the thing is, I could tell that this wasn’t the author’s intent. She was my least favorite character, as we spend the entire narrative inside her head, but I didn’t actually like any of the characters. All of them had something about them that grated on me. A Flicker in the Dark isn’t a bad book. There were moments that captured me, especially in the past portions of the narrative. But it left me very dissatisfied. I didn’t hate it, exactly, but I can’t honestly say that I would recommend it to others. There are a plethora of better thrillers, better unreliable narrators, better Louisiana novels, and better mysteries out there. At least, in my opinion. I know based on the s that plenty of people loved this book.

This is Abdullah’s debut novel, and I found it to be a strong, well written story with compelling characters and an enchanting setting. A new riff on the classic tale of The Thousand and One Arabian Nights at its core, The Stardust Thief carves a new path into uncharted territory while still beautifully honoring its inspiration. I’ve read very little Arabic-inspired fantasy, but this book made me thirsty for more.“Death in a free land is better than life in a gilded cage.”Loulie is the infamous Midnight Merchant, a seller of jinn relics that are nearly impossible to locate. In the land of Madinne, jinn are viewed as monsters and killed on sight, harvested for their silver blood, which is the only thing that can breathe life into the arid landscape. The more lush the oasis, the more jinn blood has been spilled there. These jinn often leave behind relics, magical objects that can do different things, and these objects are considered priceless. Thus, Loulie has a booming business. Her secret? A magic compass and and inhuman bodyguard. She is our main perspective character, joined by Mazen and Aisha. Mazen is a prince, the youngest son of the sultan. He’s obsessed with stories, and I found him and his development delightful. Aisha is one of the forty thieves, and she took a while to grow on me. “We’re all afraid, Prince. The only difference between a hero and a coward is that one forgets their fear and fights, while the other succumbs to it and flees.”I ended up really enjoying all three perspective characters. I was never tempted to skim through one to reach another. All three of these characters had some serious issues to work through, but they all experienced some pretty fantastic development over the course of the story. But, while they had faults, they also had characteristics that drew me in from the beginning, especially Loulie and Mazen. I came to care about them quickly, which made me even more invested in their development. They felt realistic to me.“…one cannot know the outcome of a journey if one is not brave enough to take it.”While I very much enjoyed the characters, the setting was probably my favorite element of the story. I loved the descriptions of the oases, and found Abdullah’s dark take on their existence fascinating. The idea of a people being brutally slaughtered because their deaths bring life to the desert is horrifying, and not a concept I had seen before. The descriptions of the markets, and the food, and the palaces, and even the desert were all equally enchanting. Speaking of enchanting, I found the magical relics populating the story fascinating. They were so varied; some held immense power, while others may do something small, like an endless hourglass or a ring that lets you breathe underwater for a few seconds. But whatever their power, they were always unique.“No one knows what the dead want, Loulie. All we can do is honor them in the ways we understand.”Periodically throughout the book, Abdullah would include little stories in the style of the Arabian Night tales. I loved these, and the subtle shift in the voice of the writing that accompanied them. These stories, and what Abdullah says about the power of stories, were in my opinion the heart of the entire novel. The stories we tell have such power. The power to keep those we love alive, the power to shift perspective to such an extent that we essentially rewrite history, the power to inspire and enrage and transport. Abdullah’s belief in this power shone through in her writing.“If there is only to be one more tale tonight, let it be the one about the storyteller who changed her fate with her fables. Let it be a story about stories and the power they have to sway mortal hearts.”If I had any qualm with The Stardust Thief, it would be the pacing. Sometimes things seem to be trudging along for so long that, when the action suddenly hit, it felt a bit like whiplash. There were points where it was both difficult to keep up and keep going. In that regard, it felt very much like a first novel. And while I loved the characters, there were points where I became so exasperated with their stubbornness or lies or what have you that I would have to put the book down for a time and cool down before continuing. However, these complaints were infrequent, and I thought that overall this book was a strong foundation for whatever comes next.“Though only the gods know how long we may live, we humans are the ones who decide when legacies die.”The Stardust Thief is a truly enchanting debut, with a lush setting and characters who are easy to root for. There were times when I was reminded of Strange the Dreamer, a story I adore. And I loved the ways in which this fresh, original story paid homage to one of the oldest and most revered sets of stories in written history. This was a wonderful first installment for a fantasy series, and I can’t wait to see where Abdullah takes the story next.All quotations taken from an uncorrected proof and are subject to change upon publication.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 14, 2022","Apr 20, 2022","Apr 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58950705-the-stardust-thief

Here we learn the history of Martin the Warrior and see the eventual founding of This second installment in the Redwall series is actually a prequel. Here we learn the history of Martin the Warrior and see the eventual founding of Redwall Abbey. Our story begins with the creatures of Mossflower being severely taxed and oppressed by Lord Greeneyes, the wildcat king of Kotir, a fortress in Mossflower Wood. Upon his death Tsarmina, his even more evil and far crazier daughter, takes his throne and vows to suck the larders of the forest creatures dry and force them to labor for her. Obviously, any animal dwelling outside of the fortress heartily disagrees with this plan, and a war ensues.The action in the series is pretty basic, as are the narratives. However, Jacques excels in two areas: description and characterization. What I remembered most about this series from reading it as a child, aside from the anthropomorphic animals with weapons, are the descriptions of food. These novels shouldn’t be read on an empty stomach, because the descriptions of feasts and even “basic” picnics or breakfasts scattered liberally throughout each novel will make you incredibly hungry. Everything sounds delicious. Jacques originally wrote these stories to tell to students at a school for the blind, and you can tell. I also suspect that he was quite the foodie, because again, all of the dishes described in the series sound truly, mouthwateringly scrumptious.The other area in which Jacques excels is in his characters. While his villains tend to be one-dimensionally evil with no redeeming qualities, his heroes and their supporting casts are wonderfully easy to root for. Mossflower is a fantastic example of this. Gonff, mousethief and poet extraordinaire, is a delight on every page. The Mask, an otter who is a mast of disguise, was fascinating. Colimbine, the Loamhedge mouse whom Gonff loves, Bella the badger, Young Dinny the Mole, Logalog the shrew, the hares from Salamandastron, and even Tsarmina’s peace-loving brother, the wildcat Gingivere, were all lovely characters. And then there’s Martin. Martin is a truly epic character, a larger-than-life hero packed into a tiny package. He’s noble and fierce and kind and fair, and he never backs down from a challenge. He’s also a very good friend. Who could help but love him?Mossflower is a worthy sequel to Redwall, and even improves upon the story in various ways. While the characters are incredibly black and white, and the stories can be a bit simplistic, I have to remind myself that children are the target audience here. And for fantasy starring animals written for children, these hold up remarkably well as an adult rereading them. It’s a world that I’ve never forgotten, and revisiting Mossflower Wood and beyond, reacquainting myself with charming characters and experiencing once again their lavish feasts, has been an incredibly cozy experience....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 07, 2022","Apr 13, 2022","Apr 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1168787.Mossflower

I liked the framework, but the words of the prophet on each of these different topics is where Gibran’s writing shone the brightest. I was reminded strongly of the biblical Book of Proverbs, though The Prophet had more of a purposeful flow to it. There was a lot of wisdom to be found here, and a lot of philosophical thoughts to contemplate. The book felt far older than it truly is; there was a timeless quality to the writing and the subjects addressed that made the work seem both ancient and ageless.

As she digs in, we get lost in Alan Conway’s newest Atticus Pünd mystery right alongside her. I love how it’s presented as its own separate book, complete with a brief bio of the author and praise for his earlier works. Pünd finds himself pulled into a murder investigation at Saxby-on-Avon, a quaint little English village housing quite an eclectic cast of characters. I was incredibly impressed at the nuance of characterizations here, and completely caught up in all of the small dramas surrounding the greater mystery. The crime itself is multifaceted, as well. I was reminded so strongly of classic whodunnits by Doyle and Christie, especially. The characters, the setting, the crime, and Pünd himself gave me strong Holmes and Poirot vibes, as did the writing itself. I loved Pünd and could happily read the other eight novels in his fictitious series. I was so invested, as a matter of fact, that I completely forgot that it was in fact a fictitious novel within another novel until I was jerked out of the story with our narrator. It was a jarring transition, as I’m positive Horowitz intended it to be. From here, Susan must not only find the missing chapters of the book, but solve another murder, this one in her reality. While this mystery was also compelling, it didn’t have quite the same sparkle as the unfinished Pünd novel. But that’s okay, because it forced me to share Susan’s obsession with finding the rest of the book. I was also very impressed by how different the two stories were in style and voice, which has to be a difficult balance to strike. The writing was brilliant, and not only did it make me deeply respect Horowitz as a craftsman, it made me far more enthusiastic about reading more of his work. The only reason this book isn’t a full 5 stars is that I wanted to rush through Susan’s story in hopes of getting back to Pünd. But that’s a me thing, not a failing on Horowitz’s part in any way, which is why I had not a single qualm about rounding up my rating.Magpie Murders impressed me in a multitude of ways. Not only did I find by stories compelling, the inclusion of an entire book within another made for an incredibly immersive reading experience. I deeply wish that the entire fictional Pünd series existed, because I feel like Pünd could absolutely hold his own with Holmes and Poirot. I found Magpie Murders , in a word, classy. Which isn’t a term I generally equate with more recently published mystery novels, but it absolutely suits this book. I can see why Horowitz was sanctioned by the Conan Doyle estate to continue the legacy of Sherlock Holmes, and after reading Magpie Murders I am even more excited to see what he does with the fictional detective I love most in the world. If you’re a love of Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, I can’t recommend this book enough....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 28, 2022","Apr 02, 2022","Mar 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50622439-magpie-murders

This is not a book that I enjoyed. And I’m not sure you’re supposed to. But it is a book that left an impression, and I absolutely get how it could be life altering for some. Golding famously asked his wife “Wouldn’t it be a good idea if I wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave?” That’s what this book book answers, and those answers are anything but uplifting. Golding believed that, once away from the constraints of society, people would be quickly and easily drawn away from civilization and into savagery. His lack of faith in any kind of innate goodness in the face of adversity is writ large here and, while I desperately hope this would not be the case and I adhere to a most positive worldview, he makes a very convincing argument.The story begins with a plane crash on a lush, inviting island. The plane in question was full of little boys, who seem to have all survived, though that’s up for debate. There isn’t an adult in sight. At first, these boys seem to band loosely together, trying to maintain a semblance of civilization while also being too lazy to truly contribute much to each other. They pretty much want to play in the sun, fill up on fruit, and swim until they’re ready to nap. A modicum of effort is made to keep up a signal fire in hopes of being rescued, but even that falls by the wayside eventually. There are four sides to this story, in my opinion. Firstly, there is Ralph, Piggy, and Samneric, the twins. These boys hope for rescue, and try at least somewhat to maintain order on the island. There are the littluns, the boys around 6 years of age or younger who are incredibly difficult to corral and just want full bellies and a safe place to sleep. Then there is Jack Merridew and his cohort of hunters, who quickly fall into a disturbingly savage tribal mentality where worth is based solely on provision proffered. Finally, there’s Simon, who seems to see their microcosm of a world more clearly than the rest of the boys, comprehending that the only thing they truly need to fear on the island is themselves, and each other. I found the archetypes each boy represented fascinating, but each was also a character in their own right instead of feeling like a construct. I didn’t like a single one of them, but I don’t think I was meant to.Just in case you’ve never read this or been spoiled to the ending, I’m not going to get too into the plot. Do I like this book? No. But do I recommend it? Yes. It’s a short, culturally significant read that I think is well worth the few hours you’ll spend with it. It might not be a story that I enjoy, but I can’t deny its staying power. I respect it, and the ways in which it has inspired stories that are important to me. Stephen King said in his introduction to the centenary edition of Lord of the Flies that it was “the first book with hands – strong ones that reached out of the pages and seized me by the throat.” It’s even the namesake of Castle Rock, one of King’s most infamous and oft-visited fictional settings.I read this for Middle Grade March, as I first read it in my own middle grade years, but I have to stress that this is not a children’s book. This is a book about children, written for adults. I’m not saying that kids shouldn’t read it, just that they need to be sure they’re reading for something this dark and disturbing before picking it up. I was. It’s a story that really does sink its teeth into you and worm its way into your long-term memories, no matter whether you love it, hate it, or try to hold it at arm’s length. There’s so much to dig into here, so much to discuss. I actually think this would be a brilliant book club book, especially if all those involved had somehow missed it in their youth. If you did happen to read this when you were young, I highly recommend picking it up again to see what you missed the first time, and how the connotions have changed now that you’re an adult.

I remember borrowing the DVD from the library about a decade ago, but Chris vetoed it about 10 minutes in because it was subtitled and our tv was small. While I always intended to go back to it one day, I just never got around to it. That’s going to have to change, because I absolutely loved this novelization of the story. I feel like “novelization” is almost an insult, actually. Because, while I’ve never seen the movie, I know that the care with which this book was written and illustrated demands more respect that such nomenclature usually provides. Pan’s Labyrinth: The Labyrinth of the Faun, is gorgeous in the same way poisonous mushrooms are: lush, inviting, but deadly.“In our choices lie our fate.”Pan’s Labyrinth is the story of Ofelia, a girl in 1940s Spain whose widowed young mother has remarried a hateful military man. Ofelia’s mother is pregnant, and the two of them are called to come live in the rundown mill when Ofelia’s new stepfather is stationed, in the midst of a forbidding forest. At least, that is the story on the surface. Deeper within, this is the story of a lost princess, a hidden kingdom, a calculating Faun, and the wars waging within and between and for the hearts of the Spanish people. I love the fairy tale vibe, and I adored the little fables tucked within the central plot, and how those ended up being such a vital piece of the narrative. “Sometimes the objects we hold dear give away who we are even more than the people we love.” Ofelia is a lovely character, brave and reckless and loving and everything you would wish for in a daughter. Her mother is blinded by her muddled love for, and fear of, Vidal, the new stepfather Ofelia has dubbed the Wolf. She loves her daughter, but is always scared for her. She’s also scared for herself and for the unborn son wreaking havoc on her health. Mercedes, the secondary heroine of the novel, was wonderful, and I loved her affection for Ofelia. She also has plenty to fear, but does her best to live bravely, anyway. “Evil seldom takes shape immediately. It is often little more than a whisper at first. A glance. A betrayal. But then it grows and takes root, still invisible, unnoticed. Only fairy tales give evil a proper shape. The big bad wolves, the evil kings, the demons, and devils . . .”The more fantastical entities of the story, the Faun and the Fairies and the Pale Man, were fascinating. Even those portrayed as good, the Faun and the Fairies, had an underlying cruelty to them. But the Pale Man is one of the most disturbing characters I’ve ever come across. He’s one of those rare beings whose exteriors match their spirits. His wickedness is writ large in the eyes that would no longer stay in his head. Just thinking about him is creeping me out.“Although we may wish for it, true magic is a scary thing.”This novel felt pretty dark for a middle grade novel, until I remembered some of the darker children’s books I read when I was younger. Kids seem to be drawn to darkness. I’m not a psychologist, but I think this might be in part because it makes them feel safer in their reality, or lets them know they’re not alone in their struggles. I would say that this particular book is a bit more mature that most middle grade books, and parents or teachers might should offer a couple of content warnings to children before pressing it into their hands. The content might ride the line between middle grade and young adult but, in spite of the darkness, the tone and style of this book falls firmly in middle grade territory, in my opinion. “Mortals don't understand life is not a book you close only after you read the last page. There is no last page in the Book of Life, for the last one is always the first page of another story.”The writing is lovely, and often philosophical in a way that would make any reader no matter their age pause to think, but without pulling them from the story in any way. I found myself thankful that I had bought the Kindle book years ago, so that I could annotate without marking up the lovely copy my aunt bought me for my birthday. There was just a ton of food for thought here, made even more impactful by the beautiful prose.“Libraries don't keep secrets; they reveal them.” After having read the book, I know that I must watch the movie as soon as I can get my hands on it. Unfortunately I couldn’t find it streaming anywhere, or I would have watched it as soon as I finished the novel. But the DVD is on the way and, in the meantime, I’m going to continue ruminating on Ofelia’s story, her tragedy and her triumph. If the movie is anywhere near as good as the book it inspired, I’m incredibly excited to watch it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 19, 2022","Mar 24, 2022","Mar 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42117981-pan-s-labyrinth

After all, YA tends to be very hit-or-miss for me. I needn’t have worried, because this book was absolutely fantastic. I was blown away by the world-building, the concept, and the character development. Bree was a phenomenal protagonist. She was far from perfect, but I loved watching her strengths solidify and rooting for her as she wrestled with the trauma and loss life had dealt her. And it’s a campus novel with a secret society, which is an added bonus. This is also one of the freshest, most original takes on Arthurian legend I’ve experienced, even making me want to go back and reread some of the source inspiration.“Don't make your life about the loss. Make it about the love.”It’s been a while since I was actually shocked by the quality of an author’s writing. Deonn crafts each sentence with a poetic intentionality, a choice not often made by YA fantasy authors. I’ve read some YA with prose so poetic it was purple, that almost distracted from the story being told. I’ve read far more where the author took a workman’s stance on the prose, using it only as a vehicle by which to tell there story and not wanting said prose to distract the reader in any way. I tend to find this style the most effective in fantasy for any age group. But when an author has a naturally poetic style to their prose, as Deonn does, it dazzles.“Some truths only tragedy can teach. The first one I learned is that when people acknowledge your pain, they want your pain to acknowledge them back. They need to witness it in real time, or else you're not doing your part.”Deonn crafted not one but two fascinating, complex magic systems, and I love the dichotomy between the two. On hand there is the blood craft linked with the Legendborn, which varied wildly from scion to scion. On there other there is root craft, another hereditary magic source, but one that is more respectful and sustainable. I found their differences and the areas where they overlapped very interesting. I’m looking forward to Bloodmarked and hoping that both magic systems will be even further explored there.“Love is a powerful thing, more powerful than blood, although both run through us like a river.” If I was forced to describe Legendborn in a single word, that word would be: powerful. The magic systems, the unflinching portrayal of history, the character development, the writing itself. All of it. Powerful is the best one word description I can think of for this story. My second choice would be propulsive. I was invested from page 1, and even when I wasn’t actively read the book I found myself thinking about it. It’s also a book that made me think deeply. Our protagonist is a young Black woman on a college campus in the South, so there was a lot of dialogue on racism and sexism and how our backgrounds effect the ways in which we view the world.“Two faults. My race and my gender.But they are not faults. They are strength.”A couple of things kept this from being a solid, strong 5 star read for me. First, not all of Bree’s actions and motivations made sense. I don’t expect to agree with all of a protagonist’s decisions, but I feel like I should at least understand them. I also felt that it was very easy to forget she was only sixteen unless it was mentioned frequently. Second, there’s the beginnings of my least favorite trope present in this book, a love triangle. I truly, deeply despise them, and the presence of one soured my experience just a bit. But only a little bit, and I’ll be interested to see how and if that particular trope develops in the next installment.“The most important thing you can do in this world, the most necessary thing, is to survive it. You can't do anything for anyone else if you don't take care of yourself first.”Legendborn is my favorite YA fantasy I’ve read in a very long time. It felt truly unique; I’ve never read anything else quite like it. I was moved, and enthralled, and always invested. If you’re looking for original magic systems and new takes on ancient stories and a protagonist who oozes vitality and reality, Legendborn delivers all of the above. I’m so excited to see where the story goes in the sequel.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 19, 2022","Mar 31, 2022","Mar 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892338-legendborn

If you’re a lover of movies like Willow, The Never-Ending Story, Labyrinth, and especially The Dark Crystal, then you need to get your hands on this book. Its pages are populated with puppets come to life, a quest to save a dying fantasy realm, and a ton of pop culture references. While I loved the idea behind it, the actual execution of this story left me a bit unsatisfied, but it’s a book that I think is going to make a lot of my fellow nerdy 80s babies extremely happy.If I were to describe The Shadow Glass in a word, it would be: zany. This felt wacky and madcap, but with a tinge of darkness. The story was almost manic in its wildness and pacing, to the point of near unbelievability even as a fantasy novel. But that was paired with a melancholy that bordered on depressive, and I found that a very odd dichotomy.The author had interesting things to say about nerd culture, especially those who view themselves as “gate keepers” of the things they treasure, resenting even the very creators of the story or world they love should said creator decide to expand it. Which is completely their right, by the way. There is no wrong way to love the stories that speak to you, unless it involves tearing down that love in other fans. But the flip side was addressed, as well; very little is as powerful as a group of fans who wholeheartedly love something. Finding others who love the same thing you love, just as fervently, can feel like finding your tribe after going it alone. That joy and camaraderie were well presented in this novel.I really wanted to love The Shadow Glass, but I couldn’t quite make that happen. The cause was two-fold. First, there were multiple points in the narrative where there was simply too much going on, and so much of it was over the top that I became desensitized to even the things that should’ve broken my heart or had me cheering. My other issue was with the characterization, or lack thereof. There was not much to be found in terms of character development, even though Jack was a much different person by the end of the book. He even paid for that transformation, but it still felt somehow disingenuous. And speaking of Jack, I never found him likable, even when he found his inner hero. I found him grating, and I thought the same about Zavanna. Most of the characters grated on me, actually, unless they had golden retriever energy like Toby and Brol. While I didn’t love The Shadow Glass, I loved the idea and the heart behind it. It’s a story that I have no doubt will charm other fantasy fans, especially those who loved (and still love) Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal and the like. It encourages readers to never stop loving what you love, and to never stop believing in the magic of stories. I would love to see The Shadow Glass come to the screen, and to see how it would measure up to the movies it honors in its pages. I have no doubt that it would be just as loved as the stories that inspired it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,1,8,1,"Apr 07, 2022","Apr 18, 2022","Mar 18, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58661569-the-shadow-glass

While I very much enjoyed the preceding two novels, I didn’t quite love the story for some reason. I really liked it, don’t get me wrong, but there was some sort of disconnect between me and the first two books. That was definitely not the case with The Winter of the Witch. I was so incredibly invested, and was brought to tears multiple times. The whole book was epic from start to finish. The balance of grief and joy was razor sharp. I found the entire story imaginative, unique, and honestly exquisite. This book is the kind of finale that retroactively improves the books that came before it, as you see all the ways those novels paved the way for this one.Vasya has slowly become one of my favorite fantasy heroines. When I first met her, I was comparing her to the protagonists in Naomi Novik’s Spinning Silver, which I had read almost immediately before. Unfortunately, that was to Winternight’s detriment, as I had loved Spinning Silver so much and couldn’t help but compare the two. I felt that Vasya didn’t have quite as much dimension as Novik’s three heroines; she was almost too perfect, without the internal moral struggles that make for a character with the kind of depth that makes them relatable. I instantly liked her, but she felt almost too good to truly invest in even as a child. However, any such qualms I had disappeared completely in this third book. Vasya has been through so much, and that innate, tough goodness at her core is in large part what kept her going. She’s an incredible character, and all of my qualms from earlier in the trilogy fell by the wayside as I watched her conquer impossible odds. The way she found to secure her own agency in a time and place where such was completely unheard of for a woman blew me away.I was totally unprepared for some of the horrific sacrifices that would be made in this novel. It felt much darker than the two preceding books; so much so in fact that, in the beginning of the novel, I was pretty taken aback and almost offended by how blindsided I felt. But all of these sacrifices had meaning, and power, and a huge role in the story. Nothing was done for shock value, despite how I might have first felt. The stakes were intensely high here, and there can be no great reward without the threat of great loss. Again, the way Arden balanced joy and grief here was incredibly powerful. I was truly impressed.One of the most captivating elements of this series is the inclusion of, and the importance placed on, Russian folklore. In this final third of the story, the traditional, nearly forgotten magical entities of Russia are at war with the mundane and the holy. Vasya rides that dividing line. Seeing which side she will choose, or whether she will stand in the gap between the two, is where much of the tension lies. Arden’s presentation of the magical here is absolutely superb. The chyerti, the nature and household spirits of pagan Russia, were so varied and fascinating. From Midnight personified, to magical horses, to tiny mushroom spirits, each had their own unique personality. I also loved the interplay between the Christian religion and the remnants of paganism, seeing them war for dominance while wondering if they could find a way to coexist. I highly recommend reading Arden’s Author’s Note at the end of the novel, to see where some of her inspiration came from.I found The Winter of the Witch truly brilliant, and the Winternight trilogy as a whole a strong one. It might have started off a bit slow for me, but man, did it ever deliver in the end. Vasya will always have a place in my heart, and her story is one that I’m excited to share with others and revisit one day. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Mar 14, 2022","Mar 18, 2022","Mar 14, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/36621586-the-winter-of-the-witch

This story is in part about the disappearance of a writer of children’s books. Maggie St. James, the author of the Eloise and the Foxtail series, walked away from her life 5 years ago and hasn’t been seen since. Her series was dark and controversial, beloved by children and feared by parents as some children ran away to the woods in search of the magical underground of Maggie’s stories. Travis Wren, a man with a unique talent for finding people, has been hired by Maggie’s parents years after their daughter left, in hopes that he can find answers the police couldn’t. After introducing readers to Travis and his quest, the story shifts to a commune hidden away in the depths of the forest and forgotten by the outside world. Here we have three perspective characters: Theo, one of the community’s gate guards; Calla, Theo’s wife; and Bee, Calla’s blind sister. Through them we get to know Pastoral, its strengths and weaknesses, struggles and triumphs. It’s a beautiful place laced with an undercurrent of fear as everyone worries about catching the Pox, a brutal disease carried by the trees encompassing the commune as acting as a natural border. Because of the deadly, wildly contagious Pox, the road to Pastoral has been permanently closed, no longer allowing anyone to enter the community. Or to leave it.Pastoral reminds me of the community in M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village, but without the period setting and religious connotations. I found reading about such a place without these two elements, which so often define communities like this in literature and film, absolutely fascinating. When religion isn’t binding this type of secluded, forgotten body of people together, what takes its place?I unfortunately guessed the majority of the reveals and connections made towards the climax of the book, but I still enjoyed the journey. The characters never quite drew me in, but I was still invested in their story. I loved the setting and the emphasis placed on nature. Overall, I felt that this was a solid tale, and a totally respectable adult debut for the author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 14, 2022","Mar 19, 2022","Mar 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56898223-a-history-of-wild-places

I adored Beach Read and The People We Meet on Vacation, Henry’s two previous adult fiction novels, so a part of me was afraid that Book Lovers might not measure up. Also, romance isn’t a genre that I was very into until last year, when nearly half of my 192 reads for the year were romance. I felt like I had gorged on them so much that I was sick of them, and I feared that any romance I read this year would suffer through no fault of their own, but simply because I was burned out. Thankfully, neither factor effected my experience with Book Lovers.  It was just as lovely as I could have hoped; different enough from Henry’s other novels to not feel redundant, and with enough plot outside of the romance itself to keep from feeling nauseatingly sweet.“That’s life. You’re always making decisions, taking paths that lead you away from the rest before you can see where they end. Maybe that’s why we as a species love stories so much. All those chances for do-overs, opportunities to live the lives we’ll never have.”This is a hugging book, y’all. When I finished the last page, I quite literally clutched it to my chest and just rocked with it for a minute or two. It’s been a while since a book made me cry, especially multiple times. But my heart felt so full while reading the last handful of chapters that it just…overflowed through my eyes. And that was only in part because of the romance. Yes, there is a definite romance here, and a compelling one, at that. But I don’t consider this a romance or romcom at its core. I think this is truly a story of sisters, of the struggle to maintain a close relationship when life takes you in such radically different directions. It’s about seeing who you are with clear eyes, and being brave enough to recognize and even start to change the things you don’t like about that reflection. It’s about seeing your worth as a person, not just as whatever career path you’ve chosen.“Maybe love shouldn’t be built on a foundation of compromises, but maybe it can’t exist without them either. Not the kind that forces two people into shapes they don’t fit in, but the kind that loosens their grips, always leaves room to grow. Compromises that say, there will be a you-shaped space in my heart, and if your shape changes, I will adapt. No matter where we go, our love will stretch out to hold us, and that makes me feel like … like everything will be okay.” Our main character is Nora, literary agent extraordinaire and self-proclaimed Ice Queen, at least on the outside. But under the surface, she cares deeply about the people in her life. Especially her sister, Libby. The two lost their mother when Libby was still a teen, and Nora has functioned as more of a mom than just a sister. But Libby is determined to break Nora out of her protective rut, and so has booked a trip for the two of them. Away from the New York they both love. In a small, rural community that inspired one of the clients Nora represents to write her most recent bestseller. Nora’s voice as our narrator is so freaking funny. I love her way with words, even within her own mind. She’s such a city girl, and I loved seeing her flounder a bit in the country. When Charlie, Nora’s somewhat rival in the literary scene, pops up in the same small town, Nora is flummoxed. But Charlie is just as quick-witted as Nora, and the two reluctantly hit it off. While I didn’t consider their romance the absolute focus of the book, I did love it dearly. They had fabulous chemistry.“Life in New York was like being in a giant bookstore: all these trillions of paths and possibilities drawing dreamers into the city's beating heart, saying, I make no promises but I offer many doors.”This is not a book about books, but it is a book about, well, book lovers. I loved all of the little literary references and mentions of books. At one point, Libby even rewrote the lyrics to “My Favorite Things” to talk about the small town bookstore they were frequenting and trying to save. You could easily feel the literary love here, but without it ever affecting the breezy feel of the novel. And then there’s Nora and Charlie’s literary relationship. It felt so unique to me, and I was utterly charmed by it. A shared love of anything is a great basis for a romance, and I can’t think of a better love to share than that of books. “You’re in books. Of course you don’t have a life. None of us do. There’s always something too good to read.” Something I’ve loved about every Emily Henry book I’ve read is the balance. Yes, they’re labeled as romances and yes, there is a wonderful one at the heart of each of these novels. But there are also always deeper themes, things that make you think about hard topics, but done in a way that still feels somehow light and easy. There’s a surprising richness to her work, and that’s what will keep me coming back to these novels that I already love and picking up anything else she publishes. Book Lovers might have been a story I was afraid would let me down, but it taught me to trust that I’m in good hands when I pick up anything Henry writes. This was a beautiful book about family and finding yourself and opening yourself up to love along the way, and everything about it made my heart happy.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"May 25, 2022","May 31, 2022","Mar 11, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58701063-book-lovers

But I do love hearing people’s thoughts on things that interest them, so essays appeal to me. I might not pick up essay collections often, but I tend to enjoy them whenever I do. However, I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed a collection of essays more than I did John Green’s The Anthropocene Reviewed. The essays in this collection are wildly varied not in quality, but in topic. What binds them together is Green’s thoughtful introspection, and I deeply enjoyed getting to view the world through his eyes.While I might not agree with Green on every point, I deeply value his transparent honesty, and the mixture of hope and fear he shows in his outlook on life and the world at large. This is the kind of discourse I love, even if, or perhaps especially if, it’s coming from a differing worldview. I was right with Green on most topics, with just enough variation to keep things interesting. I’ve read and enjoyed Green’s YA fiction in the past, but this book is radically different in every way except for the thoughtfulness he has always brought to his writing. If I were asked to describe The Anthropocene Reviewed in three words, those words would be: informative, thoughtful, and fun. But if I could use only one word, I would call this book wise. The thoughts Green shares, the way in which he writes, and the balance of each essay strikes between fun and educational, maudlin and uplifting, are all to my mind amazing markers of wisdom. I never felt as if I were being taught, but I learned so much from my time with this book. The addition of the star ratings at the end of each essay were such a fun little touch.I intended to make my way through The Anthropocene Reviewed slowly, reading an essay or two a day. Instead I found myself reading essay after essay, unable to put the book down. I finished it in a couple of days. I made the decision to tandem read my physical copy with the audiobook, which I borrowed from the library. That was such a great decision, allowing me to annotate and soak in certain passages while listening to the inflection and humor and sincerity as Green read aloud his own essays. Either format is well worth reading, but I can’t recommend the combination of both highly enough. Also, listeners of the audiobooks get three bonus essays (“Mortification,” “The Kaua’i o-o,” and “The Smallpox Vaccine”) that don’t appear in the print copy. I thought Green did a brilliant job narrating his own work, and whoever made that decision deserves some praise.My favorite essays were “Sunsets,” “Sycamore Trees,” and “New Partner.” All of the essays in the collection were profound and thought-provoking in one way or another, even those on Diet Dr. Pepper or Super Mario Cart or Piggly Wiggly, but these three spoke to me on the deepest level. “Sunsets” asks that we not consider ourselves “too cool” to fully appreciate the simple yet awe-inspiring beauty of nature. “Sycamore Trees” discusses the power of belief over despair. “New Partner” demonstrates the way a favorite song can transport us in time and somehow encapsulate the moments that are most important to us. Beauty, faith, and music are three of the things that keep me going even when my outlook on life is at its darkest, and I felt a camaraderie with Green as he revealed their importance in his own life.Strangely, what I wish most about this collection is that it didn’t feel so set in our specific point in time. I’m not sure how well all of his discussion of the pandemic and how it has effected our lives is going to age. But regardless, this is such a timely, comforting book to read right now, and I deeply appreciated the introspection it encouraged.I give The Anthropocene Reviewed 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 08, 2022","Mar 10, 2022","Mar 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58678422-the-anthropocene-reviewed

I never would have picked this collection up if I wasn’t so invested in the television series Supernatural and the actors associated with it. I loved Misha’s character, Castiel, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every convention panel he’s been a part of that I’ve watched on YouTube. It was his name that had me picking up this book in Target, though at the time I was just getting back into poetry. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of poem I found. While not my favorite collection, I found it to be a solid one.The love poems made me ache, especially knowing that the 30-year relationship being alluded to in so many ended in divorce before the collection’s publication. I can’t imagine the devastation of separating after spending almost two-thirds of your life together. I really enjoyed the two sections involving running, the dichotomy of the joyfulness of the first set and the gloom of the second. In my option, these first three sections were by far the strongest. I spent more time with these poems, thinking about them and rereading them, than I did with the back half of the collection. Those last three sections, involving people in Misha’s life, his parents, and his kids, weren’t quite as structurally sound as the first three. However, the last stanza of “The Last Poem” was a lovely ode to the quiet moments of parenthood that resonated with me in spite of my not having children. It expressed a sentiment I’ve seen in my brother while he watched his daughter sleep, and it’s achingly sweet.There were lines in this collection that stood out, many of which were in the first Love Poems section. But I can’t say that I added any new favorite poems to those already living in my mind. However, one of the great things about poetry is that you never know how you’ll feel about it upon revisiting. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 08, 2022","Mar 12, 2022","Mar 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58315381-some-things-i-still-can-t-tell-you

Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow is chockfull of magic, whimsy and, above all, joy. This is the kind of series I would have adored with every fiber of my being when I was in middle school. And I loved it almost as much as an adult.Morrigan Crow is a cursed child. Doomed to die on her eleventh birthday, like all of the other cursed children, all because they were born on Eventide. Our story opens on her funeral, but she has actually absconded to Nevermoor, a secret magical city, with Jupiter North, one of the most affable, wildly eccentric characters I’ve had the pleasure of meeting in fiction. Here, Morrigan will battle it out for one of nine places in the Wundrous Society for her year. Against hundreds of other eleven year-olds who actually know the rules. But this little goth girl is plucky to the extreme, and she’ll do everything in her power to stay in Nevermoor now that she’s experienced it.This series has been compared to Harry Potter. I get it in terms of magic and nostalgia and even plot to an extent, but Nevermoor is radically different from Hogwarts. Here we have an entire city, a magical hotel, and nothing whatsoever resembling a structured school setting. Embracing your individuality and showcasing it is the name of the game here, and the weirdo in me resonated with that so strongly. This is a wildly diverse cast of characters, which I adored. There’s also a giant talking cat, who is incredibly snarky. But my favorite characters were definitely Morrigan and Jupiter and, though this is Morrigan’s story, I think I actually love Jupiter just a bit more. He’s utterly delightful. He pretends to be flighty in order to hold on to secrets until the right time to convey them, but he’s actually very much on top of things at all times. His sense of humor and his kindness won me over immediately. If we’re still going with the Harry Potter comparison, he’s a far cooler and more caring Dumbledore. He also reminded me of David Tennant’s incarnation of the Doctor, who I adore.The plot was fun and the characters were great, but the setting was my favorite part of this story. Nevermoor is one of the most magical settings I’ve ever experienced. As mentioned above, it is bursting with joyful whimsy. I’ve always thought that Narnia would be my immediate choice if I could visit any fantasy world, but Nevermoor gives it some serious competition. The Hotel Deucalion, which I mentioned earlier, is equal parts quirky and beautiful. Morrigan’s room gets to know and and changes to fit her needs, which I think is perhaps the most brilliant idea for a hotel ever. And that’s not even touching on the common rooms. The battle between Saint Nicholas and the Yule Queen was also memorable, and brought to mind the World Quidditch Cup from Harry Potter, but was far lovelier. There were so many small touches to the world building that I found absolutely brilliant, and I can’t wait to see how Townsend further develops Nevermoor in the rest of the series.This is the first new-to-me middle grade novel I’ve read in a long time that has gotten me this excited to share it with my niece when she’s old enough to enjoy it. I was delighted and utterly captivated from start to finish, and can think of not a single genuine critique to offer. I highly recommend it for adults and kiddos alike.Step boldly....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 08, 2022","Mar 12, 2022","Mar 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37946448-nevermoor

The cast was pretty extensive, to the point of being difficult to keep straight at times, but the majority of the players were well fleshed out for this particular type of novel. I was also surprised by how much more involved the crime was than I expected, and by how many of the characters had motive to commit it.

In comparison toThe only books I’ve read from Maas are those in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, and even those were very recent reads for me. In comparison to those, Crescent City is pretty wildly different while still delivering the plucky, surly, fallible heroine archetype and sultry, multifaceted, misunderstood love interest they’ve come to expect from her work. While the world building was excessive and clunky, the addition of an intriguing murder mystery kept me interested enough to keep reading. I’m glad I did because, though this book had some issues, the back half made it very much worth reading.The story itself: great. The info-dumping: not so much. Also, so many incredibly stupid decisions are made. Repeatedly. Like, people just don’t learn from their own actions. Do they still end up being epic? Yep. Do I root for them? Absolutely. But I just wanted to shake sense into multiple characters multiple times. Dumb decisions that characters don’t seem to really even learn from drive me nuts. Bryce, our main protagonist, is nowhere near perfect. She has a ton of faults and failings. But those serve to make her stronger in my mind, more interesting and sympathetic and multifaceted than she could’ve been without them. She reminded me some of Nesta, but with self-denial replacing self-destruction. While I can see why some readers weren’t her biggest fan, I think rooting for Bryce felt like a very natural progression for those who grew to love Nesta. I also enjoyed the inclusion of Hunt as a second perspective character, and am interested to see where the story takes the two of them.But why did Maas name this world Midgard? Is there is link to Norse mythology that hasn’t been revealed yet? If not, then the Midgard name and the frequent use of Hel as an in-world curse feels incredibly lazy. However, I did like seeing basically every magical entity ever imagined coexisting relatively peacefully in one world, and I appreciated the undercurrent of bigotry and classism Maas revealed as the book progressed. That inclusion made the world feel far more likely, if not realistic. My favorite tiny detail was the addition of messenger otters. They’re wholly unmagical and absolutely adorable.The last 250 pages or so were INSANE. And yes, those caps are needed. By the end of the book, my skin actually hurt from having chills for so long. I cried more than once, which I absolutely didn’t expect from this book seeing as I didn’t initially feel much of a connection. Brandon Sanderson enthusiasts refer to the final, prolonged, brilliant climaxes of his novels as the Sanderlanche. I honestly think Maas does something very similar in this book. A Maas-valanche, if you will. While I do think that the book could have been trimmed down by a couple of hundred pages and benefited greatly from the inclusion of an index in place of some of the info-dumping, the huge buildup and climax made even those elements worth it.I kind of hate me a villain monologue. I find them incredibly cheesy. But the way this one was done, with so many characters watching on in horror with no way to intervene, provided enough tension for me to suspend my distaste and disbelief and become deeply invested in the play-by-play. I also dislike Mary Sue protagonists but, when said protagonist did not start out all powerful but in some way worked hard and paid for that power, I’m all in. There were high stakes, and even some losses, but somehow this still delivered a bit of a fairytale ending. Which makes me hesitant to pick up the next book, as I’m sure everything that resolved here gets blown all to pieces.Overall, House of Earth and Blood is not an instant favorite for me, but I can see why it’s popular. It’s also the type of book I can see myself not only rereading but potentially enjoying more on a revisit. I’m definitely interested in seeing where the Crescent City series goes from here, but I’m not in a huge hurry to find out.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 24, 2022","Mar 07, 2022","Feb 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44778083-house-of-earth-and-blood

I wish it had been a bit lighter and more anecdotal, but I do feel like I learned a lot during my time with it.“We are all made up of the books we have loved and, more, of the books we have owned, gifted, studied, revered, lived by, lost, thrown aside, dusted, argued over, learned by heart, borrowed and never returned, failed to finish and used as doorstops…”Portable Magic is all about the reader’s relationship with books, as both conveyances of ideas as well as objects in and of themselves. It dissects our collective love affair with books and looks at both the positive and negative connotations of that love. It also addresses and digs into the “interconnectedness of book form and book content,” as well as the “reciprocity and proximity of books and their readers, in the relationships that leave both parties changed.” In other words, it’s about the importance of books, inside and out, and how our relationship with books impacts not only us, but the books themselves. “As books became part of human life, they began to change us. They do not simply reflect us, but shape us, turning us into the readers they would like to have.”“…a book becomes a book in the hands of its readers. It is an interactive object. A book that is not handled and read is not really a book at all.”One of the major points of this book is how wildly we overvalue books as objects. There have been people tried and giving wildly outlandish sentences for defacing books or book theft, to the point that their lives were forever ruined. That’s utterly senseless. A book is never more important than a person. But then others go to the opposite extreme, seeking to eradicate books that contain stories or ideas by which they feel threatened or offended. This eradication can range anywhere from censorship to book banning to the actual buying of books. I’m not going to say that these are equally wrong, because people are alive and books are inanimate, but books and the thoughts they house do deserve to be defended. A balance must be struck. “Where men burn books / They will burn people also in the end.”“Books last, and their long lives sometimes have unexpected consequences.”The impact books have had on us, individually and collectively, over the ages is also discussed in depth in this book. Our impact on books is also addressed. We see how stories change as we do, and how stories change us. We see how books in form have changed with the time, and how we have adapted our technology to continue paying homage to the biblioforms we love. It’s a fascinating dichotomy with a variety of facets. We also see how readers interact with authors through not just the consumption of their work, but by annotating and even writing fan-fiction based on the work. Stories matter deeply to us and become part of our identity. The way our love of said stories impact the form that houses them is also interesting.“The book-human relationship is reciprocal: if we are made up of books, books are made up of us. Books are deeply anthropomorphized.”“…books are ordinary things that become special in the unpredictable and unique human connections they embody and extend. We all encounter rare and valuable books all the time.”While I found a lot of food for thought in this book, it was not at all an easy read. It was dry, and dense, and overly erudite for a layman audience. I can see this being wonderfully well received in the academic world, but I’m not sure how well it will do among the general populace, of which I am one. I appreciated what I was learning, but I’m not sure how much of it will stick with me. The academic tone and voice made it a bit of a slog to get through, and I found myself fighting against and urge to skim. I’m glad to have read this, but I’m not sure it’s something I’ll ever revisit....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 18, 2022","Dec 13, 2022","Feb 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58837753-portable-magic

In recent years I’ve read books in this subgenre that have become lifetime favorites, and those that left me so disappointed it veered into anger. More than one of these disappointments came through books I requested via NetGalley, and yet I keep trying. Books like The World Cannot Give are why. I was almost as enamored by it as I was by Tartt’s The Secret History and Hopen’s The Orchard, both of which I absolutely adore. I’ve read dark academia novels set around groups of classics students, but never around a choir. The addition of music as an important element of the novel evoked in me a taste of that joy Laura pursues so fervently. As did the religiosity early on in the novel. I think the last book I read with this level of spiritual depth was The Orchard by David Hopen. (Which I highly recommend, by the way.) It was fascinating watching as these students changed, for better or worse, and how those changes impacted their passions. And it was devastating to watch everything fall apart, even though I was expecting it.Laura, our perspective character, is a girl completely infatuated with big emotions and anything that can produce them. She yearns for nothing more than a “shipwreck of the soul,” as defined by Samuel Webster, the writer of her favorite novel. When her family finally agrees to let her attend St. Durstan’s, the alma mater of her aforementioned favorite novelist who died at the tender age of nineteen, Laura is ecstatic. On campus she attends her first mandatory Evensong service and is immediately overwhelmed by the beauty of the music. After a few rocky attempts, Laura manages to introduce herself to Virginia, the lone girl in the choir and its unequivocal leader. Laura is immediately transfixed and gives Virginia every ounce of loyalty and devotion within her, which over the course of the novel seems like a nearly bottomless well. Laura finds herself becoming the second female member of the choir, an entrenched part of their select and secretive group, and loving every minute of it.I loved the addition of Bonnie as someone who was obsessed with the dark academia aesthetic without having any understanding of depths it could hide. She serves as a brilliant counterpoint to Laura’s shy but wholehearted embracing of those depths, which itself serves as a brilliant counterpoint to Virginia’s fierce, fiery devotion and personality that either entrances or more often repels with no middle ground. Virginia has another counterpart in Isobel and her relentless tirade against God and tradition. Their personalities are similar in their surety of their own rightness and their willingness to stand for that belief no matter what it might cost them. I found Virginia endlessly fascinating, with her Crusader mentality and her firm belief in her own unerring rightness and her unusual, repellant charisma. There were even points later in the novel where she reminded me of Jay Gatsby as she grew more jaded.These characters have such wild, larger-than-life plans but are so easily bogged down and distracted by the minutia of their everyday campus lives. Not to say that adults are any better about keeping our eyes on whatever prize we set before ourselves instead of getting lost in our routines. But Virginia and her cadre of choir boys and Laura all yearn to be World-Historical, a term coined by Samuel Webster, their hero and idol, in his one and only novel, All Before Them. Being a World-Historical person requires living with intentionality instead of floating through life, and seeking to do great things even when those things are difficult and painful and possibly fatal, if they mean changing the world in some way. These are big aspirations for teens, put before them by another teen who lived out what he preached by dying young for a cause he believed in. If that cause happen to be on the wrong side of history and morality, does that even matter when compared to his fervor? Virginia and Laura and the boys don’t think so.Burton’s writing is excellent. I’m usually slightly weirded out by novels told in present tense, but it worked really well here. I felt like some hidden, parasitic secondary awareness within Laura’s mind, experiencing her life with her while also seeing some things she in her naivety didn’t catch. The discussions of religion and music came from a different worldview than my own, and thus gave me a lot of food for thought even as I disagreed with them, especially the religious views. What’s even more interesting to me is that Burton herself holds a doctorate in theology and, while this is only her second novel, she has been widely published in the academic and journalism worlds. I could feel some of that prior writing here, as every single facet of this book, every scene and diatribe, felt incredibly necessary to the story. No words were wasted, while at the same time never feeling terse. I was also impressed by the fact that, after reading this book, I have no idea what Burton’s personal beliefs are. It would have been so easy for her to use a story so religious in natural as a pulpit, but she never did. I did not once feel as if she were preaching or trying to draw opinions toward any specific beliefs or tenets. The World Cannot Give is a deeply thoughtful addition to the dark academia subgenre. It does unsurprisingly go to some dark places, so be aware of that going in. But I found it insightful without proselytizing, raw without veering into emotional manipulation. The World Cannot Give is a well-balanced novel that I’ll be contemplating for a long time.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 23, 2022","Feb 25, 2022","Feb 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58070067-the-world-cannot-give

It felt like a breath of fresh air in the urban fantasy genre, balancing genre favorite entities, like vampires and more common shapeshifters, with the less familiar, like elemental spirits and blood prophets. The series also managed to be both more brutal and somehow more innocent than most I had read in the genre, which I thought was a very interesting dichotomy. But, as much as I enjoy this world that is so similar to ours except in one major way, part of me wishes Bishop would have moved on after the original series ended in the fifth book. The World of the Others, the spinoff series, has not felt nearly as strong or as special as the original. This is obviously just my own opinion, but the wonder has worn off and, as much as I liked the idea, I think I’ve decided that this is the last book set in this world that I’ll be reading.Bishop’s original five-book series set in this world fascinated me in terms of tone and world building. There was a simplicity and quaintness to the community of the Courtyard, which was an interesting foil to the expansive, terrifyingly unknown Wild Country surrounding the cities. Because so many of these characters could shift into human, but were most definitely Other, there was an innocence to their outlook on life that charmed me in comparison to many of the humans in the novels, whose complexities tended to hide evil. I found all of these building blocks, when paired with the almost oddly simplistic writing style, a truly compelling and original mix.However, after transitioning from the Courtyard and Meg’s story into Wild Country and the small communities scattered within it, something about the series lost me. The simplistic style I enjoyed suddenly felt too simple, like the kind of writing we use to teach kids how to read. It lacked the nuance that helps readers embed themselves in a story. And oddly, the charming quaintness turned into a tendency to bog down so deeply in minutia that it became difficult to keep from skimming. These two concerns are a really weird mix, and no amount of intriguing preternatural entities could make up for them. Whatever magic imbued the original series is missing from The World of the Others.Crowbones in particular felt as if Bishop was trying to juggle too many strands in the plot, leaving the overall narrative feeling muddy. And while I liked the idea of the Jumble, it just didn’t deliver the same level of charm as the Courtyard. There are some interesting characters here, and even some reprisals from the original series, but none of them felt quite as special as that original cast. Vicki, the closest thing we have to a main character, feels as though Bishop has tried too hard to make her quirky, lovable in spite of the fact she feels very unlovable. Something about the way Bishop wrote her fell flat in comparison to Meg. The other characters were fine, but forgettable. Actually, my description of Crowbones, as well as Wild Country and Lake Silence, would be exactly that: fine but forgettable. Which is really a shame, considering how much I enjoyed the first series set in this world. But these three… none of them were bad. I finished them, and didn’t hate them. But I didn’t love them, either. These are “meh” incarnate....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 14, 2022","Mar 23, 2022","Feb 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51469740-crowbones

For a while there I though that Nora might have been running out of ideas for this series and was just keeping it going for the sake of the characters, but it turns out those few weaker installments were outliers, not indicative of the new norm. This book and the two before it were all stronger in plot, while still providing a chance to visit with characters who have become so solid over the course of more than 50 novels that they nearly jump off the page when you crack the books open. In this installment, Nora plays with time and perspective more than usual for the series, which was a fun and interesting change. These elements provided not only additional insight, but more emotional investment in the outcome. While Eve always solves the case in the end, in this book I was on the edge of my seat hoping that she would do so before the other perspective in the present timeline was killed. I enjoyed the added tension in what was already a very interesting, nuanced case.Of course, my favorite element of Abandoned in Death was, as always, catching up with Eve and Roarke and Peabody and the rest. These characters feel so incredibly real to me. I’ve known them since my teen years and have loved watching them grow and change and embark on new phases of life. You would think that, after 54 books, even the best of characters would feel stale, their interactions repetitive. But that’s not the case for this series, at least for me. Just like getting to see the people who matter to me in real life always brings me joy, so does getting to catch up with these characters. And Eve’s bafflement over common idioms always makes me laugh.If you’ve never read anything by Nora and are a lover of both police procedurals and incredible character development, I urge you to pick up the first book in this series, Naked in Death.

She highlights the failings of love in religious families when a child doesn’t mirror the parents’ morals, but in a way that leaves hope open.

My favorite story in the whole little book was “How to Make Love to a Physicist,” which was simply beautiful in every way. The self exploration and cautious acceptance of love were simply stunning. “Jael” was a clever story, and “Peach Cobbler” was amazingly well rounded and was one of the deepest character studies in a book that was full of them. “Snowfall” made me appreciate my Mama and my home state, and “Dear Sister” was a fun look at an unconditional family.

The fact that such horror took place in reality is deeply disturbing but, when held against the more well-known dark parts of our nation’s history, is sadly in no way surprising. The inherent racism in such places, especially in the South and especially when given such loose supervision, isn’t something those involved have even tried very hard to hide until the past few decades.Poor Elwood is just about the unluckiest boy ever. There’s little that’s less fair than someone who does everything right still finding themselves footing the blame for someone else’s crimes. I cared more about Elwood than I did the protagonists of The Underground Railroad, because he was actually given enough time to develop as a character before the central theme of the novel came into play. He was a unique, interesting, driven, morally upright young man who won me over immediately.However, in similar fashion to my experience with The Underground Railroad, I went from caring about the protagonist as an individual to seeing them as little more than a conduit for the story. I think this is just the way in which Whitehead tells his stories. His writing is impeccable, but something about this shift in tone puts me into a more academic mindset in a setting where I feel almost guilty for not experiencing more emotional resonance. Which means that this rating is entirely subjective. I completely understand why The Nickel Boys won the Pulitzer in 2020.

Vasya’s story is well paced, populated with interesting character and lore, and has a lot of heart. Those building blocks mixed with the adult fairy tale vibe made for a very enjoyable reading experience.Arden does a great job with her characters. Vasya continues to be a force of nature, well developed and likable and compelling. I enjoyed getting to see more of her older siblings, Alexander and Olga, in this portion of the story. Morozko is fascinating, and while he remains mysterious, I felt like some light was shed on his personality and motivations and inner struggles in this book. The few supporting characters who were given any amount of time on the page were colorful. However, my favorite character apart from Vasya was Solovey, without contest. Arden is one of those authors for whom writing lovable, multifaceted animal characters seems to come naturally. All of the horses in this book have plenty of personality, but Solovey wins. He has so much sass, and is such a perfect friend and companion to Vasya throughout their adventures. I deeply wish that such a magnificent, magical horse would appear in my life.Historical fantasy isn’t a genre I read a lot of, but like other works of historical fiction it always makes me deeply appreciate the time and place in which I live. While there are definitely a plethora of problems in our modern society, there has never been a better time or place to be a woman. Thank God we have more rights and freedoms and options than the women of Russia during this period. The life Vasya’s sister, Olga, leads, the kind of life that is expected for Vasya and every other woman in Moscow at the time, sounds absolutely dreadful. Living your entire life in a tower, getting to leave only to attend church or attend to your husband once married, sounds appalling. The writing here is polished, and captures the feel of a fairy tale incredibly well. So well in fact that, while I very much enjoyed the story and the characters, they never felt quite real to me. The stories and characters I come to love most are those that invade my mind when I’m not reading, when I’m doing housework or walking dogs or dreaming. This series doesn’t do that for me. Which is totally fine, as fairy tales never have, either, but it keeps me from making a deeper emotional connection to them.The lore and mythology remain my favorite aspect of this trilogy. Arden has done a brilliant job at capturing the setting in such a way that the cold is palpable and you can almost see the domovoi Vasya sees. The world building is truly excellent, and I love how Arden builds on the actual history of Moscow in such a way that you can feel both her respect for and infatuation with the area. The concept of modern monotheistic religions like Christianity chasing away traditional pagan beliefs isn’t a new one, but the way it’s handled in this series is very compelling.I really like both The Girl in the Tower and The Bear and the Nightingale, and I expect The Winter of the Witch to deliver more of the same.

I legitimately squealed. Dark Matter and Recursion were both instant favorites for me, so I couldn’t wait to read whatever Crouch had written next. Then I read the synopsis, which immediately brought to mind the movie and subsequent tv series, Limitless. I loved both iterations of the story, so my excitement swelled even larger. But Upgrade took that basic premise and encompassed not only the radical expansion of the mind, but of the workings of the body, as well. Even more amazing! “The greatest threat to our species lies within us.”However, whether due to my irrationally high expectations and excitement or the fact that I might not have been quite intelligent enough for this book, Upgrade left me feeling vaguely disappointed. While still a good story, it didn’t pack the same punch for me as its two predecessors. Subjectively, at least. Remember that this is strictly my opinion from my own experience with the book. No doubt this will be on several Best of 2022 lists. It just won’t be on mine. “Maybe compassion and empathy are just squishy emotions. Illusions created by our mirror neurons. But does it really matter where they come from? They make us human. They might even be what make us worth saving.”What exactly makes us human? If there was a way to upgrade your genome, to speed up evolution and become something better, faster, smarter, stronger, would you take it? How can we as humans stop our own decline and subsequent extinction? Does the life of the minority supersede the wellbeing of the majority? What risks are we willing to take, individually and collectively, to turn our downward trajectory around? These are some of the questions raised in Upgrade, and I loved the food for thought. There were some profound things said in this book. But they felt very self-aware in their profundity. Did I still highlight them and spend time thinking about them? Absolutely. Our perspective character’s struggles with these questions were the core of the novel.“We were a monstrous, thoughtful, selfish, sensitive, fearful, ambitious, loving, hateful, hopeful species. We contained within us the potential for great evil, but also for great good. And we were capable of so much more than this.”Logan Ramsey is trying to live down a horrific legacy. His mother was responsible for a genetically engineered worldwide famine. Though that wasn’t her intent, and the virus was originally designed to end a blight on rice crops, it mutated and spread to various other food crops across the planet, resulting in death by starvation for over two hundred million people. Imagine that legacy, especially when you worked for your mother’s lab. Logan’s struggles with guilt and grief and rage felt very believable, as did his fierce love for his wife and daughter. I loved those relationships and thought that Beth and Ava were lovely side characters. And I loved Logan during the first half or so of the book. But it felt like, the further into the plot Crouch got, the less substantial Logan became. The same could be said for all of the supporting cast. There were moments when the strength of the character development would reappear, but it always ended up fading back into the background. That being said, that early character development kept me invested in the plot, which is what matters most with a propulsive thriller of a novel like this one. Also, the scenario was hyper-realistic and felt plausible enough to maintain a ton of tension as I read.“I had extraordinary dreams and an ordinary mind.”“No one teaches you how to handle the death of a dream.”Something I’ve always appreciated about Blake Crouch and Andy Weir is that, though very science-heavy, their books still feel accessible to those who aren’t as scientifically minded. Upgrade, however, felt almost too extreme for me. I found the science exhausting to try to keep up with, which left me feeling as if I wasn’t intelligent enough to be reading it. Which isn’t something you want in your fiction-reading experience. I blew through Dark Matter and Recursion very quickly, but I found myself frequently feeling overwhelmed by Upgrade and putting it down for a time in favor of other books. I also felt, for the first time with Crouch’s work, that I was being preached at through the inner thoughts of and dialogues between the characters. While I agreed with a lot of the more philosophical and ecological observations, something about the way in which these thoughts were presented made me feel somehow belittled or condescended on occasion. I am positive that this wasn’t the authorial intent, but that was the result.“…what do we have to lose?”“Everything it means to be human.”Upgrade is a good story with a fantastic premise. It was pretty well paced and housed characters who shone brightly upon occasion. Objectively, it was a solid book, though I still don’t think it was quite on par with Dark Matter and Recursion. Subjectively, I felt it was trying too hard to deliver social commentary, and that the central story suffered a bit because of it. I’m extremely interested to see what the readerly consensus and outlying opinions of Upgrade are going to be, and if those opinions have any retroactive bearing on my own.All quotations were taken from an uncorrected galley and are subject to change upon publication.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 11, 2022","Feb 19, 2022","Feb 11, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59838811-upgrade

Razorblade Tears broke my heart and kept me on the edge of my seat in equal measures. It’s a superb piece of crime fiction with powerful messages about racism, sexuality, and accepting your loved ones for who they are, no matter how different they might be, before you run out of chances. It’s about vengeance and justice and learning that you can still grow even when you’ve been set in your ways for longer than you can remember. It’s about family, both that which you’re born into and that which you build for yourself along the way. It’s about grief and how, sometimes, you don’t even feel like you deserve to feel it. Above all, this is a story that felt honest and real and true at its core, despite being a work of fiction.“Tears ran from his eyes and stung his cheeks. Tears for his son. Tears for his wife. Tears for the little girl they had to raise. Tears for who they were and what they all had lost. Each drop felt like it was slicing his face open like a razorblade.”This is the story of Ike and Buddy Lee, two men who on the surface couldn’t seem more different. Ike is a middle-class small business owner, married with a lovely house in the suburbs. Buddy Lee is “between jobs,” living in a rundown trailer and subsisting mainly on alcohol. Ike is black, and Buddy Lee is redneck white. They have two things in common: both are ex-cons, and their sons Isiah and Derek are married to each other. Neither man accepts their son’s sexuality, and both have a very strained relationship with their child until the unthinkable happens. Both young men are brutally murdered in their home, leaving behind a three-year-old daughter, unanswered questions, and bitter, regretful grief in their fathers. The book opens at their funeral, which marks the first time Ike and Buddy Lee have ever spoken. Both are deeply regretful of how they had treated their sons, and both are filled with fury over the murder. When the cops have pretty much let the case go cold after a couple of months, Buddy Lee and Ike take the solving of the murder and avenging their sons’ deaths into their own hands.“It didn’t seem fair for a man to morn someone, abundantly, that he had loved, so miserly.”Cosby’s work has been classified as violent Southern noir, and that feels exactly right. It captures the feel of the American South superbly, balancing the good and the bad without making us a caricature of ourselves. Razorblade Tears was gritty and dark but ultimately redemptive. The growth of Ike and Buddy Lee over the course of the novel was beautiful to watch. The ways in which they came to terms with their own failings as fathers, and their deep desire to find some way to show the boys that they loved them and accepted them and would have gone to any lengths to apologize for how they treated them in life, was profoundly moving. I also really loved how their relationship shifted from a grudging partnership to a genuine friendship over the course of the novel. “Folks like to talk about revenge like it’s a righteous thing but it’s just hate in a nicer suit…”The characters and their inner struggles were absolutely my favorite element of the novel. However, there wasn’t a single way in which Cosby fumbled this book. The aforementioned setting was well handled. The mystery element was expertly balanced, managing to be both impossible to guess and totally sensible once revealed. We learned at the same rate as the main characters, which I loved. The explorations of racism, sexuality, and homophobia were beautifully multifaceted. The external conflicts, between Ike and Buddy Lee and those who had been involved in the murders of their sons, were believable brutal. The prose was poetic when it needed to be, and disappeared into the narrative when that best served the plot. And the pacing was perfect for the story.“The tears came again. They poured from his eyes and ran over his cheeks. Flowed down to the stubble of his chin.This time did didn’t feel so much like razorblades. They felt like the long-awaited answer to a mournful prayer for rain.”Razorblade Tears is such a powerful story, and it’s exceptionally well told. It’s moving, thought-provoking, and propulsive, which is a difficult balance to strike. Honestly, there’s nothing about it that I would change. Sensitive readers should be aware of the graphic violence, and might need to pass on this. But if you have a strong stomach and want to be challenged while also experiencing a story that is almost impossible to put down, you should definitely read Razorblade Tears.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 07, 2022","Feb 11, 2022","Feb 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860585-razorblade-tears

I’ve been bringing books that I loved in the past and that impacted my faith in some way to a girl at my church. When the youth group girls started doing a Bible study on Elijah, I knew this book was the next I needed to recommend. But as I hadn’t read it in a decade, I knew I wouldn’t remember many details if she wanted to discuss it, so obviously a reread was in order. And it was so much fun!Ela of Parne has been chosen by the Infinite to serve as his first prophet in seventy years. She is also the first female prophet in remembered history, as well as one of the youngest at right around eighteen. But when the Infinite speaks to her, offering Ela the opportunity to be His voice to enemy nations, she doesn’t hesitate. Throughout the book, I was so impressed with Ela’s faith. There was enough internal fear and conflict to make her faith believable, but her practical outward trust in the Infinite even when terrified was exemplary. She was definitely a female counterpart to the Biblical prophet Elijah in more than just her plot arc.The world Larson built here is what I would consider light fantasy. It’s a world that’s not our own, with just enough differences to hammer home that fact. But it is similar enough that setting stories from the Old Testament within it made perfect sense. I also found that it breathed some new life into stories that I’ve heard my entire life by changing things up just enough to highlight the core of the stories. It reminded me how powerful and impactful these stories are.While Ela is without a doubt the star of this book, the supporting cast was wonderful, as well. Tzana, Ela’s younger sister who suffers from a very unusual disease, is a little ray of sunshine despite her ailment, and I loved that she tagged along with Ela on her journeys. Kien had a lot of character as well as a slow, believable arc of growth, and I look forward to revisiting more of his story in the next installment of the trilogy. And then there’s Pet, also known as Scythe, a beast of a warhorse breed known in-world as destroyers. I had a soft spot for great animal characters, and Larson definitely delivered that with Pet.I thought this was a very solid, fast-paced book, especially for Christian fiction. I tend to love the message of a lot of Christian fiction while being left wanting with the actual prose and story, but that wasn’t the case here. The prose didn’t sparkle, but it served the story well. If I had any complaint it would be that certain sections felt almost too fast, not giving the scene enough time to breathe before moving on to the next. If the girl I lent this to enjoyed it as much as I did, then I’ll be incredibly happy. Hopefully she’ll want to continue the series, which will give me an excuse to continue the reread....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 07, 2022","Feb 10, 2022","Feb 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11823941-prophet

Tordotcom has been kind enough to facilitate that tradition for the past 6 years by sending me a galley copy of each installment before its publication, usually in January. It’s always one of my most exciting pieces of book mail of the year. Some installments have been more successful (for me) than others, but this year’s release, Where the Drowned Girls Go, brought me back to the magic of the first book. There we were introduced to the dark sister school of Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children, but we also begin to see various storylines from previous novellas finally tying themselves together. Because of this, my hopes for this newest installment, Lost in the Moment and Found, were very high, and I was expecting even more of the series to come together.Lost in the Moment and Found is nothing like I expected while still being everything I hoped it would be. I was expecting a furtherance of the overarching plot, as we were given in its direct predecessor, Where the Drowned Girls Go. That’s not what McGuire delivers here. Instead, she gives us an achingly beautiful, linear observation of a beautiful little girl whose life falls apart slowly but unexpectedly. And as we follow this girl, we see her face her trauma in nuanced, subtle ways that could be by turns both difficult and healing for readers who have faced similar things in their own pasts. Antsy’s story is beautiful, sad, and oddly cathartic. I was gripped from the first sentence to the last.Antoinette, or Antsy to those who love her, is a beautiful, feisty, very happy 5 year-old when we first meet her. But when she loses her father, in a way that he can never be found, Antsy’s life takes a turn. When things outside of her control threaten her in ways that she can’t even fully understand, Antsy runs. And, like many such children on the run from trauma, Antsy finds her Door. The world she finds on the other side is a bit of a nexus, and Antsy finds that she can visit all kinds of worlds from the Shop Where the Lost Things Go. This Shop lives up to its name; it is indeed where all the lost things go. Some are searched out and found, while others find new homes and still others molder away, forgotten for always. Antsy will face some unusual (but highly symbolic) difficulties and decisions in the Shop, but the Door was right; this place is hers. As with all of the books in the Wayward Children series, trauma and the ways in which we deal with it are at the forefront of this story. Each novella has addressed a different source of trauma, or multiple sources, in different ways. In Lost in the Moment and Found, that trauma is grooming, adult gaslighting, and what those things could possibly lead to. Because this could be so triggering for so many readers, McGuire makes sure that you know, before the story even begins, that Antsy runs. Before anything can happen, Antsy runs. I love that McGuire gives us this warning at the beginning, because it’s something that is so personal to her. I really respect both the decision and McGuire’s transparency here.The writing itself is just as beautiful and poignant as I’ve come to expect from this series. McGuire has an achingly lovely way with words, but in a way that further builds and focuses on the character at the center of the story instead of distracting from her in any way. I love lush prose, but not at the expense of the characters or story, so the balance McGuire strikes here is absolutely perfect, in my opinion. This is a slim tale that part of me wishes were longer, but honestly these novellas are the perfect length for the stories they hold. These are without a doubt my favorite novellas, and they demonstrate how the shorter format can shine in the right hands. Lost in the Moment and Found is an exquisite installment in what has become one of my favorite series of all time. There is something powerful and profound, heartbreaking and life-affirming, about the series as a whole. Not every novella has been my favorite, but this is the 5th in the series that I’ve given a full 5 star rating. The stories McGuire is telling through this series matter so much. Wayward Children beautifully represents every kind of person and showcases how children can overcome even the worst trauma. I’m so glad that I live in a world where these books exist and are there to help those who see themselves in any of these stories face what they’ve suffered and find a way to overcome it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 26, 2022","Dec 31, 2022","Feb 03, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/60784912-lost-in-the-moment-and-found

Every poem says something about its poet, and yet every poem is completely dependent on the life experiences and imagination of its reader for whatever meaning they wring from it. Taking that into consideration, some of these poems resonated with me. Deeply. And some left me completely unmoved, or vaguely confused. But those that spoke to me are what I’ll remember about this collection.“History, despite its wrenching pain,Cannot be unlived, but if facedWith courage, need not be lived again.”Angelou’s style is all over the board. Evidently I’m a traditionalist when it comes to poetic forms. I like free-verse well enough, but ironically only if it has some structure. I was incapable of connecting with the less structured of Angelou’s poems, but thankfully this didn’t hold true for her entire catalogue, as her style was so fluid and ever-changing.“We are born in pain, then relief comes.We are lost in the dark, then day breaks.We are confused, confounded, and fearful,Then faith takes our hand.We stumble and fumble and fall,Then, we rise.”I kept reminding myself that this wasn’t a traditional collection, where the poet had carefully compiled each poem to embody a certain theme, or period in their life, or some other binding quality. This book collected every poem Angelou ever wrote. No one produces profound, flawless art every time their pen meets the page. But within these pages were some intensely powerful poems, lines that ruffle feathers or shake cores or move hearts in ways that are difficult to describe. I can absolutely see why Angelou made such a mark on society, both through her life and her poetry.

For some reason, The People We Keep isn’t a book I’ve really heard mentioned anywhere else. If it hadn’t been one of BotM’s options, I might have never heard of it, much less picked it up. I’m so incredibly thankful that I did, though. The People We Keep is a heartbreakingly beautiful story that perfectly balances sorrow and joy. With a diverse cast of larger-than-life characters and a protagonist that I not only rooted for but wished I could pluck from the pages and adopt, this book filled my heart to the bursting point and gave me an even greater appreciation for all of the wonderful people in my own life. “We have people we get to keep, who won’t ever let us go. And that’s the most important part. That’s what’s true.”April is 16 when she plays her first gig and decides to drop out of high school, all within 24 hours. Her mom left when April was just a kid, and her dad is building a new family while trying to forget that his daughter even exists. With only her dad’s ex-girlfriend to miss her, April decides to hit the road. I absolutely adore April. She’s a beautifully developed character, and watching her change and grow over the course of the novel almost felt like watching helplessly as my child grew up, with no way for me to reach her. She suffered some serious hardship, and I think Larkin did a wonderful job balancing resilience and heartache, allowing April to be both jaded and optimistic in the same breath. This dichotomy made her such a believable character, as I think that is how most of us face tough situations, with a mix of cynicism and cautious hope. That blend just feels so honest to real life. There’s plenty of ugliness, but there’s beauty, too, if you look.“I want to believe there will still be newness in the world for me. That it's not all faded and dusty.”I was immediately drawn into this story by the first chapter, when April is playing at an open mic night for the first time. Larkin’s descriptions of how April felt about her music, how it felt to sing and be at one with her guitar, how much different it was playing songs she wrote for an audience instead of alone in her dilapidated motorhome, were captivating.  I always love books where music is important, and here it’s almost a character in its own right. If Larkin isn’t a musician herself, she must be close to someone who is. I loved April’s songwriting process and the value she placed on her instrument.“If someone changes so much that they’re barely the same person, who are you even missing?”The various settings of this book were all excellent, none moreso than Ithaca. It turns out this is because Larkin attended Ithaca College. Her love for the town shines so brightly in this book. But the other locales featured in the story were also well presented, and felt like important elements of the plot instead of randomly chosen locations in which a story could happen. I kind of hate that a book set in the 1990s is now considered historical fiction, but that’s the price of getting older, I suppose. But the prices and payphones and lack of some newer technology all served the story very well. Setting this book in the 90s was exactly the right choice. I also loved visiting all of the bars and coffeeshops, seeing their similarities contrasting their wild differences. Even April’s car was an important setting, which I thought was a fun writing decision on Larkin’s part.“I say that it's amazing how much you can miss people you only got to be with for one tiny perfect bit of time; how a place where you barely got to live can be the closest thing you've ever had to home.”While I loved the settings, and the music, and the plot that tore at my heart, the crowning achievement of this novel is its characters. I’ve already discussed how much I loved April, but the supporting cast was just as wonderful. Everywhere April went, she somehow found people who were odd and diverse and plagued with their own problems, but were at the same time so full of love to give her. Larkin wisely inserted a few characters who didn’t fit this description, which just made the goodness of the other characters blaze even brighter. If I were asked to choose one book to serve as a perfect example of the found family trope, this would be the one I chose. I wish these people were real, and that I could take a roadtrip to meet them all.“I wonder if maybe all you do is meet people and lose them. And their smile fades the further you go, because you have to carry the space they leave.... And maybe the space gets bigger and heavier every year.”The People We Keep captured my heart on the first page and kept its grip tight even after I read the final scene. Larkin is a gifted author, and I’m so glad to have come into contact with her work in general and this book in particular. If you love a found family, or music, or a phenomenally developed protagonist and supporting cast, or all of the above, you should definitely read this book.(Side note: If you’re an audiobook person, The People We Keep is narrated by the always phenomenal Julia Whelan!)You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 28, 2022","Feb 05, 2022","Jan 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711726-the-people-we-keep

I don’t even think it was intentional, but that fact said a lot about both her enjoyment of the book and how quickly the synopsis captured her imagination. The Roughest Draft is the story of coauthors whose work took the world by storm, their messy falling out, and their reluctant reunion to fulfill their contract by writing one last book together. I was told by my mom that it was a more serious combination of Beach Read and The People We Meet on Vacation, both of which I loved. However, while I was completely glued to this book for 24 hours, it didn’t capture my heart in the same way. I was entranced by what the authors had to say about writing and cowriting, but I had some issues with the characters.If I relate to any character in this novel, it’s Harriet, a former writer friend of both Katrina and Nathan. She pulls no punches and says exactly what’s on her mind, and I agree heartily with her; these two need some serious therapy, both together and individually. I had a hard time liking either of them. While they did grow on me over the course of the novel, their relationship epitomized what I don’t like about angsty romances: miscommunication or a complete lack thereof. Which was made doubly frustrating by the fact that they were not just authors, but coauthors. For some reason, their dynamic early in the book brought to mind Fates and Furies, another novel where the writing was excellent but the central couple made me want to claw my own eyes out on multiple occasions. It bothers me when an author or songwriter or anyone really acts like a couple who doesn’t fight is utterly lacking in passion and not truly in love. I just can’t agree. Chris and I have never fought. Not once. We’ve never even raised our voices. But when I see him, when I think about him, when I talk to others about him, my heart is so full of him that my chest hurts and my eyes fill. He makes me laugh and think and feel unlike anyone else, and has done for half of my life now. So no, I don’t think that fighting is a prerequisite for true passion in a relationship. And I hate when artists try to plant doubt in those whose marriages aren’t plagued with angst and dysfunction. Even if that planting of doubt is inadvertent, and even if it has never once taken root in my own mind, it’s a decision that always drives me crazy.As I mentioned earlier, I really loved everything this book had to say about writing and cowriting and the importance of fiction. I found myself highlighting a ton, so much so in fact that I couldn’t even narrow down quotations to include in this . The cover art of The Roughest Draft led me to believe that this was going to be a frothy romance, but I found that it instead perfectly blurred the lines between romance and literary fiction, which gave the story more gravitas than I expected. And I loved getting to the end of the book and discovering that the authors themselves are married, and came up with the idea for this book on their honeymoon. This knowledge retroactively added in some of the charm that I was missing when face with my mom’s comparison the Emily Henry’s novels. While it might seem as though I did little but complain about what didn’t work for me in The Roughest Draft, I found it a very solid story, with more substance than many of the romances I read last year. There’s plenty of meat here; I just wish the sweet had been a little sweeter, and permeated more of the story. Whatever issues I had with it, this book was incredibly compelling, and I highly recommend it to romance readers looking for something with depth and angst, or literary readers in search of a happy ending....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 27, 2022","Jan 28, 2022","Jan 27, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57933316-the-roughest-draft

Even the more heroic epics, such as The Iliad, often see the heroesNothing reeks of trauma and death and shattered dreams quite like a Greek tragedy. Even the more heroic epics, such as The Iliad, often see the heroes victorious but slain among their enemies. But what of those left behind, those doomed to pick up the pieces in the aftermath? What of those stepped on and over by these so-called heroes on their path to glory? What of their “prizes,” those they claim as trophies after their victories? In other words, what of the women?“Can’t you see that it just goes on, over and over? The gods demand their justice, but we suffer for it, every time.”Elektra had a much clearer message than Saint’s debut novel, Ariadne. Ariadne did bring forth the plight of women in the ancient world, and demonstrate that heroes often come with a dark side, but that was about it. This novel, however, speaks of violence begetting more violence, of revenge being cyclical and all-consuming and never as fulfilling as one hopes. It speaks of obsession, and how that obsession can skew one’s views of events. And, most of all, it hammers home the saying “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.” What the two have in common, and what I like the most about them outside of their setting and status as Greek retellings, is a distinctly feminist take on historically masculine stories.“To be surprised, you had to have a belief that the world would follow its rhythms and patterns as it had always done.”Our story is told from three perspectives. Elektra, our title character, actually felt like the least important of the three, though she is the last woman standing. Youngest daughter of Agamemnon, the king of all Greek kings, Elektra is fiercely loyal to her father, and yearns for nothing more than his safe return from Troy. Her devotion is religious, and almost even romantic in nature. Because she was so young when he left for Troy, she has idolized him in such a way as to propel him into near godlike status in her mind and heart. She would do literally anything for her father and her king, up to and including allowing herself to be sacrificed to the gods if he requested it of her.“The shriek of agony in our souls, that could only be soothed by one thing. Revenge.”Which brings us to our second perspective character, Clytemnestra, wife of Agamemnon and mother of his children. Including the eldest daughter he so callously sacrifices to the gods in exchange for a fair wind to sail his ships to Troy. Clytemnestra is shocked, appalled, devastated by the suddenness and cruelty of the loss, and yearns for nothing more than Agamemnon’s safe return from Troy. So she can kill him herself. So obsessed is she with her loss and her plot for vengeance that she can see nothing else. Including the three children left to her.“We would lay down our lives for our children, and every time we faced birth, we stood on the banks of that great river that separated the living from the dead. A massed army of women, facing that perilous passage with no armor to protect us, only our own strength and hope that we would prevail.” Our last perspective character is Cassandra, princess and doomed prophetess of Troy. She is a priestess of Apollo but, because she spurned his romantic advances, she is cursed to always see what horrors the future holds and never find anyone to believe her. When Agamemnon brings the Grecian armies to Troy to reclaim his brother’s wife, Helen, Cassandra sees the devastation to come. And when her unheeded prophecies come true, she is taken as Agamemnon’s own war prize. Which means that she sees his doom coming.“Don’t think about what he did. Think about how we’ll punish him for it.”I didn’t find any of these perspective characters likable. But I actually didn’t mind that in regards to this particular story. When you know how things are going to end before the story even begins, you don’t mind not forming an attachment to the characters. However, while I didn’t find these women very sympathetic, I did find them interesting. If I had to choose a favorite, it would probably be Clytemnestra. Her single-minded focus on vengeance might be a flawed one, but you can’t help but respect her for following through. She’s the most interesting character in the Oresteia, in my opinion, and I enjoyed her portion of that story as told in this novel. I’ve always been a bit fascinated by Cassandra, whose wretched existence has become such a popular archetype. (For example, Professor Trelawney from Harry Potter has a Cassandra complex.) “Why would I be afraid? You can only fear if you have something to lose, and I have nothing.”Outside of the main characters, my favorite was actually Helen. I loved this portrayal of her; it didn’t excuse her actions, but it gave her more character and empathy than I’ve witnessed in other interpretations. The most despicable character in this novel is Agamemnon, without a doubt. One thing that every retelling of The Iliad and related works seems to agree on in that Agamemnon was simply a terrible human being. Which made Elektra and her devotion to him my least favorite of the three perspectives in the book. “They hated her because she was so beautiful and because she made them want her so much. Nothing brought them more joy than the fall of a lovely woman. They picked over her reputation like vultures, scavenging for every scrap of flesh they could devour.”Over the past couple of years, I’ve consumed multiple retellings and translations of The Iliad and this is the first I’ve read that focuses on the women in the background. I know that there other others, specifically The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker and A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes, but I haven’t yet gotten around to those. And I’ve never come across a retelling of the Oresteia, so I really enjoyed that aspect of the story.“I have become the master of my passions, and I know now that however strong the grip of agony, however fiercely it squeezes me in its terrible embrace, it can never break me.”Elektra is not a happy tale, but if you know that going in, it’s a very interesting one. Saint’s writing in this novel was lovely, and captured her characters well. I still can’t help comparing it to Madeline Miller’s work, which I think is simply stronger in philosophical depth and character development and poetic prose. But that’s a subjective stance. I will say that I enjoyed Elektra more than Ariadne, and could see true growth on Saint’s part between the two novels. I will definitely be reading anything else she publishes in the mythological retelling vein.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"May 19, 2022","May 25, 2022","Jan 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58725016-elektra

There’s a truly unique balance of ferocity and innocence, soft sympathy and agressive resolve in each of these poems and short stories. I found it thought-provoking and encouraging to the point of inspirational.“That idea...it was you. You are the universe’s fairytale come true.”Gill also includes original fables in this collection, stories of why it rains and where night came from and why we have seasons. These were just as fierce and lovely as the poetry. As were the short stories, which really read more like poetry in prose form than anything. While not every single poem or story was a hit for me, the vast majority were. Each piece gave me a lot of food for thought. I spent a lot of time reading stanzas to my husband and discussing them with him, which added to the experience.

It’s a Russian nesting doll of a book of the highest class. No, the highest caliber is a more fitting description, I suppose, for this gunslinger’s fairytale. I loved it in the same way I loved The Eyes of the Dragon, but perhaps even more fervently. Actually, I did something I don’t recall ever doing before; I left a bookmark right at the beginning of the fairytale portion when I re-shelved the book, so I could flip it open and read just that section whenever I choose. “Sometimes I feel the world has come loose of its moorings.”“It has,” I said. “But what comes loose can be tied tight again…”The Wind Through the Keyhole is the last Dark Tower story King wrote and added to the main series, but it takes place chronologically between books 4 and 5, Wizard and Glass and Wolves of the Calla. So that’s where I decided to read it. This story picks up immediately where Wizard and Glass left off, with Roland and his ka-tet leaving Lud. As they shelter from a terrifying storm called a starkblast, Roland tells the ka-tet an account from his youth, within which is embedded a gunslinger’s fable, The Wind Through the Keyhole, that his mother read to him when he was little. It’s this most internal story, this eponymous fable, that stole my heart in this book. I enjoyed both framework tales quite a bit, but something about The Wind Through the Keyhole struck me as special, even more magical than this series that has so captured my imagination over the past few years. This fable is the story of Tim, a boy of eleven who has a wonderful life on the edge of a deadly forest until the day it takes his father from him and Nell, Tim’s mother. Life after that is hard, and grows harder, until Tim embarks on a quest, an adventure the likes of which his world had never seen. King did a brilliant job balancing the stark and deadly against the dreamlike and beautiful. I was completely captivated. “Time is a keyhole, he thought as he looked up at the stars. Yes, I think so. We sometimes bend and peer through it. And the wind we feel on our cheeks when we do—the wind that blows through that keyhole—is the breath of all the living universe.”While the fable portion was one of my favorite things ever, I really loved the rest of the book, as well. The series as a whole is this wonderful blend of fantasy, horror, and western genres that work together weirdly well, and there’s something about that mix in King’s hands that pulls me in immediately. The setting is unlike anything else I’ve ever read, and I love it. I would hate to be sucked into it, obviously; it’s one of the deadliest settings I’ve come across, as well. But I love the visits I can make safely from my couch as I read the books. “A person’s never to old for stories, Bill. Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old. We live for them.”Then there are the characters. Roland is just a wonderful character who has developed so much over the course of this series. And I’ve loved the building of his ka-tet, and the characters who make that up. These other four characters are all delightful in their own ways, though I won’t discuss them by name here for fear of spoiling previous books. But suffice it to say that this core group, this ka-tet that Roland has accidentally accrued over the course of the series is diverse, well-rounded, and bursting with charm and heart. Every chance I get to spend time with them feels special. There was also an appearance by the Covenant Man within Roland’s story-within-a-story, a man who is known by so many other names in King’s worlds, which always gives me a thrill.“He’s made of lies from boots to crown, and his gospels bring nothing but tears.”I’m going to share something random that isn’t going to make a lot of sense if you have no exposure to this series, but it made my little nerd heart grow three sizes. I don’t think it could be considered a spoiler, but I apologize if I’m wrong. There are twelve Guardians of the Beam, huge sentient creatures who protect the Tower and hold creation together. The Guardian most often referenced in King’s work is the Turtle, Maturin. In this book the name of the Lion guardian is revealed to be Aslan, which just made my Narnia-loving self explode with happiness. It’s the small things in life, right? And this was one of my small things.""In the end, the wind takes everything, doesn’t it? And why not? Why other? If the sweetness of our lives did not depart, there would be no sweetness at all.”I have to confess that I had a few sharp moments of sadness not having Frank Muller read this installment to me. I opted to read this book with my eyeballs only, instead of mixing my mediums as I did with the second, third, and fourth books. King reads this one himself and, while I’ve muscled my way through a handful of his self-narrated works, I knew I wouldn’t be able to help but compare his voice to Muller’s reading of this ka-tet I’ve so grown to love. And, somehow, I could hear Muller’s cadence in my mind as I read, which made me happier than I can express.“The two most beautiful words in any language are: I forgive.”I adored The Wind Through the Keyhole with every fiber of my being. I hugged it when I finished reading it. Was it perfect? Of course not. I’m sure I could find things to critique. But I didn’t even really look, if I’m being honest. I simply let myself love the experience of reading it. It’s one of those rare books that I can see myself revisiting on a bad day, not to read it from cover to cover but to just open it to the section I love the most and let myself sink into the fable at its heart. I still have three books to go, so I can’t say with any kind of certainty what kind of impact this book had on the story when it was published after the series was considered completed. And maybe the series could stand without it perfectly well. But I’m so glad that it doesn’t have to. I’m glad that King decided to revisit the Tower and brought readers back this fairytale of a gift.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jan 20, 2022","Jan 26, 2022","Jan 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17323860-the-wind-through-the-keyhole

The Winternight trilogy is one such entry, so he, TS, Eon, and I decided to read The Bear and the Nightingale together. And it was such a fun experience! It was a perfect winter read that wasn’t too challenging while also generating plenty of discussion. The Bear and the Nightingale is an atmospheric tale rich in its setting and folklore, with a protagonist who is easy to root for. I didn’t quite fall in love with the book, but I liked it very much, and I’m interested to see how my opinion changes as we progress through the remainder of the trilogy. Vasilisa is the fifth and final daughter of Marina, who dies in childbirth and leaves her husband, Pyotr, a widower. Marina knew Vasilisa would be special, different from her other children. This proves to be the case as she grows up wild, until Pyotr decides he must remarry so that Vasya, as she will be called from here on out, will have a mother to help rear her. But nothing goes according to plan and Vasya continues to be different and wild and viewed with suspicion by the very superstitious villagers. When a new priest is sent to the village, things go from bad to worse. Vasya finds herself straining to save not only an old way of life, but the lives of her people, even as they grow to revile her. As hunger and madness and want threaten everyone she loves, will Vasya find a way to keep the beast at bay?It’s impossible not to love Vasya. She’s headstrong and proud and selfless and empathetic to a fault. This combination makes for a heroine who loves even the undeserving, and will stop at nothing to save those she loves. I really enjoyed her interactions will all the creatures of fable who lived right among the people, but who were invisible to almost everyone else. This second sight and her willingness to do whatever was right no matter the cost were really her two biggest defining characteristics. I didn’t care for many of the supporting cast, and even actively hated a couple, but I did think all of Vasya’s siblings were pretty great and showed promise, especially her two younger siblings and Sasha, who departed fairly early in the book but who I hope we’ll see again sometime in the trilogy. I love the Russian mythology and folklore that served as the backbone of this story, and the tension between that and the religion that stalks it. The dichotomy between the two belief systems and their accompanying ways of life provided excellent tension and a lot of room for thought. My very favorite element in the entire book were the creatures of traditional Russian folklore as we were shown them through the eyes of Vasya. Whether they guarded the hearth or the stable, or sought to drown unsuspecting young men in lakes, they were a fascinating look into a mythos about which I know little. I have books on my shelves dedicated to Norse myths, Greek myths, Egyptian myths, Celtic myths, Native American myths, and even early American folk tales, but The Bear and the Nightingale made me realize that I have nothing dedicated to Slavic myths. Which in turn made me start looking at other areas in which the mythology and folklore portion of my library is lacking. I suppose that’s something I’ll have to address as it’s a topic that fascinates me to no end.The Bear and the Nightingale is a solid, transportive series opener that made for some perfect seasonal reading this January. It’s difficult not to compare it to Spinning Silver, which is the first book I read and adored in 2022. The icy Russian setting, the otherworldly male being with some type of power over winter and death, the folklore, and the fairy tale feel of the stories were both very similar, though both are admittedly very much their own stories. I happen to think Spinning Silver was a touch more nuanced and mature, but there was a sweetness and timelessness to The Bear and the Nightingale. that enchanted me.

I’ve heard remarkable things about Towles’s style and A Gentleman in Moscow is a book that has been on my shelf almost since its publication in 2016. I’ve heard remarkable things about Towles’s style and characterization. However, I had also heard that it was a quiet book, a slow story softly told, so I decided that I would have to be in just exactly the right mood to pick it up. I was so wrong. While I understand the quiet description, as the plot follows our protagonist after he is sentenced to a life of house arrest within the walls of Moscow’s Metropol Hotel, it was by no means slow. Yes, the story was obviously constrained in setting by our main character’s confinement, but his life was still so tremendously full that I never felt like that pace wasn’t being propelled forward quickly enough. A Gentleman in Moscow is a beautiful, moving, utterly charming story, with characters who won my heart completely and prose that I wanted to sink into and live inside forever. “…what matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause; what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the uncertainty of acclaim.”Count Alexander Rostov won me over immediately, as he maintained an aggressively sunny attitude in the face of a distressing situation. He refused to see the glass of his circumstances as half empty, instead finding ways to be not just accepting of, but even pleased about the situation in which he found himself. At least externally. There is of course internal conflict, without which he wouldn’t be nearly as compelling. I found the Count’s voice incredibly enchanting. When he compares reading a book of essays to crawling across the Sahara, or the arms of a clock embracing when noon is struck, I was utterly charmed. How could I not immediately love him? Something about the room he is assigned versus the rooms to which he was accustomed, and how he makes the most of a much smaller space, brought to mind one of my favorite children’s classics: A Little Princess. “…if a man does not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them.”  The Count was my age when sentenced to never again step foot out of the Hotel. For some reason I went into this book thinking he was edging into elderly territory when the sentence was handed down. I can’t even imagine being so confined so young. And yet, he managed to carve out a remarkably full life for himself, mostly in the relationships he developed within the walls of the Hotel. I found the Count’s relationship with nine year-old Nina sweet and joyful and just all around lovely. The deep bond he developed with the other two members of the Triumvirate is the best kind of friendship, the type that everyone aspires to find at least once in their lives. And then there’s his relationship with Sofia, which I will not even try to encapsulate with a description. It was moving and delightful and deep in the love and respect they had for one another. “But the truth is: No matter how much time passes, those we have loved never slip away from us entirely.”Let’s talk about the prose that so enchanted me. The writing elicited a similar response in me as evoked by The Shadow of the Wind when I first read it: pure delight at the charm. The prose is exceptionally witty and thoughtful in equal measures. I was immediately transported to the city in question, and fell for the protagonist before the end of the first chapter. While A Gentleman in Moscow doesn’t have the same tension or elements of magical realism and mystery as The Shadow of the Wind, I can think of no better comparison. Without even stepping foot out of the Metropol Hotel, we were shows decades of ever-evolving Russian life in Moscow through the eyes of the Count. I couldn’t believe upon finishing this novel that Towles wasn’t a Russian who had lived through the Revolution, or that the Count wasn’t at least a real individual who had given Towles his story to pass on. But no, Amor Towles was born and raised in Boston and now resides in Manhattan. The ways in which he so exquisitely captured a time and place he had never experienced for himself boggles the mind.“To what end, he wondered, had the Divine created the stars in heaven to fill a man with feelings of inspiration one day and insignificance the next?”One additional comment about the writing: every single chapter title began with the letter A. Does this have any bearing whatsoever on the story itself? No. Did I find it delightful? Absolutely. And one word of advice: this is book meant to be sipped and savored. Take your time when you decide to embark on your journey with the Count. This book comprises decades of his life, after all. I’m very glad that I didn’t rush through it, but instead gave it time to breathe, like a good bottle of the wine so loved by the Count.“…life does not proceed by leaps and bounds. It unfolds. At any given moment, it is the manifestation of a thousand transitions.”A Gentleman in Moscow is everything I was promised and more. This is a book that I have no doubt will still be charming readers generations from now. It will unequivocally stand the test of time. For a novel so strongly based in a specific time and place, there’s a timeless element to the story that, when combined with Towles’s stellar prose and charming characters, gives it incredible staying power.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jan 15, 2022","Feb 03, 2022","Jan 15, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34066798-a-gentleman-in-moscow

While I loved A Court of Mist and Fury fiercely, I felt that A Court of Wings and Ruin didn’t quite measure up in comparison, and that A Court of Frost and Starlight was weak and forgettable compared to the rest of the series. I had just about decided that I would end my experience with the series there, but my brother changed my mind. He just binge-read all of ACOTAR and told me that ACOMAF had been his favorite until he read this one, which he thought was by far the strongest of the series. I didn’t really see how it could measure up to ACOMAF, but we rarely disagree when we read the same books. And he was so right. A Court of Silver Flames is just badass in every way. While not quite as romantic as A Court of Mist and Fury, A Court of Silver Flames surpasses it in girl-power, intensity, and spice level. I read furiously and enjoyed every minute.I don’t know that I’ve come across any other character in fiction filled with the levels of self-loathing and self-destruction found in Nesta. And honestly, I hated her more than a little myself at the start of the book. I’ve found Nesta primarily loathsome with a few moments of promise over the course of the series, so I have to confess that I wasn’t that excited to read a full novel about her. But Maas once again proved herself to be exceptional at character development. Over the 757 pages of this book, Nesta hit new lows before reaching some incredible highs. As much as I’ve come to love Feyre over the past installments, I think my love for Nesta surpasses that. She dealt was some serious trauma and guilt, with both the unwanted help of Feyre and her family, and with the more readily accepted help of the friends she makes along the way. I was incredibly impressed with the ways in which she so radically transformed, and I was even more impressed with Maas for making that transformation realistic and believable. If you love training montages, this is definitely the book for you. The vast majority of the book is spent watching Nesta and, later, her friends, training to become battle-ready. Not necessarily because battle looms, but as a way to work through some of the aforementioned issues. ACOSF deals a lot with various traumas, particularly focusing on the multiple forms of violence against women. Watching Nesta and her girls fight to overcome their trauma, to grow from the things they had suffered instead of letting it keep them broken, was incredibly empowering. I don’t know that I’ve ever read another book that screamed “girl-power” quite as strongly and organically as this one. I grew to really love the entire cast. The girls weren’t the only strong characters in ACOSF. I loved Cassian as soon as I met him in ACOMAF. And he just got better in this book. I love a male character who believes in helping women claim their own agency instead of trying to strong-arm them into behaving a certain way. Cassian is all about helping these women succeed, and I love him even more for it. Azriel, as well. Maas created some truly fantastic characters in this series, both male and female, and I’m deeply invested in their collective world and their individual stories. After finishing this book, I truly can’t wait for whatever else Maas decides to publish set in Prythia.One quick observation. Definitely not a complaint, just an observation. ACOSF is way more explicit than the previous installments in the series. Not only are sex scenes more frequent, they’re more…descriptive. Again, I’m not complaining at all. I just felt like I should give other readers a quick heads up. It’s almost like Maas kept hearing the series referred to as “fairy porn” and decided to just give the people what they seemed to expect. Also, this was the first book in the series told entirely in third person, which I think made me enjoy the writing even more.The plot here was surprisingly interesting for a story that mostly revolved around freeing oneself from the pain of the past and learning to accept oneself. It never felt slow or plodding to me. I was equally invested in every facet of the story. But the more magic and lore-heavy scenes, which would seem to be the main draw, didn’t shine quite as brightly as the training montages and the internal battles these women, especially Nesta, faced day in and day out as they sought to rise above their pasts. These moments, which dominated the book, were just powerful every single time.A Court of Silver Flames was empowering, thought-provoking, and potentially even healing for someone who has yet to deal with some past trauma in their own life. And, beyond all that, it was just a gripping, really strong story that kept me enthralled from start to finish. I loved Nesta’s story, and I can’t wait to see what comes next.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jan 10, 2022","Jan 14, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138095-a-court-of-silver-flames

That is the first word that comes to mind as I consider The Song of Achilles.  Miller is a truly gifted author. The ways in which she was able to breathe new life and depth into characters who have been part of our collective consciousness for millennia is awe-inspiring. The story of Achilles and the Trojan War is one I have consumed in a plethora of formats and reiterations, but the way Miller tells the tale is without comparison. “I am made of memories.”I’ve owned this book on Kindle since 2013, on Audible and in paperback since 2019. And yet I still continued to put off reading it. Why? Because I knew the ending already, and I didn’t want to experience the devastation. Even after reading and deeply loving Circe, I shied away from The Song of Achilles I might have avoided it even more purposefully, because I knew that the gorgeous prose of Circe paired with the grief lacing Achilles’ story would be even more heartbreaking than I originally thought. And I was correct. But this is a story that is absolutely worth the pain I brings with it. “He is half of my soul, as the poets say.”What sets The Song of Achilles apart from other retellings of the Trojan War is the perspective through which Miller reveals the story. Our narrator is Patroclus, best friend and lover of Achilles since their youth. I ended up falling in love with the version of him Miller presented. Patroclus in no way held a candle to Achilles in the eyes of the world. He was fully mortal, unskilled at the arts of war, and preferred to spend his time learning the arts of healing instead. Patroclus wasn’t gilded and breathtakingly beautiful and godlike in his athleticism like his love. But the heart beating at his core was far lovelier than that of anyone around him. The depth Miller brought to this character was truly exceptional, and while I still don’t love Achilles, I came to understand him and appreciate him more through the eyes of Patroclus than I ever have before. “When he died, all things soft and beautiful and bright would be buried with him.”The love story here is one of the most devastating I’ve ever read. The tragic flavor of it brought to mind classic tales like Wuthering Heights, but with a protagonist I cared about far more. Because, in my eyes, at least, Patroclus is the protagonist of this story, not Achilles. Yes, Patroclus revolved his entire life around this man that he loved. And thus, the story revolves around Achilles. But Patroclus shines in a different, more poignant way that his demigod lover. Achilles is bright and beautiful, destined to burn brightly but burn out far too soon. This knowledge, this expectation of losing Achilles so young, is what defines every moment for Patroclus. But there is something about the way Patroclus sees the world, seeking to heal wounds and ease pain and help as many captive women as he can through Achilles’ fame, that both fills and breaks my heart. The only reason I felt anything for Achilles is because I felt so much for Patroclus.“And perhaps it is the greater grief, after all, to be left on earth when another is gone.”Have I mentioned the writing? Miller is one of the finest wordsmiths of our age, and I truly believe that both The Song of Achilles and Circe will be remembered and revered as classics throughout the annals of time. The stories themselves have already proven their longevity, but they’ve been transformed into something new and deep and powerful through Miller’s craftsmanship. Her prose is remarkable; even the smallest of sentences and turns of phrase can be packed with layers of meaning. And yet, Miller never seems to revel in the beauty of her own words, as some authors are wont to do. She comes across as comfortable and confident in her craft without ever seeming prideful of it. The humility in that balance, especially in a novel as exquisitely penned as this one, is as remarkable as the talent itself.“In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.”The Song of Achilles is a powerful, achingly beautiful retelling of one of our oldest stories. Miller’s take on this classic myth is lyrical, truly a song. I truly believe that The Song of Achilles and Circe will stand the test of time just as well as their Homeric inspirations.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Jan 10, 2022","Jan 15, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13516154-the-song-of-achilles

Learning more about Manx’s backstory made him a far more interesting and multi-faceted character. The story here was really good, and the art style, while not my personal favorite, paired very well with the narrative. There were another couple of characters who were given a little bit of depth, but for the most part this is Manx’s story. While enjoyable, I can tell this isn’t a story that’s going to stick with me.

I have Callahan’s 2018 novel, Actual rating: 3.5 starsAs soon as I saw the title Once Upon a Wardrobe, I knew I needed to read this book immediately. I have Callahan’s 2018 novel, Becoming Mrs. Lewis, sitting on my bookshelf. I bought it immediately because I love all things C.S. Lewis, but for some reason I’ve never gotten around to picking it up. But Once Upon a Wardrobe sounded like it would have a bit more Narnia between the pages than its predecessor might, so I started reading it a week after I found out it existed. There’s a charm, a nostalgic quaintness to the story and the setting that is immediately inviting. This is the very definition of a cozy novel. Though it is also a sad one. There’s a poignancy here, where sorrow and hope and joy intermingle. But something about Callahan’s prose falls flat for me. It feels both youthful, almost to the point of juvenile, and outdated, as though she is trying to capture the magic found in the written voice of her inspiration, Lewis, without access to a key ingredient. The result is unfortunately stiff, in my opinion, to the point that I couldn’t fully connect with the truly lovely story being told. I think this is in part due to Callahan’s propensity for telling instead of showing what is going on through the eyes of her characters. It felt too directed, too forced. There were moments of beauty and brilliance, but that made the failings of the writing in other areas even more jarring.However, the story made up for the writing. I knew the core story, the tale of Lewis’s life told through vignettes. I’ve read about his life in his own words, though that was long enough ago that I very much enjoyed becoming reacquainted. But the framework story, the tale of Megs and George, was heartachingly lovely. George is a young boy with a failing heart. He fully expects this Christmas of 1950 to be his last. George is utterly enchanted by a new book recently published for children: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Megs, George’s older sister who loves him dearly and would do anything for him, actually attends Oxford, where the author of the aforementioned novel teaches. George begs Megs to find Mr. Lewis and ask him one single, buring question. “Where did Narnia come from?” The answer isn’t what Megs expects. Lewis tells her the story of his life, stories that Megs writes down afterward the best she can so she can share them with her brother. This leads the siblings on some marvelous adventures together, through the stories Megs has been told. But where in all of these stories is the answer to George’s question? I did not initially like Megs, though I loved George from the start. I think this is in large part due to my issues with Callahan’s writing. At first, Megs was giving off hard “I’m not like other girls” vibes, which is a trope that always drives me to the brink of madness. But as Megs took this journey for the sake of her brother, as she learned more about herself and about life outside of the tangible and rational, she grew on me. She dealt with impending grief in believable, sympathetic ways. The love she had for her little brother was palpable, and Callahan did a wonderful job on their sibling dynamic. While I had my issues with Once Upon a Wardrobe, my opinions by the end were mostly positive. Callahan told a powerful, moving story in a sweet, gentle way. While there is sadness here, this book would be perfect for sensitive readers who still want to think about some harder topics. The overall tone of the novel was uplifting. I might not have loved her writing style, but Callahan told a brilliant story here. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jan 04, 2022","Jan 06, 2022","Jan 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57099601-once-upon-a-wardrobe

The only other modern book in the genre I’ve enjoyed this much was We Begin at the End, but this book had more in common with The Maidens and The Divines, both of which disappointed me last year. It was a perfectly paced, pitch perfect blend of mystery and academia that captivated me from the prologue through to the epilogue. I hung on every word. This is a story that felt so incredibly real, which such a delicious building tension, that I thought about it almost constantly when I wasn’t reading it. It found its way into my dreams, which has become a rare thing as I’ve gotten older. And the ending was something that, in hindsight, I might should have been able to see. Especially considering the opening. But I didn’t.“But nothing stays buried forever, I thought. The past is a gift that keeps giving, pulling names from a big black hat.” “Sometimes, burial is best. Why would you want to dig up the past? Especially when the mystery is so much better than the truth.” This is a book that I stumbled across on NetGalley and requested mere days before its U.S. release. I regret that I couldn’t read it before publication, but I’m so grateful that my request was approved anyway. I had no idea this was the third book in a series until I had already read 10% of it, but it wasn’t to the story’s detriment. It was very enjoyable on its own. I didn’t feel as though I was missing anything vital. However, I will be going back and reading more of not only this series but the rest of Harris’s backlog. Three of her books are sitting on my physical shelves: Chocolat, The Gospel of Loki, and The Testament of Loki. The fact that I’ve never read any of her work both saddens and delights me. I feel like I’ve missed so much, and yet I’ve suddenly discovered a new-to-me author with over 20 novels in their backlist. It’s like finding a doubloon that leads to an entire treasure chest.“Hope is the thing that kills you… Hope is what breaks when you hit the ground.” The audio was absolutely brilliant, and is probably one of the best audiobooks I’ve experienced. Two narrators are featured: Alex Kingston of Doctor Who fame; and Steven Pacey, who narrates Abercrombie’s First Law series and is one of my favorite audiobook narrators. While Kingston delivered the majority of the story as Headmaster Rebecca Buckfast, and she did so with fantastic aplomb, Pacey’s additions as Roy Straitley were a lovely break in the narrative, giving you a chance to take a breath in the midst of Rebecca’s very compelling and tense story. Had I not recognized the narrators on NetGalley, I would never have requested this book and wouldn’t have stumbled upon a new author whose backlist I’m so incredibly excited to read. “I have never believed in the mantra ‘what does not kill me makes me stronger’, but I do believe that what does not kill me gives me the chance to fight back.” Rebecca is the new Headmaster of what was formerly an all-boys’ private school that is opening up to girls for the first time in its history. Seeing this school and others like it through her eyes was an enlightening experience. There’s a lot of discourse here about women in academia, especially in private schools. Even when Rebecca is able to break into the “old boys’ club” atmosphere, she isn’t treated like the rest of her colleagues. One of the schools in this book doesn’t even have a lady’s restroom; the women are instead forced to use the handicap facilities, which goes a long way to showing how their male counterparts view them. Being female isn’t a disability. But so many men in so many professions seem to believe so. Harris managed to both romanticize academia, as readers tend to do, and shine a light on its underbelly.“The mistake you made was one of scale. Men always do, used as they are to taking the main entrance. Women must be more discreet. All we need is a narrow door. And when we have crept in unseen, like a spider through a keyhole, we spin ourselves an empire of silk, and fill you with astonishment.” I absolutely love an unreliable narrator when done right. There are so many thrillers that rely heavily on this trope while not doing it particularly well. But Harris used the trope so deftly, and I truly felt as though I was making Rebecca’s discoveries alongside her. And the difference in tone between the Rebecca of her memories and the one telling her story to Straitley was fascinating. There were times when I couldn’t tell if there was a supernatural element to the book, or if that was simply mind games being played on or by the narrators. That balance was kept on a razor-sharp edge that delighted me to no end. I was honestly more than a little in awe so how well Harris balanced every aspect of this story. “Children see the world differently. They filter their realities through fairy tales and metaphors.” The setup of A Narrow Door was fantastic. I was equally invested in the framework story and the coldcase mystery housed within it. It’s also one of the best academia novels I’ve read, though it’s told from the perspective of teachers instead of students. I would comfortably shelve this alongside The Secret History and The Orchard. While not quite as philosophical, and a bit more plot-driven, the writing was absolutely superb and the school atmosphere permeated the story very well. The divisions of this book alone, based around the five rivers in the Greek Underworld, enchanted me. As did the frequent use of Latin during Roy Straitley’s perspective chapters. This was an incredibly intelligent book in so many ways, but it never felt as though Harris was prideful of that fact or using it as purposeful misdirection. This is the kind of smart book that makes you feel smarter while reading it, instead of feeling like it’s talking down to you.“Memory is like a young child: it is immensely suggestible. It is coloured by feelings; dreams; other people’s convictions. And, like its friend, the subconscious, it loves to deal in metaphor, so that Memory often leaves home dressed in a sensible outfit, and returns in a tutu and fairy wings, with its face painted like a tiger.” There’s so much I want to say about A Narrow Door that I can’t even get my thoughts in order. I know it’s only the first week of January, but I can confidently say that this novel will appear on my list of favorites for the year. It’s a wonderful blending of a smart plot, impeccable writing, sympathetic characters, and a mystery that will keep you guessing. If you’re a fan of crime fiction, or dark academia, or novels with a strong voice that never grates on your nerves, you should give this one a go. Especially on audio. And if you love all of the aforementioned building blocks in a novel, I’m begging you to track down a copy of this book.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jan 04, 2022","Jan 07, 2022","Jan 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57953043-a-narrow-door

I read another of Novik’s high fantasy novels, Uprooted, in 2016 and…I was not a fan. While I didn’t loathe it with every fiber of my being like Petrik did, it took me a couple of months to trudge through 435 pages. That’s not my general reading experience. There were a lot of things I really didn’t like about that book and, because of that dislike, I was skittish about picking up Spinning Silver . But, as I own both a physical and digital copy, I knew I was going to have to pick it up eventually. So when Petrik suggested we do a buddy-read as soon as the new year started, I jumped at it. He, Eon, TS, Haifa and myself all started it together, and the consensus has been overwhelmingly positive. Spinning Silver is a thoughtful, intricate, powerful novel that is one of the most atmospheric books I’ve ever read. I’m incredibly glad that we gave Novik another try.The story follows three young women, Miryem, Wanda, and Irina, who are all incredibly compelling characters. Miryem is the daughter of a Jewish moneylender who is a doormat of a man, leading to his family slowly starving to death until Miryem steps into the role. Wanda is the oldest child of an abusive drunk who is in debt to Miryem’s father, and Wanda finds herself working off that debt in Miryem’s home. Irina is the daughter of a duke whose political machinations matter more than his daughter’s wellbeing, but Irina isn’t beautiful enough to be useful without the aid of outside forces. All three women are well fleshed out, and their motivations are believable. And they’re all incredibly smart or canny in their own ways. I loved that they thought their way through whatever situations they faced. They didn’t wait for someone to save them. They saved themselves. I loved that Miryem’s Jewish heritage. The little bits of her religious background and culture sprinkled into the novel added a depth to her character that drew me to her. And also seeing that culture through the eyes of Wanda, who isn’t Jewish, only served to further deepen that aspect of Miryam’s story. And then there’s Irina and her life as a royal, through whom we experienced the politics of the land. Between these three young women runs the gamut of political, religious, and socio-economical stratas, which provided a wonderfully broad look at the world of Lithvas that Novik created.While our three main perspective characters were the driving force of the novel, there was a wonderful supporting cast. We have Miryem’s parents and grandfather, Wanda’s brothers, and Irina’s maid who all give us more insight into whichever of our main characters have their love. My favorite of these secondary characters was hands down Wanda’s youngest brother, Stepon. The ways in which he viewed the world made my heart ache. He’s another of those literary children who, if I could reach into the pages and pluck out, I would adopt in a heartbeat. It was impossible for me to choose a favorite between Miryem, Wanda, and Irina, but Stepon was an easy choice. Then there are the tsar of Lithvas and the Staryk king. Both ended up being far more multi-faceted by the end of the story than I would have expected when they were introduced. I won’t discuss them because I don’t want to spoil the plot in any way, but both were very interesting characters.The setting of this book felt very Russian. Novik blended real-world settings with her own fantastical creation so beautifully. The firm foundation of what we know made the structure of the new and unknown feel infinitely more tangible. This combination made for an intensely atmospheric world.  I could feel the bite of the cold in a way that few books have managed for me in the past. Lithvas indeed felt very Russian, but the realm of the Staryk was truly magical, and the dichotomy between the two kingdoms worked very well. I wasn’t sure how all of the strands of the plot were going to come together. But Novik tied everything up so tidily that, in hindsight, I can’t believe I didn’t see the resolution coming. The story was intricate and layered but managed to deliver on the fairytale source material with a fairytale ending. But this ending was satisfying without seeming overly saccharine or illogical, as sometimes happens with fairytales. I love a good retelling, and this is one of the most original I’ve read. Rumplestiltskin is one of the more unusual choices for a retelling, but Novik breathed so much new life into this tale. Spinning Silver is a story I’ll be thinking about for a long time. I’m so glad Petrik decided we should give Novik another chance. I’d be lying by omission if I didn’t confess that my love for this book makes me reconsider my hatred of Uprooted. Perhaps I will reread it one day, to see if my opinions of it have changed. But I can say with certainty that my opinion of this book will stay the same. I found Spinning Silver incredibly atmospheric and well-paced, thought-provoking and empowering and populated by fascinating characters and magic. I have not one single criticism to offer.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,Jan 2022,"Jan 03, 2022","Jan 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37168303-spinning-silver

There were a couple of drawbacks to this book, but those are very much personal preferences. Firstly, there was far more opera included than I would have expected. When I hear “classical music” I instantly think of instrumentals, which I know is closed-minded. I simply have never developed a taste for opera, and thus there was a wide swath of this collection that I suffered through instead of enjoyed. Secondly, I wish there had been a bit more to the write-ups for each day. I know they’re meant to be brief, and that the author had a lot to do as there were 366 of them, but I was just left wanting more information to go along with quite a few of these pieces.

I was reading A Christmas Carol, which has been my Christmas tradition for about a decade now, and Picking up Krampus started out as a bit of a joke. I was reading A Christmas Carol, which has been my Christmas tradition for about a decade now, and decided to balance it out with something completely different. I went into Krampus fully expecting a horror novel that ripped Christmas apart. What I got was wildly different and infinitely more powerful. This book was profound and though-provoking and so much more emotional than I anticipated. Strangely enough, Krampus ended up being one of my favorite books of the year, providing a depth and nuance to famous and infamous figures that surprised me, as well as giving me a cast of new characters to root for. I have never been more pleasantly surprised by a book with such a disturbing cover. Which was also done by Brom. The man is an incredible artist.This take on Krampus was absolutely fascinating. I had to do some research of my own as I didn’t know much about the origins of Krampus and was immediately taken in by Brom’s Norse take on the myth of Krampus. There’s a good deal of debate over whether Krampus is a lesser member of the Norse pantheon and potentially the grandson of Loki, as Brom supposes in this novel, or if he’s tied more to Germanic paganism. Whatever Krampus’s true origins may be, I found Brom’s Norse mythological take on his story absolutely fascinating. I won’t discuss the other Norse tie-in as it’s a spoiler, but it was a delightful surprise that I never would have considered.I also loved seeing the funhouse mirror dichotomy of Krampus and Santa Claus. In this book, Santa Claus and Krampus are both far more morally ambiguous than their more commonly known myths portray. Santa is not wholly good, or even mostly good depending on whose perspective you’re viewing him from, and Krampus is far from evil. Krampus was also a very likable character who could be surprisingly kind. I didn’t expect to like him, but he won me over almost immediately. I actually think he might’ve been my favorite character in the entire book. Krampus is terrible in the original sense of the word, yes, but he can also be kind.  Crazed, yes, but understandably so after the last half a millennia he’s spent in captivity. But I found him a surprisingly nuanced character. As was Santa Claus, actually. You haven’t lived until you’ve read about Santa armed with a broadsword, facing off against Krampus. It’s even odder when you’re rooting for Krampus. And yet, here we are.As for characters outside of Krampus and Santa, I initially found Jesse weak and pitiable, if not exactly likable. But he grew tremendously over the course of the story in ways that felt both hopeful and realistic. I liked Isabelle immediately, and found the rest of the supporting cast colorful and varied enough to remain interesting for the entirety of the novel. The choice in setting was wonderful and made a strange kind of sense. Instead of the North Pole, the majority of the story actually takes place in Appalachian West Virginia. I love seeing classic characters in unusual settings. But there’s also something kind of mysterious and a little bit mystical about Appalachia, so I thought it was a wonderful choice. In his afterword Brom goes into more detail as to why he chose this particular locale, and I found it a fascinating and insightful decision. Krampus is a novel that kept me on my toes, as I never had any idea where the narrative was going. I was absorbed and invested from start to finish, and can see myself rereading this every few Decembers. I feel like I learned a lot, while also being entertained and made to think in equal measures. This is the first book I’ve ever read by Brom, but it won’t be the last. His ideas are incredibly interesting, his characters are sympathetic, and his writing style immediately draws you in. If you want to add a little edge to your Yuletide or Christmas celebrations that also has a lot of heart, you should definitely pick up a copy of Krampus.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 21, 2021","Dec 25, 2021","Dec 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13505670-krampus

Worlds where the air bleeds words and lightning can rewrite the past.”Reading McGuire’s newest Wayward Children novella has become something of a Christmas tradition for me over the past few years. While my reading experience has varied book to book, it’s always cozy and enjoyable and transportive. I request very few ARCs, but this series is top among them and I’m always elated to receive the next installment. I was cautiously excited about Where the Drowned Girls Go, as it’s a pretty direct followup to my least favorite novella in the series, Beneath the Sugar Sky. However, this newest novella was absolutely fantastic; so much so, in fact, that it made me want to go back and reread Beneath the Sugar Sky to see if my opinion of it had changed. Where the Drowned Girls Go was a thoughtful, different addition to the series, and builds on and links every single one of its predecessors.“I never wanted to be a hero, but that doesn’t mean I’ll let you turn me into a villain.”Cora Miller, a girl who found her true identity as a mermaid of the Trenches, as been claimed by the Drowned Gods of the Moors, a different world than the one to which she yearns to return. Back at Eleanor West’s Home for Wayward Children, Cora is so scared of the Drowned Gods that she is determined to escape and forget any and all doors to other realms, even the one that her heart calls home. And she’ll do it at any cost. This determination leads her to switch her enrollment to West’s sister school, the Whitethorn Institute, despite Eleanor’s desperate pleading for her to reconsider. Because Whitethorn isn’t welcoming, friendly, or safe. It’s a prison, and Cora has just voluntarily incarcerated herself. Will the Drowned Gods find her anyway? Will Cora let herself fade, as Whitethorn demands of her? Or will she finally find the courage to face her fears and search for home?“I am not yours to cling to or to claim.”“I am not your door… But I might be my own.”Besides Cora, we have a fairly extensive cast of returning character at West’s, as well as new characters we meet at Whitethorn. I found most all of these new characters interesting, and the returning characters who received much time on the page had all developed in lovely ways. This is especially true of Cora herself. I didn’t love her in her first story, Beneath the Sugar Sky, for a host of reasons. But I found many of those reasons not only addressed but rectified in this new chapter of her story. She grew tremendously as a character, and I’ve come to love her as much as I do Jack and Kade and Christopher. I’m now incredibly interested in getting more of her story.“You can’t say ‘my hands are clean, that means I’m a good guy’ when you let people stand behind you with knives, ready to slash at everyone you say you want to save.”I mentioned that this book builds on all of the preceding novellas. Some of the others could be read independently of the rest of the series, but that is definitely not the case here. The plots and settings and characters of the six books before this one are essential to understanding and appreciating Where the Drowned Girls Go. I feel like this installment bound the others into one entity, a solid foundation upon which McGuire could take the series in any direction for any duration. It made me incredibly excited to see what comes next.“Sticks and stones, as the sages say; sticks and stones. I know what I am and I’m happy this way, and saying something true shouldn’t be an insult, ever, because that’s not how words want to work.”Something I have loved about every single Wayward Children novella is the philosophical depth McGuire so beautifully imbues into the prose of each story. The writing is exquisite; I always find myself recording pages of quotes that moved me both with what they communicate and the lovely ways in which the do so. Even though all of these books are under 200 pages long, they always make me think and feel deeply. McGuire truly has a gift, and it’s always beautifully wielded on the page. I’m in awe. If each of these novellas has a philosophical theme, this one is courage and self-acceptance and being willing to stand up for both yourself and others, even when those in authority truly believe the ways in which they hurt you are “for your own good.” The dichotomy between the two school hammered these points home, and gave me an even deeper appreciation for the haven Eleanor West offers. “You’re a monster in a hall of heroes, and we’re going to defeat you. That’s what heroes do. We beat monsters, no matter how much it costs us.”Seanan McGuire’s Wayward Children series is this wonderful, rare balancing act between comforting and thought-provoking. Each installment is unique and offers something different in both story and topics to contemplate. But the central thread, the desire to find a place of our own and the need to Be Sure before we take the risky step out of our comfort zone and into a reality that fits us better, binds all of these stories into something even stronger together than they are individually. Where the Drowned Girls Go acts to solidify that tie while also telling a very compelling story in its own right. There’s something truly magical about McGuire’s writing and world building, and I’m already eagerly awaiting the eighth installment in the series.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 15, 2021","Dec 20, 2021","Dec 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693537-where-the-drowned-girls-go

I’m going to be transparent and tell you that I didn’t think I’d be super interested in The Love Hypothesis when I first heard of it. I’m not a science person. Like, at all. But I am a Star Wars person, and I thought something about the cover looked familiar. When I heard that this book was originally Reylo (Kylo Ren and Rey) fan fiction, I could see it immediately in the cover art. I’ve always been a sucker for fan fiction in multiple fandoms, so my curiosity was understandably piqued. And I am so, so incredibly glad that I chose it as my Book of the Month pick, because it was absolutely delightful. The Love Hypothesis is another one of those debut novels that completely blew me away. Hazelwood is an immensely talented author. Her background as a neuroscientist laid a phenomenal foundation for this story. You could really tell that she had experience in the setting she chose, which lent an authenticity to the story that I think is actually rare in the world of genre fiction. Speaking of, this is hands down one of the best rom-coms I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. Hazelwood integrated a ton of popular romance tropes into this book, fake dating and forced proximity among them. But instead of feeling tired or trite, these tropes had new life breathed into them. They were fun and funny and enchanting, and I kept getting excited whenever a new trope would pop up. However, those tropes would have been nothing without the wonderfully engaging couple at the heart of The Love Hypothesis. Olive Smith is a Ph.D. candidate who, in the first chapter of our story, locks lips with the first man she stumbles across out of desperation to convince her friend that she’s on a date. The lips in question happen to belong to Dr. Adam Carlsen, a giant of a man as infamous for being a hard-ass as he is famous for his genius. The two strike a bargain; they will pass themselves off as a couple for a few weeks, as they would both benefit from people believing they’re in a committed relationship. Of course, everything that can go wrong does, but that’s what makes it a fun story. Adam and Olive’s chemistry was insane. And their banter and inside jokes were absolutely adorable. I loved them so much. This was a bit of a slow burn, but that made the payoff that much stronger. I’ve seen The Love Hypothesis proclaimed as spicy, which it is, but it’s in no way smutty. There’s really only one (admittedly extensive) sex scene in this book. But that scene was absolute fire. Again, it’s a slow burn of a romance, but the one aforementioned sex scene is about as open-door as it gets. I can read just about anything with a perfectly blank expression, but because of all of the buildup and banter, I actually blushed just a little reading this. And grinned the entire time. And reread an entire chapter because it was just that good. I loved everything about The Love Hypothesis. I physically hugged this book when I finished it, I loved it so much. It was bright and sweet and funny and felt like a warm hug from a new friend. This might be the first book Hazelwood was written and the first I’ve read, but she’s immediately an auto-buy author for me, and I can’t wait to see what she puts out next. The only other author I’ve read who scratched this same itch for me is Emily Henry. If there were more rom-coms like The Love Hypothesis, it would undoubtedly be my favorite genre.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 10, 2021","Dec 13, 2021","Dec 10, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56732449-the-love-hypothesis

I enjoyed A Court of Thorns and Roses much more than I expected. But I absolutely adored A Court of Mist and Fury. My expectations were a good bit higher going into this second book, but those expectations were obliterated. I can’t believe I waited so long to read this series. I might be the most reluctant of Maas converts, but I have been won over entirely. This book is one of the most addictive, well-paced, romantic things I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. It’s one of my favorite things I’ve read all year. Not only am I excited to see what happens next, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I have found a new series to add to my comfort-rereads shelf. Be aware that I don’t know how to  this book without giving some details that spoil events in ACOTAR. So, there will be spoilers aplenty below. You’ve been warned.“To the people who look at the stars and wish…”“To the stars who listen— and the dreams that are answered.”The world building, the plot, and the characters in this second installment are all leaps and bounds superior to their predecessor. I feel like A Court of Thorns and Roses walked so A Court of Mist and Fury could run. Yes, ACOTAR was a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, but it was also a perfect introduction to ACOMAF as an even more compelling Hades and Persephone retelling. Feyre is taken from the Spring Court to the Night Court one week out of the month because of a deal she made with Rhysand while Under the Mountain. And yet, even while having to comply with this bargain she made under duress, Feyre has far more freedom with him than she could ever hope to have with Tamlin. I love the foresight Maas demonstrated by making Tamlin High Lord of the Spring Court, and how well that sets up the Persephone link for Feyre. It’s a detail I found delightful, and I believe shows that Maas had this twist in the story in mind before she even started writing ACOTAR. “Don’t let the hard days win.” I was team Rhysand from the instant Feyre met him, even before we knew his name. That allegiance just grew and grew over the course of the last dozen chapters of ACOTAR. And my opinion of him skyrocketed, while my opinion of Tamlin plummeted, with every chapter of ACOMAF I read. I have come to love Rhysand with my entire heart, and this is the most romantically infatuated I’ve been with a character since first meeting Roarke in J.D. Robb’s In Death series as a teenager. Rhys’s personality is as unspeakably hot as his physical appearance.I also dearly love Rhysand’s entire Court of Dreams. Azriel, Cassian, Mor, and Amren are all fascinating, likable, and exhibit the kind of depth missing from any of the characters in ACOTAR. Except for Lucien, that is. I love their relationships with one another, the friendships that bond all of Rhys’s court, and the way they accept Feyre into their midst so willingly. These are some of the best friendships I’ve read in fantasy fiction, or fiction in general. Azriel and Cassian are both especially intriguing, and I hope to learn more about them in future installments. They’re so radically different from one another, but are equally compelling. Feyre has grown tremendously as a character. I found her whiny and unlikeable in ACOTAR, and weak at the beginning of ACOMAF. But by the end of this book, she had totally won me over. She grew and developed dramatically, which actually made me care far more deeply for her than I would have an immediately likable protagonist. She ended up being a very strong character who I’m incredibly invested in at the point. Honestly, she could have become a bit of a Mary Sue after the events at the end of ACOTAR had her development not been carefully handled. Instead, she’s a badass who really worked for every bit of power she has. I can’t believe how much I’ve come to respect her. “I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless againI would not, could not be broken. Tamed.”And the romance. Y’all, this is one of the most romantic books I’ve ever read, even though there was a ton of plot going on outside of that romance. There’s a particular chapter (54) that actually had me rubbing my chest because it made my heart physically ache. I’m a romantic at heart, and this fed my soul. It was a slow burn, but to quote Fahrenheit 451, it was a pleasure to burn. This couple is now among my favorite couples in fiction. And I already had quite the extensive list, but I’d say this couple is up there with Eve and Roarke from the aforementioned In Death series, who are my O.G. favorite couple and have been over the course of the 50+ book series. “I am broken and healing, but every piece of my heart belong to you.”The world building and lore of Prythian are so compelling. In particular, the city of Velaris is simply magical in every way. I love the idea of a secret city dedicated to art and living life to the fullest, nestled deep in the mountains and kept hidden from the rest of the world at all cost. It’s one of those fantasy settings that, if I could live in any fictional place, would be very, very high on my list. I would love to wander those streets. And the night of Starfall was absolutely gorgeous. The House of Wind sounds beautiful, and the town house sounds charming and homey. I just loved everything about the Court of Dreams setting. But even outside of my favorite pocket of Prythian, Maas has developed a world that is utterly fascinating, and I hope she continues to explore it over the course of many future installments.Without giving the ending away, I just have to comment on how deftly Maas handled the twisty climax. While this was a cliffhanger in a sense, and I could happily have picked up the next book immediately, I wasn’t frustrated by the ending. She gave us enough resolution that, if I would have had to wait a year between books, I wouldn’t have been irate about how she left things, but I would have wanted to get my hands on that third book the day ACOWAR was published. It would have been excitement, not frustration over the cliffhanger, that had me reaching for the next installment. And I think that’s a pretty wonderful, but difficult, balance for an author to strike.I’m still in shock over how very much I’m loving this series, and this book in particular. This just goes to show that you shouldn’t judge a book by its fanbase. I’ve (hopefully) learned my lesson in that regard. If you’ve made it all the way through this rambling , thanks for sticking with me. If you did so and haven’t yet read the books, I hope I didn’t ruin them for you, but instead gave you just enough information to find yourself intrigued into picking them up for yourself.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 03, 2021","Dec 10, 2021","Dec 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26073150-a-court-of-mist-and-fury

I’ve owned a copy of A Court of Thorns and Roses for six years, and honestly had no intention of reading it after I became active on Goodreads and was made aware of how toxic the Maas fanbase could be. Yes, I know the author isn’t responsible for the fandom, and that it wasn’t the book’s fault, but I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and decided to stay away. But then my sister-in-law read and loved the series. As did Emma, one of my co-bloggers, who I consider one of the most intelligent readers I know. As did my best friend who, in the end, finally wore me down. But even after being convinced to give the series a try by people I love and whose opinions I trust, I still went into this book incredibly skeptical, which you’ll be able to see from some of the  below, which was written piecemeal as I read the book. I scoffed my way through the first third, and was completely enraptured by the rest. Honestly, I’m a tiny bit pissed that it won me over. But when I tell you I started the next book as soon as I finished the last pages of this one, I’m not exaggerating. I didn’t even give myself a five minute breather between the two. Is it the best book I’ve ever read? No. But do I get the appeal, the dedicated fanbase, and the widespread acclaim? Absolutely, I do. Feyre, our main character, did not make a great first impression on me. Feyre’s family, her two sisters and her father, are the least sympathetic family I’ve read in forever. If I was Feyre, I would have left them to their own devices years prior to the start of this story. They don’t appreciate her even a little bit, which actually made me like her less. She put up with far too much for me to have much respect for her. Yes, I know that’s harsh. But alas, it’s true. That deathbed promise is a terribly flimsy excuse for putting up with that kind of treatment for that long.I found Feyre’s reactions to her situation completely unrealistic. I can get past the magic, the faeries, the masks, etc. What I can’t get behind is being removed from a horrible home situation, being given a new home full of luxuries, being assured your completely unappreciative family is being well provided for, and still wanting to run. I understand that it adds tension, but her reactions made absolutely no sense to me. She was basically rewarded for murder, but all she did was gripe and try to find a way out.There was one exchange that completely threw me out of the story. “You can’t read. How on earth did you learn to hunt and survive?” Paraphrased, but that’s the gist of a conversation between Feyre and Tamlin. What on earth do those two things have to do with one another? I mean, literacy is incredibly important, but we as humans “survived” for millennia before we developed written language. This whole exchange just baffled me.The above three paragraphs were written during that initial scoffing I mentioned in the first paragraph. Once I got past the characters, the setting and the story completely won me over. And then, slowly, the characters grew on me, as well. I was particularly fond of Lucien and another character who shall remain nameless for now, but who I found incredibly attractive in spite of, and sometimes because of, his actions. Feyre slowly grew on me, as well, though I confess I liked Tamlin less and less as the plot progressed, and I’m not really sure why. I feel like a good portion of those who loved this book also loved Uprooted, which was a miss for me even though I fully expected to love it. Both books had all of the building blocks of a story I should love, but I just ended up rolling my eyes through the majority of both. One thing I will give ACOTAR over Uprooted is that the former was propulsive, even when eliciting the aforementioned eye rolling. I read ACOTAR over the course of a couple of days, whereas Uprooted took me literal months to complete. And, while I did eye-roll my way through both books, I ended up really enjoying ACOTAR in spite of myself, which was never the case with Uprooted. There have got to be better Beauty and the Beast retellings out there. I can’t think of any off of the top of my head, but surely there are. While more Labyrinth than Beauty and the Beast, I highly recommend Wintersong by S. Jae-Jones if you love the setting and atmosphere of these books but were left wanting more. However, I’d be remiss if I didn’t give ACOTAR props for winning me over so thoroughly. When I first started writing this , before I had finished the book, I felt pretty sure that it would be getting a 2 or 2.5 star rating from me. But it was a solid 4 star read, and I’m actually super excited to continue the series. And I’m a little bit mad about it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,Dec 2021,"Dec 03, 2021","Dec 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16096824-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses

Here, we follow one man over the course of his life, first meeting him as a nine-year-old boy. A boy who immediately won my heart, by the way. And we follow him throughout the next more than twenty years of his life. Through his eyes, we see the hidden world of privately-owned art and experience the terrifying highs of thievery and all of the research and legwork that goes into the theft itself. We experience great love and great loss and the support of family both blood-bound and life-found. We feel what it is to be hunted, but we also experience the beauties and wonders of the world through the chase. We feel a thirst for knowledge and what it’s like to move past sating your own thirst and into feeding other hungry minds with what you’ve learned. And we experience redemption, revenge, second chances and ultimate justice. Nora gives us so much with this one character.Harry Booth is a brilliant, sympathetic, incredibly multifaceted character, and I thoroughly enjoyed following him on his journey though life. I fell for him and his thirsty mind immediately. He’s one of those kids that I wished desperately I could pluck from the pages of his story and give him an easier one, but he truly made the most of the hand he had been dealt. I really loved seeing the world through his eyes, as he never seemed to become jaded in spite of all he had faced. His love of new cultures and languages, of literature and theater, were beautiful and charming and made me want to go back to school, as well. And the boy (and the man he grew into) had such marvelously nimble fingers and quick feet to go with that razor-sharp mind. I can’t believe I was rooting so strongly for a thief, but here we are. He was amazing at it, and his strict rules and morals even in the midst of his thievery made him incredibly easy to sympathize with. I absolutely loved this story, but there were a couple of issues that kept me from giving it a solid 5 star rating instead of the 4.5 stars I settled on. First of all, the love interest didn’t feel nearly as multidimensional as the protagonist. Which is unusual in Nora’s writing. She was presented as being full of character and charm, but it was more of a case of being told it was so instead of being shown. Everyone in the story loved her, but she never quite won me over, though I definitely didn’t dislike her, by any means. My second issue was that the ending felt somehow too rushed and too tidy. Very rarely do I think a book would have benefited from an additional 50 pages or so, but I felt that the final caper and resolution just didn’t have quite enough room to breathe. But other than those two small issues, I thought the book was exquisite. Yet again we see Nora straying from the formula that served her so well for so long, and it’s delightful to see her stretch and grow. I loved not knowing exactly where the story was heading while still being assured that everything would turn out alright. People sleep on Nora. They discount her work because she publishes so often, or they discount her as a romance author or someone whose work they just wouldn’t be interested in. But she’s such a beautiful writer, y’all. Within the first couple of pages of Nightwork, she had me falling in love with this 9 year old boy and wishing I could reach through the pages to help him and his mom because his story was breaking my heart. Within the first two or three pages. No joke. She’s just so good as quickly but deeply developing these characters and giving them authentic voices that charm you immediately. And the writing itself is so much lovelier than most imagine. I’ve read literary authors who have nothing on her style and ease of prose. It speaks clearly, emotes deeply, and draws in readers instantly. She has a true gift with words, a gift that is often discounted by the public because of the types of stories (they believe) she tells and speed at which she produces them. If you’ve never read Nora, I beg you to give her a chance. And if you should choose to do so, Nightwork is a beautiful place to start....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 13, 2022","Jul 19, 2022","Nov 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58724963-nightwork

While the premise was intriguing, it didn’t immediately grab me. But I’m so glad I picked it up after reading her , because this was a new take on the academia novels I’ve so come to love. Fun, compelling, and thought-provoking, Never Saw Me Coming scratched an itch I didn’t even know I had.The points of view were fascinating, as was the premise. This is the story of three college students, all from radically different walks of life with very little held in common. But there is one thing they share, and it’s the thing that most defines each of their lives. Chloe, Charles, and Andre are all part of a special study at their university, one that pays the entirety of their tuition in exchange for active participation in a study with the psychology department. The study in question? Psychopathy. That’s right; two of these students are clinically diagnosed psychopaths, and the other is faking the diagnosis out of desperation. When murders start plaguing the campus, authorities immediately suspect those participating in the program, and the three perspective students reluctantly band together to find and stop the killer. Only in their own self interest, of course. Surprisingly, I came to care deeply about all three perspective characters. I was immediately fascinated by Chloe when, within the first few pages, she had revealed that her true purpose at this school was to murder a student who had wronged her in the past. The way in which these passages were worded brought to mind an unrequited crush, which I thought was an interesting, and hilarious, juxtaposition to the murder plotting. The open, unapologetic honesty with which Chloe viewed herself charmed me despite her total lack of moral compass. Character revelations about Charles and Andre come later in the plot, but suffice it to say that they won me over, as well.Never Saw Me Coming was an incredibly balanced, well-paced novel featuring one of my favorite settings. I’m a sucker for campus novels, and this was definitely a good one. I love that it gave me plenty of food for thought while still keeping me highly entertained.

I was completely surprised by how squishy it made my heart, and how invested I was in the story. It’s a story I am already very familiar with, but I loved this new take on such a classic tale. And now I think I’m going to have to seek out more Hades and Persephone retellings.I really appreciated how Robert portrayed these characters who have been around for millenia. Hades is surly and protective and good at the core despite the bad reputation he makes such intelligent use of. He’s my very favorite kind of romantic male leads, and I found his portrayal insanely attractive. And Persephone had a surprising amount of depth under her sunny persona. I truly loved both of them, and I just wanted them to be happy, and happy together. The relationship between Hades and Persephone is freaking adorable and really, really hot. Did I mention hot? Because this book is pretty darn spicy. I love me a good spicy romance, though I often don’t include them on Goodreads because I dislike the title or the cover or both. But I had to include Neon Gods. I wish more spicy romance books utilized this style of title and cover art, but that’s beside the point. If you should choose to read novel, know that it’s incredibly open door. The sex scenes are very descriptive. That’s not something that phases me, but it’s not one I would press into my grandmother’s hands, if you catch my drift. But while the sex scenes were well done, they weren’t the draw. The relationship between Hades and Persephone, the way both characters grew because of their involvement with each other was what made this story special. There was plenty of tension, and all of that tension paid off. Neon Gods was such a pleasant surprise. I can’t wait to read more in Robert’s Dark Olympus series, as well as digging into some of her backlog.

While I really enjoyed The Talisman, the first novel in this duology, I feel like I’ve hearFor some reason, I wasn’t expecting much from Black House. While I really enjoyed The Talisman, the first novel in this duology, I feel like I’ve heard a good bit of negative commentary about this particular book in the past. Can I actually pinpoint any of said comments? Nope. Not a one. Maybe I was thinking about a different book. Because Black House was everything I should have expected: scary, moving, and vital to the Dark Tower.“I must not be so bad if I have a friend like that.”I love the narrator’s voice in this book. To me, it’s reminiscent of Dickens with charming, gentle directions of “let us look here” and “this is our destination” and so on. This creates an interesting dichotomy with the darker, more horroresque elements of the novel. And this book is absolutely a horror novel. Like its predecessor, there might be elements of portal fantasy and mystery here, but Black House is unequivocally and firmly planted in the horror genre. So much so, in fact, that there were multiple parts of the story that had me feeling squeamish and contemplating putting the book aside. I’m incredibly glad that I stuck it out, because this story ended up being far more important in the scheme of things concerning the Dark Tower than I expected.“What you love, you must love all the harder because someday it will be gone.”Michael Collings called this book “a linchpin narrative bringing together—explicitly, undeniably, and utterly—the mythic worlds King and Straub have drawn, pulling them together and knotting them at the core…” While I haven’t read any of Straub’s work outside the predecessor to this book he wrote with King, The Talisman, I can absolutely see how vital this book is to King’s Dark Tower landscape. While all of the interrelated novels on the extended Dark Tower reading order list I’ve been using do indeed tie into the narrative in some way, The Talisman and Black House feel essential to the overarching story. While I think the duology would be a powerful story on its own, the connections it provides in King’s larger picture feel truly inspired.  If you’re thinking about embarking on a trip to the Dark Tower, absolutely do not skip these two books.“The King is in his Tower, eating bread and honey. The Breakers in the basement, making all the money.”Outside of its contributions to the Dark Tower landscape, I have some mixed feelings about Black House. On the one hand, I was utterly charmed by the narrative voice, as stated above. There were also a handful of characters who shone so brightly they almost burned, my favorites of these being Henry and Beezer. On the other hand, there were multiple descriptive passages that felt almost like murder porn, and it gave me the willies, to use a King-ism. It felt almost gleeful in its visceral depictions of carnage. And I initially thought I was going to hate this book because of the changes in Jack Sawyer’s character from The Talisman, but thankfully those alterations weren’t permanent. “Yes, it’s always the past. That’s where the hurt is, all you can’t get over.”Again, my main complaint with The Talisman comes back into play in Black House: while I loved some of these characters, anyone being portrayed as villainous had absolutely zero redeeming qualities. I can’t stand caricature villains, and there were multiple characters I feel fit that bill in this book. There is a struggle, a nuance at the core of all of the protagonistic characters I came to love in this story. They weren’t perfect, which just made me care about them even more. But the villains? They’re cardboard. Malicious, sadistic, evil-to-the-core cardboard. While I’m not saying that I wanted to root for the villains in any way, I wish there would have been just a tiny bit of nuance there.“Ka is a friend to evil as well as good. It embraces both.” This was also another monster of a book that I believe could have been edited down one or two hundred pages and become a tighter, even more engrossing story. But it was compelling despite its verbosity, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Black House is a book that I thought about even when I wasn’t reading, which I think is the highest mark of a good story.

This is true. But is it that bad to fail, that hard to fall?”There was a lot of depth to this sixth installment in Gaiman’s Sandman series. Each of the eight issues in this bind-up stood alone, but all of them had some themes in common. There was a lot about making the most of your time, dealing with regret, and living with the outcome of decisions you’ve made. The title, Fables and Reflections, very much suited the tone and content. Dream was more of a secondary character in each of these stories, but served as the bridge connecting all of these radically different characters, as well as their times and places in history. “Some things are too big to be seen; some emotions are too huge to be felt.”Many of the characters here came straight from history: Joshua Abraham Norton, Robespierre, Augustus Caesar, Marco Polo, and more. There were also characters who come from mythological or religious traditions, like Orpheus and Eve, both of whose tales are among my favorites in the collection. The story of Orpheus in particular was very well done. But out of all of these stories, the final issue in this installment was my favorite. The issue was Ramadan, and it centered around Caliph Harun al-Rashid, the ruler of Baghdad during its golden age. There was something both wonderfully magical and melancholy about his story, and that is a combination at which Gaiman truly excels. “You know what happens when you dream of falling? Sometimes you wake up. Sometimes the fall kills you. And sometimes, when you fall, you fly.” Fables and Reflections isn’t perfect. While philosophically engaging, its pacing is far slower than previous installments. I read on this bind-up for almost an entire month, which is an absurd amount of time to spend of one graphic novel. And yet, it felt as though that was exactly how Fables and Reflections was meant to be read. It’s a collection that goes down best when nibbled on over an extended period of time instead of being consumed in one sitting. I won’t say it’s my favorite installment in the series, but it gave me the most food for thought....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 24, 2021","Oct 25, 2021","Sep 24, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40996645-the-sandman-vol-6

For the most part, we are shown what relationships that should be loving are in actuality when those involved care more about themselves, their own comfort or pride or so on, than they do those they should love based on birth alone. And when parents don’t set an example of love, as we see from Lear when he banishes Cordelia for not tickling his ears with false boasts of love as her sisters do, children often emulate what they see, as Cordelia’s sisters go on to do in their treatment of their father. I love the role of the Fool in any Shakespeare play that includes the part. The way said Fool can speak the truth in riddles that others dare not speak has always fascinated me. They walk a dangerous line, which this play’s Fool acknowledges in Act 1, Scene 4; some threaten him when he lies, others when he tells the truth, and still others when he holds his peace. But the need to speak truth mingles with the need to entertain, and it makes for a very interesting character who almost feels like a breaking of the 4th wall. In modern literature, I’m reminded of Wit from The Stormlight Archives, who takes on this same role in multiple settings.While I very much appreciate this play, it’s hard to get past the unrelenting darkness of it long enough to find any true enjoyment. The conniving of Edmund was fun to read. The Fool and Edgar (while disguised) had definite amusing moments. But there wasn’t really anyone to root for, and this is a play that, even if you go in completely blind, you can somehow from the first scene that it’s going to end terribly. Which is certainly did. I’m glad to have refreshed my memory, and I very much enjoyed the act of buddy reading it with Emma. There were some profound thoughts to consider.

That’s Nora’s In Death series, under her pen name of J.D. Robb, for me. There are now 53 novels, not counting novellas and short stories, in this series and, while not every single installment has blown me away, I always enjoy getting to catch up with characters who now feel more real to me than some of the actual living, breathing people in my life. This particular story was a bit different in that it was really two different mysteries, neither of which would have been quite enough to fill out a novel by itself. But Nora managed to weave the two together seamlessly, and the combination was far more interesting than either mystery would have been on its own. One crime, the very recent murder of a homeless woman, results in Eve being on the scene when another, far older crime is uncovered on a construction site during demolition. The way Eve, and through her the author, manages to juggle these two radically different cases, committed almost 4 decades apart, was fascinating to watch.While the cases were interesting, and both of them managed to tug on the heartstrings in different ways, the plot wasn’t what kept me involved. As always with this series, that honor goes to the characters. I’ve come to love this cast of characters, both Eve and Roarke and their ever-expanding group of friends and coworkers and found families. Watching as they slowly transition into new stages of live, so slowly that they themselves don’t observe what the reader can see, is always a delight. Each installment feels like a chance to catch up with old friends. There’s a huge comfort element to any series that goes on this long, even when the central plot always hinges on murder.I have nothing new or original to say about this book. It was exactly what I was hoping it would be, and I’m already looking forward to the next time I get to catch up with Eve and Roarke and Peabody and the rest of the gang....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 12, 2021","Sep 25, 2021","Sep 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56269213-forgotten-in-death

It’s not a book that had been on my radar at all; I hadn’t heard it mentioned on any of the sites and podcasts I follow for book news. I was immediately and completely captivated by the prose. But that’s not to say that said prose outshone the story itself, which was equally engaging. I knew very little about this book going in, and was pleased to discover that it was actually a multi-generational family saga. However, it’s a family saga presented in a way that felt fresh and unique. I ended up loving everything about it, and am so thankful for whatever serendipity brought it to my attention. The writing style, especially in the first few chapters, is breathtakingly pretty, and very unique. I was reminded of Where the Crawdads Sing, but only slightly. The further the story progressed, the more clearly original it revealed itself to be. The author employs some truly unique metaphors and similes that had me going back and rereading (and re-listening) to lines, just to get my head completely wrapped around the comparisons. Every single one of them worked, even though I would never have come up with them myself. I love the juxtaposition in perspectives and time periods. Life was so radically different for a thirteen year-old girl in the 1930s than it was for a boy of the same age in the 80s. This is a fact that anyone would know if they took a moment to think about that scenario, but the back-to-back jumping between the two drove that truth home on a far deeper level.I also loved how the author kept pace as he swapped between these two perspectives. We see Carol and Samuel alternatively at similar ages and stages of life, which just further drives home how different their lives were based on gender and time period. And yet there were some beautiful parallels, as well. I very much enjoyed watching both of them grow.What makes a family? Does shared blood mean more or less than love developed over the course of years? Watching Carol slowly build herself a family without noticing, and watching Samuel grow to appreciate his own family more and more, was absolutely lovely. The side characters in this story were just a beautifully full of life as the main characters, with a couple of notable exceptions. I found anyone with a villainous role in the novel to be a bit two-dimensional, but even that decision served the story well. While I loved all of the supporting cast, I developed a serious soft spot for Eddie and Joe, in particular. Night Came with Many Stars is a hopeful, beautifully written story with a lot of depth and even more heart. I didn’t expect to be adding it to my list of favorite books of the year, but that’s exactly where it landed. Also, I can’t recommend the audio version highly enough. I’ll definitely be buying myself a physical copy in the near future.

I’m not commonly a consumer of poetry, though I tend to enjoy it when I do think to pick it up. But this collection is unlike any poetry I’ve ever read. The theme here, peering into the minds of fictional, classical, historical women, often overshadowed by their more famous spouses, or gender-bent versions of famous male characters, is incredibly unique. And every single poem in the collection delivered something witty or clever. They made me think, which I think is one of the best compliments I could give this type of work. I’ve never ed a book of poetry before, so the thoughts below are a bit… untamed, if you will. So I’ll sum up my thoughts like this: if you’re looking to dip your toes into the waters of poetry and you happen to love fantastical stories with a strong female voice, The World’s Wife is the collection for you.My favorite entries tended to be those inspired by either Christian scripture or classical mythology. Of those more classically inspired, I especially loved the poem about Thetis. The descriptions of her fight for freedom, of her transformation into so many wildly varying creatures, was enchanting. I could feel her defeat as if it were my own. I also loved the poem from Penelope’s perspective, detailing how she sank into her weaving after Odysseus didn’t return home and found herself maid the strands. She claimed to have “lost {herself} completely in a wild embroidery of love, lust, loss, and lessons learned,” and I loved how that sentiment was worded. By the time he returned, he was no longer missed. At least, so her story plays out in this particular poem. There was something prettily maudlin about “Penelope” that I truly adored.And then there were the biblical entries. The amount of symbolism in “Queen Herod” is insane. There are layers upon layers of meaning here. It’s a poem that could be read half a dozen times and the reader would notice something new each time. I found the motivation behind her decision to have all the boy-children killed incredibly interesting, and vastly different from that of the biblical King Herod. I found “Salome” to be an interesting take, as well, though that one was far more tongue-in-cheek. Can you imagine waking up with a killer hangover only to find a severed head in bed with you? Yikes.I appreciated the way Duffy’s style and meter changed poem by poem. In “Anne Hathaway,” her poem from the perspective of Shakespeare’s wife, she gives us an actual fourteen-line Shakespearean sonnet, which I thought was a lovely touch. The same can be said of the poem from Eurydice’s perspective. I loved that she kept referring to “the girls,” as if she was telling the Muses, or perhaps the Greek chorus that so often narrated stories, a story for once, instead of the other way around. While the collection was largely free-verse, I feel that I can say little about the style and meter because it did change so radically from poem to poem. What I can say is that, even when I felt I was missing some deeper meaning that I could sense but not see clearly, I never got tangled up in the writing itself. I found every single entry in this collection easy to read.“Queen Kong” was a very unique poem. How differently would a gender-swapped King Kong act in regards to her love interest? The piece took a surprising, gruesome turn right at the end that actually made me gasp aloud. And then there were “Mrs. Rip Van Winkle,” “Mrs. Icarus,” “Mrs. Aesop,” and “Frau Freud.” All of these poems made me laugh, or at least chuckle internally. Not to be sexist, but I’m not sure exactly how much a man would enjoy this collection. The male half of the population is never shown in a flattering light within these pages. There’s a bitterness, aimed toward men, running through the entirety of the collection. While I understand it, and that choice does make sense with the idea of the whole, it grated and grew a bit tedious after the fifteenth poem or so. These lines from “Mrs. Beast” convey the misandric tone of the collection:“…they’re bastards when they’re Princes,What you want to do is find yourself a Beast. The sex is better.”The imagery in some of these poems is by turns beautiful and vulgar, lovely and jarring. In “Medusa,” her former love is described as having “a shield for a heart and a sword for a tongue.” In “Mrs. Quasimodo,” she is scorned by her husband and gets revenge, her destruction called “the murdered music of the bells,” which I found incredibly evocative. But there were other turns of phrase that just made me uncomfortable. Which was most likely the intent, but it jarred me right out of my enjoyment of whichever poem I happened to be reading.Some of thes entries in this collection, such as “The Devil’s Wife,” were a bit over my head. While I understood the main thrust of the poem, I felt like there was a deeper meaning I was missing. There were a few I didn’t care for, and others that I really loved in the beginning that included a line or thought that soured the lines before it. But some, like “Thetis” and “Queen Herod,” “Penelope” and “Mrs. Lazarus,” were wonderful. I ended up very much enjoying The World’s Wife, and can actually see myself rereading it. All of these poems, whether I liked them or not, gave me a lot of food for thought. This is a very feminist collection that rewards a familiarity with classical stories while shattering them and piecing the splinters into something new. Whatever qualms I might’ve had, I can’t deny that it was wholly fascinating.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Sep 02, 2021","Sep 09, 2021","Sep 02, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11192365-the-world-s-wife

The entire idea of thIn the spirit of the title, our amazing co-blogger TS decided to send all of us at Novel Notions a copy of The Gifts of Reading. The entire idea of this book is lovely. Here is a collection of essays about the joys of giving and receiving stories, written by those who craft stories for a living. In some cases, it’s about books or authors who had some sort of profound effect on the essayist. In all cases, it was lovely to see the magic of the written word through the eyes of others, and to see how much it means to this each individual making up this host of writers. The first essay is Robert Macfarlane’s eponymous “The Gifts of Reading.” Macfarlane has a truly beautiful way with words. It’s the only essay in the collection that I had read previously, and I can see how it inspired the idea behind this book.William Boyd, in his essay “Some Observations on Giving Books,” says the following: “Books can help you endure the most dire and inhuman of circumstances…” The situations he used as examples were mostly of those imprisoned, but this is something I’ve found to be true time and again in my life, when I was going through difficult times. This entire essay resonated strongly with me, and is among my favorites in the collection. As much as it was about the joy of giving books, it was also about what books, especially fiction, give us back. And the following quote sounded like it came from my own mind:“But of all the people I’ve given books to over the years there is one person who is the wholehearted, uncontested beneficiary of my book-giving largesse. Me. I give myself books all the time, almost every day, in moments of book-obsession, book-need. Let’s be honest: book-addiction.”He ended the essay with this lovely sentiment: “When you give someone a book you are making a present of part of yourself.”Another of my favorite essays in this collection is Jackie Morris’s “Intimate Relations,” in part of which she details her relationship with books as a child and the very different relationship with books she made sure to foster in her own children. I loved the way she detailed reading to and with her children, and how that fostered a love of reading on their own. But this essay was also about being profoundly touched by a poem, about using whatever creative arts you have to fight for important things, and about how one of those important things is the public library as an institution.David Pilling’s entry, “The Man I Was,” might be my absolute favorite essay I’ve ever read. He housed his book-giving within the framework of some fictional apocalypse, when he was leaving his five favorite books out for someone to find, along with an explanation of why he loved them. This was assuming that the world lasted long enough for someone to find the hastily gift-wrapped stack of books next to his rotting corpse. The framework was equal parts sad and hilarious, but the messages inside that framework, about which books he loved enough to leave out for others and why he chose them, was thoughtful and profound. It was a perfect blend of humor and philosophical musings, and I thought it was positively brilliant.I absolutely love what SF Said has to say about the importance of children’s books, and how subversive they can truly be if you look beneath the surface. In his essay, “The Best Gifts You Can Give,” he stated: “This is what children’s literature is all about. It can express the biggest ideas in forms so beautifully simple that anyone can not only grasp them, but come to live by them, because they take up residence at your very core.” I found this sentiment incredibly lovely, and true. And the books Said chose! Some of these are among my own favorites, and I loved hearing exactly how they had impacted this author’s life and work.The final essay in the book, Markus Zusak’s “The Will of Stories,” was by far one of the shortest in the collection. It was one of the few, if not the only, essay to not drop book titles throughout. And yet, it was a delight to read. There’s something about his writing style that is beautifully unique, and even in the few short pages of this essay, that style shone.This collection as a whole was lovely. I can’t say that I adored every single essay, but there were some that I loved deeply. And even those that didn’t resonate with me still provided food for thought. If you’re a lover of books, and believe that reading is a gift best enjoyed when shared with others, this collection of essays should be on your shelves. And on the shelves of those who have fostered that love in your life, or shared that love with you in any way. It makes a truly wonderful gift....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Aug 30, 2021","Sep 30, 2021","Aug 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55449809-the-gifts-of-reading

I’ve never taken the time to pick it up, because while I enjoy a good mystery element in my reading, I don’t generally set out to read a mystery; it’s just to one of my go-to genres. And if I do set out to find a mystery, I tend to choose those that lean more towards suspense or thriller or horror. That is not the world of Three Pines, at least as far as I’ve seen in this first installment, Still Life. Even though the plot centers around a murder, there’s something gentle and quiet about the tone and writing. While I didn’t adore this book, I did enjoy it. And while I’m not on the hype train yet, I can see why so many people love the series so much. Three Pines sounds like a delightful place, in spite of the murder. And the cast of characters is a lot of fun.I love Inspector Gamache. He’s like an endearing version of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, but more believable and compassionate. The rest of the cast is pretty great, as well. I enjoyed getting pieces of the story from different perspectives, whether those perspectives were Three Pines residents or other law enforcement agents. Some of the townspeople are incredibly unique, and I’ll be interested to see more of them.Three Pines is a charming setting, even when murder is afoot. The setting puts me very much in mind of a cozy mystery, but the tone was weighty enough to give the book more gravitas than that genre usually brings to the table. I found the pacing pretty slow for a novel this short, but not so slow that I actually became bored.

My faith is a huge part of my identity. I’m a Christian, and I’ve attended Revival Season is not the kind of story I can read completely objectively. My faith is a huge part of my identity. I’m a Christian, and I’ve attended Baptist churches my entire life. When something is so integral to who you are, it’s difficult to remove yourself from a story that centers so profoundly around that trait or belief. And that was one of my biggest problems with this book. There were so many religious red flags that I wanted to take the whole fictional family to counseling. This was a twisted, maimed version of my faith staring back at me from the page, a funhouse reflection of what I believe. I just wanted to look away.  I didn't.  I finished the book.  But it was a struggle for me. A particular subset of Christian leaders I’ve always had a ton of issues with is the faith healers. While I fully believe that God is still performing miracles every day, including those so profound that there’s no other explanation, I’ve seen too many exposés on said faith healers lying to congregants and staging their healings in order to gain larger followings or more financial contributions. I don’t trust them as a group, though I’ve never met a self-professed faith healer in person. So it was interesting to see the life of a faith healer from the inside. The story is set in 2017, but it feels more historical than that. I kept thinking about the 70s as I read for some reason. There was something about the lifestyle this man was forcing upon his family that just screamed “abusive situation waiting to happen” to me, while also shooting me back into the past.I can’t imagine how hard it would be to live with knowing the truth about something while everyone you love believes a lie, and not being able to tell them the truth because you know they would never believe you. Well, I can, but I’m thankful to not be in that situation. But that’s where Miriam, our perspective character, finds herself. She’s the eldest child in this family, and she sees something one night during revival season that leads her to question everything she’s ever known about God and faith and her father. The rest of the story is her wrestling with that knowledge and those questions.If you’re a Christian, it’s so desperately important to never tie your faith to another person, whether that person is a family member or a preacher or someone famous who professes to follow Christ. The only beings who should be involved in your personal belief are you and God. The same can be said for any religion or belief system. The people in your life will fail you. They’ll make mistakes because they’re human. And if your faith is somehow tied to them, it will break when they do.I don’t generally do trigger warnings, but there’s a fairly graphic scene depicting self-harm in this book of which I think some more sensitive readers need to be made aware. There’s also a good bit of child and spousal abuse, though most of it happens off-screen, at least in the front half of the story. Between those issues and the depiction of religion, this book was hard for me to read, and I don’t consider myself a particularly sensitive reader in most cases. The unhappiness in this family was palpable from the beginning of the novel and only worsened from there. Something about it felt relentlessly bleak to me. For a story so supposedly centered on God, there was actually very little of Him in these pages. While the characters proclaimed faith in God, it felt more like their faith was in either themselves or another person. If any of them prayed for a sign, they would interpret whatever happened as an affirmation. The entire approach to faith and having a relationship with God as portrayed in this book rubbed me the wrong way and made me deeply uncomfortable. Perhaps that’s because I’ve seen this type of religious fervor firsthand in my life, and have seen the damage it can wreak. I think it’s always hard to look at the twisting of your own faith. However, I also think this was a very deliberate, purposeful choice by the author. Because God was indeed present in the pages, and his scarcity made his presence all the more powerful to our perspective character when she did feel Him. Or was it simply the power of her own belief that she felt? That question is one of the things that made the story interesting.I both hated and respected the ambiguous, open-ended ending. Where the story went after that final sentence is anyone’s guess, which will surely keep it at the front of readerly minds far after they finish the book. But I couldn’t decide if it was a brave decision or a weak one. But that’s often how I feel when reading such endings, and is one of the main reasons I have such a love/hate relationship with literary fiction. I’m glad to have read Revival Season. And I’m even more glad that I’ve finally finished reading it. It made me think deeply, and my husband and mom both heard way more about it than I’m sure they wanted to. And it made me feel, though the emotions it evoked the strongest were anger and sadness. This is a book that, while I appreciated it, I didn’t enjoy it, and I won’t be reading it again. That being said, the writing was excellent, and I would definitely be interested in reading more of West’s work.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 25, 2021","Aug 31, 2021","Aug 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44143978-revival-season

The idea of a novel this long set at a health resort sounded tedious to me. But after seeNine Perfect Strangers was not a book I intended to pick up. The idea of a novel this long set at a health resort sounded tedious to me. But after seeing the trailer for the Hulu series, I found myself intrigued. I enjoyed another of Moriarty’s books, Big Little Lies, and it was also a story whose premise did nothing for me, so I decided to give Nine Perfect Strangers a try. I’m glad I did, because it ended up being one of the best non-fantasy novels I’ve read all year. I was honestly incredibly surprised by how much I ended up enjoying this book.As I mentioned above, our setting is a health resort. I’m not generally a fan of spas as a setting, but this one had a few things going for it: it’s housed in a converted historic home in Australia, and the treatments are uniquely tailored and often cutting-edge. But what really drew me into the story were the characters. We have the titular strangers who come to the resort at the same time for a 10 day cleanse, all of them looking to revamp their lives in different ways for radically different reasons. Then we have the owner of the resort and her two aides. All twelve of these people are perspective characters, and the narrative cycles through their points of view. Moriarty does a great job diving deep into the psyches of her characters and making them feel multifaceted and three-dimensional during their perspective chapters. The balance of this with how the same characters seem almost like caricatures through the eyes of the rest of the cast is an interesting, and compelling, one. By the midpoint of the novel, every single person felt real and absolutely believable to me. There was one major exception, but I think they were supposed to be an exception. I loved seeing how all of these characters grew and changed by the end of the book, and how they stayed the same. And I didn’t really expect to care.This story is also a look at the dangers of playing God with the lives of others, and how that can negatively impact those people even when you technically get the results you want. It also showed how, no matter how tightly you try to control things, people are unpredictable and can always find a way to worm free that you didn’t anticipate. People can always surprise you, especially when you truly believe you have them all figured out. They’re also resilient, even when they don’t believe they are.There came a point in the story where the narrative could have gone completely off the rails as the plot suddenly veered from its trajectory up to that point. But, to stick with the metaphor, Moriarty kept things on track with both finesse and a firm grip. Even at its wildest, you could tell she had the story completely under control. I don’t want to go into detail, as I found this portion of the book impact because it caught me so off guard, but it was definitely surprising. There was a bit of a fourth-wall break that was jarring but fascinating. That entire segment of the story was really weird, but I was hanging on every word. This is where to book went from a 4 star read to a solid 5 stars.I didn’t see how following the growth of these characters during their time at a health resort could possibly be that interesting. It didn’t sound like there was going to be much plot. Turns out I was wrong. The story ended up being far, far twistier than I expected. While it was a bit slow to start as groundwork was laid, even then I was never bored. But after about two hundred pages, I was hooked. There were surprise revelations being thrown out even in the very last pages. Nine Perfect Strangers is not a typical read for me. But I’m so glad I decided to give it a try. I guess should thank Hulu, since the ad for the show is what drew my attention to it in the first place. After having enjoyed both this book and Big Little Lies far more than I anticipated, I’m very interested in reading more of Moriarty’s work.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Aug 19, 2021","Aug 27, 2021","Aug 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39280445-nine-perfect-strangers

If there’s such a thing as cozy fantasy, that’s how I would describe Riyria. I absolutely adore Hadrian and Royce, and getting to catch up with them made me incredibly happy. And so far, The Death of Dulgath is my favorite book in the series. It felt like there was a ton of character development in this book, especially in regards to Royce. There were also a couple of very well crafted new characters who I very much enjoyed.The growth of Royce and Hadrian’s relationship over the course of this series does something to my heart. There were a handful of scenes that actually made my heart ache a little, as Royce showed how he had grown to like and trust Hadrian. For someone who doesn’t like or trust anybody, this was a big deal. And it made my heart kind of squishy. The two complement each other incredibly well. It’s hard to think of a better duo in fiction. I can think of a few I love just as much, but at the moment I can’t think of any I actually love more than Hadrian and Royce.One difference in this book from the rest is the inclusion of an artist as a secondary character. I loved how he viewed the world, and how Sullivan described art through him. I’m a sucker for any book in which art is a central theme, so this was an added bonus for me. The artist, Sherwood, was a fascinating character, as were Scarlett and Nysa Dulgath. Again, Sullivan did a fabulous job on all of the character development in this story, both of our main characters and these new players he introduced.While the characters are definitely what make all of Sullivan’s books so engaging, he also did a great job with both setting and plot in this particular novel. Dulgath is a very interesting and unique little place. It sounded wonderfully charming, and I just wanted to transport myself into the book so I could see it with my own eyes. And the plot was a bit more multifaceted than that of the previous two books, so I was very much invested the entire time. There was also some pretty great dialogue sprinkled throughout the book; I laughed out loud more than once. The Riyria Chronicles have gotten better and better with each installment. I hope this trend continues with The Disappearance of Winter’s Daughter, but The Death of Dulgath is going to be really difficult to beat. There’s something about this world, these characters, and Sullivan’s writing that makes both Riyria series I’ve read so far incredibly inviting and cozy and comforting.

I still love this book and am blown away by the craftsmanship of the prose and the story itself, in all its facets.I’ve been looking forward to Empire of the Vampire since the day it was announced. I pre-ordered it as soon as the link to do so went live. So to say that my expectations for this book were high would be a drastic understatement. Which makes it all the more impressive that I found those expectations not only met and surpassed, but completely blown away. I loved everything about this book, and after having loved the Nevernight trilogy fervently, Kristoff’s adult fantasy is something that I will immediately and always purchase.“We are hope for the hopeless. The fire in the night. We will walk the dark as they do, and they shall know our names and despair. For so long as they burn, we shall be flame. So long as they bleed, we shall be blades. So long as they sin, we shall be saints.”Kristoff is an absurdly, nigh on disgustingly talented writer. His prose is this seemingly effortless mix of heart-achingly beautiful and snarky in the same breath. Every word feels like the easiest, most natural choice in the world while also feeling as if it was only chosen after incredibly careful consideration. Honestly, his prose is breathtaking in its balance. The ease of it makes me sick, and I can’t stop reading it. The only other authors I can think of with even a remotely similar style are Patrick Rothfuss and Scott Lynch, and yet there’s still an effortlessness to Kristoff’s work that sets it apart. Obviously I know that this caliber of craftsmanship is far from effortless, but that’s how it comes across.“But it’s a fool who looks with more fondness to the days behind than the ones ahead. And it’s a man drenched in defeat who sings that sad refrain; that things were better then.”Speaking of Rothfuss, one of my favorite niche tropes ever is when the protagonist has built this insane, larger-than-life reputation while still young but like any excessively bright star has burned out fast, and are now being somehow coerced into telling someone else their life story so that “the truth” of their life can be preserved for posterity. Which I know is incredibly specific, but it happens more often than one would think. My favorite example of this trope has always been The Name of the Wind, but I honestly think that Empire of the Vampire did it even better. The framework story was compelling in its own right, and I’m desperate to know how Gabe ended up there. Beyond the framework, we are given a look into Gabriel de León’s life story through his own words, with the timeline slipping back and forth between his early years and his most recent adventure. I was equally engaged in all three facets of the plot, which isn’t always the case in books portraying the same character in different stages of life.“Put a man in a room for a hundred years with a thousand books, and he’ll know a million truths. Put him in a room for a year with silence, and he’ll know himself.”This is one of those rare adult novels where the illustrations are actually part of the plot, and they served to enhance an already incredible story. The artwork is absolutely stunning. And the religious imagery of the writing was aided by the art style, as well. Bon Orthwick, the artist responsible for all of these amazing illustrations, is insanely talented. The combination of his art and Kristoff’s prose is utter perfection. There’s this sensuality to both that worked incredibly well with the story itself.“You’re past is stone, but your future clay. And you decide the shape of the life you’ll make.”I deeply appreciate the way Kristoff handles hard topics in this book, like addiction and zealotry, faith and doubt and love and lust and what makes us truly human. The way in which he approached religion was fascinating and gave me a lot of food for thought. The belief system in this book very closely mirrors Catholicism, and while we knew from the very beginning that the faith was corrupted in some way, it was still presented with a nice balance of respect and skepticism. “If we spend all our lives in darkness, is it any wonder when darkness starts to live in us?”If you’ve read Kristoff’s Nevernight trilogy, it will come as no surprise to you that Empire of the Vampire is incredibly dark. There’s a lot of pain and gore and death here. Like, a ton. There’s also copious amounts of religious and relationship inner turmoil. But the humor Kristoff imbues in his writing served to keep the story from ever feeling too heavy, even when things were at their bleakest. Kristoff has a keen sense of when a dark scene is becoming too much, and somehow always manages to find a way to give you just enough relief from that oppressive darkness to keep going. However, I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that the bleakness of the story got to me at times. It was just handled in a way that kept me coming back to read more.“There’s no misery so deep as one you face by yourself. No nights darker than ones you spend alone. But you can learn to live with any weight. Your scars grow thick enough, they become armour.”There’s so much more I could say about Empire of the Vampire, but I’ll settle for saying that it’s a dark, sensual, snarky, philosophical, profane, profoundly romantic and impeccably written introduction to a series that I feel certain is going to become a lifetime favorite for many readers. Myself included. This is a novel that I’ll be rereading and pressing into the hands of anyone I think could handle the darkness and the worldview. I seriously cannot wait to get my hands on the sequel.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,2,"Mar 05, 2024Oct 27, 2021","Apr 09, 2024Nov 22, 2021","Aug 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43728380-empire-of-the-vampire

I’ve always been fascinated by The Great Gatsby, both by the characters and Fitzgerald’s writing style. It’s not the most accessible of novels, despite its brevity, but there’s something magnetic about it, much as there is that same special magnetism surrounding the title character himself. I was very interested in seeing how these characters translated in the hands of another, with magic added to the mix. The author did a pretty great job capturing the tone and feel of the original while still making the story their own.The imagery is truly stunning, and captures the core essence of a Gatsby party as portrayed in the original novel to perfection. But the narrative itself is muddled and hard to follow. The inside of Jordan’s head is a vague and confusing place to be. This felt true to the original, but the muddy quality of the narrative made it difficult to become fully invested, and I found myself putting the book down after reading only a handful of pages and only reluctantly picking it back up. I just couldn’t connect. While this is something I often excuse in classic fiction like The Great Gatsby, I have a harder time looking past it in a new release, even when said new work is a retelling. I appreciated how the author incorporated discussion of race and sexuality without ever actually falling into a diatribe on the topics, and I felt like Jordan was a really great vessel through which to explore those topics. I also felt like the characterizations for Nick, Daisy, Tom, and Gatsby himself were absolutely spot on. But there was something about getting the entirety of the story from Jordan’s perspective that made the whole book feel like a fever dream, which is more than likely why it took me so long to plow through its less than 300 pages. The Chosen and the Beautiful is a unique, interesting take on what has been labeled by some as the Great American Novel. I do think it’s absolutely worth reading, especially if you’re a fan of the original. Just be content with taking your time as you journey through it, and don’t be surprised if the depth you feel sure is lurking beneath the surface manages to evade you. It’s much like a Gatsby party in that way.I received an advance copy of this book from the publisher, Tordotcom, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest .You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 19, 2021","Jul 24, 2021","Jul 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55169019-the-chosen-and-the-beautiful

In my defense, the book made less and less sense as I read it, the stories flowing less effortlessly and feeling more forced. Which is common with King. Sticking the landing just isn’t his strength.Out of all of the Stephen King books I’ve read, this one is by far the strangest, at least in terms of set-up. It’s not a novel, per se, nor is it a collection of short stories. These interconnected novellas become more and more dependent on one another as they progress, telling different facets of the same story in a way. I cared the most about the first two, and by far the longest two, stories, and honestly would have enjoyed the book more had it ended after “Hearts in Atlantis.” “Low Men in Yellow Coats” is perhaps one of the very best, most moving stories I’ve ever read. “Hearts in Atlantis” was a study in human nature that spoke to me on a deep level. The remaining 3 shorter stories just didn’t have that same level of impact. I felt like the more war-heavy stories didn’t age very well. I did, however, like that the book ended with revisiting the main character from the first story. That decision made everything feel a little more cohesive overall. Below are my brief thoughts on each of the five stories.Low Men in Yellow Coats:This particular story, which accounts for almost half of the book’s length, felt like something special. King is so incredibly good at writing convincing child heroes who aren’t saccharinely precocious. The friendship between Bobby and Ted was beautiful and true, and I love that it was founded upon a love for of good fiction. The story delivered so many things, from nostalgia to sweetness to fear to sorrow to, at last, hope. It ties directly into the Dark Tower narrative, and even if the rest of the collection doesn’t end up blowing me away, reading this story made my picking up the book absolutely worth it. 5 solid stars. If you’re a fan of Boy’s Life by Robert McCammon, I feel like this story is worth your time. The childhood nostalgia was excellently captured.Hearts in Atlantis:I find it amazing that King can take an idea as simple as a college dorm’s collective addiction to a card game and make it a compelling story. But he did. I was astounded by how much I came to care about these boys and their struggles. Pete Riley was an incredibly compelling character, and I was really rooting for him to overcome his addictions and save himself from the draft that was killing so many boys at the time. I also really enjoyed seeing Carol again, in a completely different context.Blind Willy:This is an odd one. How long can the events of a childhood rule the life of an adult? We have a borderline dissociative identity disorder and selective blindness represented here, and the entire premise is a really weird one. It’s interesting how Carol Gerber has become a bit of a Shrodinger’s cat by this point in the narrative. I’m super curious what happened to her, and what caused her to make the decisions she’s made and get involved in the movements she was involved in.Why We’re in Vietnam:Again, this story hinges on a ripple effect, on how past events and acquaintances shape the course of a life. Here, all of the main players, from John Sullivan to Ronnie (the card-playing instigator from Hearts in Atlantis) to Blind Willy of the previous story, are all connected loosely by 2 things: Carol Gerber and the Vietnam War. It was interesting seeing more of Sullivan, since he was an important side character in Low Men in Yellow Coats as the third member of Bobby and Carol’s friend group, but that was really the only purpose his story served. Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling:This final story brings us back to Bobby, our protagonist in “Low Men in Yellow Coats.” It was nice to see how his life turned out, as the end of that first story left his fate a bit up in the air. We also get to learn a little bit more about what happened to Carol after “Hearts in Atlantis.” Both Bobby and Carol are very interesting characters, and I was happy that King returned to them in the end. And I really hope to see more of Ted further down the road to the Tower.All in all, Hearts in Atlantis was a nostalgic, thought-provoking read. “Low Men in Yellow Coats” was incredible on its own, and reading it ended up being a very emotional experience. I can see how that central story could link in with the Dark Tower, and I’m very excited to see what actually comes to pass. There’s a movie of the same name starring Anthony Hopkins as Ted, and I bet he was absolutely amazing in the role. It’s definitely on my watch list.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 07, 2021","Aug 08, 2021","Jul 07, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/228134.Hearts_in_Atlantis

There are so many trilogies and series where reading the second book is something of a doldrums experience; it’s giving you a lot of background and filler to get you to the main event in the third book. I’ve read a bunch of these, some of them in series that I consider to be favorites, especially in the fantasy genre. But that’s not at all what I got in The Becoming, book 2 of Nora’s The Dragon Heart Legacy trilogy. This book was impactful and engaging from first page to last, while still providing the setup needed for the final installment. I thoroughly enjoyed every single scene in The Becoming, and I will absolutely be rereading it and its predecessor before the aforementioned final installment, The Choice, is published in November of 2022. I’m incredibly thankful for Nora’s schedule and work ethic, because I would hate to have to wait any longer to get the end of this story.If you know me at all, you know that I adore Nora Roberts and read absolutely everything she publishes. She’s one of my very favorite authors, and has been for over half of my life now. I go through phases and changes with other favorites, but Nora’s place in my heart has always been solid and secure. My favorite genre tends to change. Sometimes I’m all about fantasy and horror, while other times I want nothing but literary fiction or thrillers or middle grade classics. I’ve never considered romance a favorite genre until this year, but Nora has always been my favorite regardless of genre. Because of this, I’ve been beyond thrilled as, in the past few years, she’s really stretched herself as a writer and has both tackled tough topics and tried her hand at genres outside of her norm, like dystopian and fantasy. While she’s always had fantastical elements in her work, The Dragon Heart Legacy is the first I would label straight up portal fantasy, and she’s done a brilliant job balancing the worlds on either side of those portals.There are so many strong, wonderfully developed characters in this series that listing them would take forever, so I’m only going to mention a few. Breen, our protagonist, has grown by leaps and bounds since we first met her in The Awakening. Her determination and drive support her talent and wit very well, but she would have never discovered any of those qualities in herself without the beautiful support system of friends and family she’s managed to accrue by this point in the narrative. My favorites are Marco, her childhood best friend who would follow her anywhere; Sally, the drag queen who is far more of a mother to Breen and Marco than either of their own; and the grandmother and honorary grandfather Breen never knew she had. But the entire cast is wonderful. While the romance of the central characters is far slower developing than is Nora’s norm, she’s balanced that very well with romances in the lives of the supporting characters, especially in Marco. There’s quite a lot of action and battle sequences for a Nora series, and she has always written them well. As with her sex scenes, she writes more about the atmosphere and emotions than she does the mechanics of the act itself, but her battles suck you in. You can smell the blood and smoke and sheer ferocity in the scenes. And there’s something beautiful and timeless about magic as she writes it, just as there’s something insidious in the magic of the antagonists. This series has no gray characters; there is a very clear divide between good and evil, but I think having such a solid division between light and dark is refreshing. I have nothing negative to say about this book, or the one that came before it. The writing was lovely, the magic enchanting, the characters endearing, and the battle engaging. I wish I could take a trip to Ireland, find the Welcoming Tree, and take my own journey into Talamh. The Becoming made me want to ride a dragon and make friends with a fairy, yes, but it also made me want to write, to sing, to push myself out of my comfort zone and see who I can become when I get out of my own way. And isn’t that kind of motivation the very most we can ask of fiction?You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 28, 2021","Nov 30, 2021","Jun 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56269133-the-becoming

I figured I was in for an The premise and cover of Olympus, Texas immediately grabbed my attention, but I wasn’t expecting anything earth-shattering. I figured I was in for an interesting story that would hopefully keep me engaged but which I would most likely forget about soon after. I was incredibly mistaken. It’s closing in on mid-June, and I can unequivocally say this is the best book I’ve read so far this year. And I started off the year with The Labyrinth of the Spirits, which blew my mind. I can’t believe I found this book even more impactful. Not only was the story excellent and the characters impeccably crafted, this book was a masterclass on the psychology of fictional beings who have been around for millennia without being this thoroughly exposed and explained. I feel like an entire college class could be taught on the Greek pantheon using Olympus, Texas as a textbook. It’s incredible, and it changed the way I think about stories I’ve known for decades. “Being family just means we don't have the safety of fences between us.”The characters in this little novel are weirdly compelling. Less than fifty pages in they already felt more fleshed out and real than some real life human beings I’ve known for years. And that was before I fully realized who they were and what they represented. They are almost uncomfortably realistic in a remarkably short span of pages, and I was honestly in awe of the author’s character craftsmanship. “It's much easier to break a thing that has already been broken once. Mending rarely makes it stronger.”This book managed to feel like equal parts Grecian drama and a vivid image of the American South. It is also a blazingly furious, feminist answering of everything wrong with the world of Greek mythology. And, as stated in the narrative itself, this family is a walking collection of deadly sins; and yet, for all of their flaws and for all the ways they so deeply wound one another, there is genuine love there. The way in which the author mines the psyches of these characters who have been around for millennia and manages to flesh them out so fully is mind-blowing.“...those absent can feel more present, do more damage, than any warm body in the room.”I knew going in that this novel was inspired by Greek mythology, but I had no idea that residents of Olympus, Texas would be modern takes on the gods of the classical Olympus. Zeus, Hera, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Artemis, Apollo, Athena, Hades, and others are present in more mortal forms, and it was fascinating to pair these characters up with their immortal counterparts. There are also more minor mythical characters littering the narrative, and every single little inclusion was so deftly and subtly crafted that I was awed.“When people define themselves in comparison to something else, they become that much more committed to never changing their minds about that something else.”I’ve read plenty of Greek myth retellings, but this book was so different. It wasn’t trying to retell one particular story of give a new take on one particular character. Instead, the story takes these famous faces and couches them in a new setting, but where the same stories play out. Yes, there is a realistic, modern twist to each component, but they’re essentially the same tales that have been told about the Greek pantheon for millennia. And yet it’s one of the most creative books I’ve ever read. One of the things lacking in classical myths is insight into the motivations of the players. Here, the author gives us motivations and insights in spades, and it has changed the way I perceive the original myths. I found the idea fascinating, and the execution utterly compelling. “Pessimism wasn't a negative trait for them. It was a way to consistently feel happier, each mediocre event a triumph over potential calamity.” It amazes me how effortless every aspect of this novel felt, especially considering how much juggling had to be done to give each of these characters room to shine without changing anything at the core of the gods and goddesses they represented. I was also stunned by how sympathetic the author was able to make characters like Hera and Aphrodite and Zeus, who have always felt so petty and two-dimensional to me. The reverse can be said for deities I’ve always been more drawn to, like Hephaestus and Athena. And the depth of insight on the part of the author is absolutely astounding. I would think she had taken things as deep as humanly possible, and she would blow me away with another little reveal.“Our reactions to most things are muddier than we admit. Yours don't have to be all good or all evil. They just are what they are.”Even though this story is perhaps the most fascinating retelling I’ve ever read, it is at its heart an incredibly moving, intricate, heartbreakingly believable family drama that would still be fantastic without the reader having any knowledge of Greek mythology. And it addresses so many questions with both depth and grace. Is bad behavior a product of nature or nurture? Does family bring out the worst in one another? Can selflessness be just as harmful to others as selfishness? Do the sins of the father always come back on the son? Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of those who came before us? And, to go back to the Greek inspiration behind this tale, how much are women expected to suffer at the hands of the men who supposedly love them? Because every tragedy in this story, whether taking place on the page or in the past, is the product of a man’s lust, or jealousy, or pride. Not that the women aren’t culpable, but the author did a great job harkening back to the mythological source material in this regard.“If romantic love contained so much foolishness, waste, and want, why seek it out? It seemed a natural disaster on par with a hurricane--one would deal with it only if evacuation proved impossible.”I loved everything about Olympus, Texas. The setting was believable, the character development was absolutely astounding, and the psychological insights into these timeless personalities will inform my views of them for the rest of my life. While I do feel like this would still be an incredibly compelling family drama for those who have no familiarity with Greek mythology, anyone who shares my fascination with Greek mythology should absolutely not pass on Olympus, Texas.

But was it worth the trauma I endured to get here? Heck to the no. It was fine, but it wasn’t mind-blowing by any means. And I rolled my eyes so often, y’all. There were some things that seriously irked me about both books. For example, I can’t stand the martyr complex in a relationship. When one half of a couple decides that they’re no good for the other half and determines to sacrifice themselves and their happiness and shove away the other person, usually in some underhanded, manipulative way instead of talking it out with their significant other, I see red. COMMUNICATE, people. It’s not that hard. Lay it all out there. Hash it out. Let the other person be in on making this life-changing decision since, you know, it also effects them and THEY ARE AN ADULT. I seriously can’t stand when people, real or fictional, do this. It drives me insane. I also can’t stand how co-dependent these couples become. It’s not healthy. I love my husband with every fiber of my being. He’s my best friend, and I’d be devastated to lose him. But I’m still a whole person on my own. No one should feel that they have to have another person to be complete. The author’s strength is cute dialog, whether through texts or face-to-face interactions. I also found the tour element and the inclusion of art in different forms interesting.

While I’ve read some truly wonderful books this year, none of them have made my heart happy quite like this one. I spent so much time grinning from ear to ear that my face hurts. The relationship between Poppy and Alex is so stinking cute. I had this kind of friendship in the past. And, Reader, I married him. There is little I love more than a friends-to-lovers story, because I know first hand how much added depth falling in love with your best friend brings to a relationship. But this wouldn’t have been nearly as fun to read about had both parties in the relationship not been inherently likable. Thankfully, both Poppy and Alex are incredibly charming, though they’re radically different. Those differences make their friendship even more fun to read about. He’s incredibly straight-laced and a touch obsessive-compulsive. She’s a wild child mess of a woman who just wants to taste everything the world has to offer.I’m not a big rom-com girl, but every once in a while I’ll develop an itch for one. Emily Henry scratches that itch better than any author I’ve come across. I laughed. I cried. But I knew everything was going to work out in the end. I found this book both lighter and a bit more endearing than Beach Read, which I loved, so I’m thinking that Henry has more than earned my trust. I read/listened to this book in under 24 hours. While I’m sure it would have been great in print alone, adding Julia Whelan’s narration made reading it a truly wonderful experience. She did an incredible job breathing more life into already three-dimensional characters.

But thankfully no such choice was required, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in both formats.Formulating a coherent, thoughtful critique of this book is proving impossible, so I’ll just end this gush-fest by reiterating how happy People We Meet on Vacation made me. It’s been a long time since a book made me laugh this hard or grin this wide, and it was exactly what I needed right now. I cannot recommend the novel or its audio counterpart highly enough.

I try not to judge books by their covers, but the double entrendre of this one, with the book on the book cover and a burial plot in the background of the title, immediately captured my attention. And I did very much enjoy the layers of this story within a story, this nesting doll of layers that Korelitz presents here. But when the premise revolves around the writing of a book with a completely unique plot, one which is not a variation of the same handful of plots we’ve told and retold since before written language came to be, you don’t expect to guess the twist. Alas, that was my experience. The Plot sets out to deliver something new, and does to an extent, but I feel that it promised more than it was able to deliver.“Good writers borrow, great writers steal. —T. S. Eliot (but possibly stolen from Oscar Wilde)” I have never felt so convicted by a nonreligious work as I did by the very first chapter of The Plot. If you’re a reader who loves to daydream about being an author without ever developing the courage to actually try to write, or to send what you did manage to write out into the world, this book is a gut punch. It also speaks to the fear of rejection all artists face, whether in the first amateurish throws of their craft or after worldwide acclaim, when creating something new. The things The Plot had to say about writing and the cultural importance of stories and storytelling were definitely my favorite aspect of the book.“You’re only as successful as the last book you published, and you’re only as good as the next book you’re writing. So shut up and write.”Once we get past the philosophy of writing presented early on, and revisited throughout, we get to the actual premise of the story. Imagine being a young but already fading author, whose debut novel made a respectable splash in the literary world but who has never again managed to garner even a fraction of that response with further works. In desperation, you take a job teaching fiction writing in a third-rate MFA program to make ends meet. There, one of your most obnoxious students of all time shares with you his Sure Thing, a plot the likes of which has never been written. And yet, the book never materializes. When you find out that said book will never be written, wouldn’t you feel a responsibility to that phenomenal plot to write it yourself and share it with the world? This is the predicament in which Jacob Finch Bonner finds himself. As his life changes trajectory after he puts this Plot into the world, he gets a message that makes his blood run cold: someone knows he’s a thief. This is where the pace really cranks up, propelling readers toward (what should have been) a radical, shocking climax.“Once you were in possession of an actual idea, you owed it a debt for having chosen you, and not some other writer, and you paid that debt by getting down to work, not just as a journeyman fabricator of sentences but as an unshrinking artist ready to make painful, time-consuming, even self-flagellating mistakes.” I think what crippled this book for me were the characters. I don’t want to give away any more spoilers than the general synopsis; all of the information in the above paragraph can be found in the jacket copy. So I’m only going to discuss Jake himself. I found him to be an incredibly weak character. I understood his motivations, and even his actions to an extent, but he just felt like a pushover. I always pictured him cowering from life, which made some of his later actions less believable. Honestly, I was meant to be rooting for him, I suppose, but I found him slightly distasteful.“I’ve learned so much about writers. You’re a strange kind of beast, aren’t you, with your petty feuds and your fifty shades of narcissism? You act like words don’t belong to everyone. You act like stories don’t have real people attached to them.”As mentioned previously, I guessed the twist/reveal that was meant to be so shocking by a little over the halfway mark. This made for me battling frustration with Jake for not seeing what I saw through the rest of the story. I’ve read books that were far more straightforward that delivered better shocks. However, I will say that the ending Korelitz chose was really ballsy, and I very much respect that choice. The ending redeemed my frustration to an extent and recolored my experience with the book in a more positive light.“I just care about the story. Either it’s a good plot or it isn’t. And if it’s not a good plot, the best writing isn’t going to help. And if it is, the worst writing isn’t going to hurt it.”The Plot is an incredibly propulsive thriller, perfect for book lovers who enjoy reading stories about stories and the art of crafting them. It has a really solid twist that will undoubtedly make this a 4 or 5 star book if you don’t see it coming. I wasn’t a fan of Korelitz’s character development, but she really stuck her landing.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 18, 2022","Jan 24, 2022","May 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55315487-the-plot

As much fun as I had reading Nothing to See Here last year, Perfect Little World impacted me much more deeply. I adore Izzy and Dr. Grind and Mr. Tannehill and the entire setting of this story. They’re weird, the setting and premise are weird, but wonderfully so on all counts.Imagine a gigantic home comprised of ten nuclear families, all raising their children together. No, this is not a commune or a cult. It’s a long-term science experiment called the Infinite Family Project. Nine expecting couples and one single soon-to-be mother have signed on to live together for the first ten years of their children’s lives, only revealing to the children who belongs with whom at the five year mark. Until this point, the parents will essentially parent all of the children equally, with the kids sharing a communal bedroom and the parents taking shifts with them when not in their own small homes inside the compound. It’s a really weird senario. Will it help these children feel like they have a bounty of adults who love them? Will it help these parents, who are for the most part without real family, feel as though they have an unshakeable support system? Or will the entire project go down in flames?While I was intrigued by the premise, the characters are what kept me invested. Izzy is such an unusual woman, and inside her mind was a unique, refreshing place to be. The same can be said for Dr. Grind, the other perspective character in this book. Wilson excels at penning loveably odd characters, and that is showcased to great affect in Perfect Little World. He also excels at unusual relationships. I love Izzy’s relationship with Mr. Tannehill. He’s much more of a father to her than her biological father. It’s probably my favorite relationship in the entire novel, though there are plenty more that are lovely. I thought this was a lovely story, and a lovely idea. We say that it takes a village to raise a child, but how much happier and healthier would our kids be if we tried to actually live out that idea? Even if our approach isn’t quite this radical, what would it hurt for us to reach out to families with little support? Kindness and compassion and genuinely caring can mean so much to lonely lives. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 14, 2021","May 18, 2021","May 14, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29229956-perfect-little-world

Honestly, this is one of the few novels in King’s backlist that I would have had no qualms skipping if it hadn’t been on the suggested expanded Dark Tower reading list I found here. I had no desire to read about a supernatural car. Freaky inanimate objects don’t really do it for me. Most of the time, anyway. I should’ve remembered the topiaries in The Shining. Because this unnatural Buick ended up being pretty darn creepy. I was expecting Christine or James Dean’s Little Bastard. That’s so not what was delivered.I was wondering what on earth a book about a car could possibly have to do with King’s Dark Tower series. Even before I reached the halfway mark, my wondering had ceased. While I won’t know for certain how it ties in until I’ve read the rest of the main Dark Tower series, I have no trouble seeing how this preternatural car could relate to the bigger story. And some of the things that pop out of it make the lobstrosities of The Drawing of the Three seem cuddly and banal. Seriously, this “car” is hella creepy, y’all.“It's funny how close the past is, sometimes. Sometimes it seems as if you could almost reach out and touch it. Only who really wants to?”While I wasn’t that interested in a story about a car, that wasn’t the only part of the jacket copy that gave me pause. I had no real desire to read a story so deeply entrenched in the world of law enforcement. However, I ended up falling in love with Troop D. The ways in which they accepted the son of a fallen officer so easily and completely into the fold warmed my heart. And I loved the way in which they told the boy the story of his father’s tie with the Buick. There was something ancient and almost classical about the way in which the tale was told. It felt like a deconstructed Greek chorus, and something about the tight-knit relationships and the reluctant but determined way in which they imparted this tale and all its oddities won me over completely.“…the whole idea of curious cats attaining satisfaction seemed slightly absurd. The world rarely finishes its conversations.” I felt like the main theme of this story isn’t grief, but instead the dangerous seduction of curiosity, and how closely related it is to obsession. This is a topic King has covered time and again, but this particular story felt more like it danced around the theme instead of meeting head on. And honestly, that worked well here. Something random that I loved about this book was the complete lack of sex. Sex is where King always loses me, and it was refreshing not to have to worry about that in this novel. Stephen King can make seriously anything eerie and disturbing, and From a Buick 8 is a prime example. I love it when I go into a book with low expectations and find myself pleasantly surprised. Also, it got me one step closer to reaching the Tower. I’m getting closer and closer, and I am insanely excited to be nearing the end.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 10, 2021","May 16, 2021","May 10, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6499285-from-a-buick-8

We meet Gifty in the preTranscendent Kingdom is a beautifully written look into the life of Gifty, a first generation Ghanan American neuroscientist. We meet Gifty in the present and follow along as she revisits her past, seeing her faith in God in a losing battle against the traumas of her childhood. We see her brother’s battle with and surrender to addiction, and her mother’s same relationship with depression, and we are shown how these battles and losses helped in large part to lead her to her career in the sciences. Gifty’s story is interesting and moving, but the emotion it most evoked within me as I read was sadness. While her remembrances of her brother and mother were painful, what truly hurt me the most to read about was her church experiences. With everything I’ve gone through in my life, I always knew that I had this huge support system in not just God, but my church family. Gifty should have had that, but instead faced judgment and racism from those sharing the pews around her. I think, even more than her losses, this treatment is what most compromised her faith in God. Ghandi, when asked his views on Christianity, once said: “I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.” In my opinion, these are some of the saddest words that have ever been spoken. A Christian’s calling is to be Jesus’s hands and feet in the world, to be the lens through whom the world can see Christ. The Christians of whom Ghandi spoke, as well as the fictional congregants of Gifty’s childhood church, are utter failures in this regard. And such is the case all too heartbreakingly often.There was an amazing amount of depth to be found in Transcendent Kingdom’s less than 300 pages. And made me think, and it made me feel.

I love Ward’s decision to revisit part central romances in later books, at her peeling back the curtain and showing that things aren’t all rainbows and unicorns just because you love each other and tied the knot. Relationships take work, and that work doesn’t end at happily ever after. Seeing that on the page, and seeing these couples work through whatever life throws at them, is really satisfying....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 05, 2021","May 06, 2021","May 05, 2021",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10803619-lover-unleashed

The plot is interesting and fast-paced, the world building is enchanting without being overwhelming, the characters are multi-dimensional and sympathetic, and the romances are so dramatic as to evoke soap opera vibes. There’s plenty of tension and drama in the story, but none of it feels trite or overwrought like that in so many of the YA books I’ve read that left me irritated.

Something isn’t right on the mountain. Something besides the abuse Mattie can never seem to escape. A new creature has made the mountain its home. It’s huge, a master at staying hidden, and far too intelligent to be a bear or any other average predator. Can Mattie find a way to escape them mountain, and leave both of her monsters behind?I flew through Near the Bone in less than 24 hours. I’ve never read anything by Christina Henry, but I found her prose to be compulsively readable. There’s something about her writing style that really drew me in. It’s like the words just disappeared from the page, leaving a movie of sorts in their place. And while this is a novel about a preternatural creature, and while there are a handful of other characters in the narrative, this is largely a character study of Mattie. I loved watching her reclaim her courage and her voice over the course of the novel, as well as her mission to uncover her own past. She was without a doubt the star of the show.While the story was incredibly compelling, there was a lack of depth outside of Mattie’s internal story that left me feeling a bit dissatisfied. If it were a movie, Near the Bone would have been a made-for-tv, SyFy cut, not a big-budget HBO or theatrical release. This could totally be an issue on my end, though, instead of with the book itself. I tend to find a lot of horror novels a bit shallow, and I think this is because my first loves of the genre were Dean Koontz and Stephen King. As both of these authors tend to pen chonkers, I think it’s an unfair comparison to make with shorter novels, but it’s one that I can’t seem to help making. However, Near the Bone fared better than most in my mind due to the depth of Mattie’s story. I just wish a bit more of that wonderful depth had been applied to the creature itself, and to the mountain survival scenario. If you’re in the market for a well-paced survival horror with a compelling protagonist and a slim page count, Near the Bone should definitely be at the top of your list.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 14, 2021","Apr 16, 2021","Apr 14, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54735151-near-the-bone

By the time I actually received my copy, I had forgotten everything but the broadest of outlines and the fact that I really wanted to read it. I should have refreshed my memory because man, is this book dark. I wasn’t ready for it.Girl A is the story of Lex, one of the surviving children from a house of horrors where she was imprisoned and tortured alongside her siblings by their parents. Lex is the girl who escaped, who ensured the release of her siblings. The narrative opens with Lex going to her mother’s prison for the first time, after said mother has died and left Lex as the executor of her estate. We follow Lex as she reconnects with her siblings and confronts parts of her past that still haunt her every day. She gives us their stories in bits and pieces over the course of the novel, and each new revelation is more devastating than the first. This novel is very much about the long-enduring effects of childhood trauma. Is it something you can ever truly, totally overcome? I think that our scars contribute hugely to shaping who we are, but wounds have to heal in order to become scars. What if the wounds from our past never close? What if they’re constantly being picked at, or become horribly infected but are never treated for it? Does your life become consumed by the wound, or do you try to live life as if you aren’t bleeding out in every moment? We see a varied array or responses to these questions over the course of the novel, but I found there to be very little hope. Perhaps I’m naive, considering the subject matter of this book, but I was desperately seeking hope somewhere in the story. There was a hint on the very last page, but it felt too late to make a difference in the narrative, and could even be interpreted as something less than hopeful depending on how you read it.Girl A was incredibly well written, and I found it to be a very impressive debut novel.

I love my husband with every single fiber of my being, but I can’t fathom there only being one right person out there for anyone. There are too many things that could potentially go wrong. What if your soul mate dies of cancer before they graduate high school? What if they live halfway around the world? Those kinds of questions are just scratching the surface of what Marrs explores in The One.  Imagine if scientists were able to isolate a component of DNA that exactly matched with only one other person on the face of the earth. That’s exactly what has happened in The One. The company Match Your DNA has taken the world by storm. One simple mouth swab, and they’ll scour their database in search of your genetic match. Dating and marriage are forever changed. Racism, homophobia, and religious conflicts are basically things of the past, as DNA matches can cross continents, genders, races, and creeds. It would be an almost idyllic society, at least on the surface, if not for all of the families that have been broken up as married couples split to be with their genetic matches. But, as with all things, there’s an underbelly to this new world of that is anything but romantic.The One is not exactly a novel, but instead follows the lives of five strangers as they find their matches. We see how these matches wreck or improve the lives of their counterparts. The five plotlines don’t cross, which made the book feel like a collection of five smaller stories, but I thought this added a level of interest to the plots that might not have been there had said plots intermingled. And each story was radically different. I found them all delightfully twisty, far more so than I expected. Definitely don’t go into this book expecting a romance. Yes, romance is a big part of each story, but this is a thriller; a happily ever after ending isn’t guaranteed in the slightest. There was nothing predictable about this book, and I found that lack of predictability delightful. The pacing was phenomenal. However, I have to confess that I wasn’t blown away by the character development. The One was much more about the plot lines than about the characters themselves, and I never truly connected with any of them. But I was fascinated by their stories, and was always eager to learn what had happened next by the time the narrative cycled back around to them.I found The One a refreshing, unique conglomeration of stories. I’ve never read anything quite like it. I’m definitely interested in digging into other works by Marrs. This book is the inspiration for a new Netflix series, and you can bet that I’ll be adding it to my watchlist.

I had no problem rooting for the good guys, even though I couldn’t quite loathe the bad ones as much as I wanted. The descriptions were tight and exactly enough. I was able to picture everything I needed to in detail, without ever getting bogged down in minutia. While the plot isn’t the most original on the planet, it was handled in a way that felt fresh and compelling and even offered a bit of food for thought.My digital galley of this was an audiobook, and I actually think that format kept me more involved in the story than I might have been with a print copy. The audio is narrated by the author, and she did a wonderful job. Not only am I interested in checking out more of her work, I’ll ensure that I pick it up on audio if she narrates it. Her pacing and inflection were superb. The only reason this was a 4 star read for me instead of meriting 5 stars is that I don’t think it’s a story that will stick with me for long. I was deeply invested while the tale was ongoing, but I already feel myself moving on from it. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I can see it leading me to including more thrillers in my reading rotation....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 25, 2021","Mar 27, 2021","Mar 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55004063-mother-may-i

Much. SCIENCE. Seriously, there’s an overwhelming amount of science in Project Hail Mary. While I have a tendency to zone out during any intensively science-heavy sections, I couldn’t put this book down. I just adore the snarky tone of Weir’s writing. And while the protagonist in this novel bears an uncanny resemblance to Mark Watney in terms of inner monologue style and aggressive optimism in the face of impossible odds, I didn’t care. The delight that is Watney’s personality is what drew me to and kept me invested in The Martian in the first place. That type of character was exactly what I was hoping to find in Project Hail Mary, so I wasn’t disappointed in the least by their similarities. I was deeply invested, and my emotions while reading fell into mirroring those of our protagonist. He demanded an incredibly amount of empathy. I desperately want to discuss another character, but doing so would spoil a major twist in the story. I’ll settle for saying that there was a lot to love about the characterizations Weir wove into the narrative, and said characterizations more than made up for him drowning me in science. Reading about such hope and optimism in the face of impossible odds made me feel better about the world in which we’re living, and can we honestly ask anything more of our art and artists?

A ritualistic murder on a prestigious college campus, with a Classics professor and his select group of all female students, known as the Maidens, at the center of the intrigue? Yes, please. I love dark academia, especially when combined with the study of Ancient Greek and classical literature. I went in hoping form something along the lines of The Secret History, which I absolutely adore. But I liked what this book pretended to be far more than what it actually was. If that makes sense. Alas, The Maidens fell a bit flat for me.I actually groaned out loud at the twist. I was so disappointed with where it went. I felt played, and not in a fun way. There was some truly great setup for something else here, but the twist came out of left field with absolutely no breadcrumbs leading to it. It felt forced and false, and reminded me of the problems I had with Michaelides’ previous novel. But while I didn’t love how things turned out, the rest of the story was interesting enough to make my experience with it vaguely positive overall.There is a brief reference to the author’s previous novel, The Silent Patient, and the case around which that story centers. This was a fun addition, I suppose, but it actually served to pull me out of the story. I thought it was unnecessary and distracting, but that’s a personal opinion. I’m sure there will be other readers who love this little nod to The Silent Patient.Something random that bothered me through the entirety of the book: why does every single man who crosses our perspective character’s path seem to have the hots for her? I know she’s evidently a beautiful woman, but having 4 different men pursuing her to varying degrees over the course of the novel was a bit much. And elicited more than a little eye-rolling. What I will say, though, is that the audio for this is stellar, except for the voice given to one particular character. If you’re a fan of BBC’s Sherlock, be aware that Louise Brealey is the main narrator here!The Maidens wasn’t a bad book. But it didn’t live up to its potential. If you’re in the market for a mystery, this one might be refreshingly different. However, if you go into this book looking for dark academia along the lines of The Secret History, I’m afraid you might be disappointed.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 26, 2021","May 29, 2021","Mar 19, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45300567-the-maidens

The magic is wild and terrifying and surely among the most fascinating in fiction. But what truly makes these books shine are the characters within them. The character development here is fairly unique in that we get most of from external opinion instead of internally within the characters themselves. So many of these characters have a level of nobility and courage and selflessness that they not only never expect but never acknowledge within themselves. We see these attributes through the eyes of others, which makes them even more worthy of respect. These characters are what both draw readers in and make them hesitant to continue, because you can be sure that any character to whom you grow attached will either die epically or endure the level of trauma that can break the strongest of minds. That knowledge, garnered over the course of the first two novels in the series, is precisely why it took me almost a solid month to read Memories of Ice. This series is so dark and heavy that I have to slowly pace myself through them, balancing them out with lighter fare so as not to sink into a fictionally-triggered depression. I was also suffering some severe battle fatigue by the halfway point. However, I was invested in so many character arcs that there was never any question of my finishing the book. There were some truly epic, immensely powerful scenes that had me in tears at the end. Some were almost expected, but others completely blindsided me. If I was rating this book strictly on its most powerful moments, it would be a solid 5 stars. It’s going to take me a while before I can even consider moving forward in the series, but that’s definitely not due to any failing on Erikson’s part.

It will definitely appeal to the same audience that loved Madeline Miller’s Circe. However, there was some magic imbued into Miller’s work, some fierce beauty behind the pain, that wasn’t present in this novel. It felt like viewing a work of art through a fog instead of clear glass. While it was a very well written mythological retelling, I couldn’t quite love it.Ariadne as a character drove me crazy. Her responses and reactions were realistic for a girl her age, but I kept wanting to shake her. But I have to confess that she grew. However, I found her strength as a character far overshadowed, at least in the first half of the novel, by that of her sister, Phedré. Here is a different kind of strong female character, and I very much respected her mind and her ability to make a life for herself out of a situation she would have changed if given the chance. At least, that’s who she is in the first half of the book. There was a lot of character development in all of the predominant characters in this novel, but not all of, or even most of, those changes were good.Saint did an incredible job shining light on the failings of heroic tales: the heroes themselves. When the heroes tell their own stories, who can expect them to not embellish their victories and breeze past their losses? Who would not expect them to emphasize their attributes and minimize their failings? To compare it to a tapestry, seeing a hero’s story from the underside, where the knots and mistakes are visible, was refreshing. I took some kind of fierce, illicit joy in seeing Theseus’s flaws and weaknesses. Here he was humanized, and not in a good way. Ariadne’s story also breathed a lot of depth and dimension into a god of the pantheon I often overlook: Dionysus. He was also humanized in this novel, as well, but in a much more positive way than his heroic, mortal counterpart. But later in the story we are shown how, even though gods don’t age, they can definitely change, even over the short course of a human lifetime. The narrative is intensely feminist. I enjoyed seeing Dionysus as one of the rare gods who fostered the rebellious spirit beating in the hearts of the women who sought out his cult, though much had changed by the end of the novel. There was a lot of commentary on the treatment of women during Ariadne’s time, as well as many examples proving how wrong men were when they shrugged said women off as “the weaker sex.”This was a good story, but it was incredibly tragic. Which is to be expected from anything inspired by Greek mythology, I suppose. It’s not a canon known for its happy endings, after all. All of the positive attributes I could find in the cast of characters had more or less vanished by the close of the novel. There was nothing about this book that made me feel anything good. It was lovely, and sad, and well written, but it was terribly depressing for so short a work. Was it a book worth reading? Absolutely. Will I read it again, though?

Finding a series that I love all the way through is rare for me. And I just found one to add to that very I am completely blown away by this trilogy. Finding a series that I love all the way through is rare for me. And I just found one to add to that very exclusive list. There’s a bloody beauty to Mia’s story. A vulgar elegance, if you will. The world Kristoff created here managed to be both stark and lush in equal measures, and something about that dichotomy resonated strongly with me. As did Mia. Her heartache, her rage and fear and determination, all felt honest. I found her and her journey utterly captivating.“I am a daughter of the dark between the stars. I am the thought that wakes the bastards of this world sweating in the nevernight. i am the vengeance of every orphaned daughter, every murdered mother, every bastard son. I am the war you cannot win.” First of all, let’s talk plot. In Nevernight, Kristoff gives us his spin on a school setting, one of my favorite tropes both in and outside of the fantasy genres. This school for young assassins is one of the harshest, deadliest I’ve ever come across in fiction. In Godsgrave, Kristoff gives us another favored fantasy trope: gladiatorial games. And he did so with wicked aplomb. The balance of bloodletting and emotion was perfect. Finally, in Darkdawn, Kristoff gives us his take on pirates, hero’s journeys, and epic battles on a magical, godlike scale. All of these tropes are among my favorites, and I absolutely love when an author can take one of these and put a fresh, unique spin on it. Kristoff did so again and again, and I was honestly a bit awed by how deftly he was able to seamlessly weave these tropes together into a tight, compelling narrative.“To live in the hearts we leave behind is to never die.”While I truly loved Mia and enjoyed the supporting cast immensely, they weren’t the biggest draw for me. Nor was the plot or the setting, though I was thoroughly invested in both. No, what actually drew me in and kept me coming back for me was the prose. Kristoff is a phenomenal author. Some writers want their prose to disappear as the reader sinks into the story, allowing their work to become a film of sorts in the readers’ minds. Others see the prose itself as the most important element of their work. Kristoff falls between these two mindsets, and actually made his prose into a character in its own right. I mean this both literally and figuratively; things get pretty meta in this final installment. The writing is brimming with humor and emotion and is often achingly beautiful and shockingly vulgar in the space of a single paragraph. I was delighted by every single sentence.“You never know what can break you until you're falling apart. You never miss your shadow until you're lost in the dark.”If there’s one thing I could change about this series, it would be the inclusion of a love triangle. It’s my least favorite trope in literature. I can honestly say I wasn’t invested in either outcome. But for some reason, I was able to basically just skim over the romance throughout the entire trilogy without being genuinely annoyed by it. While I would’ve been happier without it, the presence of the triangle wasn’t enough for me to downgrade my rating for any of the three books. “You can’t know how sweet it is to breathe ’til you’ve had your ribs broken. You can’t appreciate being happy ’til someone has made you cry. And there’s no point blaming yourself for the kickings life gives you. Just think about how much it hurt, and how much you don’t want to feel that way again. And that’ll help you do what you need to do the next time to win.”Kristoff has no problem killing off his darlings, but I was totally okay with that. Even though the deaths of characters I had come to love hurt my heart, I appreciated the fact that Kristoff didn’t pull his punches. This is a story with incredibly high stakes, and it wouldn’t have been as strong a tale without heartbreaking sacrifices along the way. There were a couple of instances where I thought Kristoff took the easy road but, as it served the plot, I could let those slide. Again, my frustration here wasn’t enough for me to drop the rating.“Fear was Can't.Fear was Won't.But fear wasn't ever a choice.To never fear was to never hope. Never love. never live. To never fear the dark was to never smile as the dawn kissed your face. To never fear solitude was to never know the joy of a beauty in your arms.Part of having is the fear of losing.Part of creating is the fear of it breaking.Part of beginning is the fear of your ending.Fear is never a choice.Never a choice.But letting it rule you is.”The Nevernight Chronicle is everything I hoped it would be, and more. I don’t know that I could possibly be any more excited for Kristoff’s upcoming release, Empire of the Vampire. I think I just found a new author to add to my “immediately preorder everything they ever write” list.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,2,15,1,"Mar 04, 2021","Mar 12, 2021","Mar 04, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23264672-darkdawn

Faithless in Death was fast-paced and gripping and exactly what I was hoping for.The story begins with the murder of a talented artist. But, while finding her killer is always central to the plot, and while she is always a priority, the story twists and expands from there. Instead of focusing on a single murder, Eve finds herself toe-to-toe an expansive, powerful, evil cult. I’m a sucker for a good cult story, so this plot line was an unexpected bonus for me. The cult is truly evil and believe themselves to be above the law. Can Eve and her team take them down? It’s a David versus Goliath tale, but my money is always on David.Once again, I loved getting to revisit people I’ve come to love over the decades. They feel incredibly real to me, and every novel feels like a chance to catch up with old friends. I love seeing how these characters have grown and changed over the course of 52(!) novels. The relationships I can remember first forming have now deepened, and the family Eve and Roarke have built for themselves is bigger and closer than ever. While I really love Eve’s cases most of the time, what draws me back to this series again and again will always be the characters, and the little slices of their lives Nora works into the narrative.I’m so relieved to have connected once again with the In Death series. And may we never be parted again....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 15, 2021","Feb 19, 2021","Feb 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53138105-faithless-in-death

One that moved you, inspired you, broke down a wall within you and helped you grow? What song can bring back a memory as sharp as a snapshot, bringing you back to a time and place and smell and one prismatic moment any time you hear the first notes playing through a speaker? I don’t think any other art form on the planet can so deeply evoke sense memories and wildly variant emotions that music. While I love books with every fiber of my being, it’s music that has the most power to move me. And I think this is true for far more people than realize it. Music is the language of the soul, and it’s fascinating to see what speaks to the hearts of different people. Especially those who move others with their own music.It was interesting to hear how wildly different these artists approached discussing the music that shaped them. Some took a cerebral approach, others verged on spiritual, and some were just brimming with so much enthusiasm and joy that you couldn’t help but smile with them. Some of these artists, both those being interviewed and those whose records were the albums that changed the interviewed artists’ lives, I had at least a passing familiarity with. Some I had never heard of. But my knowledge of these artists and that art that moved them didn’t really matter in the slightest. Hearing any person, even a total stranger, talk about the music that matters to them, even if I’ve never heard of it, always feels valuable to me. The music that is important to us and the reasons it matters can be deeply personal, and I think any sharing of that is something special.You can tell that Spitznagel, the author and interviewer behind this book, is incredibly passionate about music. Rock in particular. There is so much love and care in the way he approaches these interviews. It’s evident that he was truly invested in learning how all of these artists he approached would answer the question of what album changed their life. This book could have somehow ended up becoming about him. That didn’t happen here. He was a facilitator, not the star of the show, and that mentality made all the difference in making this book feel honest and authentic. While I love the concept of this book, there were some failings in the audiobook format. This is a series of interviews, but both sides of every single interview are narrated by the same person, Michael Bulter Murray. While he did a great job, this could have been so much more had there been clips of the real interviews, or at least one additional narrator. The narrator did the best he could to ensure you could tell who was talking, interviewer or artist, but it would have been much easier to follow with two voices. However, I adjusted to having only one voice covering both ends of these interviews after a while, and I think the audio format was a very fitting way to ingest this book. By the time I reached the end, my complaints felt very minor.I was intrigued by the title and premise of this book when I stumbled across it on NetGalley, but I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Honestly, I could have happily read twice as many such interviews without ever feeling bored. I had never heard of Spitznagel, but now I want to dig into his back catalogue. Anyone who loves music this deeply is someone whose work I want in my life.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 09, 2021","Feb 11, 2021","Feb 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54810070-rock-stars-on-the-record

I was in the mood for a quiet story, but this was just too quiet. The writing was nice, but not incredible enough to carry a story lacking in both plot and characterization. I just wanted to shake everyone, sit them all down in a circle, and not let anyone move until they had hashed out all of their considerable issues. While I had issues with the novel, I will say that I found the premise unique. There aren’t that many adult sibling stories out there, and this one revolves around 51-year-old fraternal twins who have always lived with their mother. The tale opens on the death of that mother, leaving Julius and Jeanie, the aforementioned twins, alone for the first time in their lives and at a loss as to how to handle a funeral or the outstanding debts their didn’t even know about. Julius and Jeanie are both potentially fascinating characters who, in my opinion, never lived up to that potential. While there was some growth in the end, we don’t actually witness it, and I didn’t find it believable considering the trajectory these characters were on before said growth. I found myself constantly reminded of the movie Nell, and I’m not sure that’s a compliment. One thing I loved was that the biggest bond between these siblings was their music. That’s something my brother and I share, as well, and it’s a really special bond to have. I honestly wish it would have played a bigger role in the narrative.While I can see why others love and will love this novel, it just didn’t work for me. If there had been a little more plot, or a little more character development, I think I could’ve at least liked it very much.

Firstly, had I not read these back to back I might have forgotten some of the characters who, while radically different, share their names across the two novels. Secondly, I’m glad I read Desperation first because I fear I would have actually been disappointed in that one had it been preceded by The Regulators. While I enjoyed both, I found The Regulators to be the better story overall.King, writing as Bachman here, couches an absolutely horrifying tale within the confines of everyday suburbia. I’ve never been more glad to live in the woods with no close neighbors than I was while reading this book. Your average summer day in the burbs is wrecked by a seemingly random drive-by shooting. But the shooters return, and there’s something incredibly off about them, and their vans, and their weapons. Things get more and more sinister from there. The two main things shared by this novel and its sister, Desperation, are the character names and the antagonist. I found it fascinating to read about characters with the exact same names but who were, for the most part, radically different from the counterparts in the other novel, with radically different fates. There were a select few of these characters who mirrored their other selves in some way, but it was a very exclusive group. Which just served to make those certain characters all the more interesting. Another of the main bonds between these two novels is Tak, the incredibly freaky antagonist. I found his influence even more disturbing in this book than I did in Desperation. I think this is due to a couple of things. First, everything happening on a particular suburban street made the action feel more claustrophobic, which upped the creep factor. Second, Tak was working through the possessed body of a child, which is always a terrifying horror trope. This loose duology was a very interesting stretch of my long road to the Tower. And these two novels are unequivocally horror, without a shadow of a doubt. If you’re looking to be freaked out, both of these books are a good bet.

AnActual rating: 4.5 stars, rounded up.“Lives are short, but knowledge is eternal.” I’ve discovered that alternate histories completely fascinate me. And what could be more fascinating that a world in which the Great Library of Alexandria didn’t burn to the ground? Not only did it survive, but it became the intellectual equivalent of the Catholic Church during the reign of the Holy Roman Empire, but with even more power and longevity. And instead of encouraging and cultivating creativity and the pursuit of knowledge, the Library has been systematically suppressing ideas and inventions that would change the world, some of which we in reality currently enjoy and take for granted. This idea really made me stop and think and appreciate, but Ink and Bone is so much more than just a treatise on the vital importance of intellectual freedom. It’s also a killer story with an incredibly compelling cast of characters. It was well paced and well written and I think it’s the beginning of something truly magical.Jess Brightwell is a runner for his book smuggler father. In this version of the world, it is in most cases illegal to own real, handwritten books. Instead, people are issues blanks, books in which the print appears and disappears by magic and at times of the Library’s choosing. These blanks remind me of multi-page readers, but I’m digressing. Jess runs books for his father, risking arrest and even his life smuggling books from an incredibly young age. But he loves books and the knowledge they contain with a ferocity that his father decides to use to his own advantage and buys Jess’s way into testing that could lead to his becoming a Library Scholar. Jess passes the test and heads for Alexandria, where we meet the rest of our cast.The dynamics among this group of students as they compete and reluctantly become friends reminded me very much of Harry Potter for some reason. But I think the biggest reason I was reminded of Harry Potter was Wolfe, the Scholar in charge of this new group of students. Wolfe is a much cooler, more vibrant Professor Snape. While I love Jess and Thomas and most all of the students, I adore Wolfe. Even though he’s technically a background character, he took center stage for me. I’m so intrigued by the world building, by the thought of a Library basically running the world. The settings for different and compelling, and the plot itself was multilayered in a way that ensured there was never a dull moment in the text. Also, it doesn’t hurt that the books themselves are gorgeous. While this is YA, which isn’t my favorite genre, it never annoyed me, and it avoided common YA tropes that I dislike. All in all, this was a great beginning to what I suspect will be a fantastic series. I’m definitely interested in seeing where the story goes next....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jan 26, 2021","Feb 04, 2021","Jan 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23398607-ink-and-bone

As a barren woman myself, this premise hit incredibly close to home for me. I loved seeing how all of these women dealt with such superstition and blatant inequality. “People cry witchcraft whenever they don’t understand something.”I’ve seen s calling this book a mix of The Crucible and True Grit, or The Handmaid’s Tale and the Netflix show Godless. Both are incredibly apt, and I felt all four of those inspirations in this story. But what I ended up being reminded of the most was the movie Young Guns. Likely this was largely a mix of nostalgia, having adored that movie in my childhood, and the fact that one of the most important characters in this book was known solely by the moniker “The Kid.” Whatever the case may be, that similarity imparted a fun walk down memory lane for me, which did nothing but increase my enjoyment while reading.“Knowledge can be very valuable... but only if people want it. If they don't, it can be worse than useless.” Our main character, Ada, was interesting. She’s incredibly book-smart, and has a lot of practical medical knowledge, but she’s not exactly gifted in the common sense department. She makes plenty of mistakes, but overall I found her an easy protagonist to root for. The rest of the characters surrounding her were fun and multifaceted, and I very much enjoyed getting their backstories. “When someone believes in something... you can't just take it away. You have to give them something to replace it.”I think my main complaint about Outlawed is that it’s one of those rare novels that feels too short. I feel like another fifty to hundred pages could have bumped this up from four stars to five in my book. But regardless, this is an incredibly fun story with plenty of depth and drama. There’s a ton of commentary and questions regarding identity and sexuality that I found to be great food for thought.

However, I had completely forgotten how much sadness there was in this story, and that there was a scene involving a near rape. I’m often surprised when I revisit a children’s classic by the content that I don’t recall, that obviously didn’t bother me when I was a child. Which, in my opinion, is an argument for why we shouldn’t ban books to protect our kids. The vast majority of the things we’re worried about either won’t bother the children we are trying to protect, or will lead them to asking big, and very important questions.This was a refreshing revisit, and I loved my time with Miyax and the wolf pack that becomes her family.

For some reason, this writing decision made it harder for me to connect with the characters, though it should have done the opposite. And while I understand that everyone handles grief differently, the decisions two of these characters made didn’t make any sense to me, which made them even more difficult for me to empathize with. I also found the prose itself very stilted, with no natural rhythm to the writing, which was another reason I had a difficult time connecting with the story.

But instead of picking it up immediately, I decided to save it for when I needed something warm and sweet and hopeful to brighten up my world. That was absolutely the right decision. I found myself in desperate need of comfort after I finished reading Deadhouse Gates, the second installment in Erikson’s Malazan Book of the Fallen series. That book felt like it destroyed my soul. And this book resurrected it, and reminded me that there’s goodness in the world.The Unadoptables are five older orphans who have lived their entire young lives in what is possibly the foulest orphanage in the Netherlands. When a chance to escape presents itself, the five run away together in search of home and a family. I found all five of the orphans absolutely lovely. There’s Sem, the kindest boy you’ll ever meet, who’s incredibly gifted with a needle and thread. There’s Fenna, a beautiful redhead who is gifted in the culinary arts but has never found her voice. Lotta is a brilliant scientist in the making with six fingers on each hand, and she uses these extra digits incredibly nimbly. Egg is an incredibly talented artist of unknown Asian descent, who wants to map the world and find out where he came from. And finally, there’s Milou, of ebony hair and midnight eye, who was found on the roof in a tiny coffin and is certain her parents are coming back for her one day. She tells amazing stories, and is the leader of this ragtag crew.All of the children were delightful. Some of the adults were unequivocally horrid, and others were more of a mystery until the final pages. But the children and their relationships with one another were the true core of the story, and I enjoyed every minute with them. The setting was inviting and atmospheric and just different enough from most similar middle grade novels to set it apart. The prose just kind of disappeared as I was reading, which is the absolute best thing a writer can accomplish in this genre, in my opinion. It was truly all about the characters and their story, and I think that kids who fall into the target audience range will find within this book a story that really resonates with them. But I also think this is one of those wonderful middle grade novels that is honestly perfect for just about anyone.It’s been a long time since I read a book this size in a single sitting.

I wasn’t sure it was going to appeal to me, as contemporary fiction often feels just the slightest bit boring when I pick it up. That was not the case with this particular book. I was incredibly invested, from start to finish. I cared about and connected with the characters, I was drawn in by the setting, and I found the story captivating.This was such a deep character study. These characters were examined and portrayed with great care and insight, as were their familial relationships and the dynamics between the families. I found every single character compelling and sympathetic, and I truly cared what happened to them. Keane does a great job portraying emotions. Instead of telling us what Peter or Frances or another character is feeling at a particular juncture, she shows us the tightness in his chest or the thirst that won’t abate. This writing decision helped me feel what he was feeling without having to put that feeling into words, and I thought it was brilliant. I highly recommend this book, and think it would prove surprisingly interesting to just about any reader.

She’s the ultimate source of mental comfort for me, and my mom, and my Memaw, and countless others across the globe. I maintain that her novels are the equivalent of a bubble bath for the brain, and that’s just what I needed this past week. I was terribly sick and the most effective medicines I found for my state of mind were reading this book and catching up on Doctor Who. I’ve never read a bad Nora novel. But there are definitely some I love more than others, and this is on the top of that list. Tribute is among my favorites of Nora’s standalone works. I love me a home renovation, and a woman making headway in a profession that is generally considered a man’s game, and a look inside a writer’s or an artist’s life, and a good family drama, and a generational mystery, and a beautifully sweet romance, and a close-knit small town. And an ugly, intelligent, charming dog who is totally a character in his own right. This novel has all of those elements. The characters are vibrant and deep, the setting is incredibly charming, and the plot is surprisingly multifaceted and well-paced. I’ve read this book in the past. Multiple times. And yet I actually didn’t remember exactly who the baddie was, or what the climax would entail, so it was all pleasantly new to me.

It’s an interesting twist on a classic story, and I’m loving how many such novels have come out recently and how many more are scheduled for publication soon. But as with all such books, I think it’s going to be hit-or-miss with lovers of the original. Seeing how Hawkins updated and tinkered with the original characters is fun, especially regarding the supporting cast. It’s her approach to Jane that I had issues with. One of the main draws of the classic, at least for me, is Jane Eyre’s character. She upright and good and wholesome and selfless, all without seeming two-dimensional or unlikely in any way. This Jane is definitely not that one. She’s selfish. Greedy. Shallow. Petty. She steals from the rich for the simple pleasure of it. I did find still her oddly likable, but she in no way measures up to the Jane I love. That being said, there were a lot of things I very much enjoyed about this book. First of all, the decision Hawkins made with regards to setting was so smart. There’s nothing quite as Gothic in feel as Victorian England, but the American South is the next best thing in terms of atmosphere. Southern Gothic is such an interesting subgenre, and the way Hawkins blended that into a classical Gothic story was noteworthy. The story takes place in Alabama, in a wealthy subdivision called Thornfield Estates. Jane is a dog-walker instead of a governess, which is how she, a broke orphan who has aged out of the system, finds herself in this glitzy neighborhood. It’s here she meets Eddie Rochester, she he almost runs her over in his sports car. Neither of their lives will ever be the same.I very much enjoyed the ways in which Hawkins tweaked the original plot so that it was still surprising to readers of her source material while not veering far enough from it to lose its resemblance. Even though, or maybe because, I’m very familiar with the novel that inspired this one, there were plot points that surprised me a bit, which made my experience much more enjoyable and entertaining. Also, the audiobook is well narrated, with a different narrator for each point of view. The narrators oozed character into their performances, which made me want to just keep listening.If you have any kind of sentimental attachment to Jane Eyre, I’m not sure this is going to be the right book for you. But it might be! Finding the ways in which Hawkins tipped her hat to the original adds a scavenger hunt element to an already engaging story. And if you’ve never read the classic, this is a fun riff on it that I think you’ll enjoy for its own sake, but also might leave you intrigued enough to give the original a try....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,Jan 2021,"Jan 05, 2021","Jan 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53137893-the-wife-upstairs

When I learned that wasn’t the case, I ignored that information for more years. I thought The Shadow of the Wind was pretty nearly perfect on its own, and didn’t need expanded upon. I’ve read some marvelous books that should have been left alone, that had further books tacked on later that didn’t measure up to the first, and somehow manage to tarnish that first book. I didn’t want that to happen to my magical experience with The Shadow of the Wind, so I just ignored the rest of the series for a long time. But then, I found a gorgeous copy of The Labyrinth of the Spirits, the last of the quartet, on sale. I had to buy it for the cover alone, because it just captivated me. But I still didn’t think I intended to read it, or the two books between it and that first novel I had so loved. “Most of us mortals never get to know our real destiny; we’re just trampled by it.”That is, until I shared a picture of my purchase, and Petrik immediately fell in love. If you know Petrik, you won’t be surprised to know that he quickly researched the book, which lead him to the rest of the series, and decided that he had to read The Cemetery of Forgotten Books as soon as possible. His enthusiasm was infectious, and TS decided to join him in reading the series. They both adored it, so much so that this particular book ended up being both of their second favorite novel of the year. Obviously, since the copy I bought had started them down this path, I had to give in and read it, along with its two predecessors. “Truth is never perfect, never squares with all expectations. Truth always poses doubts and questions. Only lies are one hundred percent believable, because they don't need to justify reality, they simply have to tell us what we want to hear.”I really liked The Angel’s Game and The Prisoner of Heaven, but they didn’t quite capture me the way The Shadow of the Wind had. And then I arrived at this final installment, the book that I hoped would tie everything together and contain nearly the same magic as the first book. While it did indeed tie things together beautifully, it did not match The Shadow of the Wind.  It by far surpassed it. The Labyrinth of the Spirits was brilliant in every way, and made me retroactively love every other installment of the series even more. It, and the three preceding books in hindsight, has to be among the most mind-blowing, intelligent, moving novels I’ve ever read in my entire life. “There are times when it’s more honorable to die forsaken than to live in glory.”Within the text, Zafón stated his belief that “stories have no beginning and no end, only doors through which one may enter them.” That’s not an idea I would have fully grasped before reading this series, but it’s absolutely true of the way in which Zafón designed The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. While I would still heartily suggest starting with the first novel and progressing in a linear fashion, each book is an entry point into the same sweeping story. I’ve never come across anything else set up in quite the same way, and this structure is part of the genius. The entire series truly is a labyrinth, and this installment brings us to its heart. I was totally awestruck.“Sometimes, when the gods aren’t looking and destiny loses its way, even good people get a taste of good luck in their lives.”While the structure is absolutely brilliant, it’s far from the only impressive element. I’m blown away by the intricacies of the plot. So much happens over the course of these four novels, and no detail is ever forgotten or misremembered or shrugged away as unimportant. Every single one of those details matters. The setting is incredibly lush and dark and vibrant, and Barcelona is truly a character in her own right. I am also constantly amazed by the fact that the beautiful prose is in fact a translation, which speaks volumes of both Zafón and of Lucia Graves for her work translating the original Spanish into English. Zafón says so much about the importance of stories and the trials of the writing life that ring so achingly true.“A story is an endless labyrinth of words, images, and spirits, conjured up to show us the invisible truth about ourselves.”But my favorite thing about these books, through which I think Zafón shines the brightest, is the cast. The characters are so multifaceted, so wonderfully and heartbreakingly real. They grew to matter so much to me, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to truly stop thinking about them. All of them had such glaring failings, so many beautifully fragile strengths. If you can’t tell, I was deeply invested, and their stories will no doubt stay with me for a very long time. “Tell our stories to the world, and never forget that we exist so long as someone remembers us.”I’m so incredibly thankful to have read this series as a whole, and The Labyrinth of the Spirits in particular. Zafón was an incredibly gifted author, and I’m so glad he was able to leave the world this magnum opus. If I’m ever able to visit Spain, Barcelona will be the destination of me. I hope someday I can wander the streets and wonder if another city, one comprised of paper and ink, is waiting for me beneath the cobblestones.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,Jan 2021,"Jan 12, 2021","Jan 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37677977-the-labyrinth-of-the-spirits

And thanks to the wonderful people at Tor.com, reading the newest installment a bit ahead of its publication date has become something of a Christmas tradition for me. These novellas are all beautifully written and poignant and full of heavy topics handled with a light but respectful touch. Across the Green Grass Fields is no exception to this rule. “Girlhood wasn’t destiny unless you wanted it to be, and she had accepted her destiny wholeheartedly. Anything to be normal.”In this sixth volume of the loose series we meet Regan, a young girl who loves horses and lives in fear of being shunned for any reason. She tries to surpress anything about herself that might make her stand out, but it’s not enough. When Regan finds out why she doesn’t fit in easily with the other girls, her sense of betrayal drives her through a Door into a world she didn’t know she was searching for.“…anyone who answered a friend’s honesty with horror and rejection had never been a friend in the first place.”The Hooflands are populated by every hoofed creature imaginable. Unicorns, fauns, kelpies, selines, perytons, and minotaurs abound. But Regan finds her true home in a herd of centaurs, where she learns that being a strong woman doesn’t look the same for everyone. Within this herd, Regan finds love and acceptance and empowerment. Her human parents in our world also loved her fiercely and accepted her unconditionally and would have done anything to help her feel empowered, but something about the presence of hooves and furred flanks has cleared her vision enough to finally accept and love herself. “I can be beautiful and limited at the same time… There’s nothing wrong with being limited, as long as you have people around to make sure those limitations don’t get you hurt.”This story, like all of its predecessors, deals with some heavy topics in lovely, respectful ways while never impeding the plot in any way. The tale at the heart of this book was meandering but compelling, and I enjoyed it immensely right up until I didn’t. The ending seemed incredibly abrupt, but as that’s how it would have seemed for Regan, I think that was the point. But even though I understand the choice, it still left me a teensy bit dissatisfied with the final pages.“She still didn’t believe in destiny. Clay shaped into a cup was not always destined to become a drinking vessel; it was simply shaped by someone too large to be resisted. She was not clay, but she had been shaped by her circumstances all the same, not directed by any destiny.”Across the Green Grass Fields is an achingly lovely story about a girl who loved horses but not herself, who finally found self-acceptance among the hoofed inhabitants of another world. It was a solid new installment in a series that resonates deeply with a multitude of readers, and I think they’re going to really love this one.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 20, 2020","Dec 23, 2020","Dec 20, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53205924-across-the-green-grass-fields

It’s young adult, which I’ve struggled with in the past, but I decided to give it a go anyway. I’m so glad I did, because Wintersong is a beautiful story. A retelling of the movie Labyrinth, it’s a captivating take on the Goblin King and his Underground, with music at its core. “You are the monster I claim.”Wintersong is lush, melancholy, and brimming with decaying decadence. Sixteen-year-old me would have adored this. It still spoke to me at thirty-one, but my teenaged self would have fallen head-over-heels for the story, the setting, the characters, the romance and, most importantly, the music. Music was incredibly foundational not only to the main characters, but to the plot itself. Music is very much the soul of this story and, as someone for whom music comprises much of my own soul, this resonated deeply with me. The descriptions of music, of crafting music and letting it flow through you, were stunning. “There is music in your soul. A wild and untamed sortof music that speaks to me. It defies all the rules and laws you humans set upon it. It grows from inside you, and I have a wish to set that music free.”The writing is beautiful. The author writes lyrically, and some of her phrases felt like music themselves. She painted, lush, lovely, haunting pictures with her words. Teenaged me would have been completely enraptured by the writing, as well. Seriously, y’all, I cannot state strongly enough how much this would have been my favorite book when I was in high school.“Life,” he said softly, “is more than ﬂesh. Your body is a candle, your soul the ﬂame. The longer I burn the candle...” He did not ﬁnish. “A candle unused is nothing but wax and wick,” I said.“I would rather light the ﬂame, knowing it will go out than sit forever in darkness.”The story is very dramatic, but the plot calls for it. I don’t know how you could retell this story without such drama. And I’m going to be painfully honest: as much as I respect Labyrinth and love David Bowie, I enjoyed this book more than the film. The importance of music is a huge part of that, but so is the core cast of the book, as well as the setting and the writing. Jae-Jones just did a magnificent job paying tribute to her source material while also telling her own story. Side note: I loved the homage Jae-Jones paid to Bowie by giving her own Goblin King heterochromia.“It takes love, you see, to bring the world back to life.”There is definitely sex in this story, but I didn’t find it vulgar. It’s more about the emotion than the anatomy involved. That’s not to say it isn’t erotic. Because it’s very erotic. Again, younger me would have found it insanely romantic and would have read and reread certain scenes until the pages loosed themselves from their binding.“To love is to be selfless. Let me be selfless.”Honestly, there was a poignancy to the ending that I think would give a suitable finality to the story without reading the sequel. It stands alone really well, especially as a Labyrinth retelling. However, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t start the second book immediately after finishing the first.“Love is the bridge that spans the world above and below, and keeps the wheel of life turning.”So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Because I kept thinking the entire time about how much my younger self would have adored this book. While I really enjoyed it, dwelling on how much more I would have loved it 15 years ago was a constant distraction. But it also kept me reading. Adult Celeste might have wanted to roll her eyes at more melodramatic scenes, at the difficulty of communication and at some of the racier scenes. But the part of me that remembers being a teenager knew how much I would have loved everything about this book, including those parts, and so my enjoyment was expanded.“I am,” I said slowly, “a girl with music in her soul.”Wintersong is a beautiful, haunting story, and it’s exquisitely told. If you’re a fan of dark, dramatic, supernatural romances, you should pick this book up. And if you have a soft spot for Labyrinth, you’re seriously going to love this.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Dec 15, 2020","Dec 19, 2020","Dec 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24763621-wintersong

It seemed like every time I visited my grandparents, which was everyday, Jeopardy was on. It’s how I learnedJeopardy was a huge part of my childhood. It seemed like every time I visited my grandparents, which was everyday, Jeopardy was on. It’s how I learned to embrace my huge thirst for and retention of useless trivia. Because it’s not totally useless if it could potentially help you win on Jeopardy one day, right? It’s why the only team I joined in school was Quiz Bowl, and why Quiz Bowl captain was one of my favorite things to list on college applications. It’s part of the bond I share with the aforementioned grandparents, who are two of my favorite people on the planet. And Alex Trebek has been the face of it all for my entire life. News of his passing hit my family hard, as he felt more like a friend than a celebrity. He is mourned and will be deeply missed by legions, myself and those I love most among them.Celebrity memoirs aren’t something I generally gravitate toward, but I’m so glad to have read this one. Trebek wrote it in response to the outpouring of love and support he received after revealing his pancreatic cancer diagnosis. It’s his goodbye letter to the world, and it was incredibly poignant. For an additional gut punch, listen to the audiobook co-narrated by himself and Ken Jennings, Jeopardy’s longest reigning champion. Rarely do I consume a book in one sitting, but that’s what I did here. And I spend the majority of that time smiling, with tears threatening to fall at any moment.The first few chapters are standard memoir fare. We learn about Trebek’s childhood and school days, his family and his early career. We learn about his move to America and how that eventually led to his 36 years as the host of Jeopardy. We learn about the wife who he describes as the other half of his soul, and about the life they made together. He was a man with very little angst in his life, and you could feel his acknowledgement and appreciation of this fact through his writing.In the back half of the book, we are given anecdotes from Trebek’s time with Jeopardy. He tells us about some of the more memorable champions, about the mustache controversy, and about his thoughts on Will Ferrell’s impression of him on SNL. I loved getting these tidbits. I especially loved his chapter on Ken Jennings, and how he was unable to help developing a friendship with the man during Ken’s 74 episode winning streak. The mustache chapter made me legitimately laugh out loud.Mixed into both portions of the book were Trebek’s philosophical thoughts on life and the things he hoped we as a nation and as a world would improve upon. These were always kindly conveyed, and gave a sense of just how nice a man Trebek truly was. But the last few chapters, those detailing life with cancer and his last days, were what shattered my heart. Was this a literary work of genius? No. The writing was serviceable, but nothing special. What was special was the author, and his decision to share his story with the world before he was taken from us. I’m thankful to have been given a peek into the life he lived, the life that touched millions in ways he never understood. While I hope Jeopardy continues to educate and inspire for generations to come, it’ll never quite be the same.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Dec 11, 2020","Dec 14, 2020","Dec 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52854193-the-answer-is

This collection of graphic biographies takes 18 women who wrote and, in sets of three, seeks to illuminate their lives and motivations just the tiniest bit. I really like the way this is presented. Each author gets a page-long bio, followed by a short comic answering the titular question of why she wrote, and finished off with a list of published works and important facts. It reminded me of Rejected Princesses, though I can see where it would have even more in common with Monster, She Wrote, which I have yet to read. By presenting each writer as part of a loosely linked trio, we see how motivations can bind together even those who never met one another. Whether the wrote to explore the human condition, provide for their families, express themselves through a persona in ways they never could in their real lives, or make their voices heard as they fought for rights and freedoms, all of these women had compelling motivations for setting pen to page that still resonate today.I don’t believe I have ever read a graphic biography, and I very much enjoyed the ways in which the illustrations brought these women to life. The art was very well done and expressive. I found it incredibly tasteful. Also, the writing itself is lovely, without distracting from the lives and works being discussed. The information included was just enough to make me very interested in all of these women. By the time I read the final pages, I read more about all eighteen, and I wanted to read more of the things they wrote themselves.Some of the subjects are women I had never heard of, others about whom I thought I knew a good deal. It was interesting to see new facets to the latter and to be introduced to the former. There were motivations I wouldn’t have naturally considered without having read this collection. Some of these women were protecting their sexual identities for various reasons, or fighting the system to protect their rights to their own work. Reading about the drive all of these women had to put pen to page motivated me to write more myself.Why She Wrote is an insightful, encouraging, and empowering look into the lives of eight incredible female writers. While I truly believe this could be read and enjoyed by both sexes and almost any age bracket, I think this would make an exceptional gift for girl or woman over the age of ten or so. This would be an especially impactful gift for any young girl who dreams of becoming a writer.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 08, 2020","Dec 15, 2020","Dec 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55104100-why-she-wrote

Sometimes I’m able to guess the big twist or outcome or both within the first 100 pages, and then lose my patience with the rest of the narrative and the cast for not getting there faster. Sometimes the author includes wild twists for the sake of sensationalism that come out of left and field couldn’t have been predicted. Both types of mystery novels drive me a little crazy. The Guest List was neither of those. Told in a way that leaves you guessing without the sensationalism and populated with an interesting group of characters, I was invested through the final pages.“In my experience, those who have the greatest respect for the rules also take the most enjoyment in breaking them.”Foley has this narrative dexterity that vaguely brought to mind Agatha Christie if she wrote in 2020. The story is told via divided timeline, but that division is in actuality less than 48 hours. The narrative jumps back and forth between the immediate aftermath of something awful happening at a end of a wedding, though we don’t know what that something awful is, and the lead up to said wedding, starting the day prior. The leading-up portion of the book is where we spend most of our time, and where we get to know the main characters: Jules, the bride; Olivia, the bridesmaid; Johnno, the best man; Aoife, the wedding planner; and Hannah, the plus one. As we spend more time with these characters, learning their pain and fears and motivations, it becomes harder to predict who will be victim or perpetrator or neither. But everyone has a reason to want someone dead. The cast was compelling and pretty well balanced. In just about every character, there were attributes that made me like them and flaws that spoke of long-abiding inner demons. As the book moved into its fever pitch at the end, I truly didn’t know who would strike the killing blow. This varied, tortured, likable cast is the way in which this novel felt most reminiscent of Christie to me.“And I'm not worried about it being haunted. I have my own ghosts. I carry them with me wherever I go.” The wedding of Jules, a lifestyle magazine editor, and Will, the star of a survival show, is a big deal. Though the two aren’t massive celebrities, they’re famous enough to rate a fairy tale celebrity wedding on a secluded island. The guest list is exclusive, and it promises to be an event to remember. I loved the setting, a remote island off the coast of Ireland. It was moody and ominous and the perfect site for a mystery/thriller. The wedding part of the premise was fine, though I’m not a huge fan of stories in which the narrative hinges on a wedding. It’s a choice that feels overused to me, though Foley utilized it to great affect in this novel. Social media played a pretty large role in the lives of some of the characters, and there’s something about a strong inclusion of such things that I feel impedes novels like this from feeling potentially timeless, but that’s a personal opinion.“So to luck. And to making your own luck... or giving it a little helping hand, when it needs it.” I enjoyed The Guest List. I didn’t love it, and it wouldn’t have been my choice for mystery of the year. I think Stuart Turton’s The Devil and the Dark Water totally deserves that honor, in my eyes at least if not in the eyes of Goodreads. But I don’t regret picking it up, and I found it interesting enough to add more of Foley’s work to my TBR. If you’re looking for an atmospheric mystery set very much in today’s world, with an interesting cast and a plot that is neither too easy nor impossible to predict, The Guest List might be just what you’re craving.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 08, 2020","Dec 12, 2020","Dec 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51933429-the-guest-list

While erring on the side of silly, it was entertaining and absorbing. I listened with a smile on my face. This is one of those books I’m very glad to have gotten on audio. The names of characters and settings would have been impossible to wrap my head around otherwise. I was grateful to have someone pronouncing them for me, instead of being constantly distracted by my own poor internal attempts every time I stumbled across them in the text. Also, there is something about the story itself that lends itself incredibly well to an auditory experience. After all, the framework is that of an old woman telling the secrets of her life to a priest on her 99th birthday. That setup is perfect for an audiobook.My favorite thing about this novel is the setting. Early nineteenth-century Italy isn’t a setting that would usually grab me, but a large portion of this story took place in a remote mountain village that seemed happily adrift in time. It was utterly charming, and I would love to live in, or at least visit, such a place. The scenery was well described and sounded absolutely beautiful.The characters in this book were seriously wacky. Mariuccia, our perspective character, is grouchy in her elderly present and a snarky tomboy in her teenage past. I really liked her. And then there’s the Oracle herself. She just about defies description, but I enjoyed her immensely. The rest of the cast ranged from pleasant to amusingly antagonistic to downright silly. I did a lot of eye rolling and, even if entertaining, this all became a bit much after a while. I prefer my humor dry and in smaller doses than an entire novel, but it didn’t grate too terribly. Some of the voices the narrator chose for these more laughable characters might have been part of what made the story seem over-the-top, but said choices also did a lot to flesh out these characters. Saffron Henderson, the narrator, gave a great performance.While not perfect, The Oracle of Cumae was a fun read. The supernatural element was just enough to give the story a little extra kick, the characters were unique, and the setting was lovely.

I’ve read over 200 Nora Roberts novels, and yet every once in a while I will still read a synopsis for an upcoming novel of hers and decide that I’m not sure I’m going to love that one. So instead of preordering, like I generally do for her new releases, I place a hold with my library. That’s what I did with Legacy. And now I have to buy it anyway, because I loved it. Adrian Rizzo is among my favorite of Nora’s protagonists. We first meet her when she’s seven, and we follow her through her childhood and teenage years into adulthood. Her mother, Lena, is the founder and face of Yoga Baby, a fitness line specializing in workout videos. After Adrian’s biological father storms into her home and tries to kill Adrian for simply existing, Lena kills him in self defense. This notoriety blasts her already successful brand into a multi-million dollar corporation. As Adrian grows, we see her determination to forge her own path, even as it closely resembles her mother’s. I’m going to be honest here. One of the main reasons I didn’t expect to love this book was the choice of professions. Nora tends to give her characters interesting jobs and an entrepreneurial spirit, but I doubted her ability to make me care about the drive and ambition of someone who made fitness DVDs. I was wrong. I ended up being incredibly invested in every aspect of Adrian’s life, and that definitely includes her career. Adrian is strong and creative and driven and kind, and I thought Nora did a brilliant job balancing all of these attributes without making Adrian’s very existence seem improbable. I also really loved her friends, her grandparents, the town of Traveler’s Creek, and even the two adorable dogs whose love story is just about the sweetest thing I’ve ever read. And then there’s Raylan. He’s another fantastic, creative character. His arc differed greatly from most of Nora’s leading men. I can’t say a lot about his story without spoiling some important plot points, but I will say he’s a wonderful father and a truly gifted artist. Raylan writes and illustrates superhero graphic novels, which reminded me of the lead in another of Nora’s standalones, Tribute. But as that’s a profession I find fascinating, and as there were plenty of other traits to set the two men apart from one another, I didn’t mind the repetition. Something I’ve been loving for the past few years is Nora’s decision to veer away from her own template. Her early novels, while great, were indubitably formulaic, so much so that I could just about pinpoint at what percentage in the book the main characters would kiss for the first time, have sex for the first time, have a disagreement that seemed like a dealbreaker, and when they would face some kind of outside conflict that would cement their relationship. Obviously I didn’t mind this, as I read dozens upon dozens of these books, but her newer works are less predicable in this regard. I can still usually tell who the antagonist is far before the protagonist does, and I know that there will always be a romance for the main character and a happily ever after at the end of the story. But the actual pacing of each story is no longer identical, which has made for a more interesting reading experience. Not more enjoyable, but more interesting.I also love that Nora has been trying to incorporate more real-life issues into her novels. This book alone included elements like domestic violence, school shootings, stalking, and sex scandals between professors and students. Then there were broader themes, like dealing with grief and the different faces of parental relationships with children. I love that her work has gotten deeper while still staying true to her fans and delivering the kinds of stories that made so many readers fall in love with her books.I shouldn’t have been surprised by how much I loved Legacy, and yet here we are. Nora never disappoints. She’s been my go-to comfort author for over half of my life (?!) now, and I don’t see that changing for as long as she continues to publish. Her characters always win my heart, and I can always trust her to give me a happy ending. I have no doubt that I’ll be a faithful fan of hers until my dying day.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 02, 2021","Jun 04, 2021","Dec 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860458-legacy

The plot moves along quickly. Rustic noir isn’t a subgenre I’ve come across before, and that mixed with the slightly dystopian setting kept me interested. The writing was solid. Unfortunately, it left me dissatisfied.Our story takes place in near future in which a rural state has seceded from the Union and cut itself off from the rest of the US. Life here is very rural and agrarian, with a few small towns but no true urban areas. The people who live here have a hard life, but most consider the hardship worth the preported freedom they claim. This could be an idyllic culture if not for the drugs and the infighting said drugs bring with them. It’s essential a technologically deficient microcosm of the world in which we live.I’m a sucker for well crafted rural settings, and that is to me Foster’s greatest strength in this book. She imbued the story with a very strong sense of place, and that is a large part of why I kept reading even when annoyed by other elements of the book. I could feel the cold and the wet, and I could see how it balanced with the beautiful. I love the dichotomy between danger and beauty that so defines nature in my mind, and that was well presented here.The plot itself is an interesting one. Brooke, a wife and mother with a lot of skeletons in her closet, finds an enemy from her past hiding on her family’s farm. Terror and greed have her capturing said enemy and taking him to the outside world, where she can claim the bounty federal agents have placed on his head. The bounty is enough to give her and her family a fresh start somewhere new. The problem is, she’s hidden her past so well that her family doesn’t see why they could possibly need a fresh start. Brooke’s husband and children know nothing of her past, and can’t understand the person she has morphed into since discovering their trespasser.And now we come to my problem with the novel: Brooke. Honestly, I had issues with all of the characters, and found the characterization to be the least believable and most obnoxious element of the story. The entire plot could’ve been resolved in 20 pages had Brooke actually communicated with ANYONE. She guarded her secrets like priceless jewels and then, when that decision endangered everyone and everything she loved, she seemed blindsided by it. What did you expect, Brooke?! TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND, BROOKE. Seriously every single problem in this book could have been solved by open and honest conversation. It drove me insane.I think The Captive is going to be a popular book, especially for those who like their thrillers with unreliable narrators à la Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train. The dystopian rural noir setting is an unusual one, and it’s what drew me to the book in the first place and kept me reading. But if failures to communicate serving as the driving force behind a plot make you crazy, maybe skip this one.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 05, 2020","Dec 07, 2020","Dec 05, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/50209357-the-captive

Incredibly reminiscent of books about the lives of Catholic saints, but with more of a fairytale feel, I found the collection charming.  I loved the combination of religious and fantastical. The stories are formulaic in the best sense of the word. A collection like this in the real world is supposed to be for spiritual edification first and entertainment second, so I can only assume that’s the feel that Bardugo was going for. However, these were far from dry, and were without a doubt entertaining. The saints presented in the collection were wonderfully varied, though most of the tales adhered to one common trope or another. There were pious youths who find themselves persecuted, superstitious citizens who killed what they didn’t understand, cowards who took their blessings so much for granted that they refused to protect them, and greedy nobles who insisted on draining a gift completely dry. The inclusion of these tropes imbued the collection with a timeless quality that reminded me of Foxe’s Book of Martyrs. Even the cover art hearkens back to Butler’s Lives of the Saints.Honestly, I haven’t read most of the Grishaverse books. My sister-in-law has read them all and loves them. The only one I’ve read is Six of Crows, which I enjoyed. But, while I have yet to return to Bardugo’s world, it has always been my intention. I thought this audiobook would be a perfect way to dip my toe back into the Grisha waters, so to speak. The Lives of Saints is a book that features in the main series, and I love when authors pull out fictional things like this from their world building and make them real.  At 128 pages in physical and a little over 2 hours in audio, it’s a very fast read. The audio version is narrated by Lauren Fortgang and Ben Barnes. BEN BARNES. I usually try to always read things in publication order, but BEN BARNES, Y’ALL. Both narrators did an impeccable job conveying these short stories.While I thoroughly enjoyed the audio, I was very glad to have a digital copy on my phone because the illustrations were gorgeous. There’s something about being read to while also reading the words yourself that reminds me of fairy tales from my childhood, which did nothing but improve my experience with this book. I have no doubt that The Lives of Saints will be a 5 star read for those who are already enraptured with the Grishaverse.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 04, 2020","Dec 08, 2020","Dec 04, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54339142-the-lives-of-saints

And there’s nothing cozier in my opinion than a literary mystery. Any time a book or an author takes centerstage in a plot, I’m excited. That excitement often leaves me disappointed, as I tend to expect too much of these books for some reason. But sometimes I get my hands on a book that delivers. Escaping Dreamland is one such book. This is the first Charlie Lovett novel I’ve read, but it certainly won’t be my last.I loved the dual timeline here. In 2010, we are slowly learning the story of an author, and what a lost children’s adventure series from the 1900s meant to him, his father, and his grandfather. In the early 1900s, we meet the three authors behind this series and see how their lives became intertwined. While the 2010 timeline was plenty interesting, and is where the mystery element of the novel came in, the historical portions of the book were what kept drawing me back to the story. The historical half of Escaping Dreamland was transportive and believable and captivating. The level of legwork and research that goes into a story like this is astounding, and it was evident that Lovett cut no corners in this regard. From what I gather, this degree of meticulous research is present in every single one of his novels, which is both respectable and very exciting. I loved learning about the publishing world of the early 1900s, especially as it dealt with children’s fiction. Learning more about how these famous series came to be was fascinating, though I must confess that the fictional series at the center of Lovett’s novel sound much more multifaceted and unique than Nancy Drew or The Hardy Boys.While Escaping Dreamland was very interesting, I can’t say it was exactly enthralling. Even when important things were happening, I felt very little tension from the story. This is in large part why I’m not giving it a full five star rating. I think this is in large part due to Lovett’s style, which has a gentle quality to it, though I can’t say that for sure without having ever read any of his other work. While I was never on the edge of my seat, I was always deeply invested. And when you’re on the hunt for something comforting, that’s not necessarily a bad reading experience to have.I very much enjoyed my time in Escaping Dreamland. There were certain sections that dragged, and others that felt rushed. But, for the most part, this was a fun, entertaining reading experience with the added bonus of introducing me to a new author whose backlog I’m excited to explore. If you’re an audio reader, Mike Lenz does a great job narrating the audiobook. And if you’re a fan of books about books, historical fiction, and mysteries, I think you’re going to love this story.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 02, 2020","Dec 04, 2020","Dec 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52506812-escaping-dreamland

Featuring a stellar cast, a rich and atmospherThe Devil and the Dark Water is a wonderful spin on a nautical mystery in the style of Sherlock Holmes. Featuring a stellar cast, a rich and atmospheric setting, chilling brushes with the supernatural and a grippingly paced plot, this was everything one could possibly hope for from a mystery novel. I found it incredibly clever, satisfyingly twisty and deliciously suspenseful. And it had an ending I didn’t see coming. Honestly, I couldn’t ask for more.“Questions are swords and answers are shields… I’m begging you, armor yourself.”Our story is set in 1634 on the Saardam, a merchant ship leaving Batavia (Jakarta) for Amsterdam. The cast of characters aboard the Saardam is oozing with personality. Every character was fascinating, and many of them tended to be both multifaceted and simultaneously a caricature of some sort. Even the most horrid of characters had redeeming qualities in at least one other character’s eyes. My favorite character was Arent Hayes, hands down. He’s fiercely loyal, good to the core, willing to get his hands dirty to protect others, and far more intelligent than he believes himself to be. But there were other characters, like Sara and Lia and Sammy, who were surprisingly full of depth and who I desperately wanted to learn more about. I would actually love to read a followup book featuring the further adventures of a handful of these characters, should Turton choose to revisit them.“Courage isn’t the absence of fear… It’s the light we find when fear is all there is.”I love the relationship between Samuel Pipps and Arent Hayes. Their friendship reminded me strongly of Holmes and Watson, even though they as individuals are radically different from the aforementioned duo. The closeness of their relationship and their fraternal love for one another, though, bear a strong resemblance to Holmes and Watson. “He’d always believed miracles were what happened when you finally ran out of hope. They were bits of luck, polished until they gleamed, delivered exactly as you needed them.”While reading, I was strongly reminded of The Hound of the Baskervilles in multiple ways. Firstly, the the duality of wondering if the supernatural is real and to blame, or if the entire supernatural element is a mask behind which the true action is hiding, is a consuming question. Secondly, the famous detective who is supposed to answer all of our questions is off screen for the majority of the narrative, as Sherlock is in Baskervilles. I found The Devil and the Dark Water even more satisfying than The Hound of the Baskervilles, which is incredibly high praise as it’s one of my favorite stories in the Holmes canon. Doyle very much knew what he was doing, but Turton took note and ran with it. “Guilt was like dirt. It got under the skin and didn’t come clean. It made people second guess everything that was done, find fault where there was none and imagine mistakes that weren’t made.”Besides the beautifully balanced, unpredictable mystery and the highly well-developed characters, my favorite element of the novel was Turton’s writing. The man has an incredible way with words, and yet there’s not an ounce of pretension or smugness to his prose. It’s never flowery, but it’s always resonant. There were quite a few turns of phrases that I had to annotate simply because they were so well worded. As a side note, the author’s afterword at the end of the novel, in which he apologizes to history and ships for the liberties he takes with them, is absolutely delightful and gave me an even greater appreciation for Turton as an author. “Some songs weren’t mere songs. They were memories curled tight and set alight.”I liked The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, but I didn’t love it. I’m not sure I would have given The Devil and the Dark Water a chance had it not been for the promise of “Sherlock Holmes on the high seas” and the glowing  of my co-blogger Emma, who also gifted me a stunning hardcover copy with sprayed red edges and creepy eyes. I’m so glad she gave TS and I this gift, and that the two of us and Eon decided to read it together, because this book blew Turton’s first novel out of the water. No pun intended. The Devil and the Dark Water has earned its spot on the shelf with Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie. It’s one of my favorite books of the year, and one of my favorite mysteries I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading.

I read the O.G. of the genre, The Secret History, for the first time at the beginning of this year. I can’t believe I waited so long to read it, but it immediately became an instant favorite. I also adore any book that delves deeply into religion or philosophy or, even better, the intersection of both. David Hopen managed to combine both the academic setting and the religious contemplation that I love so much in his debut(!!) novel, The Orchard.“God is someone—something—we’ll always need. He is the adversary against which we rage and the comfort for which we yearn.”My knee-jerk response to this story when I started getting into it was to affix a label to it. The Secret History: Jewish Orthodox Edition. But that would be doing Hopen’s book a huge disservice, as it was much more deliberate and original than such a label could convey. This is the tale of Ari Eden, a teenage Jew raised in a deeply Orthodox small community in Brooklyn, and how radically his life changes when his family moves to a much richer and more laid back Jewish community in Florida. We see the internal struggle between upbringing and peer pressure, personal integrity and curiosity. And through it all, the narrative is deeply tied up in questions of God’s identity, of how best to experience His presence. I found the dichotomy better this search and more normal teenaged angst fascinating. “There are ways to find strength within faith, even when faith is shattered, even when faith reduces, at best, to doubt.”Ari and the group of friends into which he somehow stumbles did remind me very much of The Secret History. That dynamic, as well as their group’s special relationship with an educational authority figure, were half of where I found similarities between that novel and this one. The other big correlation was the group’s pursuit of divine knowledge by, pardon the wordplay, unorthodox means. But the trappings of an exclusive Jewish Orthodox high school versus a nameless Ivy League were pretty radically different, though this was the least YA cast of teenagers in tone of writing I’ve ever come across. The religiosity of both school and extracurricular life is very unusual for an outsider. I was raised in a deeply Christian household, and yet I was blown away by how radically every aspect of life was dictated by beliefs, and how easily some members of the community ignored those dictates while others took them very much to heart. I learned an incredible amount about a culture I thought I knew. Another big difference between Ari and Richard, the perspective character in The Secret History, is that Ari struck me as far more three-dimensional. I believe Richard was intentionally crafted to seem almost flat in comparison to those around him, so that is in no way a slight. I just found Ari more sympathetic and compelling in his own right.“Do you know what they want out of me? Harmless perfection. Normal extraordinariness.”If you loved The Secret History but thought it could use more Talmud and philosophical discussions about God, The Orchard is the book for you. But despite my inability to discuss one without the other, I do truly believe that two novels, though both exquisite, are worlds apart. Hopen’s debut is a gorgeously written, lovingly crafted work of art that I believe will find a devoted, and hopefully huge, following. It stretched my mind in the best of ways.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 23, 2020","Nov 29, 2020","Nov 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51475363-the-orchard

There are some big issues in this book. Unfortunately, they’re mostly hinted at without being properly addressed. While the mystery was vaguely interesting, the main draw of the story for me was the bookshop, as well as the bakery. Both had just a touch of magical realism to them, and strangely I found the shops as entities more intriguing than their owners, two of the four main characters of the book. While the characters were fun on paper, so to speak, they were far from three-dimensional. I think this is in large part due to the writing. The dialogue was almost painfully trite. The author tried for casual but was unsuccessful, coming across instead as forced. I very much liked what the author had to say about the power of books and how important they are to the lives of readers, I enjoyed the characters even if they weren’t believable, and the plot didn’t drag. But I don’t think this is a series I’ll be returning to.

At the moment, it’s also Rhythm of War is hands down my favorite book of the year, and I’ve read some truly incredible books over the course of 2020. At the moment, it’s also my favorite fantasy book I’ve ever read. That title has been held by The Name of the Wind for over a decade, but in Rhythm of War Sanderson has usurped it. Humans are a poem. A song.For ones so soft, they are somehow strong.For ones so varied, they are somehow intense.For ones so lost, they are somehow determined.For ones so confused, they are somehow brilliant.For ones so tarnished, they are somehow bright.Radiant.The thing that sets Sanderson apart from other fantasy authors in my mind is his phenomenal world building. There is no other author who can evoke such vibrant and absorbing images in my mind as I read. When I pick up a Sanderson book, I feel like it completely transports me, and like the real world doesn’t exist while I’m nestled between the pages. His worlds are so tangible and easy to visualize, and no world exemplifies this better than Roshar. Sanderson is also exceptional at crafting magic systems. Every single magic system in his Cosmere is captivating and cinematic, which is doubly true for the Stormlight Archive seeing as the magic system varies so vastly from person to person. There’s a science and a method to each system that makes them believable. Even with the magic system of Roshar, which seems almost religious in nature, there are rules that make sense.“We need to remember the past.. We need to remember what we passed through to get here.”Character development is yet another area in which Sanderson truly excels. So much of the plot in this installment revolved around divided minds. Whether that divide is between light and dark, or intellect and emotion, or the division involves hiding from the truth or the past behind a self-created fiction, almost every perspective character is dealing with an internal division of some sort. Some of these struggles are more evident and dramatic than others, for sure, but a giant part of the development for any of these characters is learning to forgive themselves and accept themselves.“Some people charged toward the goal, running for all they had. Others stumbled. But it wasn’t the speed that mattered.It was the direction they were going.”I love what Sanderson conveys through his characters about the differences between empathy and sympathy. Even when we can’t understand what someone we love is going through, such as clinical depression or another mental struggle, we can still have empathy. We can still care deeply and be there for them without being able to grasp what they’re feeling. He also reminds us of the importance of having that kind of empathy for ourselves. We’re always our own worst critics, and the characters in this series exemplify that. “Had she done harm without realizing it? Possibly. Had she made mistakes? Certainly. But she’d been trying to help. That was her journey.”Rhythm of War also deftly addresses inclusion and prejudice. Whatever our differences physiologically, ideologically, or psychologically, we should still be able to respect one another and treat one another with dignity. Common ground is great when it can be found, and I think it should carry far more weight than our divisions. But common ground shouldn’t be necessary for us to treat other people like, well, people. That comes into play a good deal in this story. “No one ever accomplished anything by being content with who they were… We accomplish greta things by reaching toward who we could become.”Honestly, there is an astonishing amount of philosophy woven into this entire series, and that makes the entirety of it more meaningful to me. The blending of philosophy, religion, and science in this particular installment is absolutely fascinating. The character development is second to none, the world building is insane, the pacing is solid and the action sequences are captivating. These are all building blocks of a great fantasy series. But that extra deep dive into the crossroads of science and religion? The graceful handling of mental illness and societal failings in a way that never weighs down the story itself? Those elements are what lift Stormlight Archive from great into the realm of near perfection, in my eyes.“Never underestimate the strength of a soldier trained to stand fast.”“Never underestimate the simple intimidating force of a man who won’t back down.”“Never underestimate the worth of being willing to hold. Your. GROUND.”Music is and has always been my thing. I’m insanely bookwormy, but if I had to define myself to quickly to others, I would call myself a musician first and a reader second. Melody and lyrics are the ways in which I most capably express myself. Because of this, I should have been more excited than I was about Rhythm of War based on the title alone. But I thought I knew what that title referenced and, while ecstatic to revisit the world and characters I have come to love with my entire heart, there was something about that title that dampened my enthusiasm just the tiniest bit. I should have known better. Sanderson completely surprised me in the best way when it became time to reveal the source of the title. That particular element of the plot is in large part why this is now my favorite Stormlight novel. I can’t say anything more about it without spoiling what I view as an incredibly important plot point. What I will say is, if you’re someone whose life has been defined by music, there’s going to be some special resonance here for you.“What is a secret but a surprise to be discovered?”Sanderson fans have coined the term “Sanderlanche” to describe the insane epicness of how he brings all of his plot points together. There were multiple little Sanderlanches mixed into this book, and each and every one of them was incredible. Every single one packed a huge emotional punch that I found very, very satisfying. Then there was the giant Sanderlanche. I lost so much sleep, y’all. I read the last 300 or so pages in one sitting because I was physically incapable of putting it down. It was almost infuriatingly good. I’m constantly blown away by Sanderson’s imagination, work ethic, and craftsmanship.“Our weakness doesn’t make us weak. Our weakness makes us strong. For we had to carry it all these years.”If you’re invested (ha) in the Cosmere, this book is going to bring you a little something extra. In the pages of Rhythm of War, various stands of the Cosmere start tying together. I found this almost as exciting as the plot and character development. However, if you’re not caught up on the Cosmere and have only read the Stormlight Archive, you’re still going to be able to enjoy this without feeling lost. But if you’re a lover of Easter egg hunting in your media consumption, you’re in for some serious fun.“Honor is not dead so long as he lives in the hearts of men!”In my opinion, there has never been a better time in the history of publishing to be a fantasy fan. And for me personally, that is in large part due to Brandon Sanderson. His work captivates and inspires me so much, and I can’t wait to see where he takes his readership next. Is it too soon to start counting down the days until Book 5? But in the meantime, I’ll be reading whatever he puts out and rereading what he’s already given us. If you’re looking to escape from reality for a while, and would prefer to do so in a way that will lift you up emotionally and feed your soul, there’s no author I’d rather recommend.

That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.” I love how so many strands of this accidental hostage situation tie back to a suicide that happened ten years prior. You see how every person, even those at the end of their metaphorical rope, and every action, even the suicide of a stranger, have a much greater, farther reaching impact than we ever imagine. The way these people, who didn’t know one another but whose lives had been touched by the aforementioned suicide, find their lives intersecting reminded me very much of the movie Crash.“The truth of course is that if people really were as happy as they look on the Internet, they wouldn’t spend so much damn time on the Internet, because no one who’s having a really good day spends half of it taking pictures of themselves. Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s probably because it’s full of shit.”The cast of characters could not have been more varied. And I was rooting for every single one of them. I didn’t find them realistic, per se, but I did find them all so adorable in their own ways that I wish they existed. This book addresses so many different types of love, as well as the characters’ worthiness of those loves, and I was moved by them. I love books that make me laugh while also making my heart hurt and my brain work, and this did all of those things in such a way that consuming it was effortless. There’s something to be said for easy books that still manage to feed you. Anxious People is one of those.“Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.” All in all, Anxious People is a delightfully heartwarming read that felt very applicable to the times in which we’re living. By the final chapters, the story ended up feeling like a hug made of words. It was sweet and hopeful and just what I needed.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Nov 11, 2020","Nov 16, 2020","Nov 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49127718-anxious-people

Despite all of the new plot points and the expansion of the magic system, it felt just a touch stale.

I’ve always had a lot of respect for our military, and for the people who sacrifice their time, dreams, bodies, and lives in its service. I also have a lot of empathy for the family of those who serve, as I can’t even begin to imagine how terrifying it must be to watch someone you love with your entire being fly into a war zone, and how insanely stressful it must be to wait and hope for their return. But this book has increased all of those feelings for me. Witnessing military life from the inside, from the perspectives of three girls as they graduate high school, attend West Point, and embark on their careers thereafter, made for a moving and eye-opening experience. “Some wounds are invisible. It doesn't mean they're not real.”The trio of protagonists are all three very different girls with very different motivations: Dani is hyper-competitive, Avery desperately wants to prove her worth, and Hannah has this deep desire to serve. The three girls share two things: a love of basketball and an insane drive to be the very best they can be, whatever their motivations may be. I shouldn’t have favorites, but it was impossible for me not to fall in love with Hannah. Avery had my sympathy, and Dani was engaging, but Hannah is one of the purest, sweetest souls I’ve ever come across. The fact that she chose the Army as her way to serve somehow only reinforced that purity. She was in no way naive or weak, but her strength was laced with this intentional innocence that I adored. Hannah’s faith reminded me so much of high school Celeste. It’s fierce and wholesome and something I wish I could recapture. I think this is why I love Hannah so much: she helps me recapture that fresh faith while I’m with her. Also, her love story was incredibly joyful and so sweet to experience alongside her.“If you think you're important, if you feel that your life matters, all you need to do is spend some time in nature, Hannah thought. Stand before an ocean. Climb a mountain. Stare out over a canyon. Creation--wild and untamed--reminded her of her size in this universe. But feeling small did not send her into despair. She was like a child, trusting her Father when He said the storm would pass.”Speaking of faith, that was probably my favorite element of the novel. This is not Christian fiction, but it spoke more honestly of the faith I hold and had more spiritual resonance than almost anything I’ve read in that genre. The way Christianity is presented in the lives of those who adhere to it in the novel is raw and honest and real in a way I’ve seldom seen in fiction. Or even nonfiction, actually. The questions of the nonbelievers were never belittled or shrugged off. The faith of the believers in this book feels sincere and like an integral part of their characters. In the face of the grief that comes in the back third of the novel (which you know is coming from the first chapter), this faith could have seemed trite or brittle. But it never did. You can still believe in God with your whole heart while feeling betrayed by Him, and that angry faith felt incredibly valid in light of what they were going through. And then there’s Wendy. I want to be her when I go up. She was the surrogate mom for the girl’s basketball team while our three protagonists were at West Point, and she’s one of the most loving, welcoming, dependable women I’ve ever read. And her faith is insanely strong. She shares this faith constantly without ever once preaching at others. Sometimes the ways she shares this faith is with a Bible on her lap, and sometimes it’s serving meals without expecting a word of thanks, or letting someone cry on her shoulder without offering the empty platitudes that most of us can’t keep from falling off our tongues in such situations. Her faith and the way it oozes from her is something I desperately want. And her willingness to admit that she doesn’t have the answers is so respectable. Upon finishing the novel, I discovered that the author had based this character after her mother, who had served in a similar capacity when the author’s father was stationed at and teaching classes for West Point, which made the characters and setting even more poignant.“Maybe faith was having the humility to scream at God and the audacity to get up off the floor.”  About that setting. The first chunk of this novel is technically a campus story. I’ve never read a campus novel quite like this one. West Point is fascinating. It’s so far removed from other universities. The lack of frats and parties and pajama-clad upperclassmen, mixed with the academic and physical rigor expected from every single student, was such a departure from every other college campus I’ve encountered in real life or literature. I loved getting to learn more about it and follow Dani, Avery, and Hannah around through their time there, but I freely admit that I would have never been able to hack it.“I wanted perfection. But it turns out, here on earth, we don't get perfection; we get people.”Besides the characters, the faith element, and the setting, the other main building block of this novel was grief, and how you deal with it. I’ve read some fantastic books that deal with grief in ways that felt honest and insightful, but this one tops all of those. Gibson presents grief in such a raw, brutally honest way, and her representation of how her characters dealt with that grief, and how that varied among them, was masterful. I also really appreciated that the reader knows from the first 5 pages of the book that something terrible has happened. This made the grief, when it finally came, feel less like something inserted from shock value and sensationalism. This writing decision gave the intense sadness more honesty and resonance.“She felt like a part of her body had been ripped off. The fact that everyone didn't stare seemed absolutely impossible. How could a loss that big be that invisible?”I also have to talk about the writing itself. I find it almost impossible to believe that this is a debut novel. The prose is fantastic, and the Gibson managed to perfectly balance lovely writing, intensely deep character development, engaging plot, and thoughtful contemplations on philosophy and faith. Not only was I never once bored, I highlighted probably a quarter of the text. I annotated so much, in fact, that digging through and narrowing down the quotes I wanted to include was crazy difficult. I’m blown away by how polished and powerful and purposeful Gibson was able to make every single chapter of this novel.“Love starts in the body. It starts with the tingling of toes and the rushing of blood and the lightness in the head. It feels a lot like pain… There are convulsions, nausea, heartburn, and breathlessness. There is a physical ache you feel when you're falling in love. It's your heart making room for someone else, like a gardener is there, digging out a hole for a new plant. There is pain, and there is fear. The fear that the hole might stay forever.”I would have never guessed that a novel about West Point and military life would end up as one of my favorite novels of the year. It’s the 130th book I’ve read in 2020 and, as of this moment, it’s second only to Ghosts of Harvard. And it’s a pretty close second. It made me think and feel deeply after months of being emotionally and intellectually numbed by real life events. I also finished reading this on Veteran’s Day, which made both the day and the book stand out more in my mind. Beyond the Point is a gorgeous novel that I can’t wait to share with my family.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 05, 2020","Nov 12, 2020","Nov 05, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37959896-beyond-the-point

A fun romp through the world of fairy tales. I do, however, think this book veers more toward being a children’s book than middle grade. For instance, the Percy Jackson books are in a completely different league, with much more complex themes and deeper character development, even in the first book. The Pages & Co. novels are breezier, more about tipping the hat to classic children’s tales while at the same time turning said stories on their heads. I love how this book in particular addresses gender roles in fairy tales, and how obnoxious those are. The prose might be simplistic, but that’s part of the beauty of these books. Children as young as six or so could enjoy them as readily as an older child or even an adult like myself. They’d make great read-alouds, but I’ve enjoyed myself immensely simply reading them on my own.

It’s not one commonly listed as a favorite, or even mentioned that frequently from among his works. I can’t say I would’ve thought to pick it up had I not been so invested in the extended reading list for the Dark Tower. But it was next on that list, so I found myself a copy. Now I’m incredibly glad I picked it up. Though not perfect, Rose Madder is now one of my favorite King novels outside of The Stand and the main Dark Tower series. Talk about a protagonist you can root for.“It ain't the blows we're dealt that matter, but the ones we survive.” Rose Daniels has had enough. After 14 years of extreme spousal abuse at the hands of her policeman husband, one drop of blood on a bed sheet is her catalyst for leaving this horrible half-life she’s been living and starting over somewhere new. Now Rosie is finally embarking on a life of her own, for the first time in her adult life. And it’s absolutely wonderful. But Norman Daniels refuses to let his wife go. He’s going to track her down. And when he finds her, he’s going to talk to her. Talk to her right up close. And he plans on it being the last conversation Rose ever has. However, there are odd powers at work here, and Norman is going to find this plan much more difficult to carry out than he ever imagined.“The concept of dreaming is known to the waking mind but to the dreamer there is no waking, no real world, no sanity; there is only the screaming bedlam of sleep.”Norman might just be the most despicable fictional character in the history of fiction.  He’s one of the most disturbed, chauvinistic, narcissistic, deranged excuse for a human being in whose head I’ve ever had the displeasure of being. I found him appalling. But Rose, on the other hand, is possibly the best female character King has ever created. She feels incredibly real, and both her hopes and her terrible fears rang very true. The way she grows over the course of the novel made me want to cheer. Her resilience and optimism is inspiring.“It's best to be ruthless with the past.” While I developed some deep feelings regarding both protagonist and antagonist, what really sold me on this book was the horror element. I’ve read a lot of King by this point, including most of his horror classics like The Shining and IT and ‘Salem’s Lot and Pet Sematary. There are portions of Rose Madder that I truly believe are just as freaky and disturbing as the aforementioned books. And the horror here felt different and original in ways that resonated with me. I won’t soon be forgetting the source of the novel’s title, or why there’s a bull skull on the cover.“That’s really all art is about, I think, and not just pictures—it’s the same with books and stories and sculpture and even castles in the sand. Some things call to us, that’s all. It’s as if the people who made them were speaking inside our heads.”I could never call King or his work underrated. But I do think Rose Madder deserves more attention than it gets. I loved seeing the ways in which it’s going to tie into the Tower, but even outside of those connections I found it a fantastic book. The only reason it’s a 4.5 star read for me instead of a full 5 is because Norman’s head was such a vile place to be, even though, thankfully, his perspective chapters were fewer and shorter than Rosie’s. Rose Madder is a great horror-laced thriller that will be in my head for a long time to come.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Oct 31, 2020","Nov 05, 2020","Oct 31, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27877126-rose-madder

Not as sharp and snappy as a short story, but without as much room for deep dives into development as novels, it can be a difficult and strangely unwieldy medium, for both author and audience. That being said, novellas can also pack an incredible amount of power into a scant few pages when done correctly. It’s a medium full of both promise and pitfalls. In the case of Tower of Mud and Straw, I think that the promise is that Barsukov himself shows a lot of promise as an author, and the main pitfall is the lack of development that would have deepened the story he penned.Tower of Mud and Straw is Barsukov’s debut solo work. He’s had multiple short stories published in genre magazines, and it’s obvious that these publications gave him a great place to practice his craft before setting out on his own. The writing is impressively tight and polished for a debut. There were places where the tone felt a bit dissonant, such as within the main character’s inner conversations with his deceased sister. But for the most part, the prose was concise without being terse, smart if not exactly snappy. Shea Ashcroft is being sent by the Queen to oversee the construction of the gargantuan Tower she has commanded be built. He’s not sure if this is punishment or reward but, either way, he’s not happy about it. When he discovers how unstable the Tower is, and that dangerous alien tech is being used in the construction, his job becomes a lot more complicated than he anticipated. I found Shea to be an interesting character who could have been far more compelling had he been given more time to develop, but this lack made his motivations ephemeral and seemingly ever-changing to the point that he wasn’t relatable, which was a bit frustrating. As it stands with this novella, I found both characters and world building promising but ultimately unsatisfying because of the lack of any deep, meaningful development. There’s a lot of promise that could be explored, but that exploration didn’t take place within the pages of this particular book.Barsukov’s debut novella is a very intriguing look into a world that I hope will be further explored. I couldn’t help being reminded of Josiah Bancroft’s Books of Babel series to begin with, as both books involve the Tower of Babel in a somewhat steampunk setting, but Barsukov was able to infuse a lot of originality into a short page count, and the two works eventually diverged in my mind. I’ll definitely be interested to see what Barsukov does next.Expected publication date for Tower of Mud and Straw: February 21, 2021Tower of Mud and Straw is not available for preorder, but you can find a link to part on on the author’s website here, as well as any upcoming news about publication.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 30, 2020","Nov 02, 2020","Oct 30, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/55236234-tower-of-mud-and-straw

Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?” This is the premise of The Midnight Library, Matt Haig’s newest novel. I’ve never read anything by Haig before this book, but I can guarantee that this oversight will be addressed. Because The Midnight Library was wonderful. There’s incredible philosophical depth packed into relatively few pages. And for a book that begins with a suicide attempt, it ended up being surprisingly positive and uplifting. Not only is it a thoughtful novel, it inspired deep contemplation within the reader, but in a way that is comfortingly gentle for the times in which we’re living.“Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when was the door closed and locked behind you.” Nora Seed doesn’t matter. Not to any single person on the face of the earth. At least, that’s what she thinks. When this belief leads her to the decision to end her own life, she finds herself caught between life and death in the Midnight Library. This library contains every single life she could have possibly led had she made even the slightest of different decisions. If she can find the perfect life among the stacks before midnight ends, she can keep it. But if she’s still undecided when the clock begins to tick once more, the Midnight Library will burn to ash, taking every perspective life, and Nora herself, along with it.“The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.”I loved accompanying Nora on each of her journeys. Not so much because they were adventures, though some of them were, but because I really enjoyed witnessing her growth. As she tackled her regrets, she slowly and sometimes painfully changed both her worldview and her opinion of herself and her worth. It was such an encouraging transformation, and reminded me more than a little of It’s a Wonderful Life. She's more important than she knows, and every decision she's ever made has rippled out to touch others. “And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.” If given the same opportunity Nora has, would you try on different lives in hopes of finally finding one that fits? My knee-jerk response would be a unequivocal yes. But upon further reflection, I don’t think I would actually take that plunge. While I might not be the rock star or author or professor I dreamed of becoming as a child, those possibilities still live within me, and will until I draw my final breath. What I wouldn’t change for the world are the relationships I have. I’ve been blessed with an insanely fun marriage to my best friend, a tight-knit family, and some wonderful friendships. Any different path I might have taken could have radically altered any of those relationships. I honestly believe that it wouldn’t be worth the risk. Instead, I can take those relationships and the potential I know lives within me and make more of an effort to make one or more of my own dreams come true. The worst that could happen is that I fail and end up back where I started. What would I have lost? Absolutely nothing but the fear that kept me from trying in the first place, the loss of which would actually be worth failing in order to attain.“Sometimes just to say your own truth out loud is enough to find others like you.”Any work of fiction that can move its readers to reevaluate their own lives and try a little harder has accomplished something incredible. And if the book can do so in a way that is gentle and comforting instead of shaming in any way, that’s truly something special. Matt Haig gives us something that special with The Midnight Library. I can see this being a book I reread whenever life starts feeling like it isn’t worth the trouble. The Midnight Library is hope and potential and solace all packed into one slim book. Read it. Press it into the hands of anyone you know that might be struggling. Let it comfort and inspire you.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Oct 27, 2020","Oct 30, 2020","Oct 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library

Had I read the book in any other stage in my life, I think I would have been able to divorce myself more easily from it and enjoy it more. However, everyone knows this year has been horrendous, and for some reason I was just unable to cope with the relentless hard knocks suffered by the poor protagonist. There was something about the bright tone of the book that made those blows even more terrible, and that’s what kept the novel from being a five star read for me. It was emotionally draining.“Words define us, they explain us, and, on occasion, they serve to control or isolate us. But what happens when words that are spoken are not recorded? What effect does that have on the speaker of those words?”I love the idea behind The Dictionary of Lost Words.  After reading The Surgeon of Crowthorne, titled The Professor and the Madman in the U.S., Williams found herself intrigued by the history of the Oxford English Dictionary. But she walked away from the reading experience with more questions than answers, especially regarding the lack of female involvement in the OED endeavor. If there were so few women involved, could it be that words mostly used by the under-represented sex were left out? What about words mostly used by other marginalized groups? Were words considered vulgar or distasteful purposely ignored, as well? We know what is present in the OED, but what words were left on the cutting room floor is a mystery. And even for words that do appear in the OED, what meanings were omitted? Over the course of her research, Williams compiled what little information she could on the few women involved in the project, and decided to pen a work of fiction addressing her thoughts about some of these questions, and included as much true information as she could. “Words are like stories… They change as they are passed from mouth to mouth; their meanings stretch or truncate to fit what needs to be said.”The fictional character who is the protagonist of the story and the lens through which Williams conveys her questions is Esme, a girl whose father worked on the OED project. Esme was raised in the Scriptorium, the small workshop where the Dictionary was compiled. Words and their meanings were her obsession from a very early age, and it was wonderful to see how that love grew and changed as she herself did. But it seemed to me that the author piled way too much tragedy onto her. I know life was terribly difficult for women during the period in which this book is set, and that such suffering would have seemed minimal compared to what other women endured in reality. However, I didn’t go into this book expecting that level of heartache. Perhaps if I had, I would have engaged with the story in a much different way. But for some reason I expected charming and light, I ended up feeling blindsided.“… words are meaningless without action.”“And sometimes action can make a lie of good words.”Even though I was emotionally unprepared for Esme’s story, I was completely captivated by her views on words and their importance. She felt that her calling was to preserve the words that others felt were unimportant, and I loved getting her inner thoughts regarding her motivations and why she loves words so fervently. I’ve always been enamored by words, and it was really gratifying to be inside the mind of someone who shares that passion. I thought she and her passion were very well conveyed, and I really enjoyed her as a character.“What words would define me? Which would be used to judge or contain?”The Dictionary of Lost Words is a beautiful treatise on the importance of all words, no matter who uses them. It’s beautifully written, and truly transported me to another time and place. While readers should be aware that the story is not for the faint of heart and can wreak havoc on the heart, it is absolutely worth reading.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Oct 25, 2020","Nov 04, 2020","Oct 25, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49354511-the-dictionary-of-lost-words

Petrik and TS decided to pick it up as well, even though it’s not something within their usual genre wheelhouses. Again, they loved it. But they warned me that it was heartbreaking and, since I had been going through a particularly rough patch in my life, I held off until I felt like I was emotionally strong enough to handle it. I’m so glad I did, because I can say without a single qualm that it will be only my list of favorite books read in 2021, but the heart-wrenching emotion of it would have kept it from the same list last year. It really pays to wait until the right moment to read this type of book, and I’m glad I had friends to caution me in that regard.“Better and worse. Bad and good. None of us are any one thing. We’re just a collection of the best and worst things we’ve done.”This book is one of the most devastating things I’ve ever read. It was beautiful, and the characters were incredibly real, but it made my chest physically ache as I was reading. I actually had to put it down and walk away a couple of times because I had reached my emotional threshold. I cared so much about this stories and every single character populating it. The plot was also deeply compelling and surprisingly unpredictable. I didn’t solve the mystery elements before the characters in the book did so themselves, and that’s something at which I generally excel. It was refreshing to be kept guessing, but without the author throwing in wild twists that were literally impossible to predict. After all was revealed, I could see where the narrative had always been pointing in that direction.“Is there a difference between a prayer and a wish?”“You wish for what you want, and pray for what you need.”There were two main perspective characters in this story: Duchess, a thirteen-year-old girl with the world on her shoulders who identifies as an outlaw and just wants to take care of her brother; and Walk, the sheriff of Duchess’s small town who tries his best to care for his people while fighting hard against change. While the supporting cast was absolutely wonderful, and Walk was a great character, Duchess was undoubtedly the star of the show. Her rage was always at war with her kindness except for when it came to her little brother. She’s young and fierce and broken and so strong in the face of all of it that it made my heart ache. I’ve never in my life wanted to reach into a book and save a child as much as I wanted to save her. For her creation alone, I would have called Whitaker a master of his craft, but every single character in this book was heartbreakingly multifaceted. I’m truly in awe.“Hope is secular. And life is fragile. And sometimes we hold on too tight, even though we know it’ll break.”I received an audio copy of this book through NetGalley and, though I tandem-read the digital copy, I’m incredibly glad I experienced this via audio. This is only the second book I’ve heard narrated by George Newbern, the first being A Man Called Ove. With both narrations, Newbern did an absolutely brilliant job. Every character’s voice was unique and easily identifiable, and not a single one of those voices felt cheesy or stereotypical. Emotion dripped from every sentence. While I have no doubt I would have still loved this book had I strictly read it with my eyes, having Newbern narrate the story for me as I read added a resonance to the experience that was truly something special.“If the good stand by idle, are they still good?”We Begin at the End wrecked me. It upset my faith in people, but it also managed to restore that same faith. I met characters who I don’t think I will ever be able to forget. While I’m not sure this is a book I can reread, because it hurt so much the first time, reading it was an experience that mattered. It impacted me deeply. I’m thankful to my friends for recommending it, and stand in awe of Whitaker for writing it.

This story takes place in China in 1937, when the city of Nanking falls to the Japanese. The narrative follows Lian, a scholarship student who is fleeing with her university to save not only themselves but the Library of Legends, an original collection of China’s fables and folklore that is integral to their national identity. Lian does her part to protect the Library, and I very much enjoyed this aspect of the story. As the journey progresses, we start to see these legends come to life on the periphery of the story, as the legends themselves begin to evacuate the mortal world. There were so many excellent building blocks to this story. An interesting and well-developed setting, a dramatic and compelling plot, a respect for stories, a star-crossed romance, and even an element of mysticism were all present. But there was something about both the characters and the writing itself that just fell a bit flat for me. None of the characters ever felt tangible to me, which made them less than believable. I think this disconnect is directly linked to Chang’s writing style and choices in prose. Something about it just didn’t resonate with me as a reader.Though I had my issues with The Library of Legends, I loved getting to learn more about a time and place with which I was fairly unfamiliar.

I feel as though I am part of the gunslinger’s ka-tet, making the trek right along with them. And so far, it’s one of the most fulfilling literary journeys I’ve ever embarked upon. Wizard and Glass did nothing but reinforce that feeling.“And now, all these years later, it seemed to him that the most horrible fact of human existence was that broken hearts mended.”In this installment of the series we get a lot of backstory on Roland, the tragic hero of this entire tale. And tragic is definitely the right descriptor. Because of the framework King set up before embarking on this trip into Roland’s memories, we know things are going to end horribly, even if we don’t know exactly how things go wrong. We know we’re in for a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. And yet, even knowing this, even knowing that the events we’re witnessing occurred in the past and can’t be changed, it’s impossible to keep from pleading King to give us a different outcome in the telling. No such luck. But even the most heartbreaking tales can be utterly captivating when told well, and this one is very well told.“So do we pass the ghosts that haunt us later in our lives; they sit undramatically by the roadside like poor beggars, and we see them only from the corners of our eyes, if we see them at all. The idea that they have been waiting there for us rarely if ever crosses our minds. Yet they do wait, and when we have passed, they gather up their bundles of memory and fall in behind, treading in our footsteps and catching up, little by little.”I’m really glad that I read The Stand before picking up this book, as it was referenced heavily. While you could definitely read only the main series and still very much enjoy it without feeling lost, I think reading books like The Stand, The Eyes of the Dragon, Insomnia, The Talisman, ‘Salem’s Lot, and other will only enhance the enjoyment for King’s Constant Readers. If you have no interest in becoming one of those and just want Roland’s story, go for it. It’s more than capable of standing on its own. The interconnectedness of King’s other works to the Dark Tower is just a wonderful added bonus.“It starts here. From its field of roses, the Dark Tower cries out in its beast’s voice. Time is a face on the water.”An unexpected side effect of reading this series is the soft spot I’m developing for the Western genre. I never thought I had much taste for Westerns, but I’m becoming a bit enamored with the setting. Who would’ve thought that Stephen King, the King of Horror himself, would have me finally gearing up to read Cormac McCarthy and Larry McMurtry? And King’s portrayal of ka, the irresistible and unstoppable fate which drives the world, has given me a lot of philosophical musings on which to ponder.“If it's ka it'll come like a wind, and your plans will stand before it no more than a barn before a cyclone.”There’s not a whole lot more I can say without spoiling something, so I’ll just say this: I loved this book. I loved the story-within-a-story, as well as the framework containing it. I loved the cultural references, and the connections to The Stand. Most of all, I love the group of characters at the core of this series. By this point, they feel incredibly real to me. And, knowing King, I’m terrified that not all of them will make it to the Tower. But live or die, they’re a ka-tet I would be proud to belong to, and I’m with them ’til the end of the line.“Stand, and be true.”You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 03, 2020","Oct 09, 2020","Oct 03, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28253767-wizard-and-glass

If you’re planning on a journey to King’s Dark Tower, this one is absolutely essential. Not only are the concepts of ka and ka-tet integral to the plot of the novel, the Tower itself makes brief appearances. And while I didn’t look it up for fear of having important future plot points spoiled for myself, I’m almost positive that two important new characters in the main series were introduced in this book. “Him's name is Roland, Mama. I dream about him, sometimes. Him's a King, too.”Insomnia is a weird one, y’all. Chronic insomnia gives senior citizens magic powers and unusual psychic abilities. And then said seniors have to save not just Derry (yes, that Derry), not just the world, but multiple worlds. And they do this by sliding into a higher plane of existence. There were some freaky parts, but this is mostly a preternatural psychological thriller. “It was life, often unsatisfying, frequently cruel, usually boring, sometimes beautiful, once in a while exhilarating.” It was fun to revisit Derry for the first time since having read IT years ago. While it’s not as central to King’s collective mythos as Castle Rock, it’s probably the next most important King location in what is arguably our world. Every mention of Mike Hamlin as Derry’s librarian made me smile, and every time a sewer came up in the story I felt a little shiver.“Sooner or later everything you thought you'd left behind comes around again. For good or ill, it comes around again.”I think the main thing that inhibited my enjoyment of this book was the format I chose to consume. The audio version was just…bad. Not that the narrator was awful. No, what I hated was the dissonant music that would play very loudly over the narrator at the end of a chapter. It was obnoxious and, quite honestly, painful. “It's a long way back to Eden, Sweetheart, so don't sweat the small stuff.”If you’re taking your own journey to the Tower, please don’t skip this book. I think it’s going to be really important. But I highly recommend skipping the audio and reading it with your eyes, because your hearing is also important.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 26, 2020","Oct 03, 2020","Sep 26, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28387572-insomnia

While I deeply appreciate the gift, the giving of it had no impact on the thoughts and opinions expressed below.One witch you can laugh at. Three you can burn. But what do you do with a hundred?The Ten Thousand Doors of January was my favorite book of 2019. I adored Harrow’s way with and respect for words and stories. The tale was such an ode to both that it made my heart feel as though it would burst. I kept having to pause periodically and close the book and my eyes so I could just soak in the exquisite prose. I wasn’t sure Harrow could ever again pen something quite that beautiful. But while I didn’t quite connect to her second novel as deeply as I did her first, I needn’t have worried. The Once and Future Witches is just as lovingly and impeccably crafted as Harrow’s incredible debut.“Sometimes a thing is too dangerous to be written down or said straight out. Sometimes you have to slip it in slantwise, half-hidden.”I love the symmetry of the first three chapters. The introduction of each sister feels whimsical because of it. The way in which Harrow takes familiar fairy tales and turns them on their heads in subtle, interesting ways is also very effective. The story is in large part a blending of fairy tales and the women’s suffrage movement, which felt like a unique combination. However, while I was infatuated by the form, the soul of this novel resides within the three sisters at its core: James Juniper, the youngest and wildest; Beatrice Belladonna, the oldest and wisest; and Agnes Amaranth, the strong one between them. But when we first meet these sisters, they are far from each other, and from who they were each meant to be. Witnessing their growth over the course of the novel, both internally and in their bond as sisters, was lovely to behold. She thought survival was a selfish thing, a circle drawn tight around your heart. She thought the more people you let inside that circle the more wats the world had to hurt you. But what if it’s the opposite, and there are more people to catch you when you fall? What if there’s an invisible tipping point somewhere along the way when one becomes three becomes infinite, when there are so many of you inside that circle that you become hydra-headed, invincible?The novel is so purposefully and perfectly written that it was actually difficult for me to establish any emotional connection. It reminded me of The Starless Sea in this regard, though I definitely enjoyed The Once and Future Witches more. But I enjoyed it on a purely cerebral level instead of ever truly feeling it, try as I might. I think that lack of connection is likely a failing on my part, a side effect of the horrific year that has been 2020. Both my personal life and the state of the world have been so chaotic and terrible that things which would usually impact me deeply can’t seem to touch me at all. It’s quite possible that this lack of connection will be completely rectified on a reread, when my world is (hopefully) a little less awful.Fate is a story people tell themselves so they can believe everything happens for a reason, that the whole awful world is fitted together like some perfect machine, with blood for oil and bones for brass. That every child locked in her cellar or girl chained to her loom is in her right and proper place.She doesn’t much care for fate.I’m so thrilled to have been given the opportunity to read Harrow’s newest novel. It’s a story I definitely intend to read again. And I have a feeling that it will resonate more deeply with me the next time I visit with the Eastwood sisters as they take New Salem by storm. If you’re looking for a beautiful, witchy, feminist way to celebrate Halloween, is this ever the book for you.All above quotations were taken from an uncorrected proof and are subject to change upon publication.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Sep 18, 2020","Oct 06, 2020","Sep 18, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49504061-the-once-and-future-witches

But over the span of this book and its predecessor, The Drawing of the Three, he’s edging remarkably close to becoming not just one of my favorite authors, but my hands down favorite. Right now he’s in a three-way tie with Brandon Sanderson and Nora Roberts, but Wizard and Glass might actually change that if it holds a candle to The Waste Lands. I’ve heard that the back half of the Dark Tower series pales a bit in comparison to the first 4 books, so I’m trying to keep my expectations low, but this is shaping up to be my favorite series of all time.“The wheel of ka turns and the world moves on.” The Gunslinger was fine the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. I loved The Drawing of the Three almost immediately, and that love never wavered throughout the course of the novel. But The Waste Lands is one of my favorite books I’ve ever read. I’m not saying it’s one of the best books I’ve ever read, as I’ve been fortunate enough to consume some absolute masterpieces. King’s prose doesn’t quite measure up to masterpiece quality. There are imperfections here. But for sheer enjoyment value, for its ability to keep me so invested that I had a difficult time focussing on real life, for its insistence on invading my dreams even after I had read its final pages, this book just wins. I was never less than completely entranced. The plot was astonishingly intricate and never lagged. I was never bored for a single second.“See the turtle of enormous girth, on his shell he holds the earth. If you want to run and play, come along the beam today.”I’m always amazed by the myriad of intricate ways in which King references his own work. Some are small and incredibly subtle, while others are evident to even those who haven’t read a lot of his backlog. And the self-referencing should seem haughty. It doesn’t. Instead, it makes everything King has ever written come across as purposeful and intentional and premeditative. I have mad respect for this, and I think it makes his stellar stories even more enjoyable, as they build on one another. I’m a huge lover of Easter eggs in stories. It’s why I love Marvel and Sanderson’s Cosmere, and it’s why I’ve come to adore King’s work. And it’s exactly why I’ve chosen to take the much longer, circuitous route to the Tower. I’d love to just blast through the main series, but I’d love even more to pick up on as many of the little references to his other works that King has interwoven into the story as I possibly can. This will more than likely lead to me reading his entire body of work over the course of a decade or two, and I’m completely okay with that. “In the end, all things, even the Beams, serve the Dark Tower. Did you think you would be any different?”The central cast of The Waste Lands completely won me over. I love each member of this ka-tet with every fiber of my being. And I can’t discuss a single one of them because, as with John Gwynne’s work, even mentioning certain character names could potentially spoil some important plot points. But also as with Gwynne’s work, I’m making an exception for an animal companion. Oy the Billy-Bumbler is an absolute darling, and I’m amazed at King’s ability to craft such a unique and lovable creature. I need one. Not want. NEED. I will say this about the central cast; they have all grown tremendously since each of them was introduced into the narrative. There’s so much character development in this series that it’s unreal. And their relationships with each other have experienced just as much transformation. It’s been truly wonderful to observe.I do not aim with my hand. He who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I aim with my eye.I do not shoot with my hand. He who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father. I shoot with my mind.I do not kill with my gun. He who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father. I kill with my heart.I have no idea where the wheel of Ka will take these companions. I would say that I can’t wait to find out, but I also know that King has no problem killing off his darlings and I’m terrified of what might lie ahead. But the need to know is fierce, and I’m incredibly excited to continue my journey to the Tower. And I can’t wait to see how more of King’s other works tie into it.Long days and pleasant nights, friends.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Sep 18, 2020","Sep 26, 2020","Sep 18, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28335914-the-waste-lands

Dune is considered the science fiction equiWhile the ending felt abrupt and a bit unsatisfying, I very much enjoyed this classic of the sci-fi genre. Dune is considered the science fiction equivalent of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, and that comparison makes total sense to me. The epic scope of Herbert’s debut novel, the highly unique setting, the near fathomless depth of the world building, the slightly stilted dialogue that lends the story a classic air, and the mysticism surrounding the central plot all reminded me of Tolkien’s world. Knowing how many books followed this one and dug further into the mythos Herbert introduced here further establishes that link. But what Dune did for science fiction, how it helped propel the genre into the mainstream and show that it could appeal to literary readers, very much harkens to what Tolkien was able to do for the fantasy genre. Undoubtedly, the godfathers of genre fiction deserve our praise.Going into this book knowing what it did for the genre and understanding that it’s a classic actually helped me enjoy it more than I otherwise would have. There was so much philosophy and so little deliverance of promised action sequences that I can see why plenty of others have been disappointed by Dune. However, I try to read classics more leniently, with my focus on discovering what has enabled the book to not only stand the test of time, but how it influenced books that came after it. With this mindset, I enjoyed Dune far more than I would have otherwise. While it is in my opinion far from a perfect novel, I can absolutely see why it’s important.I found the characters interesting if often two-dimensional, but I found the world building and philosophy absolutely fascinating. I’m a sucker for religion in fiction, and Dune delivered that in spades. Herbert obviously had a brilliant imagination, and I’m glad to have read this novel before new movie is released later this year.

Also, there is some really weird sexual content in this story that is much easier to skim over when presented in pure prose.

While McConaghy has written SFF in the past, this work is something entirely new for her, and you could feel the passion and anger pouring off of every page. I’ve never read any of her SFF novels, but I might have to give them a go. Because the woman can really write.“A life's impact can be measured by what it gives and what it leaves behind, but it can also be measured by what it steals from the world.”This is the story of a dying world, a near future where almost every wild animal has become extinct due to climate change and human interference at a catastrophic level. Franny Stone is bound and determined to follow what she believes will be the last mass migration of Arctic terns, even if it kills her. As the story progresses, and we learn more and more about what is driving her, Franny becomes more and more fascinating and sympathetic. The character development here was very well done, both in Franny and in the supporting cast. There were mystery elements I found intriguing. The prose was lovely. While the story often came across as preachy, the timeliness of it justifies McConaghy’s stance and vehemence. I picked up this book right before Hurricane Laura hit my home in Louisiana. The storm was the worst in this area since 1856. A tree fell on my grandparents’ house as we looked on helplessly, unable to get to them because of the winds and unable to call them because all cell towers were down. My parents’ house, the home they’ve been building since before I was born, the home I spent my entire childhood in from birth to marriage, had a giant tree fall through it while we were inside and is looking like it’s beyond saving. I’m incredibly thankful that every member of my family made it through not only alive but unharmed. However, our lives here are forever changed. Reading a story in which environmental issues were so tightly wound proved to be too much for me at the time. I did eventually pick it back up and finish it, but it was the opposite of a comfort. However, that was the author’s point, I think. McConaghy wasn’t trying to comfort, but to slap awake and call to arms before it’s too late. If that was her intent, she succeeded.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 25, 2020","Sep 09, 2020","Aug 25, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42121525-migrations

The only other book I’ve read from Sager is Lock Every Door, which took forever to grab my attention. It was fine, but nowhere near a favorite. While Home Before Dark isn’t an instant favorite, either, it was a much more enjoyable reading experience. Imagine a child from an Amityville Horror kind of book remembers nothing of the story that made her family famous. Now picture that child being left said haunted house in her father’s will, and making the decision to go back to the place that has so defined her life and trying to find the truth behind the fiction. The story takes some interesting turns from there, and the house itself reminded me vaguely of the setting in Netflix’s version of The Haunting of Hill House, which is possibly my favorite television series of all time. The mystery wasn’t clear-cut, and there were some surprising twists. I also found the ending satisfying, which is a rarity for me with this type of novel.

I had no concrete expectations for this going in, but My Favorite Thing is Monsters is hands down the most unique graphic novel I’ve ever rBeautiful. I had no concrete expectations for this going in, but My Favorite Thing is Monsters is hands down the most unique graphic novel I’ve ever read. The story, the art style, and the character development where all absolutely brilliant. I was incredibly moved by it.“Never let anyone’s darkness provoke you into your own midnight.”This is a coming of age story unlike any other, told and drawn from the perspective of Karen Reyes, a ten-year-old girl growing up in the 60s. Karen is completely obsessed with monsters, and consumes every magazine and television show and movie about them she can find. This graphic novel is set up as her journal, in which she records her observations of others and her inner thoughts through both words and drawings. The story is also her hunt to solve a mystery, which added another layer of fun to the reading experience.“I guess that's the difference... a good monster sometimes gives somebody a fright because they're weird-looking and fangy... a fact that is beyond their control...But bad monsters are all about CONTROL... They want the whole world to be scared so that BAD MONSTERS can call the shots.”There was actually a ton of artistic commentary here, both in Karen’s interpretations of famous artwork and through how she represented others. Almost every character is conveyed as being related to some kind of monster, and is drawn accordingly. This is most evident in Karen’s portrayal of herself in her own eyes. “Like I said, basements usually smell like surrealism. But kitchens and gardens almost always smell like impressionism.Because our kitchen is part of a basement apartment, it smells like the early impressionism of Vincent Van Gogh - all big strokes of umber and ochre - a peppery greasy I-love-you smell.” We also see a lot of timely topics through the eyes of this child, from the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President John F. Kennedy, to the Flower Power and anti-Vietnam War movements, to the racism and homophobia that pervaded every aspect of life at the time. We also see the aftermath of World War II through the eyes of a concentration camp victim, which was both fascinating and almost too painful to read. Karen also conveys the importance of family and self-expression and standing up for the things you believe in. But she also showed how difficult all of those things can be, not only for a ten-year-old girl, but for the adult surrounding her. “Sometimes a thing happens that's so bad that it feels like things should be made to look on the outside, the way they feel on the inside.”Something else I appreciated about this particular graphic novel was how substantial it is. At right around 400 pages, it’s one of the longest books I’ve read in the genre. The story was meaty, and was well balanced by the stunningly unique artwork. Karen Reyes felt incredibly real to me, and I was thankful to be able to spend so much time with her. Although I borrowed a digital copy of this from my library, I immediately tracked down a physical copy to have on my shelf. I’m eagerly awaiting its sequel (and conclusion), due to be published right around my birthday next year. I will definitely be preordering it for myself as a gift. I was deeply moved by Volume 1, and I can’t wait to see how the story wraps up in Volume 2.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 14, 2020","Aug 19, 2020","Aug 14, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29069374-my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-vol-1

And I’ve never appreciated Jesus more than I do right now. I don’t see how anyone makes it through a devastating situation without Him. Because I’ve been clinging to my beliefs as tightly as I can, I’ve felt drawn back to Christian fiction for the first time in a long while. Ted Dekker was my very favorite author as a teenager, so I decided that now was a wonderful time to revisit his work. “Do not allow fear to bind you up, dear one. You will only lose what you already have. Accept what is given now.”I read this particular book years ago, but didn’t enjoy it as much as Dekker’s speculative fiction for the simple fact that it was historical fiction instead. This was incredibly unfair of me, but I couldn’t seem to change my opinion. And because I didn’t love A.D. 30, I never read A.D. 33, its sequel, when it was released. Thankfully, I had no such disappointments upon rereading A.D. 30, and am now incredibly excited to continue the story into its sequel.“He knew me. He knew me through and through and he found no shame in me.”This book is the story of Maviah, a Bedouin woman who is the disfavored daughter of a powerful sheikh. Maviah has suffered much in her life, and her entire existence is viewed as shameful. But when enemies strike and her father has no one else to send for aid, Maviah rises to the occasion and departs on a journey to Israel in search of King Harod. Once in the lands of the Hebrews, Maviah crosses paths with the mystic who is rocking the world with His teachings, Yeshua of Nazareth. Her life will never be the same.“Trust the Father. Then you will master this world with pleasure rather than be mastered by it. Then you will find the power to command any storm.”I loved seeing Maviah’s growth over the course of this novel, as well as the growth of secondary characters surrounding her. I also thoroughly enjoyed getting to see real people from the pages of the New Testament presented in a slightly different light in a work of fiction. Most of all, I love that Dekker took every single word spoken by Yeshua directly from His words in Scripture. This novel was thoughtfully presented and more moving than I remembered, and I’m very eager to see where Maviah’s story takes her next.“Will you follow my path and be the light of the world to shine in that darkness?”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 27, 2020","Jul 30, 2020","Jul 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20706852-a-d-30

Whenever I’m feeling down or overwhelmed or just in need of something comforting, her books are always a welcoming escape. The Awakening, the first installment in her newest series, is no exception. If the rest of the Dragon Heart Legacy is as great as The Awakening, it promises to be one of her best.“You have to look to find. You have to ask to have the answers. You have to awaken to become.”In recent years, Nora has been taking more and more risks with her work. She’s been writing about weightier topics, departing from the formula she’d adhered to for so many novels, and diving further into the fantasy genre. All of these changes absolutely delight me. While there’s a part of me that misses the predictability, as it was part of the the draw and comfort of her work, I have so much respect for the risks she’s taking and the ways in which she is stretching herself.“You have to work to have peace, and there are times you have to fight for it.”In this novel, Nora really highlights her strengths: characterization and strong sense of place. Breen, our main character, grows tremendously over the course of the book. And her supporting cast is simply delightful. There are a lot of musicians in this novel, and the way Nora portrays music was, as it always is, moving and true. I loved getting to know this cast, and I can’t wait to see how they develop over the next two books.“An instrument was a garden, needed love, needed tending.”My very favorite element of the story is the setting. We actually have three main settings here: Philadelphia, Ireland, and the fictional Talamh. All three settings are vibrant and well fleshed out, but there’s something about Ireland that just shines. I’m not sure how many novels Nora has written that are set at least in part in Ireland, but I’d say there are at least a couple dozen or so. You can tell that Ireland holds an incredible appeal for her, and her love for it comes through brilliantly in each of those aforementioned books. Reading one of her stories set on the Emerald Isle is my favorite way to travel when traveling is impossible. Because of Nora, Ireland is the top bucket list destination for every woman in my family. The way she paints the setting with her words is nothing short of stunning. I can always close my eyes and see just exactly what she’s described, and it’s always lovely. “If you fail, well, greatness rises from first failures.”The fantasy elements in this story are so much fun. For the most part, they are elements she has utilized in past novels, but the parallel worlds motif is a new one for her, and it adds some resonance to the rest. There’s magic, and fairies, and dragons, and more. I feel like these elements will be further explored in the next installment, and I’m beyond excited.“If you rock no boat, you never end up in the water to see where the waves might take you.”One way in which this book differs greatly from most of Nora’s novels is that it ends on a cliffhanger. I’m never a fan of such endings, but it definitely packed a punch. Thankfully, I know I won’t have to wait forever for the next book. Nora’s work ethic is insane, and I can’t remember once in my adult life when a book wasn’t published on the date she promised. Because she’s so dependable, I feel pretty secure in the belief that I won’t have to wait more than a year to see what happens next. “I’ve learned that life, a good one, is about love, about standing up for yourself and others, about generosity, about giving back.”I had a wonderful time reading The Awakening, and discussing it with my mom and grandmother as we all read it together. Even if it’s not my new favorite book, there’s nothing quite as soothing and captivating as diving into the writing of Nora Roberts when the real world is so far from perfect. This novel met all of my expectations, and I have a feeling it’s just going to get better when I revisit it next year.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,2,"Nov 24, 2021Nov 27, 2020","Nov 28, 2021Dec 02, 2020","Jul 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49127421-the-awakening

And I’m still baffled by this turn around, as I vividly recall years of my life when I couldn’t get past the first chapter of anything he wrote. Whatever the catalyst for this change in taste might have been, I’m grateful for it. King is now firmly planted among my favorites. While not every book or story is a masterpiece, they’re all enjoyable. This newest collection of his is no exception. Below are micro-s for each of the four stories contained in this collection. Even if I didn’t adore them all, I had fun reading them.Mr. Harrigan’s Phone: 4 starsLove this as a coming of age story with an whiff of the supernatural. It has the nostalgic feel of so many of King’s coming of age stories, even though it takes place in a more modern setting. Equal parts cozy and unsettling. I love the relationships between Craig and the adults in his life. Especially his relationship with the title character. However, I now even more firmly believe that, not only can you not take it with you when you go, you really, really shouldn’t. Technology should never reach beyond the grave.“I think our phones are how we are wedded to the world. If so, it’s probably a bad marriage.”The Life of Chuck: 3.5 starsA timely story, touching on our addiction to technology and how both its presence and its potential future absence so radically affects our lives. Can the world possibly go back to a time without the internet without humanity devolving into pocket dystopias? Act 3 is a very interesting portrayal of the world winding down, and the end coming with a whimper instead of a bang. Acts 2 and 1 are a sweet, intriguing life story. The way in which these three parts come together is ethereal and, according to King, up for debate. It’s a very intriguing concept that provides a lot of food for thought without giving anything approaching an answer. I both really enjoyed it and found it unsatisfying. My feelings about the story are mixed.“The universe is large, he thought. It contains multitudes. It also contains me, and in this moment I am wonderful. I have a right to be wonderful.”If It Bleeds: 4.5 starsHaving now read Doctor Sleep, I love the stronger link this story makes between Doctor Sleep and The Outsider. There is also a small link to 11/22/63 that was unexpected, as well as allusions to IT. As one of my favorite things about King’s work is his tendency to self-reference and to link all of his works to one another, these links made me very happy. And while I understand that some King fans have a strong dislike for Holly, she seems to have grown on me with each of her appearances. By the time I read this novella, she had already won me over, so I was completely invested. This ended up being a much stronger, and better, story than I was anticipating.“If it bleeds, it leads.”Rat: 3.5 starsI love the way King portrays writers in all their quirky, intelligent, vaguely superstitious, not-always-pleasant glory. In this story, he demonstrates once again how thin the line between creativity and madness can be, and how easily that line can be crossed. Take a sick day when you need one, folks. You never know when you drive yourself too hard if you’ll finally push yourself over the brink from which you can’t return. It’s a chance we all risk when we don’t cut ourselves some slack. The pursuit of art can be your end if you allow it. How much will you sacrifice for it? Also, this one got really weird. Interesting, though.“It was like a splinter, one lodged in his mind instead of under his skin.”Overall, this was a fun, if mixed, bag of stories. Even those I didn’t love were still entertaining and thought-provoking. I’m not positive I’ll revisit this particular collection in the future, but I’m still glad to have read it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 15, 2020","Jul 21, 2020","Jul 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48838041-if-it-bleeds

David Copperfield is one of the most naive characters I’ve come across in all of literature. He gets hoodwinked by almost everyone he comes in contact with, and he hands over the little he has with compassion and a smile. He’s one of the purest souls I’ve ever come across. I loved getting to watch him grow up. I also thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the varied, colorful cast of characters with whom Dickens surrounded David. I was always completely invested. Also, I had somehow managed to go my entire life without consuming this story in any form, or hearing it discussed in a class. Because of this, I actually had no idea what was going to happen next, which is kind of rare for me with classics as I majored in English Literature in college. There were plot points that surprised me, which was refreshing. And I found the ending incredibly satisfying. I believe this is one of the best classics TS and I have read together, and I enjoyed this shared experience immensely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 14, 2020","Aug 20, 2020","Jul 14, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21262470-david-copperfield

I had no Actual rating: 4.5 starsFor close to a decade I’ve thought that The Shadow of the Wind was one of the most brilliant novels I had ever read. I had no idea that it was a preamble, setting up for an even bigger story. And I truly believe that The Angel’s Game just scratched the surface; I can feel in my bones that there’s far more to come. I’ve also been reliably informed by TS and Petrik that all of the questions I found left frustratingly open at the end of this book will indeed be answered later in the series, which does nothing but add to my excitement.“Poetry is written with tears, novels with blood, and history with invisible ink.”In this book we meet David Martín, an orphan who yearns to be a writer. Thanks to his mentor, Pedro Vidal, Martín is given his chance. But when his writing career takes an unexpected trajectory, he finds himself making a deal with the devil and mirroring the tragic history of another. At its core, Martín’s story is one of intriguing mystery and gothic horror. The atmosphere of this novel was so creepy that I often couldn’t tell if there was a supernatural element to it or if the eeriness was due exclusively to the lush, dark setting. That question wasn’t truly answered, even in the final pages, though its answer was alluded to. I loved the balance Zafón struck between reality and the supernatural; it definitely kept me on my toes.“Inspiration comes when you stick your elbows on the table, your bottom on the chair and you start sweating. Choose a theme, an idea, and squeeze your brain until it hurts. That’s called inspiration.”The Angel’s Game was radically different in tone than its predecessor, The Shadow of the Wind, but that made the Martín’s search for answers even more compelling. Where The Shadow of the Wind was a historical fiction literary mystery, The Angel’s Game is, as stated above, a gothic horror, though there is plenty of mystery and romance and even magical realism in its pages. While I truly loved the atmosphere of the book, and have rarely come across such lush descriptions of setting, the mystery was what truly kept me reading. I was dying to know how Martín’s story would tie into Daniel Sempere’s tale, and finally gaining that information was incredibly satisfying.“The only way you can truly get to know an author is through the trail of ink he leaves behind him; the person you think you see is only an empty character: truth is always hidden in fiction.”Probably my least favorite element of this book was the central romance. If it can even be considered central. Martín’s romantic interest came across as incredibly two-dimensional, in my opinion, and seemed to only be there to drive the plot forward instead of serving as a character in her own right. I’m not a fan of damsels as plot devices, and that’s truly what she felt like. I know Zafón can pen wonderful female characters, as he demonstrates beautifully in another character in this novel, so I know he could have done better with this particular woman. Besides that, I really have no other complaints about this novel. Especially since, as I mentioned earlier, TS and Petrik assured me that my questions would be answer in the next two novels. “Sooner or later, the word becomes flesh and the flesh bleeds.”As with The Shadow of the Wind, my very favorite element of The Angel’s Game was the role of books, both in plot and setting.  Sempere and Sons remains one of the coziest bookshops I’ve come across in fiction, and I wish I could live there. Then you have The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, after which this entire series is named. There’s something so magical about the idea of the Cemetery, and as well as about its role as a setting. The thought of a nearly endless labyrinth of books, whose authors and existences have been lost to society, hidden deep within a city, is enchanting. It also provides a beautiful continuity between the novels, and the repetition of dialogue regarding it lends a reverence and awe to the Cemetery’s existence that moves me. “This place is a mystery. A sanctuary. Every book, every volume you see, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and the should of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens. In this place, books no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time, live forever, waiting for the day when they will reach a new reader’s hands, a new spirit…”Zafón also has profound things to say about books themselves, the art of writing, and even the impact story has on religion and philosophy and psychology, all of which I found fascinating.  And once again, both the writing and the translation of it are absolutely stunning. This is a book that begs to be annotated. Since I couldn’t bring myself to mark in my lovely physical copy, I borrowed an electronic copy from the library for the express purpose of taking notes.“We think we understand a song’s lyrics, but what makes us believe in them, or not, is the music.”I’m so glad I was persuaded to read beyond The Shadow of the Wind. As much as I adore that novel, it’s so exciting to see how much more there is to the story. If the third and fourth installments maintain this level of craftsmanship, The Cemetery of Forgotten Books will undoubtedly become one of my favorite series. The Angel’s Game made me think and question and laugh and feel, and I honestly can’t wait to see what else Zafón’s world has in store.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jul 09, 2020","Jul 18, 2020","Jul 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4912857-the-angel-s-game

The method of storytelling is more interesting, there’s more going on than just warring and waiting, men aren’t constantly bragging about themselves nearly as often, women take a more important and vocal role in the plot, and Odysseus is a far more sympathetic protagonist than Achilles.

Love, loyalty and friendship shall be my guiding light. I will be the bright star in the night sky, the candle in the darkness. The defender of the innocent, protector of the weak. I will bring hope to the lost, give my life for the helpless. With Truth as my shield, and Courage as my sword, I shall stand against the darkness. From this day on, until the time of my death.” — The Oath of The Order of the Bright Star. I firmly believe that John Gwynne is one of the most gifted, powerful fantasy authors of our age. In the course of this trilogy and the quartet preceding it, Gwynne was able to create a world that feels as real as our own. The lore he wove into each book was fascinating and completely transportive. He crafted a compendium of characters for whom I cared so deeply that I rejoiced and wept with them as if they were my friends in reality instead of merely fictional. And don’t even get me started on his action-scene prowess. The fact that he can keep a battle going for 200 pages and keep everything in such incredibly clear focus that boredom has no hope of setting in and tension is so well maintained that I never once felt tempted to skim is an incredible accomplishment that I don’t think has been matched by any other author I’ve read outside of Brandon Sanderson. I honestly don’t know that anything about the series as a whole or this book in particular could’ve been improved in any way. In A Time of Courage, Gwynne penned an incredible finale that moved me deeply and left me feeling weepy and exhausted and content.“Take your weapons and face your fear. There is only one hope today. And that hope is you… Take your Courage, and let’s go fight the devil with it.”As with every other Gwynne novel I’ve ed, I won’t be discussing any characters by name as even their mention could potentially be a spoiler. This is because Gwynne doesn’t play it safe at all, and every character, even if they’re a perspective character, faces the very real possibility of death. Gwynne doesn’t hesitate to kill his darlings. There’s no malice or glee in such decisions, and you can actually sense in his writing how much it hurts him to pen such deaths. But he doesn’t shy away from them. These seven books document a war, and realistically we know that war can claim even the best of us. That’s what Gwynne demonstrates in his writing. His heroes are mortal, and mortals die.  Remembering our mortality reminds us to live each and every day to the fullest, and his characters do that. There is true loss in these pages, and those losses are incredibly painful. I genuinely grieved over certain characters, alongside those they left behind.“We are all just people, all of us the same. Flawed, fragile, stubborn, angry, happy. And life treats no one differently. We are born, and we live, and then we die. It’s what we do while we are here that counts. And if we can be called friend, then we are lucky indeed.”Something I really appreciate about Gwynne’s novels, and A Time of Courage in particular, is his ability to show that no person is entirely good or entirely evil. In this book, there are five perspective characters, two of who are fighting on the side of darkness. These two characters could easily have been caricatures, but Gwynne managed to give them redeeming qualities such as loyalty and their own brand of honor. Did they have any interest in being redeemed and turning to the side of good? No. But even villains are heroes in their own eyes, and Gwynne demonstrates well how they could hold that belief. Gwynne also gently reminds us that his heroes aren’t perfect, but they’re good to their very cores. I love them all.“Friend. So much of what we are and do is shaped by that. Our friendships. Those we love, those we choose to stand beside.”While romance is a very small part of this story, I loved the way Gwynne handled each romantic relationship. I could truly feel the joy each couple found in just the sight of one another. I very much appreciated the lack of love triangles here. I feel that it’s a trope that has been done to death, and it was refreshing to see romantic relationships that weren’t muddled by such strain. I also love the way Gwynne portrays friendship. His novels proclaim that a shared bloodline is the shallowest building block of family, and that clans are comprised of those who love each other, regardless of blood or past or species. There are some friendships in this book that are so deep that reading about them makes my heart ache in the best possible way. And the best of these friendships always involve animals in some way. From the first book to the end of the story of The Banished Lands, Gwynne has written phenomenal animal characters whose love and loyalty to their humans pulses from the page. Gwynne has a gift for portraying deep and abiding relationships in many forms, and those relationships are what make these books so powerful.“You blaze as bright as the sun. The world is a better place for having you in it.”Even though war plays so strong a role in every Banished Lands novel, there’s an overwhelming wholesomeness at the core of the entire series. The side of good both represents and conveys through the characters who comprise it truth and courage, love and loyalty, kindness and faithfulness. In this way I’m very much reminded of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. While every character has their own depths, the divide between good and evil forces is clear cut. The fantasy world has an abundance of grimdark books, where each side is so gray you’re not sure who to root for, and I think it’s refreshing to read a series where the sides are black and white. “Stop raging about the things you cannot change. Just be true to yourself and do what you can do. Love those worth loving and to the Otherworld with the rest of it.”A Time of Courage was a stupendous finale to not just its trilogy, but to Gwynne’s Banished Lands saga. While I would love for him to revisit it someday, I believe that Gwynne wrapped things up perfectly. Not neatly, mind you, as that wouldn’t have rang true. There were losses and loose ends, as there should be in any believable tale with stakes this high. But I found the ending exactly right, giving closure while still providing room for wondering. I wish every fantasy lover the world over would pick up Malice and fall in love with Gwynne’s world and writing.

And yet that message is still just as desperately needed, if not moreso, than it’s every been. We live in a world divided, a world in which diversity is still viewed with suspicion by many fronts. But though we still have a long way to go, inclusion and acceptance of those different than ourselves has come a long way over the course of the past century. While it may seem as though we’ve taken a step back in recent years, we’ve actually come so far that we’re better able to recognize our failings than ever before. Just as waking a sleeping limb is painful but necessary in order for our body to properly function, being able to see the areas in which we’re lacking is painful but necessary if we want to keep moving forward into a world in which people are valued for their souls and dreams instead of cast out for being different. After all, aren’t our differences what make us beautiful? The world would be a boring place if we were all carbon copies of one another. I for one am thankful to live in a world in which uniqueness abounds.“Hate is loud, but I think you'll learn it's because it's only a few people shouting, desperate to be heard. You might not ever be able to change their minds, but so long as your remember you're not alone, you will overcome.”The House in the Cerulean Sea is, at its core, a story embracing diversity and found families. The eponymous house is actually an isolated orphanage for extremely unusual magical children. Linus Baker, our perspective character, is a social worker sent to observe the children and their caretaker, Arthur Parnassus, for an entire month. Though he was incredibly reluctant to take the assignment, he finds his life changed by the children, and the island, and Arthur. Through his interactions with this motley crew, Linus learns what it means to be a true family, and that being related by blood is the least important thing in the world when it comes to forming your own. He learns to deeply value these children in all their weirdness, and to love the very things that make them so different. He sees firsthand how heartbreaking and ignorant and hateful prejudice is, as well as how easily children can bound back from it when they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are loved and valued.“Your voice is a weapon. Never forget that.”I loved the premise of this book, and the message it proclaimed. The synopsis and the cover art promised something delightful and charming, and it delivered. Even the tone of the storytelling was whimsical, reminding me a bit of Good Omens. The only reason I couldn’t quite love this book as fiercely as I had hoped was that it had a tendency to cross the line from charming into precious. While I am all for cute and sweet, when not properly balanced in a story I can find them overwhelming. And not in a good way. There were parts that felt so cloyingly sweet that reading them almost made my teeth ache. But that’s an incredibly subjective issue, one that I’m sure will not be present for most other readers.“Sometimes our prejudices color our thoughts when we least expect them to. If we can recognize that, and learn from it, we can become better people.”This book was such a delightful presentation of the importance of embracing your own weirdness and the weirdness of those you love. It’s all about loving yourself, and not trying to squeeze yourself into a mold that would make you more palatable to the world at large. It’s about seeing others for who the really are, and loving everything about them. It’s about what makes a house a home, and what makes a group a true family. It’s about acceptance and kindness and having the bravery to stand up for those who find themselves looked down on by the world. The House in the Cerulean Sea is a truly lovely story that feels incredibly timely. The world could use some loveliness.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jun 19, 2020","Jun 24, 2020","Jun 19, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/45047384-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea

Something has happened and Alix pleads with Emira to come take Briar, the three-year-old Emira has come to love, out of the house while the police are called, so the toddler isn’t frightened. Emira is coming from a birthday party and, after explaining to Alix that she’s dressed for the occasion and has had a few drinks, Emira agrees and comes to the rescue. She takes Briar to a grocery store down the road, a store in which they’ve smelled the teas and looked at the nuts a number of times. But in this case, a customer alerts a security guard, and Emira is suspected of kidnapping. This level of knee-jerk prejudice appalls me. How can you judge a person so quickly based on their skin color? How can you jump to suspecting such malicious intent based on seeing a young Black woman with a little white girl in a high end grocery store? The fact that people jump to this type of conclusion all the time is appalling and incredibly infuriating.This is a compelling story that deals with serious topics in often humorous ways. The characters are engaging, even if I repeatedly wanted to reach through the pages and throttle one or more of them. There’s a tone of well-meaning superiority from multiple characters that I found utterly exasperating, which I’m positive was the point. I loved Emira, the main character, but I just so desperately wanted her to communicate better with said self-righteous characters. I also found a lot of Emira's interactions with her friends obnoxious, but this is quite possibly become I'm a septuagenarian on the inside and can't imagine going out partying on a weeknight. Which happens frequently here. Briar, though, is perfect. She’s everything wonderful and weird about kids, and I loved every paragraph in which she was present. I can totally see why Emira fell so hard for her.Another unspoken topic that dominates the novel is what it means to be an adult. We all grow up at our own speed. Because of this, I think that many of us feel like we’re lagging behind, clinging guiltily to a perpetual childhood that we find embarrassing but impossible to release. And then, one day we find that we let it go without realizing it, and that we’ve turned into adults without noticing. Sometimes it just takes giving yourself room to grow without putting so much internal pressure on yourself. I also appreciated how important healthcare was to Emira as she neared her 26th birthday. I vividly remember having the same concerns. It’s sad that something which should be a basic human right can be the source of so much worry.Such a Fun Age is a very entertaining novel that kept me invested from start to finish. It wasn’t perfect, and I found myself almost constantly frustrated with almost the entire cast, but it was a light, fun read that had enough depth to make me think. This would be a great summer read for a book club, as it would provide a lot of great fodder for conversation while still being an easy read....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 17, 2020","Jun 20, 2020","Jun 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43923951-such-a-fun-age

We know from the vActual rating: 4.5 stars, rounded up.“Where does a mistake begin?”This is the opening line of Amity Gaige’s newest novel, Sea Wife. We know from the very beginning that something terrible has happened. We just don’t know the specifics of what or how. The story is told largely from two perspectives: Juliet in the present and her husband, Michael, in the past through the captain’s log he kept during their sailing year. There are a few different mysteries woven through the plot, but I felt that the story largely centers around what makes a marriage, and what ends one. Sea Wife is a deep, beautifully written novel with enough pace to the plot to maintain investment while also discussing timeless topics in fresh ways.“Tears or sweat—so many stories end in salt water.”Michael is determined to take his family on a year-long sailing trip, to get away from modern American life and consumer culture and just live life to the very fullest. Juliet is struggling: as a mother, as a wife, as a doctoral candidate, and a human being. And Michael believes with his whole being that this trip could be exactly what Juliet needs to combat her depression. Juliet acquiesces and, for better or worse, the couple and their two young children embark on the experience of a lifetime.“Everyone is hard to love, if you do it for long enough.”So many difficult topics are addressed within this novel. How a difference in political opinion and worldview can put incredible strain on a marriage. How trauma never goes away, no matter how many years you put between it and yourself. How kids are so much more resilient and brave and hardy than we often give them credit for. How just because loving someone becomes difficult doesn’t mean that it’s not worth the struggle. There are no easy answers, and Gaige doesn’t even try to put forth any. Instead, she captures the importance of questioning, and how vital a role said questioning plays in an individual’s mental health and in the longevity of any relationship.“Because love is tidal; it goes out, it comes in, it goes out.”The rare inclusions of a third perspective, their daughter Sybil’s, were jarring but sweet. She brought an added innocence to the novel. It’s easy to present a precocious child as selfish or obnoxious or glib, but Gaige fleshes Sybil out just as thoroughly as she does Juliet and Michael. Smart but kind, creative but observant, Sybil ended up being my favorite character, though I loved them all. “…children grow by inches and the rest of us inch toward the end.”Things get very meta as the plot progresses and we see Juliet’s interaction with Michael’s logbook. I love the framework of a book within a book, and this was a very different usage of that trope. However, it took me a bit to adjust to the (very abrupt) transitions between perspectives. Until I found the book’s rhythm, each transition was repeated whiplash. This is a case where having access to the audiobook is very helpful, as each perspective is voiced by a different person. I simultaneously read this book via audio and ebook, and that combination made for an incredibly immersive experience.“Our losses will never be done with us. They have endless patience.”Gaige did a great job presenting both sides of this political war between spouses. Both arguments were perfectly rational within the minds that housed them, so much so that the opposite party had no room in said mind for the other person’s argument. That’s why they could never understand one another: there was no room for understanding. This vast schism between their worldviews made for a lot of added tension, both in the novel and in the marriage it presented. “It’s true—history is written by the victors. That’s why we need poets. To sing of the defeats.”I love what Gaige has to say about poetry specifically and art as a whole through Juliet. These are the passages that resonated the most deeply with me. Juliet’s relationship with poetry, how it served as both solace and accuser, is fascinating. That’s a similar relationship to the one I have with art, specifically music. Art is both a window and a mirror, and Gaige demonstrated that beautifully.“I think you love your pain. It’s your poetry.”Sea Wife is insanely well written. The hardest thing I’ve done all week was narrowing down the dozens upon dozens of passages I highlighted into a manageable amount to include in this . Gaige has a gorgeous way of describing things, both tangible objects and intangible ideas, both nature and human nature. But yet again, this is another in the slew of new releases that seems morally opposed to the use of quotation marks. I can understand it in a way, as we’re getting the story from the minds of those who endured it, but it still throws me off. I don’t want quotation marks to go out of style. I like quotation marks, dang it.“Fair, what a useless word. A concept that is relevant only in the rare moments when there is no greater danger than unfairness.”The only other element I want to mention is the abundance of nautical terminology. I know some people have a difficult time connecting to stories that rely on jargon. That’s not this book. While plenty of such terms are present, they in no way hinder a nautically ignorant reader from sinking into the story. However, if you’re not a fan of ships as a setting, this one might not be for you.“The wind laughed. But the sea and I, we howled.”I found Sea Wife to be a thoughtful, intriguing, haunting novel with a captivating setting. I’d recommend this book to pretty much any reader, especially those who gravitate towards thoughtful prose and quiet, small-scale stories that act as a microcosm through which to view the world at large.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Jun 15, 2020","Jun 16, 2020","Jun 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49666975-sea-wife

An action that seems to only effect one person never does. Instead, even the smallest decisions can have far-reaching consequences, small ripples that grow into tidal waves. “After a secret’s been told, everyone becomes a prophet.”Nadia Turner is a Black girl with pain in her past and big things in her future. Her mother killed herself two years ago. Her father is still living in his grief, moving through life like a ghost. On top of it all, she just found out she’s pregnant, a product of her secret relationship with a pastor’s son, Luke Shepherd. She’s seventeen years old. Nadia is smart, too smart to let this baby ruin her life. She wants to go to college and see the world and be somebody, and refuses to make the same mistake she secretly believes drove her mother to suicide: keeping a child when it’s unwanted. And so, she makes the decision to get rid of it. This decision, one she struggled with, one she truly believed was private and personal, will still be sending shockwaves through her own life and the lives of others years into the future. “…magic you wanted was a miracle, magic you didn’t want was a haunting.”The majority of the chapters begin with a monologue from the collective Mothers, the older women of the church who watch life unfold around them with mingled concern and judgment. This inclusion feels very reminiscent of a Grecian chorus in some classical drama. They stand outside of time in a way, serving predominantly as observers passing along what they’ve seen from a future perspective, while the plot progresses more linearly through the perspective characters. These Mothers, who should be trying to fill the mother-shaped hole in Nadia’s life, instead stand apart to witness and pass judgment. But there comes a time when the Mothers can no longer maintain their separation and get involved in the action in their own way. Their interference also felt very true to that Grecian form, generally making things worse instead of better.“All good secrets have a takes before you tell them, and if we’d taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season.”I have to confess that, while I’ve always tried to read widely, I haven’t always read diversely. I don’t know whether this is an unintentional oversight on my part, or if I am subconsciously seeking comfort from the books I choose to read instead of growth. But in either case, I’ve realized this lack over recent years and have been trying to add more books by people of color, but specifically by Black women, into my reading queue. With everything going on in the world right now, that inclusion is becoming more and more purposeful. I’m so glad that decision led me to Brit Bennett. “These are not her heartbreaks. Every heart is fractured different and she knows the pattern of her cracks, she traces them like lines across her palm.”It’s wild to me that something this exquisitely written is a debut novel. I’ve read some truly stupendous debuts, and The Mothers is joining the ranks with the very best of those. Bennett has a beautiful, powerful way with words that manages to feel both profound and effortless in the same gorgeous sentences. There were layers of meaning packed into single thoughts, but those layers never felt forced or contrived in any way. It's not something I can comfortable recommend to readers like my mother and grandmother due to some of the content and language, but that's the only less than positive thing I can say about it. While the story itself was fraught with heartache and hard choices, there’s an easy elegance to Bennett’s writing that is honestly astounding.“Soft things can take a beating. But you push somethin’ hard a little bit and it shatters. You gotta be a soft thing in love. Hard love don’t last.”The Mothers is a dynamic, stirring portrayal of Black life on a small scale. It demonstrates just how interwoven lives are, no matter how alone you feel, and a cautionary reminder that even the most personal decisions can effect the lives of others in unforeseen ways. I was incredibly moved by this novel, and am in awe of its craftsmanship. Everything Brit Bennett writes from here on out will immediately be added to my reading list.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 10, 2020","Jun 12, 2020","Jun 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28815371-the-mothers

And we’re all wrong. We all, every single one of us, deserve those dreams. And we need to respect ourselves enough to get out of our own way and to at least try. The worst that can happen is that we fail, right? And how is that worse than never trying at all?Big Summer is a breezy, very current murder mystery. The perspective character, Daphne, is a plus-sized Instagram influencer who is about to be part of the biggest wedding to ever hit social media. But when someone winds up dead, Daphne finds herself trying to track down the murderer instead. “Everyone tries to put the best versions of themselves across. To fake it. And when they’re not doing that, they’re sitting behind their screens, passing judgment and feeling superior to whoever they think’s being sexist or racist that day.”I found Daphne incredibly relatable. She’s a woman who is trying to accept herself for who she is, in spite of a desperate desire to be thinner. While I’m not at all into social media, I appreciated that Daphne’s character wanted to use her posts and status as an influencer to help other women feel beautiful, no matter their size. “I was going to eat to nourish myself, I was going to exercise to feel strong and healthy, I was going to let go of the idea of ever being thin, once and for all, and live my life in the body that I had.”Like so many women, I’ve been plagued by self-image issues, especially since having a hysterectomy and putting on weight that no amount of exercise or healthy eating seem able to melt away. I have lived my adult life in a perpetual state of “when/then.” When I finally lose some weight, then I’ll record some music and make YouTube videos so I can get my voice out there. When I’m thinner, then I’ll finally try out for a play with the local theater troupe. When I’m not so big, then I won’t inwardly cringe every time someone pulls out a camera. Later this week, my co-bloggers and I are going to be video chatting for the first time ever and, while I’m thrilled by the fact that I’ll finally get to see their lovely faces while we chat, I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a part of me that is panicked, afraid that they’ll think less of me when my face appears on their screens. (I absolutely know that they would never judge me like this. Most fears are irrational, right?) All of that being said, I’m learning to accept myself for who I am instead of punishing myself for not being perfect. I know my worth. I’m funny and open and kind and smart. I’ve got a killer voice and a way with words. And dang it, I’m pretty, too. I’ll never be perfect, but neither will anyone else, no matter how airbrushed they appear on social media. I have every right to be comfortable in my body, even if that body doesn’t meet societal norms for beauty.End rant.Big Summer is not the type of book I would generally pick up. Honestly, I placed a library hold on a whim and, when the audiobook became available the same day I had to take a long drive, I decided to give it a go. While I rolled my eyes in a lot of places, I didn’t hate the characters, the idea of a wedding with such a heavy social media presence was intriguing, and I didn’t guess the murderer. It ended up being a pretty entertaining read.

While they are radically different, Hollywood Park is joining Educated as one of my favorites in this random subgenre for which I’ve developed such a fondness. Hearing about Mikel Jollett’s earliest years was incredibly illuminating, and was yet another true story that made me so incredibly thankful for the wonderful, easy childhood I had, and how foundational that gilded upbringing was in my becoming the person I am today.“Those nights I just go blank, like I could tie every bad thing inside me to a balloon and just let it float up into the sky, disappearing beyond the clouds.”I wish I could go back in time and save the child Jollett was during the opening chapters of his book. He tells the heartbreaking story of his childhood with grace and honesty and humor. I can’t even fathom having my earliest memories involving childhood in a cult., being broken out of said cult by my mother in the middle of the night. And I really can’t imagine a mother who is so self-absorbed, to the point of mental illness, that life in the cult was healthier than life outside of it. Even know Jollett obviously survived his childhood, as he couldn’t have written this memoir otherwise, but there were times I was genuinely concerned about his wellbeing as I read. Such was the power of his voice as a storyteller.“‘C-U-L-T’ is such an ugly word. It looks like the C is spitting the U right at the L. The T is standing still with its arms out, trying to keep its distance from the other letters. They don’t seem like four letters that want to be in the same word together. Maybe that’s why everyone looks so mad when they say it.”This memoir is written so beautifully. You can tell that Jollett is a musician and songwriter. There’s a beautiful rhythm to the prose, and so many sentences struck me as lyrics hiding within a story. Hollywood Park is yet another book that I heavily annotated, as there were countless lines, and sometimes entire paragraphs, that were too beautiful to read past without acknowledging that beauty in some way, even if that acknowledgment was merely highlighting those lines. Or calling my mom and reading those lines to her over the phone. I did a whole lot of that.“It’s a strange word. F-A-M-I-L-Y. It’s big and comforting and each letter is different. Just look at it. The F is for father right at the front. The M for mother is in the middle, connecting all the others. It’s a long word but usually people say it in one breath, like “famly” as if the I doesn’t matter. Without the F it’s just “ambly,” a thing that ambles around from place to place. Without the M it’s just a “Fably,” which is a story about something that does not exist…. The word seems to me like a cave, something big and simple you an walk inside to get away from a storm called loneliness.”My second favorite type of memoir, outside of the crazy childhoods and surviving them, is anything around the creation of art. Whether coming from the perspective of an author or a musician or an actor or a painter, I’m fascinated by not only the creation process, but what aspects of said artist’s life is the source of their inspiration. Jollett did a wonderful job explaining his songwriting process, and how both difficult and cathartic writing has been for him.“Why be normal? Destroy yourself and dance in the embers. Embrace the catharsis. Use it.”I loved hearing how inspired Jollett was by music as a young teen, and how he felt saved by it. I related to that on a soul-deep level. While I might not have gravitated toward the same type of artist that so drew Jollett, David Bowie and The Cure and such, I remember feeling so understood and seen by certain artists as a teen. Music has always been the language of my heart, and certain songs have gotten me through some terrible times in my life. I’m glad that Jollett found that same refuge, and then took that solace even further and found a way to not only verbalize his struggles through song lyrics, but to share those with the world. “That’s the whole magic trick of an essence brought to life by a song, to become an artist when you feel broken and you’ve decided to turn it into beauty. To make the pain useful… too broken to be normal, just broken enough to see beauty.”Mikel Jollett’s story is such a poignant one. I was moved to tears throughout the entirety of this memoir. While there was too much strong language for me to feel comfortable recommending it to anyone in my family, it’s a book I definitely intend to return to, whether to read from start to finish or to simply flip back through all of those beautiful lines I highlighted.

This book didn’t reach quite the same level of ick, but there was definitely some ick within these pages.“Sometimes she craved a little danger. And that was why she had book club.” Hendrix crafted a pretty great cast of characters. They’re funny without being cheesy. While the ladies who make up the titular book club have their ups and downs as a group and plenty of failings as individuals, they were easy to root for. But then you have their husbands. The condescension and misogyny wafting off every male in this book was infuriating. If I could have reached into the pages and strangled every single carrier of a Y chromosome, I would have leapt at the opportunity. I knew when the book opened with a 1970s definition of the word housewife as “a light, worthless woman or girl,” that I was in for a lot of chauvinism, and that proved to be the case. In spades. There was also a healthy dose of racism, and classism… just a lot of bad -isms. The Eighties and early Nineties were perfectly captured. I felt like I stepped into an episode of Stranger Things. The use of these decades as part of the setting are why the aforementioned sexism and other forms of prejudice were so enragingly believable.“I've had three children . . . And some man who's never felt . . . his baby crown is stronger than me? Is tougher than me?”As stated earlier, Hendrix knows how to insert some serious grossness into his stories. The wave of rats is going to haunt my nightmares. I can’t really think of a worse way to leave this mortal coil than being engulfed by and gnawed to death by innumerable rats. Also, I could have lived without so many mentions of pubic hair. It was uncalled for and icky on an entirely different level from the gross-out horror scenes. However, while this book is firmly lodged in the horror genre, it wasn’t actually very scary. I think Hendrix did a good job writing a horror story that could be marketed to those who generally steer clear of horror.“He thinks we’re what we look like on the outside: nice Southern ladies. Let me tell you something…there’s nothing nice about Southern ladies.”While not a literary masterpiece, The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires is a very engaging and entertaining read. I’ve heard some ers and podcasters list it as one of their favorite books of the year so far. While I didn’t love it to that extent, I did very much enjoy it. If you’re looking for something engrossing and different to distract you from the problems plaguing our world today, this book offers that escape.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jun 02, 2020","Jun 06, 2020","Jun 02, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44074800-the-southern-book-club-s-guide-to-slaying-vampires

At its core, it houses such a poignant window into mental illness and the victims it leaves behind when those struggling with it take their own lives. The portrayal of grief is brutal and beautiful and real. And yet this story is so much more than that. As she explores the Harvard campus on which her brother took his own life, Cady is faced with a plethora of mysteries. While her brother’s last days consume her from the start, she also finds herself digging into the university’s past as she grapples with fear over her own future. Ghosts of Harvard is a brilliant and seamless bridging of so many ideas and genres. I am in awe of how much research went into the writing of this book, and how Serritella was able to convey so much without a single aspect feeling forced. She struck a perfect balance in so many ways, and she truly gave the world a gift through the publication of this novel.“Then where’s the room for a leap of faith? Just because you can’t explain something doesn’t make it untrue.”Is there anything more terrifying that the fear of madness? The author does a brilliant job at portraying that fear in Cady. While she is compelled to investigate her brother’s suicide and discover what drove him during his last days, she is also fighting a rising terror that she is schizophrenic, as well. Her reactions are wholly believable without being either overly dramatic or unconvincingly nonchalant. Watching her spiral over the course of her investigation was disturbing and tense and filled me with a compassion for her that I find rarely invoked by fictional characters. Cady felt so real to me. She’s a bright girl who always lived in her brother’s shadow, and she doesn’t know how to do anything but follow in his footsteps. Cady is also one of the most internally aware and honest characters I’ve come across. She asks herself hard questions and tries her best to answer them, even when it’s impossible. She truly struggles to not only understand the brother who left her, but to learn who she is as a person, and I found this journey enthralling.“The say that fate is written in the stars, but the irony is that stars don’t project the future, they reflect the past… I like to think [the people we’ve lost] are like the stars. Their light hasn’t gone out. Candlelight goes out. But something as bright as a star, as a soul, that light moves on.”This is a novel of obsession. Cady is completely obsessed with learning all she can about her brother’s last year of life, and finding any little excuse she can grasp that might have finally pushed him over the edge into suicide. She is so consumed by this need for information that she begins seeing conspiracies in every shadow. How much of this need is madness worming its way into her own mind, and how much is actually real? And how can she maintain her grasp on reality, and her new life on an incredibly prestigious and difficult campus when she’s so wrapped up in the past?“But time was two-faced. Minutes that ticks by like any other were the moments that changed a life forever, yet revealed themselves too late.”Then there are the ghosts. The voices that Cady begins hearing in her head are one of the most fascinating elements of this novel. Are they an indicator that she is spiraling into madness? Are they supernatural phenomena? Or can they be explained by weird science along the lines of that explored in Blake Crouch’s most recent novels? All three possibilities were deftly juggled in a way that never tipped the author’s hand, but also didn’t feel frustratingly vague. There was one reveal in this ghostly aspect of the book that literally elicited a physiological response from me. With one word, or rather, one name, I found myself covered from shin to eyebrow with chills. It was a powerful moment.“Do we all pick only the best snapshots to remember in our mental scrapbooks and throw away the bad? Perhaps all photo albums should bear the subtitle The Past—The Way You Want to Remember It.”I’m a sucker for any novel revolving around or set within academia. Any school story is immediately appealing to me. Very few real-life schools are more well known than Harvard, so I was excited to pick up this book merely on the basis of the title. Thankfully, the school setting was truly utilized here, and the school itself became a very important character in its own right. The history of the school is fascinating, and I learned so much over the course of reading Ghosts of Harvard. And yet I never felt like Serritella was being too heavy-handed in her conveyance of this history, but instead balanced it very well against every other element of the story.“History is never as simple a narrative as we write in books.”Some people have expressed a frustration with the slow pacing of the book. I felt that pacing was actually very well maintained. Yes, the story meanders. But it’s meant to! Because we are experiencing Cady’s revelations alongside her, I felt that the pace of the story emphasized the time and care she as a character was putting into her hunt for answers. Her flashbacks were meted out in exactly the right amount. I never felt myself drowning in backstory, but was instead excited to see more of Cady’s past and how it had shaped her. I found the rhythm of the novel captivating. I also found the book far more unpredictable than I would have expected, which was a welcome surprise. This is a story that definitely keeps you on your toes.“She noticed how easy it was to edit someone’s past so that all the pieces of a person fit neatly together… The lie endures for generations, while the truth dies with its victims. But what were the consequences?”Probably my favorite element of this book was the philosophical bent to the writing. Serritella has a beautiful way with words, and I heavily annotated my copy. Not only does she write beautifully, she writes deeply. There was so much philosophical depth to this book. I was prompted to really think and self-evaluate over the course of the book. Not only was I touched by Cady’s story, I was actually impacted by it in a way that I truly believe will stick with me.“Adventure is only possible if you don’t spoil the ending.”Much like the university after which it is named, Ghosts of Harvard contains multitudes. This book is a campus mystery, a coming of age story, a scientific exploration of mental illness, a tale of espionage, a moving historical account, a romance, an esoteric dive into poetry and philosophy and faith and prejudice and a family drama. While this mingling could have led to a bloated and unpalatable slough, all of these elements were instead woven together with a level of grace and care that is truly rare. It was everything I hoped it would be and more, and I will be doing my best to get it into as many hands as I can. It’s a book that will haunt me, and I gladly welcome it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"May 27, 2020","Jun 02, 2020","May 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52179715-ghosts-of-harvard

If I were asked to describe the book in one word, that word would be: AWWW. It was sweet and heartfelt and incredibly funny, with enough drama and depth to keep itself from becoming overly saccharine. The romance was made even better by the fact that it was between two writers.  “And that was the moment I realized: when the world felt dark and scary, love could whisk you off to go dancing; laughter could take some of the pain away; beauty could punch holes in your fear. I decided then that my life would be full of all three.” Two authors who write in wildly different genres but decide to swap for the summer, to see who could most easily don the other’s writerly hat, so to speak. So the literary fiction guy who doesn’t believe in happy endings has to try his hand at a rom-com, while the romance author attempts to pen something bleak and high brow. I found that role reversal such a fun one, especially as someone who is infatuated with writing as an art form. Being given the chance to observe the lifestyle of a writer is always a joy, and that was especially true with this book. “That was what I'd always loved about reading, what had driven me to write in the first place. That feeling that a new world was being spun like a spiderweb around you and you couldn't move until the whole thing had revealed itself to you.” I loved what Henry had to say about the writing process and literature and the publishing world through her characters. At one point January, the perspective character, goes on a rant about how women’s fiction shouldn’t be a genre, and I wholeheartedly agree with her. I read a healthy amount of novels that are billed as women’s fiction, but I never classify them as such myself. If the same exact story was penned by a male it would just be considered fiction, so I think that’s what we should call it. I don’t think any art should be labeled based on the sex organs of its creator or potential consumers. We don’t endorse that type of labeling with any other medium, so why do we do it with books? “If you swapped out all my Jessicas for Johns, do you know what you'd get? Fiction. Just fiction. Ready and willing to be read by anyone, but somehow by being a woman who writes about women, I've eliminated half the Earth's population from my potential readers, and you know what? I don't feel ashamed of that. I feel pissed.” I adore January. She’s such a beautiful mess of a human being. January has lived her entire life secure in the fact that things will work out. Even in the midst of hardship, like her mother’s battles with cancer, she has steadfastly believed in silver linings and glasses that are half full. The death of her father and revelations regarding his life rock her optimism to its core, and she can’t seem to claw her way back to her sunny disposition. This has drastically impeded her writing, as it’s hard to pen happily ever afters when you no longer believe in them. But a change of scenery, a renewed acquaintance with a former classmate, and the bet the two strike that has them swapping genres for the summer has her trying to rebuild herself and learning to accept that, while everything might not be rainbows and kittens, those things do still exist.  “... true love had seemed like the grand prize, the one thing that could weather any storm, save you from both drudgery and fear, and writing about it had felt like the single most meaningful gift I could ever give. And even if that part of my worldview was taking a brief sabbatical, it had to be true that sometimes, heartbroken women found their happy endings, their rain-falling, music-swelling moments of pure happiness.”  There were some laugh-out-loud funny scenes in Beach Read. Quite a few of them, actually. I can honestly say that, for the majority of the book, I was reading with a grin plastered across my face. But there was quite a bit of drama, as well. It never felt overblown, but life was far from perfect for either January or Gus, her former classmate turned romantic interest. Those imperfections made the story more believable and relatable, in my opinion. We all have our issues, right? These two are not exception to that. “Bad things don't dig down through your life until the pit's so deep that nothing good will ever be big enough to make you happy again. No matter how much shit, there will always be wildflowers.”  I enjoyed Beach Read so much. Part of that enjoyment was finding the right book at the right time, but I also think I would have loved it no matter when I chose to read it. I’m buying myself a physical copy so I can shelve it next to my Nora Roberts collection, because I loved it with the same fervor I feel for Nora’s books. This is a book I definitely intend to revisit, and to revisit often. Finding a new comfort read is such a wonderful feeling.

I’ve never read Ann Patchett before, but I quickly became infatuated with her storytelling over the course of this novel. To be completely honest, this was a 5 star read until the last ten pages. I shouldn’t have been so blindsided by the climactic events. The story does, after all, revolve around opera. But I was indeed blindsided. I feel slightly scarred. It was still a great book, and one that I might even read again someday, but the list of people to whom I would recommend it shrunk significantly in those last pages.“Some people are born to make great art and others are born to appreciate it. Don't you think? It is a kind of talent in itself, to be an audience, whether you are the spectator in the gallery or you are listening to the voice of the world's greatest soprano. Not everyone can be the artist. There have to be those who witness the art, who love and appreciate what they have been privileged to see.” In an unnamed South American country, a birthday party is being held in the home of the nation’s vice president. Mr. Hosokawa, the Japanese businessman who is being celebrated, would never have attended if not bribed with a private performance by his favorite opera singer, Roxane Coss. Immediately after the final notes are sung, every party attendee is taken hostage by a terrorist group. The terrorists invaded with the very distinct purpose of kidnapping the president and holding him for ransom in order to free their compatriots from prison. There’s one snag in this plan: the president isn’t in attendance. It just so happens that Mr. Hosokawa’s birthday fell on a Tuesday night. The president catches up on his soap opera on Tuesday nights, and even such a distinguished and economically important an event will not draw him away from his television on this night. The terrorists find themselves with over a hundred hostages instead of the one important hostage they sought.“If someone loves you for what you can do then it's flattering, but why do you love them? If someone loves you for who you are then they have to know you, which means you have to know them.”This is such a deep dive of a character study. So many people from so many backgrounds are kept together for an extended period of time, outside of the professions that have defined them and without even the ability to chat with the others without the help of the lone translator in the group. The impact that the language barrier has on the group is immense. And yet, at the same time, it means absolutely nothing. What can bind up together during such a time? Music. Music is the language that everyone on the planet shares, no matter the language in which the lyrics are written. The way Patchett portrayed music and its importance spoke to me on such a deep level. With the aid of music, we see love cross the barrier of language, and it is beautiful to behold. I truly believe that music is one of the most powerful forces in the universe, and Patchett conveyed that very well.“She sang as if she was saving the life of every person in the room.”It’s amazing what strange circumstances to which you can adjust yourself. Even when you find yourself in terrible situation you never could’ve expected, sometimes you can find immense beauty in weirdness and even discomfort. And you can keep learning no matter where you are. Education plays a fanscinating role in this book. Not only how it impacts the life you live, but also how thirsty minds can find ways to learn in any situation.“It makes you wonder. All the brilliant things we might have done with our lives if only we suspected we knew how.”Bel Canto is a brilliant novel, even if I didn’t care for the ending. Honestly, as much as I disliked those final events, I could have respected Patchett’s choice far more had she not tacked on an epilogue that felt like a weak attempt to pacify fans by giving them a semblance of a happy ending. If you’re someone who can handle fictional tragedy and uncomfortable situations, and especially if you love music in literature as much as I do, I recommend picking up Bel Canto. Just brace yourself as you near those final pages.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 22, 2020","May 26, 2020","May 22, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

There’s something about his style of storytelling that can make even the most grotesque tales a delight to read. And when given the opportunity to listen to him reading his own words, I never pass it up. His verbal storytelling is even more entertaining than his writing, and I so enjoyed being able to simultaneously read and listen to this book and its prequel, Mythos.Where Mythos told the stories of the Greek pantheon, from their inception to their deeds, Heroes recounts the tales of, well, heroes. Greek mythology relies almost as heavily on the exploits of heroes as it does on the fickle interference of the gods. In this book, Fry covers most of the more famous heroes of Ancient Greece. The greatest hits, if you will. Over the course of its more than 400 pages, Fry recounts in Heroes the tales of Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, Orpheus, Jason, Atalanta, Oedipus, and Theseus. I was at first confused by the omission of Achilles and Odysseus, but it was recently announced that Fry will be publishing a further volume, Troy, about the events of The Iliad and The Odyssey. But of the heroes covered, Fry did an excellent job really digging into their lives and presenting them as three-dimensional characters, shying away from neither their attributes nor their weaknesses. It’s easy to see how much research and care was put into the writing of this book and Mythos, and they manage to be both accessible to those unfamiliar with the stories and a fun way to revisit for those who are well exposed to the material.“You see?' said Prometheus. 'It is your fate to be Heracles the hero, burdened with labours, yet it is also your choice. You choose to submit to it. Such is the paradox of living. We willingly accept that we have no will.”Besides the sassy approach Fry takes to his storytelling, one of my favorite elements of both this book and Mythos is the inclusion of so much etymology. The origin of words and phrases has always fascinated me, and the same must be true of Fry for him to have includes so much information regarding those derivations. However, I honestly could have lived without some of that information. For instance, the origins of the terms Milky Way and galaxy as referring to Hera’s sprayed breast milk is something I did not know. Not sure I needed to know, but I know it I do. And I can’t un-know it.Heroes seems a bit overly silly in tone compared to Mythos, but it’s still fun. I can’t get enough of Fry’s recounting of Greek mythology, and I will undoubtedly be rereading both of these books periodically. I can’t wait to get my hands on Troy, Fry’s retelling of the the Trojan War and the events that followed. These books are such a wonderfully easy way to brush up on your knowledge of Greek mythology, and ensure that you have a lot of fun while learning.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"May 21, 2020","May 29, 2020","May 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49533747-heroes

Feral children shun growing up with every ounce of energy in their bodies. Adults, and thus their future selves, are the enemy. This extreme dislike is compounded by the knowledge that their parents and every other grown up is handing down to them a swiftly dying planet. The resentment and impotent rage radiates off the page.  A Children’s Bible contains the weirdest interpretation of the Bible I’ve ever come across. The Bible is a mystery? God is nature and Jesus is science? There is also a ton of symbolic imagery that was both interesting and off-putting. There were some weird environmental moments that reminded me of Annihilation, not in the physical appearance portrayed but in tone.What made this book feel different is that it’s not about kids in a post-apocalyptic world but kids experiencing the apocalypse as it happened. It honestly felt a little too believable in the current social climate we’re living in. This is especially seen in the ways the parents try (and fail) to deal with what’s going on, and in their decision to ignore everything as long as they can and drug themselves into a stupor instead of actually facing the situation. Ultimately, A Children’s Bible is just disconcerting. The ending or lack thereof is uncomfortably bleak. Part of me thinks the book is incredibly apt for the times in which we’re living, but the rest of me thinks that the timing of its publication made it very unenjoyable.

Do we have The Shining to thank for this, or is it an idea that has been around for as long as people have been paying to spend the night in beds not their own? A hotel full of ghosts is what I came into this book expecting to find, and I did get that to a very small extent. But most of the plot revolves around two girls, thirty-five years apart, playing Nancy Drew. It was fine, but not what I was hoping for.The Sun Down Motel is an interesting setting that I wish would have been further explored. The hauntings that plague the motel are accepted as real and readers are even given affirmation from multiple characters that these ghosts truly exist and can be experienced by anyone at the hotel who is sensitive enough in nature and willing to believe. Unfortunately, these hauntings feel very blasé, taken for granted and the effects of their presence on those who can see them not emotionally explored.

The tone is just hilarious. Lillian, the perspective character, is absoluteNothing to See Here is one of the funniest books I’ve read in a long time. The tone is just hilarious. Lillian, the perspective character, is absolutely bonkers and I adore her. She’s tough and kooky and always afraid that she’s going to mess things up, and I just want to be her friend more than anything. This book is short and breezy without being shallow, and it completely transported me into this beyond weird circumstance in the midst of normalcy. “I wasn’t destined for greatness; I knew this. But I was figuring out how to steal it from someone stupid enough to relax their grip on it.” Lillian’s life isn’t great. She was raised very poor. As a young teen, she worked her butt off to get a scholarship to a prestigious girl’s boarding school in her town. This is where she meets her best friend in the world, Madison. Madison is gorgeous and filthy rich but is just as much of a weirdo deep down as Lillian. Even after Madison’s dad pays Lillian’s mom off to allow Lillian to be blamed for something Madison did, even after Lillian is expelled for this and loses her shot at getting out of this town and building a better for herself, she still loves Madison. So when Madison, now the wife of a senator, begs Lillian to help her through a weird situation, Lillian can’t say no, even though she’s let herself be beaten down by life and isn’t sure what she could possibly offer her friend.“From that point on, I guess I sort of realized that my imagination, which made life tolerable, needed to be kept a secret from the rest of the world. But if you keep something hidden away, all tied up, it’s hard to summon it when you really need it.” Turns out what Madison needs is someone who is fiercely loyal to her and able to keep a secret. Lillian is her girl on both counts. This is how Lillian suddenly finds herself caring for Madison’s senator husband’s twin ten-year-olds from his previous marriage. While she doesn’t see how she’s at all qualified to take care of kids, Lillian agrees to the task. That’s when Madison drops a bomb: these kids spontaneously combust when agitated. It doesn’t harm the kids in any way; the flames don’t even singe their hair. But obviously they’re incredibly destructive and their weirdness needs to be kept under wraps. Lillian decides that she will do whatever it takes to keep these kids safe, and she throws herself into caring for them.“Maybe raising children was just giving them the things you loved most in the world and hoping that they loved them too.” The random spontaneous combustion of these kids is the only element of Nothing to See Here that might cause it to be classified as magical realism. Everything else is firmly based in reality. Bessie and Roland, the kids in question, are basically feral after having been raised in isolation by their now dead mother. But Lillian clicks with them immediately. Their relationship is a joy to watch bloom. “You took care of people by not letting them know how badly you wanted your life to be different.” While the premise of combustable children is pretty attention-grabbing, what made Nothing to See Here work so well for me was the humor that oozed out of every page. Lillian is quite possibly my favorite narrator of any book ever. This is another novel that was simply fabulous on audio. I felt that Ireland added even more quirkiness to an already crazy character through her narration. Her Southern drawl was insanely thick and served the story incredibly well, and it lended the book an even stronger sense of place. “A lot of times when I think I’m being self-sufficient, I’m really just learning to live without the things that I need.” I have nothing negative to say about this book. I’m looking forward to digging into Wilson’s back catalogue, as this was the first of his work I’ve ever read. Nothing to See Here is the best kind of crazy. If you’re looking for something that will make you laugh and remind you that your problems could always be worse, this is the exact right book for you.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"May 13, 2020","May 15, 2020","May 13, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/42519313-nothing-to-see-here

While there was indeed adventure in these pages, I found so much more than that. Hannah giveI came into The Great Alone expecting an adventure story. While there was indeed adventure in these pages, I found so much more than that. Hannah gives her readers a peak into not only Alaska, but into love in all its forms and scope and limitless variety. We see the love of a child for their parent and a parent for their child, and how far each would go to protect the other. We see romantic love so twisted that it becomes deadly to at least one party, and romantic love so strong and pure that it can conquer the worst adversities. We see the love that can grow within a community, and how family can form among completely unrelated people. And lacing all of these loves together, we see the love that nature can foster within a human heart, even when said nature is just as brutal and dangerous as it is stunningly beautiful. “I think you stand by the people you love.” The Great Alone is not at all a romance novel, though there is romance within its pages. It is a study of all the various types of love listed above. It is a display of the tenacity of the human spirit, and how much one can overcome, especially for the sake of another. It’s a coming of age story unlike any I’ve read before. And above all, it is a love letter to Alaska, the Great Alone. Rarely have I read a book with such a strong sense of place. I was completely captivated by its deadly beauty and, while I have no desire to move there myself, I can understand why those that do reside there become so fiercely loyal to and defined by the land that is their home.“Alaska isn't about who you were when you headed this way. It's about who you become.”The potential fragility of familial love isn’t something I think of often. I’ve been blessed with an incredibly stable and selfless family, and we love each other fiercely. But that love doesn’t have a lot to overcome to remain strong. And I’m incredibly thankful for that. Leni Allbright’s parents, Ernt and Cora, love each other. But it’s a poisonous, all consuming, jealous love that spins further and further out of control as Leni grows up. Being a prisoner of war in the Vietnam War changed Leni’s dad, and not for the better. Cora loves Ernt anyway, and so does Leni, but the woman and the girl live on edge, afraid that the least little thing they do wrong might set him off. When a fellow soldier dies and leaves Ernt his homestead in Alaska, the Allbrights pack up their lives and head north. They have no idea what they’re in for. But here, for the very first time, Leni feels like she’s found a home. Alaskan life might be incredibly hard, but it’s worth every drop of sweat.“You don’t stop loving a person when they’re hurt. You get stronger so they can lean on you.” If I had to define The Great Alone in one word, that word would be harrowing. Reading this book was emotionally exhausting and incredibly tense, but worth it. I’m not a big crier, especially over words on a page. But I cried my way through the last third of this particular book. My Novel Notions co-bloggers insisted that I share the fact that I finished reading this while sobbing into my pasta. I seasoned my lunch with the salt of my tears. I wish I was kidding. It broke me, y’all. I was so exhausted by the time it was over that I had to go sleep it off. And I’m not a napper. I can’t remember the last time I had such a visceral response to a book. The mother-daughter relationship at the heart of this book is the source of most of my wildly fluctuating emotions. The quote below actually made me put the book down and walk to my parents' house, because I was bawling my eyes out and I desperately needed to hug my own mama. You are my heart, baby girl. You are everything I did right. And I want you to know I would do it all again, every wonderful terrible second of it. I would do years and years of it again for one minute with you.”  I have a tendency to bounce between formats when reading a book. I have a physical copy that I would read, and then I would listen while walking my dog or folding laundry. By the time I was past the halfway point of The Great Alone, I had completely abandoned the physical copy. Julia Whelan narrated the audiobook and I think she did an absolutely brilliant job. It was a pitch perfect performance that added a lot to an already incredible book.“Books are the mile markers of my life. Some people have family photos or home movies to record their past. I’ve got books. Characters. For as long as I can remember, books have been my safe place.”The Great Alone is a phenomenal story of love and resilience and stark, deadly beauty. There is some pretty hard content in this book, especially regarding violence, but I feel that the darkness made the brightness within it even more brilliant. This is one of my favorite books I’ve read this year, and I will definitely be reading more of Hannah’s work in the not-too-distant future. I’ve been really missing out. The only novel of hers I had read before this was The Nightingale, which I loved, so I plan not to wait so long between her books from here on out. I’m already looking forward to rereading The Great Alone, in all of its formats, and my physical copy now has a place on the shelf that houses my lifetime favorites. I can’t praise it highly enough.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"May 10, 2020","May 13, 2020","May 10, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43263516-the-great-alone

Parry managed to stay completely faithful to the persons and events that make up the true history of this time period while deftly adding in the existence of magic and exemplifying how that existence might have impacted the French Revolution and the British fight to abolish the slave trade. Historical figures like William Pitt, William Wilberforce, Toussaint Bréda L’Ouverture, and Maximilien Robespierre are all exquisitely portrayed both as individuals that really existed and fictional characters whose minds were are invited to explore. Parry balanced this contrast beautifully. She could have rewritten history in a way that made it somehow less. She could have stayed so true to history that the narrative felt more like a nonfiction text than a novel. But she did neither of those things. She was able to bridge that divide in a way that both informs and inspires, that encourages both historical curiosity and fantastical imaginings. I’m truly in awe of what she was able to do with this novel.“And beneath the surface, something was moving. Something that spoke of change, and of revolution, and of blood.”One of the things I loved most about this book is how the importance in friendship is demonstrated in each of the three plot-lines. Pitt and Wilberforce, Robespierre and Camille, Toussaint and Fina (a character of Parry’s own imagination) are the central hubs around which this triune story orbits, and their relationships with one another play incredibly important roles in history. These relationships are what kept the story from seeming too dry. I especially loved the friendship between Pitt and Wilberforce, and was always excited when the narrative swung back in their direction. Parry has a gift with her craftsmanship of witty dialogue that feels appropriate to the time period without ever seeming stuffy. I found every debate and conversation a pleasure to read because of this.“It isn’t about proving what we can be. It’s about becoming what we can be.”Slavery is the most heinous act we as humans have ever wrought upon one another. I didn’t think it could be portrayed in a worse light than its reality, but Parry managed to make it even more horrifying with her addition of spellbinding slaves by forcing them to ingest magical elixirs that deprived them of all outward freewill. I can’t imagine not being able to control my body at all, with every single blink and twitch dictated by someone who has decided that I am property. And to make matters in the book even worse, the spellbound slaves are still completely aware inside their minds and are screaming for release and fighting a losing battle for control of their own bodies. The concept is terrifying.“To some extent, we all have the capacity to become monsters.”While I very much enjoyed the book, I must confess that I found myself getting bogged down in the legislation pretty frequently. This isn’t Parry’s fault, as the synopsis is very clear regarding the plot of the book, and it’s a plot that is necessarily very reliant on legality and politics. However, this obviously results in a slower pace and less action that some fantasy readers expect from the books they choose, so just be aware that this book is more of an alternate history that involves magic than it is a fantasy novel. While I haven’t yet read it myself, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell sprang immediately to mind within the first twenty pages, and I believe that fans of that novel will find Parry’s sophomore work very appealing.“I sometimes think ‘just this once’ is the most dangerous phrase in the English language.”My only other qualm with A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians is Parry’s choice of ending. For such a large, often meandering novel, the ending felt very abrupt and left me unsatisfied. If there is a sequel planned, I will be much more content upon learning of its existence. But as I went into this book believing it to be a standalone, I was a bit frustrated when I read the final chapter and saw that I had reached the end before more of the plot-lines were tied up.“Liberty, what crimes are committed in your name!”Parry is a brilliant author. She has a wonderful flow to her prose that feels both effortless and highly intelligent. I know how much research goes into a book like this, but Parry tells the story in such a way that the reader is able to forget how much work went into it and simply lose themselves in the writing. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed both novels I’ve read from her, and I can’t wait to see what she puts out next. But I’m clinging to hope that said next book will be a continuation of this particular story.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jun 19, 2020","Jul 14, 2020","May 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51862863-a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians

It’s over. Well, at least The Iliad is, though the story continues in The Odyssey. I had forgotten how much the beginning of this epic souHallelujah. It’s over. Well, at least The Iliad is, though the story continues in The Odyssey. I had forgotten how much the beginning of this epic sounds like a giant group of toddlers fighting over toys. These toddlers just happen to command warships and armies, and the toys happen to be women they view as war prizes. Frankly, it’s disgusting. If these idiotic “heroes” would just view women as actual people who can make their own decisions instead of pretty toys over which to wage war, every single event in this story could have been avoided. Had they just asked Helen who she wanted to be with and respected that decision, hundreds of lives would have been saved. The amount of bloodshed over the “taking” of this woman is just insanely wasteful, even if it’s fictional.“Any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.”The gods are so incredibly petty. If Monopoly is the board game that ruins families, the gods of Olympus are playing something similar with cities and human lives. Men and women are literal pawns to them, game pieces and very little else. They claim to care about some of these people, but it’s a very shallow kind of care. Seriously, they’re terrible. And as 70% of Greek mythology is directly tied to Zeus’s inability to keep it in his toga and Hera’s rage over that fact, it can’t even be pretended that the gods cared about much outside of their own desires and fury.“Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.”Honestly, this is a cast completely comprised of hypocrites. All of these men deeply believe they commit a travesty against another person but is then surprised and horrified if something similar is done to themselves or someone close to them.  For instance, if the whole war is occurring due to the theft of a woman (more on that above), then why on earth would you take the “prize” of your greatest warrior because you’re feeling slighted? How did you think that was going to work out for you? And if your heart is set on desecrating the dead body of said warrior’s bestie, who isn’t even fighting in the war because of the aforementioned lady theft, why on earth would you be shocked that he decides to not only finally engage in the war but that he’s out for your blood and intends to disrespect your corpse in the same ways? Seriously, people. What the heck?“Let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.”These warriors are also insanely self-absorbed. To a man, every single one of them act as if their feelings are the only ones that matter. Their mourning is the only true mourning. Their rage is the only true rage. This is doubly true for the divine beings that populate the story, as stated earlier. I seriously cannot fathom being this level of selfish, and I sincerely pray that I never become this wrapped up in myself. If I do, some one please punch me in the throat and snap me out of it, will you? “Why so much grief for me? No man will hurl me down to Death, against my fate. And fate? No one alive has ever escaped it, neither brave man nor coward, I tell you - it’s born with us the day that we are born.”Unrelated to anything, but I could also go the rest of my life without hearing anyone else referred to as “god-like” or their speech referred to as “winged words.” Those terms were exasperatingly overused. However, there are some truly beautiful lines mixed into the free verse, and those almost made up for the repetition mentioned. I know both of these observations are subject to change based on which translation you choose to read. I bounced between the Caroline Alexander translation and the Robert Fagles translation, both of which were lovely.“No man or woman born, coward or brave, can shun his destiny.”I respect The Iliad. I know it’s among the earliest literary pieces we have, and that it paved the way for countless stories that followed. But, as with the times I read this epic in the past, whether in part or entirety, I just can’t enjoy something that makes me roll my eyes this hard or groan this often. That opinion is incredibly subjective, and I know many people who disagree. But the abundance of wholly preventable violence, and the lack of anything else to break up said violence, just isn’t at all enjoyable for me. Thankfully, The Odyssey comes after this, and I know that it’s far and above more entertaining. I may not care for the tale of the Trojan War, but Odysseus’s return trip is wild and I’m eager to dive back into it.Another buddy read with TS!You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"May 05, 2020","May 21, 2020","May 05, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25806615-the-iliad

The story ended up being so much more hopeful than I expected. Edward’s journey from normalcy Actual rating: 4.5 stars, rounded up.I loved this book. The story ended up being so much more hopeful than I expected. Edward’s journey from normalcy to survival to learning to live again is incredibly encouraging to anyone who has ever undergone trauma. Because no matter what we’ve faced in our lives, next to none of us have ever undergone a tragedy quite like the one Edward endures.“There is a note of relief. They have somewhere to start, even if it is the worst place imaginable.”We know from the synopsis that something terrible is going to happen to flight 2977, and that Edward is going to be the lone survivor. There was some part of me that expected this to be a different type of survival story, one where Edward finds himself alone amid the rubble and has to make his way back to civilization with nothing but his wits and luck to guide him through some kind of wilderness. That is not this story. Edward is found amid the wreckage. He recuperates in a hospital and has family that takes him in. But this is still the tale of how he survived emotionally what killed his parents and brother and nearly two hundred others. “What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?”Napolitano does a brilliant job of portraying grief in all its stages. And she does it through the growth of a child, which adds an extra layer of difficulty to what her protagonist is facing. We see Edward not only survive the crash, we also observe his physical healing and growth as he ages. As much as he might wish otherwise, the development of his body means that he’s growing up and away from those he lost. I can’t imagine my own growth from child to teen and beyond being a source of pain for me because it was a constant reminder that I lived where my family did not. But children are resilient, and Edward proves that again and again, even if that resiliency is against his own will.“Everything ends,” she says. “That’s nothing to be sad about. What matters is what starts in that moment.”I find it so interesting that the loss that breaks Edward is not that of his parents, but that of his brother. There can never be enough books about positive sibling relationships, in my opinion. My brother is one of my very best friends, and I can’t imagine losing him. I’m fortunate enough to also have a wonderful relationship with my parents, who I still see everyday, but there’s something so special about having a sibling who you not only love, but actually enjoy being around. That’s the kind of relationship that Edward and his brother, Jordan, had. Edward feels like he has to live his life not only for himself, but for his older brother who never had a chance to grow up. But does he own that same to every other passenger who perished on the flight that left him a brother-less orphan? Is there some reason that he was the lone survivor, or was it just luck?“Take stock of who we are, and what we have, and then use it for good.”This is a story about the difference between surviving and actually living. How many of us are satisfied with floating from day to day merely existing and carrying on a well-worn cycle we’ve built for ourselves? If you had survived something as traumatic as a plane crash, would you feel that you needed to live your life more intentionally instead of simply coasting? I hope that, when my time on earth comes to an end, I and those I leave behind will feel that I made the most of every single day.“This was not a tragedy. Dying on your couch watching TV by yourself is a tragedy. Dying while doing something you love with every part of your body is magic. I wish you magic, Edward.”Dear Edward was not an easy book. But it was ultimately a hopeful one. It’s a unique if painful take on the classic coming-of-age trope. Though the subject matter was heartbreaking, it was handled in such a way that the story was compulsively readable and interlaced with humor, both in Edward’s present and in the multi-character narration of the events of the flight itself. This is an incredibly well balanced book that I feel could be the right book for just about any adult reader.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"May 04, 2020","May 10, 2020","May 04, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45294613-dear-edward

The writing is so vivid and transporting that I felt like I indwelled each character during their prospective chapters. It’s also one of the most tragic, heartbreaking stories I’ve read in a very long time. My heart almost physically ached during my time reading this book. But most of all, Valentine is immensely powerful. It proclaims an almost rebellious resilience in the face of heinous adversity that is fiercely and unequivocally feminist, and I felt impacted by it at a soul-deep level.“Mercy is hard in a place like this…”It took me a bit of time to adjust to the author’s choice to not include quotation marks in her dialogue. After I acclimated, I really appreciated this decision, because it ensured that readers are getting the story exclusively from the minds of the perspective characters. I realized that not a single man actually spoke a word over the course of this story. Every line of male dialogue is conveyed by the woman who remembers it, and there was something profound about that decision. Wetmore is giving a voice to the women who live their lives unheard, and denying a voice to the men who have kept these women quiet. The marginalized and disenfranchised are given the chance to scream their pain and rage at the top of their lungs, even if only inside their minds. They will be ignored no longer, at least in the pages of this book.“Every August for the nearly thirty years she taught English, in an overheated classroom filled with farm boys and cheerleaders and roughneck wannabes reeking of aftershave and perfume, Corinne would spot the name of at least one misfit or dreamer on her fall roster. In a good year there might be two or three of them—the outcasts and weirdoes, the cellists and geniuses and acne ridden tuba players, the poets, the boys whose asthma precluded a high school football career and the girls who hadn’t learned to hide their smarts. Stories save lives, Corinne had said to those students. To the rest of them she said, I’ll wake you when it’s over.”The terror induced by motherhood is thoroughly explored here, and how that fear can reshape a life. Motherhood is also shown as something to be feared in and of itself in a time and town where girls are kicked out of school just as soon as they’re visibly pregnant, and that condition seems to befall most every girl in the area while they’re still children themselves. We also see how racism, money, and rigid gender roles can choke a town into something poisoned and utterly devoid of kindness. We see a time when domestic abuse was so common that most didn’t even consider it abuse, and when victim shaming was so expected that rape victims kept silent. We see prejudice in a multitude of forms. But we also see a ferocity in these women and girls, and sometimes even mercy on behalf of others though they themselves have been shown none. They are survivors who have fought for that survival, and no man will take it from them.“In the church where I grew up, we were taught that sin, even if it happens only in your heart, condemns you all the same. Grace is not assured to any of us, maybe not even most of us, and while being saved gives you a fighting chance, you must always hope that the sin lodged in your heart, like a bullet that cannot be removed without killing you, is not of the mortal kind.”There was no melodrama in this story. Every moment of drama was real and harsh and necessary. Something about this book reminded me of certain classic Greek tragedies like Antigone or Medea. Not the plot, but the idea of women surviving adversity and finding strength and a voice in spite of the men who wish to suppress them. Madeline Miller’s Circe evoked a similar aura of resiliency around her title character. This could have made every male character in the periphery of Valentine into a crude caricature, but Wetmore didn’t paint all men as evil; just some men. We see a loving husband and a caring uncle and a gentle friend, who serve as reminders that savagery is a choice made, not a genetic component that comes with a penis. But we also see women who are afraid to speak up for themselves or for others, who purposely turn a blind eye because they don’t want to feel uncomfortable. All of these characters, whether male or female, perspective or secondary, are utterly and completely human, with all the good and ill that title holds.“Our great-grandmothers feigned frailty until it was stitched to their hearts. Some of us still do the same. To speak up would require courage that we cannot even begin to imagine.Are we guilty? We are guilty as sin, guilty as the day is long. If we every stopped and thought about it for very long, and we try not to, our guilt would be as bright and heavy as sunlight in August.”This is a book where setting really matters. I’ve been in an oil town during a boom, and Wetmore captured it exactly. These towns become their own weird microcosm within society, and draw more criminals and their crimes than just about anywhere else in the States. Wetmore also did a great job of painting Texas in all its beautiful desolation. I could taste the dust and smell the gas and feel the storms brewing in the background. Texas might be harsh and hot, but there is nothing quite as breathtaking as seeing that expanse of sky, whether it’s blue as far as the eye can see or scattered with countless stars or turning the purple of a bruise as a storm moves in. And Wetmore was able to present both sides of this location incredibly well. As did the cover art, actually. Those rigs in the background could almost be horses. The writing was stellar, as well, and is what sets this novel more in the literary fiction genre than strictly historical fiction, in my opinion.“In wrath may you remember mercy…”Valentine is the most powerful debut I’ve read outside of the fantasy genre since I fell in love with The Resurrection of Joan Ashby. I was moved and enraged by nearly every page. It made me think, and reminded me to really appreciate where and when I live. I’m incredibly thankful that no part of this book felt like a page out of my own life. While it is definitely a difficult book to read due to the content, I absolutely recommend Valentine to any reader who wants a rallying cry to stand up for those who have been marginalized, and a reason to applaud those who live through trauma and don’t let it define them.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,May 2020,"May 03, 2020","May 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52377380-valentine

Very rarely do I binge read a particular author. I feel the need to mix things up in my reading life or I findI’ve been reading a lot of King lately. Very rarely do I binge read a particular author. I feel the need to mix things up in my reading life or I find myself burned out and unable to appreciate a book I should love because I’ve consumed too much of the same thing in a row. I might love pizza, but I would find it far less palatable if I had to eat it for every meal. I feel the same way about my literary diet. So I’m a readerly butterfly, flitting from author to author and genre to genre as they grab my attention. However, this is my fourth King novel in a row, and it’s the fourth in a row I’ve thoroughly enjoyed. I think that’s because each of these four novels, whether King penned them alone or with the aid of a co-author as with this book, vary drastically from everything else I’ve read by him. And yet what makes them so incredible is the way they tie into each other and refer back to things King wrote before them and foreshadow books he would write after. The Talisman is the first book King coauthored with Peter Straub, who is an author I’m unfamiliar with. However, after reading this book I’m interested to try something he wrote independently. Because The Talisman was wild, y’all. This book contains the most hardcore, horrifying hero’s journey I’ve ever encountered. Some of the more recent King books I’ve read felt very removed from the horror genre. While they might’ve had instances of horror, that is not the genre in which I would classify them. Not so with The Talisman. While the story relies heavily on the building blocks of portal fantasy, it is unequivocally horror. There was a whole lot of freaky in this book.Jack Sawyer is just a twelve-year-old kid who wants his mom to get better. This desire along with a “chance” meeting with a kindred spirit and mentor send him on a journey unlike any our world or any other have ever seen. For his task is not just to travel cross-country in search of a Talisman that can save his mother’s life, but to save the Queen of another world called the Territories. These two worlds, and more besides, are irrevocably tied together, and Jack is the only one who can get the Talisman that can save them. Along his very long, arduous journey, Jack meets wonderful people and horrible people, makes friends he loves with all his heart and villains so vile that his loathing for them knows no bounds. He sees and tastes beauty unlike anything he ever imagined, and sees horrors that would break the mind of any adult who saw the same. It’s one helluva trip.King paved the way for this story with a single, profound line of dialogue in The Gunslinger: “Go, then. There are other worlds than these.” That concept is the hub around which the happenings within The Talisman occur. This story is very much about the possibility of parallel worlds and the versions of ourselves that might reside in those worlds. The concept of twinners, those with a soul twin in another world, is one that I’m positive will pop up again and again in King’s work, and one that feels connected to books in his catalogue that I’ve already read. What holds me back from giving this book a 5 star rating lies mostly in the characters. While I did love Jack and liked the friends he made along the way, those portrayed as evil felt like cardboard cutouts of dastardly villains. All they were missing to complete the look were mustaches to twirl while they laughed maniacally. They were stupid and repetitive and, while they were indeed scary, I could help rolling my eyes at their mannerisms and speech patterns. I was also driven just a little bit crazy by Jack’s friends, who tended to be so out of their minds with fear that he had to just pull them along until they could finally serve their purpose. I’ve also noticed that King has a tendency toward the mystic negro trope which bothers me and seems borderline, if accidentally, racist. And, as with quite a few of his older works that I’ve read, King’s overuse of slang in his works prematurely ages them, and there was an abundance of such slang in this book. However, the story and the telling of it were so incredibly compelling that I can’t really hold these shortcomings against the book or its authors. Even with its failings The Talisman still provided me with a phenomenal reading experience. It was moving and unpredictable, and I was on the edge of my seat for all 900+ pages. I’m one step nearer the Tower, and I’m so glad I’ve chosen to take the scenic route.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Apr 24, 2020",May 2020,"Apr 24, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15943779-the-talisman

But when your mother and grandmother insist on you reading something, you don’t say no. I’m very glad I acquiesced, because this first entry into the Miss Fortune Mystery series was absolutely hilarious. It’s been a while since I laughed this much over a book.“Forrest Gump had gotten it all wrong. Life wasn’t a box of chocolates. It was a box of ex-lax, and I felt like I’d consumed the entire thing.”Fortune is a CIA operative who has been burned. Until things cool off, and she no longer has a massive bounty on her head, her boss is sending her to a little backwater town called Sinful in Louisiana. She’ll be posing as the estranged grand niece of a recently deceased citizen of the town. Her new identity is Sandy-Sue, a librarian and former beauty queen. Fortune is understandably appalled by the plan, seeing as she has zero experience with small towns or beauty pageants, but she doesn’t really have a choice in the matter. Soon after she arrives in town she finds herself in cahoots with the Sinful Ladies Society, a group of spinsters and widows who run the town and are nicknamed the Geritol Mafia. Fortune’s new friendship with these ladies lands her in the middle of a murder investigation. Hijinks ensue. “With friends like that, you could conquer small countries.”This book is both a caricature of and an homage to the state I love so much. The setting is just as much a character in Louisiana Longshot as Fortune and Gertie and Ida Bell. And all three of those ladies have huge personalities. There’s something about any book set in Louisiana that makes me happy, but I especially love books that actually show you that you’re in Louisiana instead of just telling you that you are. I could hear and smell and see every scene in Deleon’s book. And that made me very happy.“I think sometimes it takes a life-changing event to make us really see the way we’re living based on the choices we’ve made.”I’m not a big fan of comedic fiction, but reading it every once in a while is a breath of fresh air. That’s what this book was. Refreshingly funny. I’m not going to binge all 16 books in the series like my Memaw is currently doing, but I can see myself revisiting Fortune and Sinful and the Geritol Mafia on occasions when my life could use a bit of levity.

I don’t have anything bad to say, but I don’t have much good to say, either. The Glass Magician was one of those for me. It wasn’t bad. It was fine. A perfectly adequate book. But I doubt I’ll remember anything about it in a couple of months.Thalia Cutler is a stage magician, following in her deceased father’s footsteps. (I had to grab my copy of the book and look up her name, because I had already forgotten. See what I mean?) Thalia’s story takes place in an alternate New York City in 1905, a world in which humanity is divided into three subgroups: Solitaires, who are your average humans; Sylvestri, who commune very closely with nature; and Traders, who have an animal form in addition to their human one, and whose souls encompass both forms equally. These variances make for a world of interesting dynamics, where a magical-based classism has replaced racism and other forms of prejudice. I enjoyed the (very brief) exhibitions of stage magic, though the last scenes including stage magic were eye-rollingly overdramatic. I enjoyed the setting, and can see where this novel could almost be considered a fantasy of manners. I just wish it had been a bit more fleshed out. The characters were fine. They weren’t especially fleshed out, but they also weren’t obnoxious. There were brief glimpses of humor. The plot wasn’t really unique, but it was compelling enough to keep me turning pages. The writing wasn’t bad; it was perfectly serviceable.

I can’t even say it’s thinly veiled, because it isn’t veiled at all. And I am completely okay with that. “I may be on the side of the angels, but don’t think for a second that I am one of them.”There were a couple of pretty big twists here and there, but for the most part this book is a collection of faithful retellings of some of Doyle’s original Sherlock Holmes stories. A Study in Scarlet, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Sign of Four, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, and more are covered in this collection. The still unsolved case of Jack the Ripper, which has been included or alluded to in many secondary works about Holmes written by other authors, is the thread which ties all of these separate cases into one cohesive narrative. But what sets this book apart from other Sherlockian stories outside of Doyle’s original canon is the author’s truly fascinating addition of the supernatural. This is not mere whiffs of supernatural in and around certain cases. Addison created a world in which the supernatural runs rampant and is accepted as reality but civilization at large. “You can not keep faith with the faithless.”Where the supernatural is seen most interestingly is in the Sherlock and Watson characters. Crow, the Sherlock character in this story, is an angel. Kind of. He doesn’t have his own habitation, which is what gives angels their identity. He isn’t one of the Nameless, because he managed to wrest an identity almost out of thin air. And he isn’t one of the Fallen, who are basically angels who lost their habitations and went crazy. Crow is something that no one can define, and it freaks everyone the heck out. Everyone, that is, except for Dr. J.H. Doyle, the Watson character in this tale. After being wounded in the war in Afghanistan, Doyle finds himself sharing a flat with Crow at 221B Baker Street. Addison barely deviated from the original meeting of the two, which I appreciated. From there they embark on the adventures that have become so well known over the past century, with just enough differences to keep things interesting.“Shepherds watch over their flocks. And angels watch over shepherds.”The Angel of the Crows is very much rooted in the Victorian London of Doyle’s original canon. Addison stays incredibly true to the stories that provided her inspiration. But what kept this book from feeling like a stale rehashing, besides the supernatural elements, were all of the references to the BBC series that Addison included. Some of the dialogue was word for word from the show. I’ve read and loved every Sherlock story Doyle penned, but the reason behind that love is my adoration for the BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. I have watched each and every episode multiple times; the first six episodes I’ve watched half a dozen times at least. It’s my sentimental favorite series ever. When Addison opened the book with a quote from the show, I was already won over. But every time she gave the series even the slightest of nods in the narrative it made me giddy. I mean, she gave Crow wings with the same level of moodiness and sass as Sherlock’s coat gave him in the show. The biggest change was Crow’s complete innocence and joy over the smallest things. Since these personality traits make him very believable as an angel, so I’m totally in favor of them. And I really don’t think they’re too far off from Sherlock’s portrayal in the show.“Your real name has power.”If you’re a fan of the original Doyle canon, this is a fun replay of some of its greatest hits, so to speak. Does it do anything truly new? No. The core of the stories are exactly the same. But the trappings are a lot of fun. And if you’re as obsessed with BBC’s Sherlock as I am, The Angel of the Crows is going to make you really happy. It’s as light and sweet and frothy as any plot relying on murder can get.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions.

Can you imagine just up and leaving civilization one day, without telling anyone or bringing anything with you? Now take that a step further, and live in a stolen tent for 27 years while subsisting entirely on whatever you can steal from surrounding cabins. That was actually Christopher Knight’s life. Talk about truth being stranger than fiction. I can’t imagine how trapped he must’ve felt when he was finally caught and arrested for right around 1,000 counts of theft. While the story was incredibly interesting, there was something about the author that rubbed me the wrong way. I doubt Finkel was trying to capitalize on someone else’s misery, but I felt a bit of that. And the ways he describes himself as pursuing Knight was borderline creepy. Knight himself was such an enigma, and I would love to know more about how his mind works. Because throughout the book, one of the most interesting elements to Knight’s decision to leave civilization was that he had no reason. There was no catalyst; he just walked into the woods one day and didn’t come back out until he was forced out by authorities. This book is short, fast paced, and unflaggingly interesting. It’s an easy nonfiction read that is definitely worth your time.Random side note: I love Knight’s view on Ulysses.

It’s a heavily Jewish book with lovely fantasy overtones. There are shapeshifters and mysterious newcomers peddling forbidden fruit and a deeply atmospheric forest, as well as a central sibling relationship and deep religious questions to ponder. It sounded made for me. So made for me that I ignored the fact that it’s YA. I should’ve known better. While I enjoyed the plot and the structure, the usual YA all-consuming romances and the characters’ inner struggles with coming to know and accept themselves were cloyingly overabundant and negatively impacted my reading experience. However, I feel like this is on me, not the book. I should know by now that YA usually doesn’t work for me. I was almost as disappointed by this book as I was by Uprooted, which I think is comparable in setting and atmosphere.“To love means to sacrifice everything that you are.”I love the alternating formats of the chapters. Liba, the more solid and down-to-earth sister, tells her part of the story in lovely prose. Laya, the flightier, more artistic sister, gives her thoughts in ephemeral free verse. This alternating format was one of my favorite elements of the book. My other favorite element was the inclusion of so much Jewish culture and mythology. I love learning new things about cultures outside of my own, and Jewish culture in particular has always fascinated me, as from it stems my Christian faith. The inclusion of Hebrew words and customs was so enlightening, and is honestly almost entirely responsible for third star in my rating, along with the wonderful afterword that explained the real events that inspired this story, and how those events were tied into her personal heritage. I also found the way the author portrayed racial and religious prejudice as simmering just below the surface of even the most benign of settings, waiting for the smallest trigger to be incited into boiling mistrust and persecution, incredibly telling. Because hasn’t that been the way of the world since time immemorial? We’re also so eager to latch onto any reason to look down on and mistreat those who are not mirror images of ourselves.“Jews always come out battered, bruised, but still triumphant. Because we believe in God, in community, in compassion, and in the power of our people to endure.”My least favorite elements of this book go hand in hand. I strongly disliked the author’s handling of romance. It felt forced and trite and never rang true to me. As soon as either sister found a romantic interest, all of the things that made her individual character interesting were completely negated as she was consumed by the relationship. This directly correlates to my other main issue: the sisters themselves. At the very beginning of the novel, I found the sisters interesting. By the time I was a quarter of the way through, I actively disliked them both. Liba was just a ball of fear and self-loathing for much of the book when she was not in the arms of her romantic interest. Laya, on the other hand, was such a free spirit that she seemed incapable of caring for others. Both girls were completely driven by appetite in different ways, and those cravings engulfed all of their other personality traits. Characters I’m sure were supposed to be strong female protagonists ended up coming across as simpering or selfish, respectively. “I get to choose what kind of strong I want to be.”I’ve also come to the conclusion that I have no taste for needless melodrama. When people suffer because they refuse to openly communicate, I have absolutely no sympathy for them. I’m also sick to death of female protagonists who are wracked with such strong self-image issues that they basically hate themselves and think they’re worthless, even when everyone around them thinks they’re wonderful. It’s needy and obnoxious and so overdone. There are a select few authors in my reading experience whose prose can support such flaws in ways that minimize my desire to roll my eyes every other paragraph, but that’s not what was delivered in this particular book. However, this did thankfully improve toward the very end of the book, although the growth felt a bit forced; the author did a good bit of showing instead of telling when it came to character development.“I am brave enough to stand for what I believe in—and I believe in you.”The Sisters of the Winter Wood is a book that didn’t quite manage to deliver on its promises, though that is a very subjective opinion. I will say that the ending redeemed both plot and characters, as people finally talked to each other, but that happened a bit too late for me to develop any love for the story. There are plenty of readers who will (and have certainly already) adore this book. I just regret that I’m not one of them.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 06, 2020","Apr 16, 2020","Apr 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37854049-the-sisters-of-the-winter-wood

My Dark Vanessa is incredibly thought-provoking and raises a ton of great questions. I’m glad that I read it. And I’ll never read it again. (Side note: Everything being explored in this  is pretty much referenced in the book’s synopsis, so I don’t think I’m spoiling anything. But if you want to go into this book truly blind, you might want to skip this .)“To be groomed is to be loved and handled like a precious, delicate thing.”My Dark Vanessa is the story of a girl who begins having an affair with one of her teachers when she’s only fifteen. Her story weaves between the past, when the affair began, and the present, when the teacher is now being accused of sexual assault in the midst of the unnamed but alluded to #MeToo movement. We see how Vanessa’s entire life has been consumed by this one relationship, and her refusal to believe that she was abused. This incredibly unhealthy relationship is an addiction for them both, and Vanessa loses all sense of herself as an individual because of it. “Sometimes it feels like that’s all I’m doing every time I reach out—trying to haunt, to drag him back in time, asking him to tell me again what happened. Make me understand it once and for all. Because I’m still stuck here. I can’t move on.”I honestly am at a loss for words about this book, so what follows is kind all over the place. My Dark Vanessa was both cathartic and traumatic, a relief to read and so uncomfortable that I couldn’t read it for more than thirty minutes at a time without needing a break. I feel like so many women, and I’m sure plenty of men, have experienced something on the shallow end of Vanessa’s story. Maybe we were never in a full-blown sexual relationship with an adult in authority when we were still children. Maybe we were touched inappropriately or coaxed into touching someone else briefly. Maybe it only happened once, or maybe we lived on edge wondering if and when it would happen again. And maybe a thrill of adrenaline masqueraded itself as pleasure, shaming us into not speaking up. Because if some part of us enjoyed it, it wasn’t really abuse. Right? Where is the line between abuse and consent? Women used to be married and having children at fourteen, so can sex with a consenting fifteen-year-old really be considered abuse? “Because even if I sometimes use the word abuse to describe certain things that were done to me, in someone else’s mouth the word turns ugly and absolute. It swallows up everything that happened.”My personal answer to that last question is a resounding YES. What was once adulthood is no longer. Since we as a society have changed our ways of life so drastically that there is now a step between childhood and adulthood, adolescence, we have to reevaluate such questions. A century ago, Vanessa might have been a grown woman at fifteen. In the framework of this book, she is far from adult. Physical maturity doesn’t equal emotional maturity, and in our modern world the latter develops far less quickly than the former. And I think that there’s an inherent wrongness in any relationship begun between an authority figure and someone over whom they currently have authority, but that’s another personal opinion. (Also, if you’re a teenager and a male teacher ever gives you a copy of Lolita on the sly, RUN.)“I’m not a victim because I never wanted to be, and If I didn’t want to be, then I’m not. That’s how it works. The difference between rape and sex is state of mind. You can’t rape the willing, right?”Russell balanced this book so well. It was never sensational. It always felt honest and real without either skimming over or wallowing in details. She was also careful to present both Vanessa and Strane as flawed human beings. The victim isn’t likable. The villain isn’t a monster. Though I was infuriated by his humanity. I had no desire to feel sorry for Strane; I just wanted to hate him. And I did hate him. I loathed him, in fact. But not because he was a monster. And while I definitely feel that he’s wholly responsible for his relationship for Vanessa, she was far from perfect, though I won’t get into why I feel that way. I don’t want to further spoil the book.“Now when we touch each other, the world doesn’t even notice. I know there should be freedom in that, but to me it only feels like loss.”As uncomfortable as I was with them, I really appreciated the questions Russell raised. If we’ve been abused but don’t speak up, are when then responsible for anyone else abused by the same person further down the road? Do we have some kind of moral responsibility to lay ourselves bare to the world, to have them cluck and murmur and shake their heads over our wounds? Do we have any right to demand that every victim expose their trauma and relive it over and over again? And if we choose not to label ourselves victims, are we negating any wrong that was done to us? I appreciate her refusal to give any easy answers to this difficult questions just as much as I do her willingness to raise them.“This, I think, is the cost of telling, even in the guise of fiction. Once you do, it’s the only thing about you anyone will ever care about. It defines you whether you want it to or not.”Russell spent eighteen years penning this book, and that care shows on every page. I think I highlighted roughly half of the book. The writing was exquisite. Every element was handled with such finesse and grace. We see the flaws in our society and the systems that allow such abuse to happen, as well as not given children the tools they need to recognize abuse or the safety they need to feel in order to tell someone about abuse they’ve already suffered. We see how the abused is groomed to one day become the abuser if they aren’t careful, if they refuse to find help and support. We see just how pushy society can be in demanding your story when they did nothing to save you from it. “The excuses we make for them are outrageous, but they’re nothing compared with the ones we make for ourselves.”There was not a facet of My Dark Vanessa that Russell didn’t polish to a mirror shine, not so we would be dazzled by its beauty but so there was no possible way we could ignore the flaws. It’s definitely a book worth reading, but please be aware that it is hard. If this type of deep peering into abuse is something you can’t handle emotionally, steer clear. But if you want a book that will make you think deeply about one of the most controversial topics of, not just our time, but any time, My Dark Vanessa is the story for you.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Apr 02, 2020","Apr 17, 2020","Apr 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44890081-my-dark-vanessa

After all, the Donner Party is one of the most famous factual examples of Readers know how this book will end before even starting the first chapter. After all, the Donner Party is one of the most famous factual examples of cannibalism in the Western world. If you’re reading a book about the Donner Party, you know without a doubt that things aren’t going to end well. No matter how these characters strive toward their goal, you know most of them will not only not make it to the end, they will end up being eaten by the members of the party who remain. Because of this, every page of Alma Katsu’s The Hunger ratchets up the tension and unease as you close in on the inevitable outcome. “Evil was invisible, and it was everywhere.”There’s a weird sensuality to everything in this book, including the eponymous hunger. But even before the hunger arrives, almost every interaction is strangely, sexually charged. Uncomfortably so. Even a beating could be disturbingly sexualized in the minds of both abuser and abused. We think of the past as being simpler and easier and more innocent because it was different. However, history is as dramatic as any soap opera. And sexual appetites were just as repressed and perverse and all-consuming as their can be in our modern world. I did find quite a bit of the interpersonal interactions eye-rollingly melodramatic, but I’ve never been one to handle unnecessary drama very well. It’s why I don’t read more Young Adult novels.“The world was fragile. One day, growth; the next day, kindling.”The characters here were interesting, but I never fell in love with any of them. I think the reason for that is two-fold. First of all, I knew better than to get attached because I knew most of them we’re going to die. Secondly, even though Katsu did her best to show each member’s strengths and failings, she mostly conveyed their desires and struggles instead of any true personality traits. We’re more than the sum of our parts, but that wasn’t demonstrated in The Hunger. But as the book is literally all about hungers and desires, this choice could have been purposeful. Speaking of those hungers, Katsu did a good job of presenting the dichotomy between superstition and science, the supernatural and the medical, in her presentation of cannibalism. It was incredibly disturbing. “I don’t believe in monsters… Only men who behave like them.”If you enjoy historical fiction with an edge, The Hunger is the book for you. It’ll make you incredibly paranoid about ensuring that your pantry is always full. So maybe wait until the world calms back down a bit before picking this one up.

An alien bio-dome, Wormwood has anchored itself into the Nigerian landscape. Due to the healing powers it radiates once a year, a city dubbed Rosewater has grown around the dome.

I didn’t connect with the setting. I was never invested in the plot. The idea of the xenosphere was interesting, but it felt like the author mainly used in for weird sex and to show the ways in which minds can decay or be turned against their owners. I also thought that the source of the xenosphere being fungal was a pretty original concept. But in my opinion, that is literally all this book had going for it. I’m sure plenty of people have enjoyed this book, and will enjoy it in the future. Sadly, I am not one of those people. It did nothing for me.

As the world has kind of spiraled into chaos, I’ve found myself unable to concentrate on anything, though I knew that sinking into a story would give my mind a much-needed reprieve from the news and the fear it brings with it. Fantasy world building was too different to feel at all believable for my current mood, and contemporary fiction didn’t provide enough of an escape. I finally decided that what I needed was something historical, something firmly lodged in reality but far removed from the modern world in which we dwell. I needed bright and wholesome and something that would remind me that, no matter how the times change, people change with them and eventually learn to conquer any obstacles in their path. I can think of no series that more perfectly encapsulates all of those needs than The Little House on the Prairie. Though I’ve read most of the series in the past, I had never read this particular book. And it was such a breath of fresh air.I know that this series has, in recent years, been reclassified as problematic, mostly for the racism portrayed by certain central characters. Yes, that racism is present. But as that was legitimately how pioneers felt during the westward expansion, isn’t it better to include those views so as to discuss and refute them that it is to banish them from history? We can’t learn from our mistakes if we whitewash our past and pretend that we’ve always been enlightened. Racism aside, and ignoring the fact that the author often waxes poetic about her own selflessness in the third person as well as the fact that her “authorship” is greatly exaggerated as her daughter did a majority of the writing, this series is just delightful. Modern readers tend to view this prairie past as “simpler times,” but most of us would not handle the multitude of hardships these settlers faced with anywhere near their resilience and grace. The times they lived in were much harder. But the difference in daily life and setting is a joy to experience through the eyes of Laura Ingalls. In this particular book, we see her has a young woman for the first time instead of a child. We witness her first teaching experience in the beginning of the novel and her marriage in its final pages. While there were some instances that had me rolling my eyes, like the Ingalls’ family purchase of an organ when they really couldn’t afford it, I thoroughly enjoyed my escape to a different time in history.

I don’t care all that much about fashion. I’ve never read anything by Elizabeth Gilbert. But something drew me to this book and I decided to give it a whirl because I was in the mood for something outside of my norm. Thankfully, I thoroughly enjoyed myself while reading it. City of Girls definitely delivered the “something different” I was craving.“You must learn in life to take things more lightly, my dear. The world is always changing. Learn how to allow for it.”Vivian Morris is a little bit of a failure. Her affluent, upright parents are fed up with her after she flunks out of college, so they send her to live with her Aunt Peg in New York City. This is where Vivian’s life truly begins. Peg owns and runs a dilapidated playhouse called The Lily, where subpar shows are put on every single week for the working class folks who live in the same neighborhood. While these performances are fairly lackluster, there is some genuine talent to be found within The Lily’s walls. This includes Celia, the stunning showgirl who decides to take Vivian under her wing. Celia is the opposite of a good influence. She leads Vivian deeper and deeper into debauchery until Vivian finds herself crossing a line that cannot be uncrossed.“Let us not become so cautious that we forget to live.”Before her ruin, Vivian had found a purpose at The Lily. While she might have flunked out of school, she is immensely talented at one thing: sewing. The woman is a wizard with a sewing machine, and quickly elevates The Lily in her own way by outfitting the cast in the best costumes she can conjure on Peg’s shoestring budget. Vivian falls in love so quickly and so often after her arrival. She falls in love with The Lily, and the city itself, and the lifestyle Celia pulls her into. She falls a little in love with her friend, and the brilliant, classy, superbly talented British actress Edna Parker Watson, who she sees as a mentor. She falls in romantic love for the first time. And she starts to love herself, until the aforementioned line is crossed and she sees herself as a garbage human being. “At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time. After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.”The book itself is a love song to so many things: fashion, theater, friendship, sex, and most of all, New York City. There was an insane amount of sex here, including the funniest loss-of-virginity scene I’ve ever read. While this is not a lifestyle I can really understand, it was interesting to watch a woman become so joyously free sexually so long before the start of the Sexual Revolution. That was probably my least favorite element of the story, but I can see why Gilbert made this decision for her character. Speaking of characters, I was very impressed by how fully formed and unique each character was, no matter how small their role in the story. I could picture them incredibly well, and every single one of them felt real. Even the titular play, “City of Girls,” felt like a real character to me. It was wonderful to see behind the scenes of such a production. But my favorite aspects of this novel were its voice and its span. I’m a sucker for an epistolary novel, which is what I found here. The narrative is couched in a letter written by Vivian to Angela, a woman who has asked Vivian to explain who she was to Angela’s father. I loved wondering which man mentioned would finally be revealed as Angela’s father. “The world ain't straight. You grow up thinking things are a certain way. You think there are rules. You think there's a way that things have to be. You try to live straight. But the world doesn't care about your rules, or what you believe. The world ain't straight, Vivian. Never will be. Our rules, they don't mean a thing. The world just happens to you sometimes, is what I think. And people just gotta keep moving through it, best they can.”I also loved the span of Vivian’s letter. She quite literally includes her entire life’s story, and it was delightful to watch important moments in history intersect with that life. We see World War II from the perspective of a romantically unattached woman in a big American city, and how the war impacted those at home. Her contribution to the war effort was also something I’d never seen or considered before, which added another layer of interest. We see Vivian moving through the decades following the war, and all of the changes those decades entailed, including changes in the realm of fashion. It was such a different look at American life in the twentieth century, and I applaud Gilbert for her originality.“After a certain age, time just drizzles down upon your head like rain in the month of March: you’re always surprised at how much of it can accumulate, and how fast.”City of Girls was so much more than I expected it to be. If you’re interested in a different take on historical fiction that has much to say about female empowerment and finding the courage to march to the beat of your own drum, this book is for you. I’m intrigued to see if any other of Gilbert’s books works this well for me.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Mar 16, 2020","Mar 20, 2020","Mar 16, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42135029-city-of-girls

I learned tons of fun facts to share with friends and family but was never inundated to the point of boredom.“Even meaning and destiny themselves can be read in ordinary things, if you have the gift.” These are pretty much all stories with which I’ve familiar since childhood. My editions of Edith Hamilton’s Mythology and Bulfinch’s Mythology are both ragged from countless rereads. But it’s been a few years since I spent time in Greece’s brilliant myths, and Fry’s Mythos looked like just the right way to revisit them. I couldn’t have been more right. Fry managed to breathe new life into these myths while still staying incredibly true to them. It requires a very deft hand to so impeccably balance freshness and timelessness, but that’s exactly what Fry managed to accomplish in this collection. Fry claims that: “The Greeks created gods that were in their image; warlike but creative, wise but ferocious, loving but jealous, tender but brutal, compassionate, but vengeful.” And I think that sentiment exactly captures why their myths are so much fun to read. They have all of the character flaws and failings of humans, but on a much grander and more eternal scale. Without these faults there would have been very few stories to tell.“It is their refusal to see any divine beings as perfect, whole and complete of themselves, whether Zeus, Moros or Prometheus, that makes the Greeks so satisfying.” I can’t sing this book’s praises enough, and thus I’m going to keep this  short so I’m not just repeating said praises over and over again. Every single minute spent with Mythos was a pure and unadulterated delight. And getting to hear it read in Fry’s own superb voice made an already wonderful experience into something amazing. If you’re an audiobook listener, please give this one a try in that format. It’s one of the few books I’ve ever listened to that I know for a fact I’ll be listening to again and again. I had actually borrowed it from the library and returned it before I hit the halfway point, because I knew I needed to own it and have it downloaded on my phone forever. If you love mythology or Stephen Fry or both or even neither, you’ve got to give Mythos a read.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Mar 09, 2020","Mar 14, 2020","Mar 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35074096-mythos

I loved Daisy Jones and The Six, but I wasn’t sure if any other books from Taylor Jenkins Reid would click with me, since I picked up the aforementioned book solely because it was about musicians. I am so very happy that I was wrong. There’s just something about the way Reid writes that entrances me. I don’t know what drew me to this particular book, because that cover looks like it houses a light, fluffy romance, which is exactly the opposite of what I’m currently craving in my reading life. While there is a lot of sweetness, there was nothing light and fluffy about this story, and I’m so very glad I read it.“You can’t be loyal to two people.You can’t yearn for two dreams.”Imagine marrying your high school sweetheart, only to lose him right before your first wedding anniversary. Imagine spending years grieving that loss before finally picking up the pieces of your life and trying to move forward and start living again. Imagine finding a new love and building a life together, only to be wrecked in a completely different way when you find out that the love who thought was dead had been found alive. Suddenly the three of you find yourselves in an impossible situation where none of you did anything wrong. What on earth do you do? These might seem like spoilers, but all of this information is in the synopsis and the first chapter of the book. From there, we get inside glimpses into Emma’s relationships and history with both men in her life before we find ourselves once more in the present as she faces her heart-shattering choice.“What else could you want in a person other than kindness and humor? I'm not sure anything else really matters to me.”I relate so hard to the relationship between Emma and Jesse. That’s exactly my relationship with my husband. High school sweethearts who grew up together and whose relationship actually made it. But we’re also Emma and Sam, adults who find a childlike joy in one another’s company. We’re just that level of sappy. We’re musical and silly and madly in love. Chris is both of these men for me. While I read this book I was overwhelmed by my love for him and how insanely thankful I am to have him in my life. He’s who I laugh through life with. He sings with me in the car at the top of his lungs. He makes puns and song references and cheesy jokes, all with the sole intent of making me laugh. He’s’ the most helpful person on the planet. His is the last face I see at night and the first I see every morning. He’s my sous chef and my best friend and absolutely the love of my life. I can’t envision my life without him.“When you love someone, it seeps out of everything you do, it bleeds into everything you say, it becomes so ever-present, that eventually it becomes ordinary to hear, no matter how extraordinary it is to feel.”Reid did an amazing job at conveying true and honest grief in all of its painful steps. For this particular part of the book she swapped from third person storytelling to second person, and it was incredibly affective. I could so easily put myself in Emma’s shoes as she grieved, and I felt that this grief was incredibly believable. If I was to lose Chris, I feel like my phases of grief would closely mirror Emma’s. However, I don’t know that I could move into a new romance like she did. I don’t blame her a bit for finding a new love. The fact that a heart can hold two such powerful loves is absolutely amazing. But I don’t think my heart has that capacity. Chris is it for me.“I don’t think that true love means your only love.I think true love means loving truly.Loving purely. Loving wholly.Maybe, if you’re the kind of person who’s willing to give all of yourself, the kind of person who is willing to love with all of your heart even though you’ve experienced just how much it can hurt . . . maybe you get lots of true loves, then. Maybe that’s the gift you get for being brave.” I’m not going to go any further into the plot, but I can honestly say that I had no idea how things were going to pan out. There were so many philosophical questions about love conveyed in this story that really made me stop and think. Reid’s characters were incredibly well-developed and believable, and I cared so deeply about the outcome that I felt heartsick in my real life. All in all, even though this isn’t exactly my genre and I didn’t agree with every decision made, I loved this book so much. I’m really excited to dive deeper into Reid’s back catalogue.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Mar 06, 2020","Mar 11, 2020","Mar 06, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27189194-one-true-loves

Thankfully, Ken Liu proved to be an astonishingly gifted writer. I’ve heard his work referred to as graceful, and I can’t think of a more apt description. The man has a marvelous way with words. You can tell that every single sentence was crafted with care. This collection of stories is unlike anything else I’ve ever read in my life. While I didn’t love every single story, those I did love had a profound effect on me, and I honestly believe that I will still be thinking about them for months, if not years, to come. Below are my (very random) thoughts on each story. I’ve left said thoughts in their raw state. While I wanted to share quotes from the stories themselves, I highlighted far too many to sift through. I highly recommend this collection if you want something that will make you think deeply and treat others with greater kindness. More of Liu’s work is definitely in my future.The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species = 5 stars Insanely thoughtful and original. What each of these alien races and their manner of preserving ideas says about human nature is fascinating. And absolutely delightful. One of my favorites.State Change = 5 starsSoul as external, inanimate object, and how said object defines your personality. Candle, feather, ice cube, etc. But what if you were wrong about what your object was? This was a brilliant story. Flawless. Also, the inclusion of T.S. Eliot made me very happy. My other favorite. The Perfect Match = 3 stars Reads like a more hopeful episode of Black Mirror.Good Hunting = 4 stars Chinese magic being siphoned or somehow depleted by Western influence via iron railroad. Bad feng shui on a national level. Made Westerners seem callous to the point of evil. But the loss of the magic could be restored in a way by this new magic of technology, if one were willing to go through unspeakable pain to make themselves feel whole again.The Literomancer: = 4 starsLike reading a Studio Ghibli movie. Until it became devastatingly sad. It’s amazing how much hidden meaning can be found within a word.Simulacrum = 3 starsThis one was just depressing. Whatever way you relive a moment over and over again, the end result is that you miss out on so much in the present.The Regular = 2.5 stars Not a bad little crime story, but forgettable.Paper Menagerie = 5 starsBeautiful and devastating. I love the idea of literally breathing life into art. Also, I appreciate my mom’s love for me more than ever.An Advanced Readers’ Picture Book of Comparative Cognition = 3.5 starsBeautiful beginning. Very atmospheric. I got lost in some of the science, but still lovely.The Waves = 4 stars Almost feels like a continuation of the previous story. Possibly the most sci-fi thing I’ve ever read. Insanely creative.Mono No Aware = 4 stars Another subtle continuation. Subtle is the right word for this story. It’s quietly heroic and as achingly lovely as a haiku.All the Flavors = 3.5 stars Very long. Though it was a sweet and deep and enjoyable story, I had a hard time maintaining focus while reading it.A Brief History of the Trans-Pacific Tunnel = 3 starsInteresting premise for an alternate history but incredibly sad. Could have used a bit more development.The Litigation Master and the Monkey King = 4 starsThis started off amusing and took a dark and heartbreaking turn. Anyone can be a hero.The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary = 4.5 starsProfound. Is history actually subjective? The descriptions of what took place in Unit 731 were absolutely appalling. Rarely does anything I read make me feel physically ill, but this story did. The callousness of this torture “for science” is frankly unbelievable, even though I know it actually happened. How can humanity dehumanize other humans to such an extent? Even those discussing such travesties of the past can often find a way to shrug them off or claim that they’re being over exaggerated. It’s infuriating.

I appreciate and respect it, but it left me cold.The enslavement of African Americans in the United States and the horrific ways in which they were treated is one of the two most heinous sins (alongside our treatment of Native Americans) in our national past. I have never been able to fathom how people could treat others as less than human over such a minor difference as skin color. And the fact that these slave owners viewed themselves as good and kind and “Christian” is one of the most appalling and ludicrous things I’ve ever heard. The systematic oppression and abuse of any subset of humanity, whether they are set apart by gender or religion or sexuality or something as simple as a different pigmentation, is so opposed to the teachings of Jesus that I am baffled by how anyone who considers themselves to be one of His followers can possibly rationalize it.“The only way to know how long you are lost in the darkness is to be saved from it.”Going into Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winning novel, I was hoping to see some new facet of this dark past, some deep and powerful truth that I as a Caucasian woman in the American South might have missed in my research of the topic. I wanted a revelation, which I understand is way too much pressure to put on any work of fiction, but I was unable to rein in this hope. What I got instead was a lecture housed in novel form. Yes, the slave-owning South was shown in all its horror, and the lives of slaves and those who sought to escape their bonds were presented in a way that balanced the stark and the descriptive. There were instances where the treatment of slaves was unspeakably brutal, as it truly was in our history. Whitehead also showed how even the whites who claimed to be more civilized and caring still saw African Americans as less, and incapable of making decisions for themselves even if they were no longer technically enslaved.“Slavery is a sin when whites were put to the yoke, but not the African. All men are created equal, unless we decide you are not a man.” My problems with this book was my inability to empathize with any of the characters. Did I have sympathy for them? Absolutely. However, none of the characters felt real enough to truly care for. Everything I learned about them was told to me instead of shown. This resulted in cardboard characters with rich histories but no true personalities of their own. I was also incredibly frustrated by the ending, or lack thereof. It felt like Whitehead simply got tired of writing and decided to stop.“Sometimes a useful delusion is better than a useless truth.” I’m glad I read The Underground Railroad, but I’m even more glad that it’s over and that I can move on. It's beautifully written, but I couldn't connect with it no matter how hard I tried. For me, it was like Lincoln in the Bardo in this regard. I felt that Octavia Butler’s Kindred presented this horrific time period in our history with so much more grace and depth. Those characters, from main protagonist to secondary characters to even the antagonists, felt so much more real to me, and evoked far stronger emotions. I truly cared about each on of them and was invested in the outcome. I think I’m in the minority on The Underground Railroad; I know plenty of readers who were blown away by it. But if you’re like me and find yourself disappointed, give Kindred a try instead.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 28, 2020","Mar 06, 2020","Feb 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34018954-the-underground-railroad

I wish I had a more adventurous palette that loved encountering new things. But alas, such is not my lot in life. However, I’ve always loved cooking shows and food-based travelogues for reasons that honestly elude me. I still remember watching Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations on the Travel Channel when I was in high school and losing myself in daydreams of exotic locales and finding my way off of their beaten paths and into locals-only areas. I thought Bourdain had one of the most fascinating jobs on the planet. Because of this, I was intrigued by his early life and decided to read my first ever foodie memoir about how he got started in the business. “I've long believed that good food, good eating, is all about risk. Whether we're talking about unpasteurized Stilton, raw oysters or working for organized crime 'associates,' food, for me, has always been an adventure.”Bourdain’s story was incredibly addictive. This was a no-holds-barred look at the industry and the people who populate it, written when such tell-all stories were far from the norm in the food world. I loved Bourdain’s honesty here, both about the kitchens and people who have such a huge place in his life and about his own failings. He didn’t try to show himself in a better light than he felt he deserved, and he had no qualms about confessing his own shortcomings. He also had no problem sharing the shortcomings of others or peeling back the curtains to let the outside world see the seedy underbelly of the food industry. I could have done without some of that knowledge, especially about certain hygienic issues, but the fun was worth the cringing.“…your body is not a temple, it's an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.”I love Bourdain’s passion for food and for the people who prepare it. He passionately praises the people he’s worked with, from executive chefs to busboys and everyone in between. If you’re passionate about your job and give it your all, Bourdain loved you. Also, I had no idea that drugs and sex were such a huge part of the food scene in the 70s and 80s, and reading about Bourdain’s escapades with his fellows in the industry was wild. “Writing anything is a treason of sorts.”What I wasn’t expecting was Bourdain’s writing chops. The man really knows how to string together words in ways that not only entertain but inform and transport the reader straight into the heat of the kitchen. With this book, Bourdain launched an entire subgenre of memoir. Food memoirs are now hugely popular, and I honestly don’t think those would be as prevalent or as honest had Bourdain not written Kitchen Confidential. (Side note: If you’re an audiobook fan, Bourdain narrates this himself.)“I’m not going anywhere. I hope. It's been an adventure. We took some casualties over the years. Things got broken. Things got lost. But I wouldn't have missed it for the world.”Have I ever thought about chefs being the rock star, pirate equivalents of the culinary world? Nope. Will I think of them as such from now on? Probably not. But Bourdain sure as hell was a rock star in the food industry, and the world lost him far too soon.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 27, 2020","Mar 02, 2020","Feb 27, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33313.Kitchen_Confidential

I found Convenience Store Woman such a compelling mix of heartbreaking and enraging and delightful. Keiko Furukura is a woman in her late thirties who is completely fulfilled by her part-time job as a convenience store worker. However, everyone in her life is deeply concerned by the fact that she has no relationship to speak of, much less a marriage, and no real career. Keiko isn’t quite normal and, though she tries her best to mimic those she believes she should emulate, it never seems to be enough.“You eliminate the parts of your life that others find strange--maybe that's what everyone means when they say they want to 'cure"" me.” I think that Keiko is a treasure and I wanted to dive into the pages of this little book and defend her from literally everyone. Family, co-workers, and supposed “friends” were all equally judgmental and their concern for her future was so insanely overbearing. There was not a single person in the novel that truly understood or valued her, and it enraged me. Seriously, the fury radiating off of me as I read was almost palpable. My dog was concerned, y’all. She could feel a disturbance in the Force.“The normal world has no room for exceptions and always quietly eliminates foreign objects. Anyone who is lacking is disposed of. So that’s why I need to be cured. Unless I’m cured, normal people will expurgate me.”There is a male character who is just as unusual as Keiko but is less well-adjusted. When Keiko tries to help him, he immediately leeches onto her like a parasite. If I never hear another word about the Stone Age or village mentality, it’ll be too soon. I honestly hated him. He was insanely obnoxious and the way he treated Keiko made me want to give him a hug. A very tight hug. Around the throat. Until his face turned blue.Can you tell I was irrationally angry at literally everyone in this book who wasn’t Keiko?“This society hasn't changed one bit. People who don't fit into the village are expelled: men who don't hunt, women who don't give birth to children. For all we talk about modern society and individualism, anyone who doesn't try to fit in can expect to be meddled with, coerced, and ultimately banished from the village.”Just because your life doesn’t look like everyone else’s doesn’t mean you’re wrong or that your feelings and decisions are any less valid. As long as your choices aren’t inflicting actual harm on another human being, march to the beat of your own drum. Live your best life. Learn from Keiko and stop hiding who you are at your core just to please the masses. You do you.

True crime books tend to hammer home that point, and this particular book is no exception. In Killers of the Flower Moon, Grann takes us into a dark period in our history that I wasn’t even aware happened.Our national treatment of the Native Americans who populated the land before our arrival is every bit as heinous as the appalling acceptance of slavery and the evils linked to the practice of it. However, I had no idea that even as recently as the 1920s, these Native Americans still weren’t considered fully human in the eyes of many, including those in positions of power. The Osage people were able to gain themselves more legal rights regarding their land that many other tribes in the area, and as a result were made quite wealthy through the large oil deposits found on their land. However, the US government decided that many of the Osage, who all received a percentage of the money through hereditary head rights, weren’t competent enough to manage their own money. These Osage were assigned financial guardians who were, of course, white, and generally already wealthy. This guardianship mentality led to a multitude of mistreatments, both large and small. And eventually, it led to widespread murder.I’m Cherokee on my father’s side, but have never had any tribal dealings. However, I can put myself in the shoes of these mistreated and belittled people. I can’t imagine being declared incompetent due to my blood and skin color, or having to rely on the agreement of someone else to purchase even the smallest things, especially when I was technically a millionaire. All of the horrific treatment these people endured in the 1920s could have been avoided by the government butting out and granting them financial autonomy. All of these deaths are on the government’s collective hands.While it conveyed new and fascinating information, this book tended towards dryness. I believe it would have been more successful and less disjointed had the section about the foundation of the FBI been relegated to a separate book.

The Turn of the Key is a fascinating combination of a gothic ghost story and a chilling portrayal of how intrusive technology can be. All the way through the narrative, I was never sure on which side of that dichotomy the climax would fall. While I did figure out a couple of the twists before they reached their apexes, there was plenty to keep me guessing.The mystery genre is one of my favorite genres that I have somehow found myself reading less and less often as I grow older. I think the main reason for this is that many such novels tend to be formulaic, and I’ve become so well acquainted with that formula that I often have a difficult time not predicting the outcome before I even hit the fifty page mark. There are obvious exceptions, but as the mysteries that I try and find predictable are generally the new bestsellers, I usually steer clear of them. However, there was something about the synopsis of this particular book that grabbed me. I’m a sucker for any story that starts at its end and works its way back from the beginning, and this is such a story. I also really love epistolary novels whenever I can find them, so I thoroughly enjoyed what that additional bit of formatting brought to the book. I appreciated that Ware kept drawing the reader’s attention back to the fact that the entire story was being told through letters, and that reminded us not to completely trust the veracity of the story as it was being narrated by the central character, who we know from the beginning is not necessarily trustworthy. The combination of plotting through letters and the setting of a huge manor house in the wilds of Scotland made for an incredibly atmospheric reading experience. Onto the house itself. Heatherbrae House is a very disconcerting mix of the old and aggressively new. Sections of the house come straight from a Victorian Gothic, but these pieces have been sewn onto the ultra-modern, and both opposing styles are littered with technology that is almost futuristic and is definitely voyeuristic. So, imagine a moody Gothic mansion that is wired to hear and see and anticipate your every move. What this lends to the story is a mix of old school haunted house flair and overbearing smart house tension. I thought the mixing of these two radically different settings, and how they both impacted the plot, was pretty darn original.Our main character comes to this house as a nanny to four girls whose parents are always on the go with the architectural firm the co-own and run themselves. Another element of the Gothic novel that Ware nailed here is the creepy child trope. I honestly would’ve run screaming. There’s nothing like being afraid of fictional kids to make anyone involved in childcare uncomfortable. If I wasn’t caring for a kid I had seen nearly everyday since her birth, I might have started looking at her askance whenever I picked up this book during her nap time. In my opinion, there is honestly nothing creepier than creepy kids.As I stated earlier, I did guess some of the twists, but I was surprised by enough to still find the book enjoyable. There were plot points left unfinished, but this is not uncommon in mystery novels. There was enough resolution to leave me mostly satisfied, but enough mystery to ensure that I’m still thinking about this book after I have read its final pages. I’m interested to see if Ware’s other novels are just as gripping.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 08, 2020","Feb 12, 2020","Feb 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42080142-the-turn-of-the-key

And yet I put of reading it for months after itThe synopsis for A Deadly Education filled me with so much excitement when I first read it a year ago. And yet I put of reading it for months after its release, because I was scared. The reason for that fear? In a word: Uprooted. While I didn’t loathe it with every fiber of my being like my co-blogger Petrik did, I very much did not understand the love for that book. So many people adore it. And I desperately wanted to share in that adoration, I really did. On paper, it should have absolutely worked for me. Rich setting, interesting magic, a fairytale retelling that flips its source material on its head. It should have become an instant new favorite for me. And yet, it didn’t. I struggled my way through it. So you can see why I’d be scared to try A Deadly Education, right? I have a huge weakness for magic schools, but I wondered if maybe Novik’s writing just wasn’t for me.  I am excited to report that my fears proved themselves to be unfounded. I took to this book immediately and loved every single page. Whatever my disconnect was with Uprooted, Novik’s a gifted author with a talent for immersive writing, and I’m already counting down the days until The Graduate, the second book in the Scholomance series, is published.The Scholomance, a school for magical children, is fascinating. Imagine Hogwarts, but where everything wants to eat you. There are no teachers in the Scholomance, or adults of any kind. The school divvies out the classes and assignments. Whether you want them or not. And you better do your very best on what your given and finish everything you’re assigned, because the school has no problem meting out punishments. It’s a dark place, full of danger and monsters. And the reason these magical kids attend the school is because it’s SAFER?! Students have a one-in-four chance of survival to adulthood, instead of the one-in-twenty chance they would have outside the school. No wonder our main character is so crotchety.Galadriel, or El, is perhaps the youngest curmudgeon I’ve ever met in fiction. She’s so darn angry all the time, and she has every right to be. Not only is the school she attends a fan of eating its students, but her fellow classmates have all decided she’s evil and won’t have anything to do with her. Which is really dangerous, because you need someone watching your back. It’s also really unfair, because Galadriel far from evil, no matter what that prophecy said. She can’t help that her affinity is for mass destruction. It’s not like she wants the school giving her spells to melt bones or activate super volcanoes. She just wants to get out alive. Preferably without actually going over to the dark side.And then there’s Orion Lake, the hero and golden boy of the Scholomance. For reasons that baffle her, Orion has decided to attach himself to El. Both of their lives are about to change radically.While I really loved learning about the school and the world Novik has created outside of it, my favorite element of this book was the slow-burning character development. Honestly, the characters seemed awful at first. Especially El. But as she grudgingly grew, so did those around her. I ended up loving her and her core group fiercely by the end of the novel, and I already miss them. And their snark. Because there was a ton of snark. El is incredibly sarcastic and I love it.The Scholomance itself is such a unique magical school, and the world building Novik wove within its weird walls is pretty incredible. The lessons are tedious and difficult and, in some cases, insanely powerful. Every kid in the school is overworked and worn ragged, but most of that workload is self-inflicted. The more you learn, the better chance you have of escaping alive. The student body runs off of trade and alliances, which was an interesting dynamic to observe in a teenaged cast. I loved how these kids had shaped a way of life for themselves sans any adult supervision. Honestly, adults weren’t needed. The students were plenty motivated without them. I had tentatively high expectations for A Deadly Education, and those expectations were definitely exceeded. This is a world I’m really looking forward to revisiting. I can’t wait to see what happens next in the series. If you love magic schools but have always wanted a maniacally hungry one with a bit of a Lord of the Flies vibe, look no further.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Dec 12, 2020","Dec 16, 2020","Feb 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education

I suppose I thought this would be similar to Atwood’s most famous novel, The Handmaid’s Tale. And it was in some ways, especially in the tone of the main character. Though I can’t quite call Grace a protagonist, as Offred is in the aforementioned classic of dystopian literature. What I wasn’t expecting was very well researched historical fiction.“Murderess is a strong word to have attached to you. It has a smell to it, that word - musky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase. Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, Murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.”I’m not sure how this happened, but I somehow managed to completely miss the fact that this novel was based on a true story until I reached the afterword. Grace’s story is fascinating, and is made even more so by the fact that she was a real woman and the crime she was accused of really happened. Because no one quite knew what was truth in regards to Grace’s life and possible guilt, Atwood took it upon herself to give Grace a fictional voice and allow her to tell her side of events. Atwood did this brilliantly, giving Grace a voice that rang true.“If we were all on trial for our thoughts, we would all be hanged.”This book could skew much too descriptive for many readers. However, I wallowed in the descriptions found in Grace’s tale, as they did much to aid the setting in time and place, and brilliantly illuminated Grace’s character and what made her tick. Grace is obsessed with the physical, and she laces her story as she tells it to Dr. Jordan with a minutely detailed account of her wardrobe and the wardrobes and belongings of others present in her tale. As she is a talented seamstress, this would appear fairly natural. But on further consideration, it shows how much material goods matter to Grace, and seems to convey a lack of caring and compassion about her fellow human beings. She carefully studies every situation and assumes the role she determines is expected of her without showing much real emotion. I found her wily and cunning, and by the end of the book I was still just as unsure of her guilt or innocence as I was of her character.“A prison does not only lock its inmates inside, it keeps all others out. Her strongest prison is of her own construction.”Atwood really knows how to write. The craftsmanship of this book is impeccable, and the prose definitely helped draw me deeper into the story. Atwood deserves the accolades she has received over the course of her career. She is truly on of the masters of the craft for our time.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,Feb 2020,"Feb 08, 2020","Feb 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8729842-alias-grace

This is not generally my genre of choice, but it makes for a fun departure from my usual reading. That craving hit early this year when I saw that Netflix was developing the Locke & Key series of graphic novels into their own original series. Since I have this thing about reading this book before seeing the show or movie, I knew I needed to read these immediately. They’ve also been on my TBR list for literally years, so what better time to take the plunge? I’m so glad I did. For the first time in my life, I think that a series of graphic novels might be contenders for my favorite reading experience of the year. And it’s only February!“Dying is nothing. I’ve died a thousand times and I’ve always come back. Ideas can’t really be killed. Not for good.”Locke & Key is insanely creative and wildly unique, the perfect pairing of medium and story. The prose is surprisingly thoughtful and complex and is perfectly matched by the wonderfully detailed illustrations. And this is one of those instances where the prose and illustrations are both equally important to the story. Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez are a powerful team, and I’m so glad that the pair maintained their partnership throughout the series’ entirety. When it comes to graphic novels, there is nothing worse than a writer or artist being replaced in the middle of the story, and I am really thankful that didn’t happen with Locke & Key. “Keys turn both ways. You can lock something away… but you can also throw a bolt and set something free.”I love the mythology Hill built here, and how fathomless and rife with possibilities that mythology proves itself to be. The idea of these keys that not only unlock different areas or items in Keyhouse but can also unlock the mind and human potential is a brilliant concept, and it was incredibly well explored. Also, the cast of characters are real and sympathetic and completely fascinating. I adore Kinsey, but Bode and Tyler are phenomenal characters, as well. Their relationship as siblings is tight and strong and believable, as is their relationship with their broken, alcoholic mother. There are also some wonderfully developed side characters, my favorite of whom is Rufus, a boy with autism whose differently wired brain allows him to see things that no one else can. His character arc brought me to tears.“Secrets are hell. Secrets are the prisons we make for ourselves.”Volume 4 is formatted differently when Bode or Rufus is the perspective, and I love it. The use of an almost Calvin and Hobbes style at the beginning, and a classic action comic style further in, we’re both fun changes of pace. However, the main art style of the series remains true, and the appearances of the main characters change realistically as they age or change hairstyles and so forth, but they are always recognizably themselves. And then volume 5 delivers the back story of the creation of the keys, which was a fabulous addition and incredibly enlightening right before the series’ culmination in Volume 6. Also, there was a Carrie reference in this volume that made my little nerd heart insanely happy.“You were strong enough to pick yours up all on your own. You don’t need me to be your crutch. You don’t need a crutch at all.”This is one of those rare series that not only starts off incredibly strong, but maintains a steady growth pace through the last page of the final installment. Volume 6 made me cry multiple times, and I read the last twenty or thirty pages through tears. It was brutal and beautiful in turns and equal measure, and I thought it was an incredibly poignant depiction of growing up, finding yourself, sticking with your family through thick and thin, and the power of found family in the form of friendship, as well as living with the aftermath of bad decisions and finding a way to carry on anyway. “Death isn’t the end of your life, you know. Your body is a lock. Death is the key. The key turns… and you’re free.”Locke & Key is hands down the best series of graphic novels I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. I’m saving up to buy the set, because I really need to be able to physically place this series on my shelf of favorites. I wouldn’t change a single sentence or a single frame. I’ll leave you with something Brian K. Vaughan wrote for the introduction to the third volume:“Readers love fantasy, but we need horror. Smart horror. Truthful horror. Horror that holds us make sense of a cruelly senseless world. Locke & Key is all of those things.”You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jan 30, 2020","Feb 07, 2020","Jan 30, 2020",,Box Set,view (with text),/book/show/48495600-locke-key-slipcase-set

I have a terrible case of reverse snobbery that causes me to inwardly sniff in distain at any book presented by Oprah or Reese Witherspoon or any other celebrity as exceptionally worth reading. However, since I’m aware of this tendency within myself, I’m making an effort to not write something off just because it has an Oprah’s Book Club sticker on the front, though I’ll never be a reader that decides to pick up a book based on the same sticker. I’m very glad I made myself look past its popularity and pick it up, because An American Marriage gutted me. The characters it portrays are stunningly, viscerally real. And the situation in which they find themselves is heartbreakingly, infuriatingly believable. “You can never really unlove somebody. Maybe it changes shape, but it’s there.”What would you do if, as newlyweds, you and your spouse found yourselves separated by prison walls for a crime that you (or said spouse) did not commit? Even if you knew for a fact that the accused was wholly innocent of the charge, would you be willing to put your life on hold and wait for them? Could such a young marriage shoulder such a difficult burden? That’s the situation in which Roy and Celestial find themselves. What happens from there I’ll leave you to discover should you read the book, but it was painful to witness. No one was really in the wrong here. And everyone was. It was just a brutal twist of fate that no one could have seen coming. “Sometimes when you like where you end up, you don’t care how you got there.”This was a story brilliantly well told. The writing was phenomenal, not in a way that made you stop and admire a sentence, but in a way that allowed you to see every line of anguish on someone’s face and hear the hurt in the lines of their letters. Which is another thing I loved about this book. I’m a sucker for epistolary novels, and that format dominated a large chunk of the narrative. It was an incredibly successful usage of letters, and allowed us to get both sides of the marriage story while still never revealing everything. During this section we saw only what the letter writers wanted us and each other to know. Jones has such power behind her words, and the raw emotion in these pages was almost too much at times; I felt like I was invading this private world that I had no right to see. Very rarely have characters seemed so real to me that I felt like a voyeur. I was also completely drawn in by the setting. I’ll always have a soft spot for any book that takes place in the American South, but the vast majority of the novel took this a step further by residing in my home state of Louisiana. How could this story not resonate with me?“But home isn't where you land; home is where you launch. You can't pick your home any more than you can choose your family. In poker, you get five cards. Three of them you can swap out, but two are yours to keep: family and native land.” An American Marriage is a novel that is undoubtedly worthy of its popularity.

This debut novel is a bit of a slow burn, but it’s incredibly well written. The grammar and formatting are positively immaculate, which speaks highly of Thomas’s professionalism as an author; it’s obvious that she invested a lot of time in editing and perfecting Asperfell before introducing it to the world. And her way with words is impeccable. Actually, I would even say that the setting and writing reminded me the tiniest bit of Guy Gavriel Kay, who is a phenomenally talented craftsman of an author. It also had a Regency tone and flair to it. If Guy Gavriel Kay and Jane Austen teamed up to write a young adult fantasy novel, it would look something like Asperfell. “Have courage. And no matter how dark the world seems and how much you’d like to darken with it, find whatever light you can wherever you can, and help it grow.”Though I was immediately intrigued by the synopsis, I feared that Asperfell would feel very young adult, which is a very hit-or-miss genre for me. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case. While it did veer more in that direction as the book neared its zenith, it didn’t feel cliche in the slightest. Instead, Asperfell took the elements of YA that I love, like having a plucky heroine who finds herself in over her head but is determined to rise to the occasion anyway, and translated said elements into a story I could truly connect with while delivering a story that felt fresh instead of regurgitating tired and over-used plot points. Thomas employed so many different tropes that I love without any of them seeming weak. And she did so seamlessly. A coming-of-age narrative, political intrigue, mystery, romance, and even a bit of magical schooling all exist harmoniously in this novel. There were also Regency levels of snark and sass, which were incredibly entertaining. There were also some incredibly subtle pop culture references to fandoms I love, like Harry Potter and Doctor Who. So subtle in fact that I’m not quite sure that I didn’t make them up and decide to see things that aren’t actually there.“Knowledge is the most powerful weapon any of us can possess, and even the smallest of us can wield it.”Briony is such a remarkable character. She is strong, curious, intelligent, and pure of heart without seeming stuffy or self-righteous. I very much enjoyed being given the opportunity to watch her grow up, and to being allowed to see through her eyes how her kingdom changed radically over the course of her young life. However, as much as I appreciated this introduction, to me the story didn’t start shining until we reached Asperfell itself. Asperfell is such an intriguingly original locale, and I was captivated by each new tidbit of knowledge revealed in its hallways and garden plots. “There is power in a voice such as you cannot imagine.”While I very much enjoyed this book, it fell a bit short for me at the end. The villain’s identity was fairly predictable, in my opinion, and the climactic scenes went a little Deus ex Machina, resulting in a finale sequence that felt oddly abrupt. And while the ending was technically an ending, it left me wanting much more resolution. However, even though I was a bit unsatisfied by the ending, I absolutely loved the world building and character development in Asperfell.

The use of metaphor is overdone, but in the same way that noir detective movies overdo it, which added to the hardboiled feel of the story. Ben Garston is basically a Heartstriker (definitely not Julian) with the personality of John Constantine, and the same inability to learn from his mistakes.

I found this similar to watching a fun, action-packed movie on a lazy, rainy afternoon while also half dozing. Nothing felt quite real. The characters were just that: characters. I never connected with them on an emotional level, even when they were going through horrible things. And speaking of, this emotions in this book were so overblown they edged into soap opera on multiple occasions. The villains all felt too much like mustache-twirling baddies from silent movies to be believable. There was one exception, but that particular villain was also a bit of an anti-heroine, and she was insanely sexual. I also found myself zoning out while reading, and having to go back and reread what I missed. What I definitely didn’t miss was the girl power there at the end.

Educated I’ve discovered that I have a thing for memoirs about wild, unbelievably difficult childhoods and the children who grow up to overcome them. Educated was one of my favorite books of 2019, and I quite honestly didn’t expect to find anything else in its genre to rival it, especially not so soon. The Glass Castle, which is kind of the OG of the rough childhood, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps type of memoir, proved to be just as compelling as Educated. I don’t know why I put off reading it for so long, as I’ve owned a copy for years. Whatever led to that wait, I’m so glad that the wait is over. The Glass Castle was brilliant and beautiful and made me incredibly thankful for the type of upbringing I had and the parents who raised me. “I lived in a world that at any moment could erupt into fire. It was the sort of knowledge that kept you on your toes.” Jeannette Walls is a wonderful writer, and the story she told was an instance of truth being stranger than fiction. Not only can I not imagine living the life she lived as a child, I can’t fathom how her parents were able to get away with “raising” their children that way without Social Services ever really getting involved. I’ve heard of cases where children were separated from loving parents for next to no reason, and of children being given back to parents who neglect and abuse them time and time again by the powers-that-be. It’s why Chris and I decided that we couldn’t handle being foster parents. The fact that the type of rampant neglect that was Jeannette’s and her siblings’ way of life can go unchecked is absolutely appalling. Imagine having a mother who wants to do nothing but make her art and be left alone, a father who drinks away any little bit of money the family earns or finds, and never knowing where you and your three siblings will get your next meal, and how long you’ll have to go hungry. That level of selfishness among people who decide to reproduce infuriates me like nothing else on the planet. “I wanted to let the world know that no one had a perfect life, that even the people who seemed to have it all had their secrets.” And yet, Jeannette always loved, and still loves, her family. Warts and all. There is this loyalty that was bred into her that I respect more than I can express. The fact that she and her siblings managed to escape the squalor in which they grew up and make something of their lives is incredibly impressive. But the love she maintained for the parents who let their kids starve instead of growing up and being responsible enough to take care of those they brought into the world is what really shines through in this book. All the way through, you can feel how much Jeannette truly loves her father, especially. No matter what he does, no matter how often they find themselves living in terrible conditions and going without basic necessities and food and he was to blame, her love for her father never dimmed. Her trust in him might have eroded, but not her his hold on her heart. “You should never hate anyone, even your worst enemies. Everyone has something good about them. You have to find the redeeming quality and love the person for that.” The Glass Castle is a true story that is equal parts horrifying and beautiful. If you ever need to be reminded that life could always be worse, read this book. And if you ever need to be reminded of the resilience of the human spirit, and our ability to overcome even the craziest of obstacles, read this book. “Things usually work out in the end.""""What if they don't?""""That just means you haven't come to the end yet.”You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Jan 11, 2020","Jan 16, 2020","Jan 11, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7445.The_Glass_Castle

One of my Actual rating: 4.5 starsI’ve heard amazing things about I’ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman’s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer. One of my resolutions for 2020 is to read more nonfiction that I find interesting, and true crime is a topic that is endlessly fascinating to me. I expected to be caught up in the chase for an elusive killer. What I didn’t expect was breathtaking, engaging prose dripping with compassion and empathy for the victims. Beautifully written and deeply insightful, this book was an experience unlike any other I’ve yet found in the genre. “I love reading true crime, but I’ve always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else’s tragedy. So like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best: writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane.” - from the introduction, written by Gillian FlynnI’m blown away by the level of research McNamara put into this book, and the fact that she didn’t give the killer center stage, because he didn’t deserve the attention. Instead, she focused on the victims, on the ties that bound them together, on their lives and how those lives were forever changed by said criminal. Something I found interesting is how seamlessly McNamara wove her own memoir into a work of true crime without the book ever truly becoming about her. We see how consumed with the hunt she becomes as she mixes the crime narrative with what her days look like, how the case began to interrupt her sleep and her life with her husband, who she always painted as immensely understanding. We follow along as McNamara hunts down the tiniest wisps of clues, spending countless hours mining every bit of information she can find for the slightest details that might have been overlooked.“He loses his power when we know his face.”The fact that McNamara didn’t live to finish her book or to see the killer she had hunted for so many years be brought to justice is heartbreaking. You can tell distinctly what sections she wrote herself and what was compiled after her death by others. The woman could write, and that shone through the sections she penned. The final sections were missing that style for obvious reasons. However, the afterword included by her husband, Patton Oswalt, was poignant and incredibly moving. I can’t imagine how hard her loss must have been, and how raw that loss must have still been when this book was published. I love that a further note on the killer’s capture was included at the very end showing that, while McNamara didn’t live to see it, his being brought to justice will forever be linked to this book in the minds of her readers.“One day soon, you’ll hear a car pull up to your curb, an engine cut out. You’ll hear footsteps coming up your front walk. Like they did for Edward Wayne Edwards, twenty-nine years after he killed Timothy Hack and Kelly Drew, in Sullivan, Wisconsin. Like they did for Kenneth Lee Hicks, thirty years after he killed Lori Billingsley, in Aloha, Oregon.The doorbell rings.No side gates are left open. You’re long past leaping over a fence.

As always, Lawrence knows how to captivate an audience and set the tone for the book all within the first sentence. We know immediately that Yaz of the Ictha, our perspective character, is an uncommon child. On the Ice, difference can be a death sentence. And not just because those differences often render their bearer vulnerable, but because children who are too different, broken in the eyes of their elders, end up being tossed into the Pit. And that is the end that Yaz envisions for herself with a hard clarity. But when the time comes for her to face the push that will send her into the abyss, things go differently that she had always imagined. What she fully expected to be the end of her story turned out to be its true beginning.“We are the unwanted, the things of such little use that they are thrown away. We are what is beyond repair. We are the Broken.”The idea of tribes as both extended family and the roots of identity is a dominant theme in The Girl and the Stars, as is the prospect of found family versus families related by blood. If you’ve read Lawrence’s Book of the Ancestor trilogy, you’re already familiar with both the importance of blood in the magic system and the power of the families one can build around oneself. I have a serious soft spot for any strongly tied grouping that feels like family, whether that family is genetic or gathered over the course of a life. I was happy to see that explored a bit in this book, and I believe it will be an important element of the books that follow.“Did beauty need an observer to matter? Was anything beautiful without someone to think it so?”I thoroughly enjoyed being given the chance to revisit Abeth, and to see it from an unfamiliar angle. It’s really interesting to get the same world and magic from a different perspective. The new ways in which these are viewed and conveyed add a depth to the world building. At first glance, life on the Ice is so radically different from the setting of Nona’s story in the Book of the Ancestor that it’s difficult to find much commonality. But as the story progresses we are shown more and more the ties that bind two such dissimilar ways of life irrevocably together. I also found the subterranean setting of the majority of the book quite fascinating. It’s a hidden world that was touched on in the Book of the Ancestor, but I enjoyed seeing it further fleshed out here. Cold, wind, and the Ice are the most important aspects of life here because they’re the most dangerous. It’s interesting to see to what extent these elements dominate every single moment in the minds of those who dwell within it.“…it’s better to die trying for a life we can take for ourselves than to die fighting each other in the dark for an existence we were condemned to.”While I found the world building and the quality of the writing in The Girl and the Stars just as exemplary as that of the Book of the Ancestor trilogy, I found myself unable to love this story with quite the same intensity. I think this disconnect was due in large part to the characters. While I liked Yaz and respected her steadfast loyalty, she didn’t have the same depth in my opinion as Nona. I also found her a bit too akin to a Young Adult heroine, especially since almost every male with a pulse, and one that I’m pretty sure doesn’t even have one, seemed completely infatuated with her. Yaz is also a weird combination of helpless and all-powerful, which again reminded me of a heroine from so many YA novels. “It’s a dangerous game to try to rid yourself of weakness. You never know what else you might lose in the deal.”Another thing that threw me out of the story on occasion was actually one of my favorite elements of any Lawrence book I’ve read thus far: the writing. Lawrence tends to wax philosophical quite often, which I always love. I always heavily highlight his books, and this one was no exception. He had some truly profound things to say, and he said them well. However, due to the fact that the heroine and the novel itself felt more YA in tone than the preceding trilogy, I found that these philosophical passages didn’t quite mesh with the rest of the story, and even felt a bit self-indulgent. Anytime a character embarked on an esoteric monologue, it felt incredibly out of character to the point where said character felt more like a ventriloquist dummy than an autonomous being. I hate that I found this so jarring, but it further hindered my ability to connect with Yaz and her compatriots on any emotional level. I also found the subtle science fiction and post apocalyptic undertones more distracting here than I did in the preceding trilogy, as did the occasional references to our own world. The balance was just off in my opinion.“She understood that she wasn’t the selfish voice, or the kind one—she was the sum of a multitude, normally joined so close the seams didn’t show, but liable to fall apart under stress. Everyone was. A mix, a recipe, the sum of their parts and more.”I might not have loved Yaz are her story with the same fervor I felt for Nona and her fellow nuns, but Lawrence told an incredibly interesting tale with The Girl and the Stars. He did a brilliant job of showcasing the same world from a different angle, highlighting facets that had previously been in the shadows. I’m interested to see what Abeth holds next for Yaz, and what impact Yaz will in kind have on Abeth.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"May 18, 2020","May 30, 2020","Jan 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51277288-the-girl-and-the-stars

If I had to choose one word to describe BeagleActual rating: 4.5 starsI received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest . If I had to choose one word to describe Beagle’s writing, I think I’d have to break the rule and use two: melancholy whimsy. He is absolutely brilliant at mingling the lovely and imaginative with the quietly heartbreaking. Before picking up this collection, I had only read two books by him: The Last Unicorn and Summerlong. I thought that The Last Unicorn was achingly lovely, and I completely get why it’s considered such a foundational classic of the fantasy genre and why it is so beloved by some of my favorite authors. Summerlong, on the other hand, fell flat for me, but I’m beginning to think the reason behind that lack of connection was my reading it in the wrong mindset and with impossible expectations. Both are books I plan to revisit, the first to see if my appreciation for it has changed, and the second to find out if reading it at the wrong time could be why I didn’t enjoy it more. “The whole secret of magic…is that nothing is fixed, nothing is forever; that everything…all of it yearns to be something else.”Thankfully, my introduction to Beagle’s short fiction landed at just the right time, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were some stories I preferred to others, the collection as a whole was very strong, and I don’t think there was a bad selection in the bunch. While I’m not going to break down the  on a story-by-story basis, I am going to briefly mention the ones I enjoyed most.“And whatever centuries of poems, songs, and iconic representations of the heart may have told you, the heart of a human being is not always, or even that often, a compassionate, comforting, nurturing organ. The human heart disregards everything except what it wants, which is madness. People make jokes about the weakness and selfishness of the flesh, but I will bank on it every time against the heart’s hungers, and I know what I’m saying. The human heart is a killer.”As expected from an author whose most famous work is about a unicorn, a large percentage of the stories in this collection dealt with unicorns around the world. Besides the unicorn of Western tradition, whose portrayal brought Beagle his fame, we are also presented with the Asian unicorn and the Arab unicorn in this book. The Asian unicorn is mystically spiritual and breathtakingly beautiful and a deliverer of brutal justice. The Karkadann of Arabian myth is ferocious and completely without beauty and empathy; as Beagle states in his introduction, this “unicorn” was clearly inspired by the rhinoceros. Two other stories were actually further backstory on Schmendrick the Magician from The Last Unicorn, and I must admit that these were my least favorite in the collection. I didn’t hate them by any means, but they didn’t grab my attention and keep it firmly gripped for the duration like many of the other stories did.“The unicorn set me free, can you understand me? Freed me from the world I had always been taught, and always believed, was the only world…”Now, onto some of my favorites. Beagle does a great job of capturing the tone of an original fairytale in “The Queen Who Could Not Walk” which is my favorite story in the collection. I love the idea of Far Away and Long Ago being its own place. The system though which their monarchy works is very unusual, unlike any other I’ve come across in fiction. And the ending ends up being so heartbreaking and hopeful in the same breath that it moved me to tears. My other favorite was “Music, When Soft Voices Die” which tells of a man whose experiment went too far, and how it impacted himself, his housemates, and his community. I also thoroughly enjoyed “Olfert Dapper’s Day” (which also involves a unicorn); “The Way it Works Out and All,” which introduces the titular Overneath; “The Very Nasty Aquarium” and “Great-Grandmother in the Cellar,” both of which were pleasantly creepy; and “Kaskia,” which was an interesting first encounter via technology. The other stories were perfectly pleasant, as well, which I think demonstrates how solid a writer Beagle truly is.“Put her in a room with ninety-nine perfect choices and one heartless scoundrel, and she will choose the villain every time.”The Overneath is a truly lovely collection. It’s etherial and imaginative and wonderfully maudlin, which is a hard balance to strike. Beagle is a powerhouse of classical fantasy, and this collection proves that he’s still very much relevant, and that he still has a lot to say.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 26, 2019","Jan 03, 2020","Dec 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34273712-the-overneath

I’ve only read one other book by Moyes, Me Before You, and was absolutely infuriated by it. Not because it was a bad book, mind you; on the contrary, it was incredibly compelling and introduced some characters for whom I came to care deeply. But I felt so emotionally manipulated by the ending that I seriously considered burning my copy. I didn’t, because I consider book burning akin to sacrilege, but in my opinion the ending that Moyes chose to go with felt like it was chosen not because it served the plot, but because it was shocking and memorable. I hated it with my entire being. I don’t believe myself to be a reader who demands happy endings, but the final scenes of Me Before You felt like a right hook when I was expecting a warm handshake or something of the sort. “… some things are a gift, even if you don't get to keep them.” Because I had such a visceral reaction to the one book I’ve read by Moyes, I assumed I would just stay as far away from her work in the future as possible. However, I didn’t anticipate how intrigued I would be by the synopsis of her newest book, The Giver of Stars. I’m a sucker for any story involving characters trying their hardest to get books into the hands of others. I also adore stories set in the backwater locales of my nation, and seeing those who are used to more cosmopolitan surroundings adapt to such a vastly different lifestyle. Rugged, harsh beauty is always compelling, as are female characters who buck societal norms and walk their own path, while forming friendships with other likeminded women and encouraging them to find that same freedom. Based on the synopsis of this book, I would find all of the aforementioned and more within its covers. Despite my traumatic experience with Me Before You, I decided to give Moyes another shot. And I’m so very glad I did. The Giver of Stars was beautiful and funny and moving and more. I loved every page.“Just a little homesick,” Alice answered. It was the truth, she thought. She just wasn’t sure she had yet been to the place she was homesick for.”Alice is a British woman who jumped too quickly at the opportunity to start a life away from her judgmental family and married the first pretty face she met. Her husband, the son of a wealthy mine owner in Kentucky, is not everything she hoped he would be, and the feeling seems to be mutual. When a pack horse library is started in the area and requests women who are willing to ride long distances to deliver books to those far from civilization, Alice volunteers immediately. And in this instance, it’s the best decision she has ever made. She finds herself when she dons the mantel of librarian, and accrues a motley group of true friends among her fellow female librarians and others in the far reaches of this community. She and the other librarians face many trials and hardships, but the support they give each other along the way keeps them going. “A certain kind of man looked at God’s own land, she thought, as she drew closer, and instead of beauty and wonder, all he saw was dollar signs.” I won’t get into the plot, or even how I felt about the ending. What I will say is that I never felt emotionally manipulated. Every circumstance rang true, and felt like a reasonable plot development instead of a twist included to merely shock readers. Perhaps I judged Moyes too harshly for Me Before You. I found her work in The Giver of Stars to be deep and resonant, while also maintaining fun and friendship in the light of real hardship. While not every decision made sense, and a multitude of problems could have been solved far more quickly if people would just communicate with one another, I didn’t feel like I had been played at any point in the novel. “There is always a way out of a situation. Might be ugly. Might leave you feeling like the earth had gone and shifted under your feet. But there is always a way around.” The Giver of Stars felt hopeful even in the darkest of times, which is what Me Before You was missing in my opinion. I really loved it, and I’ll be happy to read more of Moyes’ work if it follows a similar path. It was a wonderful book that I happily recommend to anyone looking for a little romance in a plot that’s not devoid of depth.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Dec 17, 2019","Dec 22, 2019","Dec 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43925876-the-giver-of-stars

Mine is beautiful on the outside and hideous on the inside. She has stretched her bloody talons toward me—” You can probably guess why I finally picked this book up. I’m stupid excited for the Netflix series of The Witcher. And since I’m a good student, I wanted to at least have read the first book of the series before watching the show. I’m very glad I did. The Last Wish is a wonderful introduction to Geralt of Rivia, the eponymous Witcher of the series. Set up as short stories with a framework, we get to see some of Geralt’s greatest hits of his career, as well as gaining a bit of insight into his character.“People,"" Geralt turned his head, ""like to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.” While I’m not a gamer, my brother is, and the Witcher games are among his favorites. So I had heard a good deal about the series before I read the first page. What I didn’t realize was that the stories in this first book are essentially fractured fairy tales. We see new, darker spins on Beauty and the Beast and Snow White, as well as references to Cinderella, the Princess and the Pea, the Princess and the Frog, Sleeping Beauty, and even the Town Musicians of Bremen. There’s even a reference to the myth of Cupid and Psyche. And a genie. I might be overblowing these references or finding some where there are none, but it made me incredibly happy so I’m choosing to believe they’re there. Whatever the case may be, the stories were in no way derivative. Instead, they used the fairytales as a foundation upon which to build something completely original.“There's a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” Geralt is an intriguing if enigmatic protagonist. He’s the epitome of a badass, but can be both calculating and grudgingly compassionate at the same time. Which I found to be an interesting balance. I feel like we managed to maintain most of his secrets in this first volume, and I’m hoping that more is revealed in the novels themselves than was brought to light in this particular collection of short stories. While they were very entertaining, they didn’t delve much past the surface of things. I know it can be difficult to plumb the depths of a personality over the span of a short story, so it’s perfectly understandable on the author’s part. I’m definitely intrigued enough to continue with the series. I want to see how differently Geralt is portrayed over the course of a novel.“Evil is evil…Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.” These stories were compelling and bloodthirsty and packed with a surprising amount of sexual tension. I highly recommend this collection to any fantasy fan, especially those who love unique retellings that manage to still be completely original in and of themselves. I’m excited to see what else this world has to offer, and to experience more of life through the eyes of a Witcher....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Dec 12, 2019","Dec 17, 2019","Dec 12, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40603587-the-last-wish

I learned a lot from The Elements of Eloquence, but I had fun while doing it.

I love the various pop culture examples that Forsyth utilizes in each chapter. The phrases are so varied that all of the different examples used were very appreciated. I also love that he does his very best to not only bring in various examples of each phrase, but uses them himself in the writing of each chapter. What blows my mind is that every single one of these phrase types is something used and familiar. We use them often and without thinking. Gaining more knowledge about what these phrases are and why they work so well was very gratifying.“The aim of this book has been to make clear what is done, a clarity and knowledge that has been abandoned for a couple of centuries now.”I didn’t expect to enjoy a nonfiction work about rhetoric anywhere near as much as I did, but Forsyth is an incredibly amusing author.

That’s how I feel about Brandon Sanderson. I love everything about his Cosmere, and all of the series that comprise it. From Mistborn to Stormlight, from Elantris to Warbreaker, he’s crafted some of the most unique magic systems I’ve ever witnessed, and I love that such wildly different series all tie into a bigger picture that is still being woven. Because of my deep adoration of the Cosmere, I’ve been hesitant to read Sanderson’s other works. I read the first Alcatraz book and thought it was fun and cute, but that’s as far as I’ve been able to go. His young adult works, The Reckoners trilogy and Skyward, gave me even more pause, because young adult is a genre that is very hit-or-miss for me. There are so many tropes that have been done to death in the YA genre: love triangles and a special girl who refuses to realize she’s special being among those most often used and happen to be my least favorites. Thankfully, neither of those were present in Skyward. Actually, there wasn’t any real romance. Which I found very refreshing for a young adult book.“You find a way, and you defy them. For those of us who don’t have the courage.”Honestly, I would have never given Skyward a chance if I had purchased the US edition from my local bookstore, as I found the cover art repellently YA. I don’t usually judge books too harshly by their covers, but for some reason this particular cover was a big turn off for me. I’m also not the biggest fan of science fiction, so the synopsis wasn’t a huge draw, either. Thankfully a friend (Petrik) sent me the UK edition as a gift, and I found that cover captivatingly beautiful. (Isn’t it super pretty?) After hearing its praises sung by two other friends (TS and Eon) whose opinions I trust without reservation, I decided to give it a try. And I’m very glad I did. Skyward is a fast-paced sci-fi coming of age story about a girl who has been made an outcast fighting for her dreams of becoming a pilot and of clearing her father’s name. In a society where being Defiant is glorified but also twisted into a demand for conformity, how can one girl’s true defiance change that society, and will that change be for good or ill?“To survive, our people have become necessarily hardened, but alongside it we have enslaved ourselves.”Spensa has dreamed of being a pilot since she was old enough to dream. Her father was a phenomenally gifted pilot and wants nothing more than to follow in his footsteps. Even when he is branded a coward and shot down by his own flight, Spensa refuses to believe what the world has to say about the man she adored more than anyone. The powers that be are determined to refuse Spensa any and all access to flight school, going so far as to deny her the ability to take the entrance exam that is considered a basic right on Detritus. Detritus is the planet, if it can even be called such, that served as the site for the ship Defiant’s crash landing a few generations ago. Since that time, the crew has split off from one another and made clans of their own as they reproduced. The Krell, an alien race bent on the destruction of Detritus, gives the Defiants hell, and the Defiants give it right back through their pilot program. The entire society is shaped around fighting the Krell, so pilots are heroes in the eyes of every single citizen. All except for Spensa’s father, that is. She grew up under the shadow of his purported cowardice and has been treated like a leper her entire life. Flight school is the way to change all of that. But, more than the respect it would buy her, Spensa yearns to fly; it’s become a need.“We must not cower in the dark because we’er afraid of the spark within us. The answer is not to put out the spark, but to learn to control it.”As Spensa (callsign: Spin) fights for her place, she makes some very interesting friends. The cadets of Skyward flight are varied and interesting and not at all safe from Sanderson killing them off during air battles. I have to say that Kimmalyn (callsign: Quirk) was an easy favorite, and I enjoyed every scene she was a part of. Spensa was a little too much to handle at the beginning of the book, and I found myself constantly rolling my eyes at her overly verbose threats and promises of domination. However, she really grew on me, and she was an easy protagonist to root for. While the student group was a great ensemble cast, the true stars of the show were nonhuman. One is Doomslug, a brightly colored parrot of a slug who came to basically be Spensa’s mascot. Doomslug is also dearly loved by readers and has found her way onto all kinds of merchandise. The other outstanding character of the nonhuman variety is M-Bot, the sassiest ship to ever fly. I adore him. Though, for reasons beyond my ability to understand, I never heard his lines in a male voice in my head. For some odd reason, I always heard Lisa Kudrow. Weird, I know.“The warrior’s way was not to run from failure, but to own up to it and do better.”While not a part of the Cosmere, Skyward was blessed with the epic Sanderlanche that his fans have come to expect. The last hundred pages of the book were wild, and felt like they happened at a breakneck speed. There were epic battles and revelations and constant brushes with death. It was truly epic. I expected to not be able to connect with the action quite as much as I do with that found in the Cosmere novels, because I’ve never been a fan of dogfights via planes or jets or other air ships. However, Sanderson did a marvelous job of conveying these dogfights in such a way that I completely connected with the action and was reading on the edge of my seat with bated breath.“It has always seemed to me…that a coward is a person who cares more about what people say than about what is right. Bravery isn’t about what people call you, Spensa. It’s about who you know yourself to be.”Action wasn’t the only successful portion of this book. There was a good deal of character development on Spensa’s end and among her friends. And, as with all of his books I’ve read thus far, Sanderson was able to incorporate some truly deep, philosophical topics in ways that never seemed heavy handed. What separated the coward from the courageous? Are personal failings ever hereditary? Is something right simply because that’s the way things have always been done? Can honoring tradition be a slow poison in a society as easily as it can be a strength? “You get to choose who you are. Legacy, memories of the past, can serve us well. But we cannot let them define us. When heritage becomes a box instead of an inspiration, it has gone too far.”I’ve heard this book compared to Ender’s Game, which is possibly my favorite sci-fi book of all time. And I can totally see that comparison. For reasons I can’t quite put my finger on, Skyward didn’t hit me as powerfully as Ender’s story, and I’m not sure it’s going to have the same kind of staying power in my mind. However, it’s a good story very well told, and I’m eager to see where Spensa and Detritus go from here.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,54,2,"Aug 30, 2023Dec 07, 2019","Sep 06, 2023Dec 14, 2019","Dec 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36642458-skyward

Nonfiction isn’t anywhere near by genre of choice, but The Princess Bride is among my favorite movies of all tiThis was such a delightful experience. Nonfiction isn’t anywhere near by genre of choice, but The Princess Bride is among my favorite movies of all time, so I decided to give it a go. Also, Carey Elwes is an absolute treasure. But even the fact that the book was the backstory of one of my favorite movies as told by its lead actor wasn’t enough to entice me into buying a copy of this book. Until I came across the audio version. Let me tell you, I jumped right on that, especially once I learned that Carey Elwes himself, along with the majority of his Princess Bride co-stars and those who were involved with filming, directing, writing, and producing the movie, narrated the audio. Getting to hear these people, whose work together has been delighting countless viewers for over 30 years, talk about their experience with the movie was a wonderful experience. It just made me appreciate even more this movie that has been so special to me for nearly half of my life. So many lines from this story have worked their way into my family’s vocabulary and, while that is in large part due to the brilliance of Goldman’s writing, the voices in which we heard them spoken are what have kept them in our heads for well over a decade.In recent years I’ve come to really appreciate what audiobooks bring to the table. I strongly disagree with those who don’t consider audiobook consumption to be truly “reading,” as studies have shown the the exact same portions of the brain are being stimulated by visually reading or listening to a story. (That being said, I also firmly disagree with those who listen to a dozen or more books a week at the highest speed possible, resulting in chipmunk-esque background noise. I don’t see how on earth anyone could properly connect with a story in that way, but that’s just my personal opinion.) Audiobooks have become among my most constant companions, accompanying me on long walks and long drives and long bouts of household chores. I’ve experienced some truly wonderful stories through this medium, and Elwes’s story behind The Princess Bride is among those. First of all, hearing anything as told by its author is always a fantastic experience, especially if they happen to have a nice speaking voice. Elwes, who has made his living off of his voice and face, was a pleasure to listen to. And he wasn’t alone. Getting to hear from Billy Crystal and Robin Wright, Rob Reiner and many more, was equally wonderful. I loved hearing how much everyone loved their involvement in this movie and knew it was special long before it gained it loyal following. I also loved that everyone involved in the making of the movie seemed so genuinely fond of one another, and had such great respect of one another.One of the most unexpected aspects of this book was how much everyone raved about Andre the Giant, one of the few cast members who had passed on before the writing of this book. While I had always found his character sweet and delightful, I knew little about him outside of his role as Fezzik. Hearing about how much everyone loved him was just so sweet. Throughout the entire audiobook, I was captivated by how much everyone loved and respected each other, and that, for the most part, filming this movie was a wonderful experience for them and still serves as one of the highlights of their careers.If you’re a fan of The Princess Bride, you really need to give this book a read. And I wholeheartedly recommend doing so through audio, as the story was far more impactful in my opinion whey voiced by those who lived it. If you haven’t seen The Princess Bride, I’m begging you to give it a shot. It’s beloved for a reason. Everything about As You Wish made my heart happy.

Because it’s book 50 (which is crazy, right?!) in a series, I was anticipating something mind-blowing for this installment; instead, I got fairly run-of-the-mill. And I’m so disappointed about it. In case you didn’t know, I absolutely adore Nora Roberts. She’s my ultimate comfort read. I’ve read literally everything she’s written, and I can’t think of another author so prolific (she’s written well over 200 books) that I can say that about. There’s something about her books that feels like coming home from the very first page. This is doubly true for the In Death series. Following the same characters through FIFTY books is a wild experience. Eve and Roarke and Peabody and so many others feel like members of my family that I get to catch up with a couple of times a year. If I’m being honest, these characters often feel more real to me than real people in my life. Or at least, they usually do.“Do you know what I mean when a situation or a time can feel like the end of your world, the somehow becomes the making of it, and you?”Golden in Death could have been (and should have been) something really special for readers who have followed the series from its inception. Instead, it felt like an afterthought, a halfhearted offering that cheapened characters I’ve come to love so much. While the sass and camaraderie were still present, they felt stilted and even a bit forced. Eve lacked the dimension she usually brings to this series. Nora simply wasn’t on her A-game here. There was absolutely nothing special about this particular story and it makes me incredibly sad.“Death—but most especially murder—ripped so many lives to shreds. And no matter how they were put back together, they were never, ever the same.”All of that being said, it wasn’t a bad book. It still showcased Nora’s wonderful writing and storytelling style. Even if the characters weren’t as tangibly real and captivating as they usually are, it was still nice to catch up with them. And there were a few heartfelt moments that resonated. But everything about this book, from the plot to the characters to even the romance (which is among my favorite love stories of all time) just felt…tired.  The main baddie felt like such a cliché by the time they were caught and arrested. I was literally rolling my eyes throughout the interrogation. And every remotely ethnic character sounded weirdly robotic and stiff during their lines of dialogue. Also, the chapter divides seemed incredibly arbitrary and made no actual sense with the flow of the story. It really threw me.“I can’t change what I did, only what I do.”Will I continue reading literally everything Nora ever publishes? Absolutely. I don’t care what it is, if she writes it, I will be reading it as soon as I can lay my hands on it. But will I be rereading this particular book? Highly unlikely.

Whether it’s a fear that the ending won’t live up to my expectation or a desire for the journey to never end, it leaves me inclined to never finish anything. Not in life, mind you; I’m incredibly dependable and the opposite of a procrastinator when it comes to reality. But when it comes to entertainment, I’d rather let the story live on unfinished in my mind than risk a final chapter that sours something I grew to love. Constant Readers of Stephen King can relate, I’m sure; though I love his work, the endings are rarely satisfying. However, there are some authors I always trust to really deliver with their endings, and Nora Roberts is high up on that list. She knows how to stick the landing every single time. The Rise of Magicks is no exception, and has actually shot this series into my list of best loved series of all time, alongside The Kingkiller Chronicle and The Stormlight Archive.“Loss can shake faith if you let it, and the dark gloats when faith seeps out with loss.”Chronicles of the One is, in ways, radically different from anything else Nora has ever penned. For one thing, she very rarely kills off characters, much less 80% of the world’s population. But not only did she launch the planet into a pandemic of apocalyptic proportions, she also took a pretty hefty risk by killing off a central character in the first book. While this might seem pretty par for the course for fantasy fans, remember that Nora has, until recent years, been first and foremost a romance author, whose audience expected happily ever afters in the final pages of any book she penned. Even I had a hard time accepting that radical choice, and I read plenty of fantasy and horror. I suppose I was thrown off because Nora was my ultimate source of comfort reading for a decade. She’s added some incredible depth to her work over the past few years, but I just wasn’t quite ready for what I found in the pages of Year One. At least, I wasn’t the first time around. On my second read-through, my cognitive dissonance was replaced with a ton of respect and a genuine love for the story Nora was telling. By my third time through, Year One had become one of my favorite books. Both of the following installments cemented that love. “The other, the not-like-me, would always spark hate in some hearts.”In other ways, Chronicles of the One is merely a final draft of the story Nora has been telling for years: magic finds its way to a group of friends or family or strangers destined to become both, and those who use magic for good must battle back the dark, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. While never derivative, it’s a story that Nora has told before, and told well. You can tell that it is her center, a belief that magic lies just beneath the surface and that those who wield it for light will always triumph over the darkness. However, that triumph never comes without blood, sweat, and tears. One of my favorite elements of any Nora novel or series is her portrayal of idyllic families and communities, while also showing how much hard work went into building them and goes into maintaining them. In all of her stories, the central characters find their passion, be it art or carpentry or baking or bookselling or defending others in a court of law, and how hard they work at said passion. The same goes for any practitioner of magic; nothing worthwhile comes freely or even easily. I love how much emphasis she puts on giving whatever path you’ve found for yourself absolutely every ounce of effort you have. And I love how, no matter how long and hard the fight, that good will always triumph over evil in everything she writes.“I can’t lean on you until I’m sure I can stand on my own.”There’s very little I can say about the actual book itself without spoiling it. So I’ll say that it was a perfect conclusion, both for romance fans and fantasy fans. There were a multitude of battles and strategic preparations and war councils, but there was also love and humor and the culmination of a romance that had been building since the involved parties were born. Nora perfectly balanced fate and free will in regards to both the war and the romance, and I think she handled both beautifully. For those who are fantasy fans and not lovers of the romance genre, don’t worry; the romance in the book never takes over the plot even as it becomes vitally linked to it. The entire trilogy was handled in such a way that I truly believe that fantasy fans will love it should they give it a chance.“Then again, love’s a victory… Without it, all the battles mean nothing.”If you can’t tell, I loved everything about not only this book, but the trilogy it concluded. I wish I could say more about the character development and the magic and the scope without fearing that I’d inadvertently spoil the story in some way, but suffice it to say that I couldn’t have been more satisfied. In fact, upon finishing the book I did something I’ve thought about but never actually done in my entire life: when I finished the last page, I decided to read it again. I went with the audio version the second time through as Julia Whelan did such a brilliant job with the first two, and I loved going that route when I decided to reread them in preparation of this book’s publication. And I loved every minute of both reading experiences. All of Nora’s books are fabulous in print, and this trilogy was no exception. But there’s something about her writing that lends itself incredibly well to audiobooks. There’s a cadence, a distinctive and lovely rhythm to her prose that is absolutely enchanting when read aloud by a talented narrator. “Now I’ve looked… And I see. The treasures, the dreams, the dangers, the glorious diversity of the world and those who live in it. She’s a generous mother who offers all we need, and she’s a child who needs our tending and care.”I can’t recommend this series highly enough to everyone, no matter your preferred genres. If you’re a fantasy fan, please don’t let the fact that Nora is a “romance” author deter you. The woman can seriously write. Her world building, and lore weaving, and character development are all absolutely stellar. And for someone fairly new to the game, her battle scenes were completely gripping. If you’re already a longtime Nora fan, and are hesitant to pick this up because of the darkness of theme and plot, please give it a try anyway. You already know that you’re in good hands; trust her to get you through a radically different story in such a way that you’ll be completely won over by the final pages. (Side note: my grandmother devoured this series and isn’t a fantasy fan. Chronicles of the One, written by one of her favorite authors, opened her up to reading more fantasy. I can’t tell you how excited I am about that.) This trilogy is truly something special. It’s among my top ten series I’ve ever read. In my whole life. Now I have to face the difficult decision of which books to move from my favorites shelf in my living room so that Chronicles of the One can take its rightful place among them.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,72,1,"Nov 27, 2019","Dec 09, 2019","Nov 27, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/43088029-the-rise-of-magicks

In this version of London, England and tThe Screaming Staircase is a fun, action-packed romp through a speculative alternative to modern(ish) London. In this version of London, England and the world at large are plagued by a pandemic of phantoms and phantasms. Adults are, for the most part, blind to these apparitions. However, this blindness does nothing to protect them from the malevolent entities. This is how the world finds themselves beholden to the younger generation, who can see and hear and otherwise sense the ghosts. Agencies have been put in place and are fun by adults who directed their more sensitive employee base. However, there are no laws that say gifted children have to work for adults, which is how Lockwood and Co. came to be. Lockwood, still a child himself, runs his own ghost hunting firm with two other children: George and Lucy. When what should have been a simple case goes horribly awry, the company find themselves taking on a terribly dangerous job with very little time to prepare. If they fail, they will lose any chance of future clients, along with the company itself and the house they live and work in.This was my first encounter with Jonathan Stroud’s writing. I’m a fan of middle grade fiction and have heard great things about both this series and the Bartimaeus series. While The Screaming Staircase was by no means boring, I found myself just trying to push through it so I could move on instead of deeply enjoying it. I thought the best element of the story was Lockwood himself, who came across as a younger ghost hunting version of Sherlock Holmes. Even the fact that we were getting his story secondhand, through the eyes of Lucy, reminded me of Sherlock’s relationship with Doctor Watson. Lockwood was a very intriguing character, and I can see where he and his tiny gang would entrance readers. Unfortunately, I simply wasn’t one of those readers. I wanted more character development outside of merely seeing quirks and chemistry, whereas this book was concerned far more with action and its mystery elements.While I didn’t love this book, I didn’t hate it by any means. I don’t see myself continuing this particular series, but I’m definitely interested enough in Stroud’s writing to give his Bartimaeus series a try....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Nov 22, 2019","Nov 29, 2019","Nov 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13555073-the-screaming-staircase

It’s not something that would have ever come across my radar. My decision to purchase it was twofold. First, it was an Audible Daily Deal. It’s hard to pass up a less than $4 audiobook, no matter what it is. Second, Alexander X is narrated by Wil Wheaton. In my opinion, narrator really matters when it comes to audiobooks. If you’re going to have someone talking in your ear for 6, 13, 27 hours, it needs to be a voice you like. No matter how wonderful the story, if I don’t jive with the narrator I’ll abandon an audiobook in a heartbeat, promising myself that I’ll try it again one day in a visual format. I have a list of narrators I love, and Wheaton is a name on that list. On the flip side of this, the best narrator in the world can’t save a lackluster story. Happily, Alexander X was a fun, addictive, and pretty darn original story that was paired with a wonderful narrator.Alexander X may look fifteen, but multiplying that number by ten will get you much closer to his actual age. Alexander is an Immortal. No, he’s not a vampire or any other supernatural being whose unnatural life span comes with mutant healing powers or disturbing cravings. Alexander is your average kid; he just happens to age very, very slowly. There are handfuls of Immortals scattered throughout history and the present, and they have yet to understand what exactly causes them to age so slowly. Some have been around since before recorded history. What they know about themselves boils down to two things. The key to their immortality is some random genetic quirk that they haven’t been able to pinpoint. They also know that, should the world ever discover their existence, those in power would stop at nothing to discover this genetic secret, even if it meant hunting down every Immortal and ripping them apart in hopes of seeing how they work. Because of the danger of discovery, Immortals are always on the move, leaving before those around them begin noticing that they aren’t aging. For someone like Alexander, this is even more difficult. Adults can stay put for decades, but someone with the appearance of a teenager has to move around far more frequently.Alexander is settled into a new life for the time being. He’s even made some friends, and is playing lacrosse despite the risk involved with being notices. But things start going horribly wrong for him the day of the school’s Homecoming games and dance. He finds himself pursued by someone determined to get to his father, and two of his friends are forced to go along for the ride in order to keep their families safe. Those hunting Alexander will not stop until they’ve captured him, and Alexander won’t stop until he knows why. The chase that ensues is a madcap adventure through both the events of current day and Alexander’s roles in historical events.This was such a fun read. It was fast-paced and funny and did a great job of balancing action and exposition. It managed to be light and gripping in equal measures. I don’t know that it’s a story that will stick with me forever, but I immediately downloaded the second installment. I can’t wait to see what other adventures are in store for Alexander and the gang.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 16, 2019","Nov 21, 2019","Nov 16, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/45856492-alexander-x

I really should have tempered my expectations. The Starless Sea is the type of book that, in the beginning, I believed would evoke strong feelings. You should either love it and be completely entranced by the atmospheric quiet of the tale, or be bored to tears by the apparent lack of action and a more common pacing. That’s what I expected when I read the first few pages. Unfortunately, if fell short for me. Instead of either loving or hating it, I mostly just find myself disappointed by it. “If all endings are beginnings, are all beginnings also endings?”Morgenstern can paint a picture with words unlike almost any other author I’ve experienced. There is a lushness to her writing that enchants me, and I can see everything she describes. I delight in the worlds she has created. The settings and premise of this book are absolutely fantastic. The idea of a secret world of stories is always a thrilling trope, and Morgenstern had a truly unique take on it that I found fascinating. The Starless Sea and its multitude of past and present Harbors are places that I would dearly love to visit. I swear I could taste the honey and smell the forgotten stories. It sounds like heaven. There were so many small-scale, unique settings within the scope of the Starless Sea that you could explore forever and never stop finding new depths to plumb. Along with its predecessor, The Starless Sea is one of the most atmospheric books I’ve ever read; creating a unique and compelling atmosphere is without a doubt Morgenstern’s biggest strength as an author. If storytelling can be a lullaby, she is one of the best in the business.“Strange, isn’t it? To love a book. When the words on the pages become so precious that they feel like part of your own history because they are.”Besides the beautifully described settings, my favorite element of this book was the fact that it wasn’t just one book. In each section, Morgenstern divided the story between Zachary’s current story and a book of fairy tales or a diary or some other book unique to that particular section. The fairy tales that Morgenstern crafted were wholly original and absolutely beautiful. The ideas of the Moon and the innkeeper, of Time and Fate, of the Owl King and his domain, were every one of them lovely and enchanting and thought provoking. Morgenstern created her own mythos, deep and wild and utterly unique, and it fueled the story. If I could somehow find a book of just these fairy tales, I give copies out like candy and would read them over and over again.“Everyone wants the stars. Everyone wishes to grasp that which exists out of reach. To hold the extraordinary in their hands and keep the remarkable in their pockets.”If this book was so beautifully written, so original in setting and lore, why didn’t I adore it? My disappointment can be found in two foundational elements: characterization and pacing. Actually, my displeasure stems from a lack of both. The characters were interesting and varied on the surface, but they had no depth. We were told of their depth, of their successes and losses and aches, but we were never actually shown these things. Morgenstern excels at presenting a setting in such a way that her audience can truly visualize it, as I stated earlier. But for some reason, she seems unable to show us a character’s core instead of merely telling us about it. This results in cardboard characters against a stunning backdrop, which just doesn’t really work. There is even very little dialogue in proportion to the amount of exposition. “Be brave… Be bold. Be loud. Never change for anyone but yourself. Any soul worth its star-stuff will take the whole package as it is and however it grows.”Also, there never seemed to be any true action; the plot just moseyed from one event to the next. There was never a true sense of tension, which is odd for a story with high stakes, as The Starless Sea is revealed to have. Perhaps part of this comes from Morgenstern’s decision to write in third person present tense? This mixed with high levels of introspection can lead to the story feeling incredibly slow for some and totally immersive for others. Even the various romances felt as if they had no true foundation, which rendered them far less powerful than I believe was intended. I think she tried to make this book more than it is, when the story could have stood just fine on its own had it been allowed to do so.“We’re here to wander through other people’s stories, searching for our own.”Above all, this is a story about never passing up an opportunity; about the stories that shape us, whether they’re consumed from outside sources or told only within ourselves; about the importance of actually living your life instead of merely existing. Though the messages are profound, they were weakened by the lack of dimension within the characters. However, the atmosphere and exquisitely rendered settings and incredibly original and lush lore were compelling enough to ensure that this is a book I’ll end up revisiting someday. Perhaps I will see the characters in a different light and be able to include The Starless Sea among my favorites, along with Morgenstern’s The Night Circus. I recommend making sure that you’re in the proper mood for this book, ready for something atmospheric and lovely that meanders instead of races.“But this is not where their story ends. Their story is only just beginning. And no story ever truly ends as long as it is told.”You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,86,1,"Nov 07, 2019","Nov 23, 2019","Nov 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43575115-the-starless-sea

I prefer my fiction hopeful, with good at its heart even when bad things happen. That being said, I’ll give anything a shot if it’s well crafted, and I’ve read some pretty incredible fantasy novels that throw hope out the window and bask in their darkness. The best in the grimdark business has to be Joe Abercrombie, hands down. He has a way of creating characters and plots that really shouldn’t work for me, but that shine in spite of their dark cores. I loved the First Law trilogy enough that I was actually hesitant to read the standalones set in the same world, because I didn’t see how Abercrombie could possibly top or even match the greatness he achieved with that original plot and cast of characters. I needn’t have doubted him. In Best Served Cold, Abercrombie not only gives us a compelling plot but a wonderfully engaging cast of new and returning characters.“Good steel bends, but never breaks. Good steel stays always sharp and ready. Good steel feels no pain, no pity, and above all, no remorse.”Monza Murcatto is out for vengeance, both for her nearly-murdered self and her completely murdered brother. She was at the top of her career as a mercenary general when she was betrayed, and she won’t stop until all seven of the men in attendance during said betrayal are dead and back in the mud. Monza is a badass but she is far from perfect. In a way, she reminded me of a female Glotka who was able to keep her looks despite her scars. She’s relentless, even when it’s to her own detriment. She’s halfheartedly battling addiction which leads to making poor choices and trusting the wrong people. And they come back to haunt her.“You were a hero round these parts. That's what they call you when you kill so many people the word murderer falls short.”The return of so many familiar side characters from the original trilogy made me really happy. I won’t list names because the very fact that they survived Last Argument of Kings could be a spoiler. But every time a familiar face was presented it brought a smile to my face. While I loved the returning characters and Monza, a new addition to the fray really won my heart. And his name is Friendly. I would happily read a dozen books about Friendly. He was just precious. In a dark way, of course; the man has no problem killing people. Still, I found him incredibly unique and charming. He’s number one in my book.“That was the difference between a hero and a villain, a soldier and a murderer, a victory and a crime. Which side of a river you called home.”Abercrombie is truly a master of characterization. None of these characters were in any way truly good at their core. They’re morally varying shades of gray, with some edging scandalously close to black. And yet I still found myself rooting for them. As I stated earlier, I prefer stories and characters that are at least tinted with goodness, if not permeated by it. However, I’ve come to the conclusion that I am perfectly willing to abandon fictional morality so long as Abercrombie is at the helm. The man can make even the vilest of villains somehow sympathetic, and I truly care what happens to each and every one of them. “Sometimes men change for the better. Sometimes men change for the worse. And often, very often, given time and opportunity . . . They change back.”Plot wise, this story is much smaller scale than that of the original trilogy. It’s about revenge, pure and simple. And yet, through this smaller scale plot we see so many strands of that original, huge and overarching plot come into play and tie into this new story in various ways. I love how Abercrombie was able to bring so many of those elements together while still maintaining this novel’s own plot, and ensuring that said plot line always stayed in the spotlight.“One cannot grow without pain. One cannot improve without it. Suffering drives us to achieve great things.”While Abercrombie is highly (and deservedly) praised for his characterizations, I feel that his actual craftsmanship is oft overlooked. The man can seriously write. There are dozens upon dozens of tiny and thoughtful writing decisions that really made the book for me. It can be something as simple as the repetition of sounds, like slap-slapping during sex or how different shoes click-clicked or squeak-squeaked down a hallway. For some reason, those little choices really stood out to me. Also, Abercrombie is the king of the entertaining segue. I love how so often, either a line of dialogue or internal monologue is both the last bit of one character’s perspective and the first line of the next. What this did was ensure that the segues not only didn’t detract from the story, but actually added to it. There are so many small but intentional additions to the prose that elevates this book from merely a good story to a beautifully crafted piece of fiction.“The dead can forgive. The dead can be forgiven. The rest of us have better things to do.”I honestly have so much respect for Abercrombie as an author, and for the world that he has created. While it’s bloodier and more political and a lot more gray than what I generally gravitate towards in my fictional forays, I can see Abercrombie and his First Law World gaining a place among my favorites. In this novel, he showed the truth of the title; revenge truly is a dish best served cold. I’ve now come to the conclusion that, if Abercrombie wrote it, I really need to read it. And I’m going to get right on that.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Nov 04, 2019","Nov 15, 2019","Nov 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2315892.Best_Served_Cold

Our ability to tell ourselves stories, to reshape reality and craft worlds of our own using nothing more than ink and page and the random scribblings we’ve agreed on as an alphabet, is in my opinion one of our most human capacities. Every life is a story, and those who write have been gifted with the rare talent for immortalizing the tales that live inside their minds. But what about the rest of us? What about those of us whose minds are filled with stories that we never find time to jot down, or authors who pass away with a multitude of tales still living inside them that never made their way onto shelves next to their kin? Where do those stories go? Do they die along with us, or does the world find a way to keep them? According to Hackwith, it’s the latter.“Stories are, at the most basic level, how we make sense of the world.”Imagine if you will a library of sheer potential. Unwritten tales from the inception of human language all the way through the nebulous future, tales whose authors died centuries ago and have yet to be born. Stories that will be written and those that have lost their chance forever. All of that potential under one roof would assuredly need a guardian. That’s where Claire comes in. “We think stories are contained things, but they’re not. Ask the muses. Humans, stories, tragedies, and wishes—everything leaves ripples in the world. Nothing we do is not felt; that’s a comfort. Nothing we do is not felt; that’s a curse.”Claire is the current Librarian in charge of the Library of the Unwritten, located in Hell but not technically part of Hell. She is an unauthor, one who had countless stories to tell yet never penned a single one. She died with regrets, and will be in charge of the Library until she can make peace with herself. Her assistant, Brevity, is a former muse, cast out for keeping her inspiration to herself instead of doling it out to mankind. Rounding out the cast of perspective characters is Leto, a fledgling demon who isn’t who he thinks he is, and Ramiel, a fallen angel trying to find his way back into heaven. “Stories can die. Of course they can. Ask any author who’s had an idea wither in their head, fail to thrive and bear fruit. Or a book that spoke to you as a child but upon revisiting it was silent and empty. Stories can die from neglect, from abuse, from rot… Honor the stories that speak to you, that give you something you need to keep going. Cherish stories while they are here. There’s a reason the unwritten live on something as fragile as paper.”We also meet other angels and demons, along with gatekeepers and residents of Valhalla, psychopomps of dead realms and unwritten books made flesh. The compendium of characters is almost as varied as the Library that Claire has sworn to protect. But a quest to locate and protect scattered pages of an insanely powerful text might find the realms, including the Library, falling down around them. If they don’t sabotage themselves first.“Mark my words, souls are made of tougher stuff. You can wear one down, tear one apart, unspool all the thread, shave a piece off even, but destroy one? I imagine there’s an end, somewhere… But even an end is just where you run out of book. Stories change, and stories go on. Maybe souls do too.”There was more action in the story than I expected. Not only was there a constant sense of frantically striving to stay a step ahead of pursuers, there were also duels and rituals that could end in death and a pretty epic battle scene towards the end. My favorite of these elements was a duel between librarians, where words were wielded as actual weapons. Tossing appropriate quotations at your opponent’s head like missiles is one of the best visuals I’ve come across.“Books are knowledge weaponized.”I love the concept of this book. A library of stories that never found their way into books, of that have yet to be written? That sounds like paradise to me. Which is why the thought of said Library existing inside Hell threw me off a bit. But once I got past that, I found Claire and her biblio-charges and comrades in arms very intriguing. Hackwith wrote a plethora of snappy, memorable lines about books and stories and authors that I believe will really stick with me. I highlighted and annotated like a madwoman. “Books have songs, songs have stories, and then there’re humans at the heart of the jumbled mess… you just can’t subtract a human from the story, no matter how hard you try. Even death doesn’t do that.”There were times when I felt that the author was almost trying too hard to be both utterly original and completely inclusive, and that the two elements were fighting for dominance. This made for some muddy passages that were more difficult to get through than they should have been. However, this could also be due to the fact that I had a lot going on in my life and was unable to find the time to read this more quickly. Overall, Hackwith created something special and new in the form of The Library of the Unwritten, and I’ll be very interested to see where the story goes from here. It’s a series that I will most certainly continue.“Go. Be good. No—be better than good: be happy.”You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Oct 30, 2019","Nov 07, 2019","Oct 30, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/41961994-the-library-of-the-unwritten

Even when I should have been asleep.From the beginning, we know things have gone horribly wrong for our narrator, who has been apartment sitting in the most illustrious residence in New York City. The Bartholomew is insanely famous, having been the home of countless celebrities over the decades. When recently unemployed Jules stumbles across an opportunity to live in the glamorous building while she gets back on her feet, and actually get paid a thousand dollars a week to do so, it’s too good a chance to pass up. But the Bartholomew isn’t what it seems, and the learning the truth behind the famous gargoyled facade could prove dangerous. Or even fatal.“Every so often, life offers you a reset button. When it does, you need to press it as hard as you can.”As I said, we know from the first page that this gig didn’t work out so well for Jules. A mere six days into her stay, she has been hit by a car while fleeing the building, and she begs not to be sent back. From there we go back in time, seeing Jules first acquire the job of a lifetime and then attempt to settle into her new, if temporary, life. Because of the way the story begins, we know from the start that there’s something shady about the Bartholomew. I immediately had Rosemary’s Baby vibes (which was one of the few books I’ve actually hated), minus the impending motherhood. Which made the first half of the book feel very derivative to me, resulting in waning interest and oft-rolling eyes. However, the big twist was actually unexpected, and I really appreciated the change in direction. The twist actually made me appreciate the preceding pages a tiny bit more in hindsight.“Never take anything you haven’t earned, my father used to say. You always end up paying for it one way or another.”Besides the awkward pacing, which made this book feel far longer than it was in actuality, I had issues with the characters. On the surface, the cast was nicely varied, and the protagonist was the kind of down-on-her-luck character that is easily sympathetic. But only on the surface. There were so many ways in which Jules was relatable, and I should have liked her. But she and the rest of the characters ended up feeling two-dimensional for reasons I can’t quite verbalize. It was almost as if the Bartholomew was a dollhouse, and Sager was wielding the characters like dolls instead of letting them live and breathe on their own. The building itself felt more alive than any of its inhabitants. However, I did connect with Sager’s writing enough to give his stuff another shot next time I’m in the mood for something suspenseful. There were a couple of gems hidden in his prose.There’s definitely an audience for this book, but I am not part of it. While I enjoyed the final twists and can appreciate what Sager accomplished by taking a tired, well-worn trope and turning it on its head, the majority of the book just wasn’t for me. It’s not something I’ll be rereading, though I’m excited to pass my copy along to a friend who is a big fan of the mystery/thriller genre. I really think she’s going to love it.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Oct 24, 2019","Oct 31, 2019","Oct 24, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/41837243-lock-every-door

I have been a word on the page. And I hope I will be again.”Or What You Will blew me away from the very first page. The last time I got this excited over the first paragraphs of a book was when I read The Ten Thousand Doors of January, which ended up being my favorite book of 2019. My pulse actually sped up as I read, and I had to stop and go back and reread those first few paragraphs because they were just so gorgeous. I had read passages to my husband and frantically text my fellow Novel Notions besties about how excited I was before I even finished that first chapter. And I continued to deeply appreciate the writing all the way through, and highlighted and annotated an incredible number of passages. But after such a wonderful beginning, things went from beautiful literary fiction to an unexpected accounting of the art scene of Renaissance Florence. I mean, I have no problem at all with the topic but that shift came out of nowhere. I would say it was jarring if the air of the novel wasn’t so meandering. And then there were a ton of Shakespearean characters added into the mix, which was surprising. But the book never really came back to what I loved so much in those first few pages, and I’d be lying if I didn’t admit I was incredibly disappointed by that decision on Walton’s part.“What am I? What am I? Figment, fakement, fragment, furious fancy-free form.”This is a book that doesn’t hold your hand. Walton expects readers to be familiar with certain histories and literary works and, if they flounder, that’s not really her problem, is it? I would strongly advice anyone interested in reading this book who has no Shakespearean exposure to at least find summaries of Twelfth Night and The Tempest and read those before diving into Or What You Will. There are micro-sequels to both plays in the pages of this book, and those will make far more sense if you have an idea of what said plays are about and who their characters are. Said sequels also tie the two plays together in interesting ways. I love the idea of these tales continuing on after the curtain closes, and I love even more the idea of those stories continuing on in a world parallel to ours where magic is real and the Renaissance never ended. But these well worn characters underwent little new development in my opinion, regardless of their near eternal life in this magical world. They continued on without really moving forward, though I feel that might have been the point.“Imagine that power, to make worlds! I can make and shape and take no worlds. I slide myself into the worlds I am given and find myself, frame myself, tame myself into the space there where I can see to be me.”The concept of telling a story from a fictional character’s perspective while they’re inside their author’s head and aware of that fact is an interesting one. As is this eternal, magical Renaissance in a Florence populated with Shakespearean casts and real, historical artists and scholars. Both stories had promise but, in my opinion, mixed about as well as oil and water. There was a lack of continuity that was distracting every time the story flipped from the real world to the fictional world. Sylvia, who is the author of the fictional world and whose mind is the dwelling place of the nameless narrator, has a very interesting back story. But I felt that her story and the book she was writing never did fully cohere, despite that being the point of the novel. “I’d want the stars to be destinations, not destiny.”This book is one of the most meta, experimental novels I’ve read in recent memory. The ideas were wonderful, and the narrative went in enough different directions to make heads spin. But the amount of fourth-wall breaking and self commentary came across as self-indulgent instead of endearing. The book was brief, at little more than 300 pages, but it felt exhaustingly labyrinthine. The writing was exquisite and the ideas unique, but I had a hard time making myself pick this little book up. I also found myself disappointed in the ending. While the entire book was building toward a particular outcome, that final scene was so brief as to feel woefully abridged and ultimately unsatisfying. However, the quality of the writing and the social commentary woven into the narrative about the fantasy genre and religion and the world as a whole saved the book for me. I enjoyed having a chance to peer so deeply into the mind of both the author of this book and the author in the book.“There’s no difference between fairy tales and war stories… Pah. All stories start both ways. There’s no difference between once upon a time, and believe me, because I was there and still bear the scars. There are scars in everyone’s stories…”I’m sure Or What You Will shall become a new favorite for many, and I deeply regret that I’m not part of that number. However, I look forward to trying more of Walton’s work, as she is a brilliant wordsmith whose prose I can’t wait to sample again. Even though I didn’t love this particular story, I deeply respect what Walton both attempted and was able to do in the writing of it. Hopefully I’ll find a book or multiple books in her catalogue that will ring as true to me as Sylvia’s books did for her fictitious fanbase in this novel.All quotes above were taken from an uncorrected proof and are subject to change upon publication.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 29, 2020","May 07, 2020","Oct 21, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046576-or-what-you-will

A magic system that feeds on memories? That’s a fascinating concept! But the magic was barely explored or explained in any meaningful way. And while this is billed as an adult fantasy, it felt so young adult in tone that I felt suckered into reading something I hadn’t actually agreed to. The setting was vague in its description to the point that I had a hard time putting myself into the action. The supporting cast was fine, but populated with vaguely intriguing cardboard cutouts instead of tangible characters with any depth. The main character, Michael Kingman, drove me absolutely insane. I wanted to shake him for constantly repeating the same mistakes and for being so blind to (very obvious) plot twists that he was constantly being blindsided. Speaking of those twists, most of them were so glaringly transparent that I audibly groaned dozens upon dozens of times. The plot didn’t feel in any way fresh, but instead reused tropes in a way that felt like an amateur band covering popular songs, if that makes sense. I’m in no way trying to belittle the book or the author; I’m just annoyed that there was so much potential here that, in my opinion, wasn’t ever met. It wasn’t a bad book, and I’m sure plenty of readers are going to love it. It was action-packed and full or drama, and it did keep me turning pages.

La BelPullman has created something so special with Lyra’s world and the mythos of other worlds he set up in the original His Dark Materials trilogy. La Belle Sauvage, the first installment of this spin-off trilogy, took us back to Lyra’s beginning, giving up the wild story of her infancy and the two children who rescued her. This second installment fast forwards to years after the events of the original trilogy, when Lyra is grown, having just tipped over the cusp of adulthood. The final events of that first trilogy haunt her still, but she is convincing herself more and more that those events aren’t quite true. As she falls into the trap of rationality Pantalaimon, her dæmon, rebels against her loss of imagination. From there, the plot goes wild.Seeing Lyra as an adult was both thrilling and heartbreaking. She’s been through so much by this point, but she’s begun to lose the ferocity and uniqueness that made her so compelling in His Dark Materials. Adult Lyra seems like a pale imitation of childhood Lyra, and Pan is incredibly upset about the change. Seeing the two of them at odds and at each other’s throats is incredibly uncomfortable. Dæmons are like the outward expression of a person’s soul, and so we can see that Lyra’s quarreling with Pan is at its core a level of self-hatred that is hard to stomach. The journeys taken in this book are made all the more poignant for it.Something that I really love about this book is the multitude of plot lines happening simultaneously but coming across as spokes in the same story instead of separate stories that the reader hopes will come together. The jump from one plot to the next never felt jarring, but like a natural progression in the overarching story. Besides Lyra’s and Pan’s perspectives, we also get to see a lot of the story from Malcolm’s point of view, and a small bit from Alice’s, as well. Unlike La Belle Sauvage, which could technically be read without having first read His Dark Materials, The Secret Commonwealth would be incredibly confusing for readers who have not read both the first trilogy and La Belle Sauvage. The preceding four books are absolutely essential to both the understanding and enjoyment of this book.My absolute favorite element of The Secret Commonwealth is the expansion of knowledge we’re given regarding dæmons. Strangely, this new information makes the dæmons more mysterious instead of less. There isn’t really any of this new knowledge that I can share in a  without somehow spoiling the plot, but it was all totally fascinating. The story also spanned much of Lyra’s world that we hadn’t seen up to this point, and it was interesting to see how it was eerily similar and radically different from our own world. We see how prejudice and fear of anyone who is different plague Lyra’s world as much as our own, and how religion so often inflames these prejudices instead of abating them.I was completely enthralled by The Secret Commonwealth, but the ending felt so abrupt that it actually shocked me and left me a little angry. I felt cheated out of witnessing something that the entire novel had been building toward. While I am sure it happened, it did so off screen so to speak. Honestly, I frantically flipped back, hoping I had accidentally skipped a few pages. No such luck. Had I known how jarring I would find the ending I would’ve waited to read it until closer to the still unknown publication date of the final installment before reading The Secret Commonwealth. Pullman wrote something wonderful in The Secret Commonwealth, despite the abrupt ending. Waiting for the final installment is going to be painful, but I have no doubt that it’ll be worth the wait. Pullman has yet to disappoint me, and I can’t wait to see how the phase of Lyra’s story ends.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Oct 18, 2019","Oct 28, 2019","Oct 18, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/19034943-the-secret-commonwealth

I’ve read roughly a third of his body of work and, while I’ve enjoyed all of them for the most part, most of them have been suitably creepy without actually scaring me. Exceptions to this have been Revival and IT the first time I tried to read it. I can now add Misery to that list. This book legitimately gave me nightmares while I was reading, because, though not probable, every event in the book is actually possible.For the majority of the book there are only two characters present: Paul Sheldon, severely injured writer extraordinaire; and Annie Wilkes, former nurse and Paul’s number one fan. When Paul has a terrible car accident while driving through a snow storm, he is discovered and rescued by Annie, his aforementioned biggest fan. Instead of taking him to a hospital like any normal person would, she brings him home with her and becomes his caretaker. Over the course of the novel Paul grows to dearly wish that he had died on impact. As these two characters comprised the bulk of the narrative, I’m going to spend a bit of time breaking them down.Let’s talk baddies first. Annie Wilkes is perhaps the most terrifying villain King ever penned, and there’s nothing supernatural about her. Which just makes her all the more terrifying. King’s description of her as unnaturally solid, with no room for blood vessels and organs, like an idol from some ancient civilization, was incredibly disturbing. I’m of the firm belief that, should Annie Wilkes and Pennywise meet in some back alley, the sometimes clown would flee in mindless terror. I known I was petrified of her. She is a deeply disturbed woman and every artist is terrified of picking up such a fan over the course of their profession. And yet she was sometimes difficult for me to read, not because she was disturbing so much as the fact that her manner of speaking when enraged made me groan and roll my eyes.  Which is the only reason this book wasn't a 4.5 star read.I think that Paul Sheldon is the personification of some of King’s deepest, darkest fears. Every artist is afraid of getting trapped by their own creation, sentenced to recreating the same popular story or song over and over and over again instead of being given the freedom to craft something new. And every artist is afraid of the critics, of being relegated to the popular fiction corner where pedestrian fluff resides instead of being respected for their work. Paul Sheldon is an incredibly popular author who has just killed off his cash cow, so to speak, in hopes of writing something with a little more class and finally being taken seriously. Over the course of literary history this has happened time and again, the most famous example being Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s decision to kill off Sherlock Holmes. After the immense public outcry he felt forced to resurrect the character, finding himself once again boxed into writing stories about a character he had come to despise. Sheldon totally feels Doyle’s pain, and though the fury he faces is on a much smaller scale, it’s also deadlier.Something that King kept repeating through Sheldon’s character was the knowledge that he wrote stories first and foremost for himself, as do all authors. While the plot itself was incredibly compelling and disturbing, what I loved the most about this book was the raw honesty about himself that King allowed to shine through his protagonist. What he has to say about writing and being an author resounded with truth. I found these passages impactful and moving, which I honestly wasn’t expecting from this book. King has this openness in his writing that I really respect, and the way he lets himself shine through and be known even in his most disturbing fiction feels like a gift to his readership.“Writers remember everything...especially the hurts. Strip a writer to the buff, point to the scars, and he'll tell you the story of each small one. From the big ones you get novels. A little talent is a nice thing to have if you want to be a writer, but the only real requirement is the ability to remember the story of every scar.Art consists of the persistence of memory.” I didn’t expect this particular King book to become one of my favorites from him. But here we are. Misery is incredibly scary, far scarier than King’s more supernatural works. And the things this book had to say about writing and what makes a good story and the dangers of becoming or attracting radical fans are thoughts that will be staying with me for a while. If I ever manage to become a famous writer or musician, I know that the words “I’m your number one fan” will fill me with dread and make some part of me want to run away screaming. Anonymity seems so much safer.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Oct 13, 2019","Oct 24, 2019","Oct 13, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28181799-misery

I still loved this book on my second read-through.First off, can I just say that Bardugo hit it out of the park with her first adult novel?I have a weakness for school stories. And if the school happens to be magical in some way, so much the better. But very rarely have I come across a book that involves a school imbued with magic where only a select few students are aware of the supernatural element. I’ve read books were there were secretly vampires or werewolves on campus, not not sanctioned magical societies that had to fly under the collegiate radar. The fact that said magical society were on the campus of a real university, Yale, made things even more interesting. These slight variations made for a fresh take on a favorite trope. “New Haven was a town forever on the brink of things.”Alex (short for Galaxy, and how cool is that?) Stern is in over her head. She was offered a place at Yale if she became a member of Lethe, the less famous magical society that polices the others, the famed Houses of the Veil. Because she has nothing and nowhere and no one else, she jumps at the chance. But Alex isn’t a brainiac, or wealthy, or from a well-to-do family, or even an upstanding citizen. She just sees ghosts. That’s it. That’s the entire reason she’s been given such a profound opportunity to change her life. Even though she’s trying her hardest to balance her classes and campus life with her Lethe responsibilities, she just can’t seem to keep all of her balls in the air. As things start to fall apart, Alex is terrified that this new life, her one shot at something more, is going to be taken away from her. But Alex is a fighter, a survivor, and she’s not going to give up and just walk away. Especially when there are not one but two mysteries to solve. And one of those mysteries involves a dead girl who reminds her so strongly of the friend she lost that Alex can’t let it go, even when trying to solve this particular mystery puts her in terrible danger. There are real stakes to her story, and I was completely enthralled by every page.“You couldn’t keep sidling up to death and dipping your toe in. Eventually it grabbed your ankle and tried to pull you under.”Bardugo did a brilliant job with the mystery elements, never giving things away too quickly. I was surprised by multiple twists, and I really appreciated how these weren’t “aha!” moments as much as they were a peeling away of another layer. I also loved the setting, and that the magic hiding beneath the surface in the version of our world that Bardugo has crafted is so varied and unexplained. Each of the Houses of the Veil specializes in a particular type of magic, and I appreciated that all the magic practiced came at a price, and usually a steep one at that. But the star of the book wasn’t the mystery, or the magic, or the setting. Without a doubt, Alex was what made this story so special.“Take me back. Make me into someone who has never been done harm. Go as far as you can. Make me brand-new. No bruises. No scars.”Joe Hill said that Alex is a heroine with “a bruised heart and bleeding knuckles,” and I can’t think of a more perfect description. Alex is first and foremost a survivor, and that brings with in attributes and failings that make for a very interesting, realistic character. Survivors are fighters by nature, but those who have survived trauma also have a tendency to protect themselves above all others. This means that Alex isn’t always loyal. She’s not selfless or optimistic or principled or trusting. She’s wily and suspicious and underhanded when she needs to be. Above all, she’s broken, and is trying to put herself back together the best she can. Some such characters can feel very alienating to readers but Alex has this cautious vulnerability and fragile hope to her that made me instantly care deeply about her. There’s one scene of her alone towards the end of the book that I found so raw and empowering that it made my heart feel like it would burst; I was just so darn proud of her in that moment.“Peace was like any high. It couldn't last. It was an illusion, something that could be interrupted in a moment and lost forever.” I’m so glad that Bardugo didn’t give into the pressure to put include content warnings with this book. Had they been included, they would’ve spoiled so much of the story. Yes, this is a dark tale, very dark in places, and there is indeed some uncomfortable, disturbing content. But it’s an ADULT BOOK. If you’re afraid of being triggered, read early s. Talk to those who have already read the book and ask if there’s anything you should watch out for. Don’t become so fixated on being forewarned about any topic that is uncomfortable that you ruin the book for everyone else. While I don’t agree with content warnings for the most part, I can see where they would be appropriate for certain middle grade and young adult fiction. But we’re grown ups. We should know what we can and can’t handle without requiring authors to spoil their own books to appease us.Okay, end rant.We are the shepherds. The time for that was done. Better to be a rattler. Better to be a jackal.If you couldn’t tell, I really loved this book. While it was a dark tale, it wasn’t hopeless by any means. I love that Bardugo gave us a satisfying ending to this particular story while still leaving Alex’s world wide open for further exploration. I can’t wait to see what Bardugo writes next. And I’ll definitely be preordering the next installment in this series as soon as I can.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,93,2,"Jan 05, 2023Oct 13, 2019","Jan 10, 2023Oct 22, 2019","Oct 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43263680-ninth-house

I adored both The Faithful and the Fallen and Of Blood and Bone in their entirety, and I couldn’t wait to see what new world Gwynne was going to create outside of the Banished Lands, which until this point had served as the setting for every novel he’s penned. And he didn’t disappoint. The Norse-inspired Vigrið is a fantastic setting, one I’m sure will only become more and more interesting as the series progresses. However, as with his previous series, the setting and premise might draw a reader in, but the characters are what keeps said reader invested.Gwynne is a marvel at developing characters who it’s impossible not to care deeply about. Our three perspective characters, Orka, Elvar, and Varg, are all warriors with radically different motivations. Varg won me over the quickest, but his two female counterparts had just as much of my heart by the end of the book. Something I adored about this book was the complete lack of sexism. Women are just as likely to be badass warriors as men are, and men are never shocked by their female counterparts’ badassery. That’s one of my favorite elements of real Norse culture, and I was ecstatic to see it so well represented here. I enjoyed Gwynne demonstrating how and why myths came to be, as characters use stories to explain natural phenomena. He does a wonderful job hinting at Norse mythology and culture without outright copying it. The Tainted, humans who carry the blood of a god and can exhibit animal characteristics, are fascinating, as are the magical creatures populating the land. This book includes the most terrifying take on tooth fairies I’ve ever read. I actually had nightmares about them. While I really enjoyed The Shadow of the Gods, I honestly wish I would have waited just a bit longer to read it. But once I was the only Novel Notions writer who had yet to read it, I just couldn’t hold off any longer. The book was excellent, but I experienced exactly what I feared: battle fatigue. You can tell from the synopsis that this is a blood-saturated story, and I wasn’t quite up for it. By the middle of the book, I was growing mentally exhausted by the constant battles each main character was facing. That, combined with the fact that Gywnne’s series tend to start with a slow burn of an opening installment, kept me from adoring this book quite as much as I wanted to, though I still definitely loved it and will be reading the book 2 as soon as I can get my greedy little hands on it.The Shadow of the Gods is a very promising start to what I’m sure is going to be another incredibly epic series from Gwynne. It’s a bit of a slow burn, though for many fantasy readers the constant bloodshed will more than make up for that. There were some surprising twists towards the end of the novel, and I really can’t wait to see what happens in the next installment. If you’ve never read Gwynne’s work, pick this one up and give him a try. And then please, I am begging you, catch up on his back catalogue. His two previous series are among the best I’ve read in the genre. They’re incredibly epic, and I truly believe they are must-reads for any epic fantasy fan.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"May 18, 2021","Jun 03, 2021","Oct 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52694527-the-shadow-of-the-gods

While I enjoyed this book,Actual rating: 2.5 starsI almost always expect more of the horror genre, outside of Stephen King, than it tends to deliver. While I enjoyed this book, I have to say that I was expecting more commitment. I find the whole “is it possession or just mental illness” thing to be a tired, overdone plot line. While Tremblay did it very well, and added in some fresh ideas with the reality show sub plot and the presence of blog entries, I just hoped for more. I want to read a possession story (besides the OG Exorcist) that really commits to the possession and doesn’t leave the reader wandering if the possessed was just mentally ill the entire time.My favorite sections of this book were hands down the blog posts. Tremblay captured the voice of a snarky but well informed blogger impeccably. I love how Karen took the show apart scene by scene, adding in her own theories and research into the mix. In my opinion, her voice to be the freshest element of the entire book. If The Last Final Girl was a real blog, I would definitely give it a follow.There are a lot of themes in this book: from desperation felt so often by families straddling the line of poverty, to what people will do for their fifteen minutes of fame; from how mental illness can change a family, to the fine line between religious zeal and fanaticism; from the relationship between family members and how those ties are strained and broken by stress, to how one can subconsciously alter one’s memories to protect oneself and what those alterations can cause over the course of one’s life. I found all of these elements interesting, but was never able to form a deep enough connection to the cast of characters to really care what they were going through. Tremblay straddled the line between possession and mental illness with great aplomb, but in the end seemed unable to deliver enough of either to be convincing. I wanted to make this a full , but I just don’t have all that much to say. I liked it, but didn’t love it. It was well written, but failed to grip me.

Odd, incredibly odd, but lovely both in spite of and due to the oddity. There’s an elegance to this book that feels like a rarity. For a novel that is less than 300 pages, Piranesi is quite the slow burn. The first half of this short book took me four days to read. Not that it was boring, mind you. It was meditative, inviting you as the reader to mull and ponder instead of racing forward to see what happens next. But then I read the second half in one sitting. When things finally picked up in the narrative, my attention never wavered.“The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.”I found Piranesi quite similar to The Starless Sea in setting, though not quite as magical. Both are encompassed by labyrinthine, otherworldly interconnected rooms that house things which shouldn’t be indoors according to the rules of nature. However, the voice is very different in each of the novels. Piranesi’s narrator is a more modern Robinson Crusoe, complete with capitalized common nouns in his internal monologue. (Which drives me a little crazy.) But this is mostly done in relation to the House, which kept the writing choice from being pretentious and actually served a purpose. This capitalization of any common noun in reference to the House is a visual demonstration of the narrator’s religious reverence for it. “The House is valuable because it is the House. It is enough in and of Itself. It is not the means to an end.”There is an innocence to the narrator that makes him almost too precious, but is ultimately quite charming. His is a pure soul, its hard edges worn away by the Tides of the House. As stated above, he is a fervent devotee of the House that comprises his world, and his adoration of the place is really quite lovely. However, there are times when the narrator is intentionally thick, his naiveté causing him to miss glaringly obvious clues to the mysteries surrounding him. While I found him incredibly sympathetic, these moments of intentional blindness were exasperating. But it was honestly fascinating to be given a story from a perspective that provided all the necessary information with which to infer answers by a narrator who couldn’t see those answers himself for so much of the book.“Perhaps even people you like and admire immensely can make you see the World in ways you would rather not.”The mystery elements of the book were intriguing, but I found myself wanting more. I want to know more about the House, more about those who interacted with it, and more about how it relates to our world and others. At times, this short book felt like it was dragging on forever, but it also felt too short to satisfying deal with such an intriguing topic. All in all, though, Piranesi is a unique, graceful, beautifully written story, and I’ll be thinking about it for a long time to come.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Oct 15, 2020","Oct 20, 2020","Sep 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50202953-piranesi

You’re the sassiest, most self-confident female protagonist I’ve ever come across in a Victorian setting, and I loved every minute of your snark. This was indeed A Curious Beginning to your story. I’m already excited to visit with you again in the future, and to see what further adventures you stumble your way into further along in the series.“I abhorred weakness of any kind but most particularly in my tea.”Veronica Speedwell is a woman far ahead of her time. An orphan raised by two spinsters who took her in as a foundling, Veronica grew up with shallow roots. Her “aunts” were constantly moving from place to place, and Veronica learned to be her own companion and to ignore the social dictates of the time that so governed women. The so called feminine arts of music and embroidery and the like held no appeal for her. Instead, Veronica became a lady scientist in an age when such a choice was unheard of, and she did it with panache. Veronica is a lepidopterist, or a scientist who studies butterflies. (How many of you knew the meaning of that word, or had ever even seen it? It was totally new to me.) When Veronica finds herself on the run from people who want to take her for reasons completely unknown to her, she finds herself reluctantly teamed with Stoker, a mysterious taxidermist who wants nothing to do with her. But a murder soon has them having to join forces, even resorting to joining a traveling circus for a time to hide from those who wished them harm. They must solve the murder and figure out why Veronica is being hunted, or they might never be free.“I am quite determined to be mistress of my own fate, Mrs. Clutterthorpe, but I do sympathize with how strange it must sound to you. It is not your fault that you are entirely devoid of imagination. I blame your education.”My favorite element of this novel is the voice in which it is told. Veronica is, as mentioned earlier, incredibly snarky, and that comes across on every single page of this book. I found her voice and self-reliance and total faith in herself so refreshing. While Stoker was a great secondary character, Veronica was most definitely the star of the show. Remember when I said she was a woman ahead of her time? That is most apparent in her views towards sex, which were remarkably progressive for a female during the reign of Queen Victoria. She just doesn’t see the world at all as others of her period do. Veronica has no desire for a husband and a household to run and children to raise; she just wants to travel wherever adventure takes her, and hopefully collect rare butterflies along the way to sell to the highest bidder.“Mrs. Clutterthorpe, I can hardly think of any fate worse than becoming the mother of six. Unless perhaps it were plague, and even then I am persuaded a few disfiguring buboes and possible death would be preferable to motherhood.”I learned while reading this book. The lexicon employed by Raybourn is immense, and I added at least a dozen new words to my vocabulary. I’m also not a science person, but found the portrayal of science in A Curious Beginning thought-provoking without ever becoming too heavy to be enjoyable. Veronica is most assuredly not a dilettante, or one who merely dabbles in the sciences instead of becoming a true scientist. (See what I mean about the vocabulary?) She is a woman of science through and through, and can stand toe to toe with any male scientist on equal footing, without feeling like she is outclassed. “I have faith that men can be as reasonable and logical as women if they but try.”The mystery element of A Curious Beginning was fun and fairly fast-paced, and didn’t feel like a rehash of every historical fiction novel set in Victoria England, of which there are countless. A Curious Beginning felt fresh and engaging and I was never once bored by the plot. There were times when I rolled my eyes over plot points or decisions characters made or elements of the blossoming romance, but I was always entertained.“One cannot innovate new improvements without understanding old failures.”Historical fiction isn’t generally my thing, but I’m very glad I made an exception for A Curious Beginning. Veronica Speedwell is an absolutely wonderful character, who I will assuredly be revisiting from time to time.  This book was a perfect cozy, sweet read for someone who needs some tart humor to counteract the sweet. If you’re a historical fiction fan and have yet to read this series, I highly recommend it.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Sep 19, 2019","Sep 28, 2019","Sep 19, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28186322-a-curious-beginning

Instead of continuing the story from where it left off at the end of The Amber Spyglass, we go back to the very beginning. Lyra’s beginning. We see that the wild adventure of her life didn’t start in The Golden Compass, but mere months into her life. The events that befell her before she had even spoken her first words are enough to put most adults in therapy.“Words belong in contexts, not pegged out like biological specimens.” While Lyra is the focus of the plot, she’s not the main character for obvious reasons. Instead, we are introduced to Malcolm, a boy who is far brighter and braver than he believes. Malcolm is not generally noticed, managing to blend in with his surroundings at his family’s inn, and he uses this talent to hear everything that goes on around him. When a baby is brought to live at the neighboring priory, Malcolm appoints himself her protector. This decision will result in the craziest, most terrifying days of his life. I love everything about Malcolm. He’s kind and considerate and curious without ever seeming rude. He can read people better than most any character I’ve encountered. As much as I love Lyra in the original trilogy, I think I love Malcolm just as much or even more. I found him to be the most wonderful element of this book, followed closely by the title’s namesake.“He was liked when noticed, but not noticed much, and that did him no harm either.”Malcolm’s prize possession is a little canoe that he has named “La Belle Sauvage.” This canoe becomes incredibly important and serves as the hinge upon which the entire narrative depends. Before I started reading this book, I had always found the title odd. Now, I don’t think it could’ve been any more appropriate. La Belle Sauvage is the little canoe that could, and I came to share Malcolm’s love for her.“If I told you half of what he's done to keep us alive and safe, well, you wouldn't imagine it could be true.”Once again, I found Pullman’s commentary regarding the religious establishment of Lyra’s world incredibly thought-provoking. In this novel we are introduced to the League of St. Alexander, and it is absolutely terrifying. The League is an arm of the Church that is aimed at drawing children into the fold of their enforcement branch. These children are encouraged to police their school, reporting teachers and students alike for anything that could be construed as sacrilegious or disrespectful of the church. This covers everything from teaching that the Bible might be metaphorical instead of literal in places, to neglecting to open each class period with a prayer, to simply being eccentric and not conforming to the norm in some way. The League is a disturbing blend of the Spanish Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials and Orwell’s Thought Police. I shudder to think of it becoming part of our society, though I’m aware that there are places where it’s not so far off. For those who do these things in the name of Christianity, I can only say that Jesus would be absolutely furious.“Once we use the word spiritual, we don’t have to explain anymore, because it belongs to the Church then, and no one can question it.”As much as I enjoy Pullman’s books, I really think the fact that they’re billed as children’s literature is doing them a disservice. While I’m a firm believer in allowing kids to read any and everything that will not leave them psychologically scarred from consuming it too soon, I know many parents and teachers who would disagree. There are adults who will only allow children to read things billed as children’s fiction so that they can protect young minds from strong content until they are mature enough to handle it for themselves. There’s content in this book that would have those parents completely aghast, such as incredibly strong language at points and allusions to dismaying sexual content that doesn’t actually appear on the page but is clearly referenced. So if you’re one such adult who feels the need to filter what the children in your life read, be warned.“How can knowing something be sinful?”I enjoyed La Belle Sauvage, but it didn’t quite live up to the amazing standard set by His Dark Materials. That being said, I’m still very much eagerly awaiting the next installment. Any chance to revisit Lyra’s world is a one I’m going to happily take.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Sep 18, 2019","Sep 24, 2019","Sep 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34128219-la-belle-sauvage

Though I’m a big audiobook reader/listener, I tend to swap between the physical and audio versions of I’m reading and generally just  the actual book itself, not the audio production. There have been a few notable exceptions, most especially Daisy Jones & The Six, but those exceptions are few and far between. Today, I have another exception to add to the list with Joe Hill’s most recent short fiction collection, Full Throttle. And it was such a strong collection! There were only two stories that I really didn’t care for and two that I felt were just okay, as opposed to the nine stories that were either 4, 4.5, or 5 star experiences.In my opinion, short stories are the fictional form most well suited to an audio format. A short story on audio is often the perfect length for a long walk or a traffic jam or chores on a Saturday morning. And there is something about being read to that brings me right back to childhood, even if the stories I listen to as an adult are far removed from those that my mother once read to me. There was only one aspect of this particular collection that drove me crazy; a lack of information on which reader narrated which story. There is of course a list of narrators, but I couldn’t find a breakdown of stories paired with their readers ANYWHERE. Amazon, Audible, AudioFile Magazine, Harper Collins’ website, and even Goodreads s got me nowhere. And I read every single ! So I took it upon myself to research and match up the narrators with their stories to the best of my ability. Seriously, this is the most research and legwork I’ve ever put into a . If you happen to notice any errors in my pairings, please message me and I will correct said mistake posthaste.Below you’ll find micro s for each short story. But before I get into the tales themselves, I’d like to say a bit about Hill’s opening. I absolutely adore the forward of this book: Who’s Your Daddy? Getting some background on Hill’s relationship with his famous author parents and how he grew up to be a writer himself. How could he not be compared to the King of modern horror when that King is his dad? And honestly, how both he and his father handled rejection is so inspiring. I love that Hill decided to follow in his father’s footsteps but didn’t want to get there riding said father’s coattails. And now, without further ado, here are my thoughts on the stories in this collection.Throttle (with Stephen King), read by Stephen Lang: 3 starsNot super original, but a story well told. I found it an interesting departure from the relationship Hill described having with his own dad in the forward. There was nothing wrong with this story, but it felt decidedly more King than Hill. While the trappings were different, this is a story I’ve heard before.Dark Carousel, read by Nate Corddry: 4.5 stars I really loved this one. I don’t think a scary story involving a carousel can exist without making me think of Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes, and I was glad Hill gave him a nod with the mention of The October Country. There was also a quick reference to NOS4A2 that was fun to catch. The story itself was engaging and tense, and I didn’t fully predict the outcome. There were a couple of horrifying moments that I could actually visual, and they totally creeped me out in the best way. This is a story I’ll happily read every October.Wolverton Station, read by Neil Gaiman: 4 starsHonestly, that fourth star is for Gaiman. The man has an exquisite reading voice. The story itself was as tense as the previous story, but had an absurdity to the concept that was almost funny. I love the thought of dapper werewolves, and sports bro werewolves, and other classes of werewolf all sharing a train.By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain, read by Kate Mulgrew: 4.5 starsThis little story was sweet and heartbreaking, and it’s easy to see that Hill can write compelling and tangibly real children just as well as his father. I wish I could adopt Gail. She’s insanely smart and creative and has an imagination second to none. I would’ve come to see your find, Gail. I promise.Faun, read by Zachary Quinto: 4.5 starsThis gave me serious “The Most Dangerous Game” vibes, but the fantasy edition. It was inspired by Bradbury’s “A Sound of Thunder” but managed to never feel derivative. It also paid homage to fantasy tales like Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but with a very dark twist. In my opinion it was one of the most original and least King-ish of the stories in the collection. Also, don’t hunt what you don’t understand. And don’t be a dick, because sometimes it’s fatal.Late Returns, read by Wil Weaton: 5 starsA time traveling book-mobile that gives those nearing their deaths one last, great read from the future? YES PLEASE. Books are the best thing in the world for bringing people together, and I can’t think of any parting gift from the world as wonderful as a chance to read a perfect-for-me book that won’t be written until long after I’m gone. Also, Hill found a way to namedrop himself and it made me smile. Very poignant, and definitely my favorite. It’s a story I would happily buy a physical copy of and which I would love to find a way to give to my bookwormy friends.All I Care About Is You, read by Ashley Cummings: 4 starsThe most sci-fi story of the collection. Iris felt very real, and struck a perfect balance between snotty, selfish teenager and tired, philosophical young adult who has had to grow up before her time. The future Hill crafted for this story is incredibly intriguing, walking a line between a fantasy world and a world so overly saturated in entertainment that it borders on a dystopia. It’s a ferocious life, and Iris is definitely cut out for it. It was sweet and thoughtful, sad and horrible, all in turns.Thumbprint, read by Laysla De Oliveira: 1.5 starsOne of my two least favorites of the stories. I can’t put my finger (or thumb) on what it was that I hated so much. Every character is either a horrible person or pitiable. It did nothing for me, except make me doubt that humanity is in any way redeemable. It felt oddly preachy, even though I can’t nail down what exactly was being preached. I just didn’t like it.The Devil on the Staircase, read by George Guidall: 3.5 starsThere was something fairy tale-esque about this story that I really enjoyed. It felt like a fable made real. This was the shortest story in the collection and I think it suffered for it. With just a bit more information this could have been at least a 4 star tale, but it ended up feeling a bit rushed.Mums, read by Connor Jessup: 4.5 starsWell, that was absolutely terrifying. By far the scariest story in the collection. There were some images evoked that I’m pretty sure are going to haunt my dreams for a while. It’s amazing to me how significant the mom’s name turned out to be, and I’m still not positive what was real and what was dreamed. I don’t think I’ll ever plant anything on a grave; precut bouquets will just have to do. *shudders*In the Tall Grass (with Stephen King), read by Stephen Lang: 4 starsVery creepy. And scary. While different in plot, the setting brought to mind another classic King short story, ""Children of the Corn."" Stories like these are why I have no desire to go through corn mazes at Halloween time. No thank you. Pregnant women, steer clear!You Are Released, read by Joe Hill: 1.5 starsMy other least favorite. Too realistic to be enjoyable. I read to escape, so I was immediately turned off by the real politics and the plausible danger. I also found it very forgettable; the story is already fading away in my mind. It did nothing for me. Except for the spelling bee girl. She was adorable. Half a star for her.Twittering From the Circus of the Dead (read by no one, as it was included as a PDF): 4 starsI totally understand why this wasn’t recorded as part of the audiobook, but was instead included as a PDF. The tweet format would have lost its power if spoken instead of visually read. The format worked incredibly well for this story. I’m always on the lookout for good circus stories, scary or otherwise, and this was a good one made more interesting through its formatting.Overall, I found this to be an incredibly strong collection. While I think that Full Throttle would be worth purchasing for “Late Returns” alone, there are a host of great stories here. And they’re varied enough that there’s something here for just about everyone.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Oct 24, 2019","Nov 05, 2019","Sep 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43801817-full-throttle

A pointless waste of energy.”I have to say, I’d never have picked up this book had it not been so highly recommended by both Petrik and his girlfriend, Katherine. Not because the subject matter wasn’t of interested, but because I had honestly never heard of it. I’m not sure how, but A Ladder to the Sky completely missed my radar when it was released in 2018. I had heard of two other of the author’s work, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and The Heart’s Invisible Furies, and while they sound great, the premise of this particular book is far more intriguing to me personally. As someone who loves every single aspect of books, from how they’re made to who wrote them to those who sell them and the stories they actually hold, any novel that involves bookselling or authorship or any other profession or hobby linked to books is always going to draw me in. Not every such book delivers, in my opinion, but this one sure does. A Ladder to the Sky was compulsively readable from page one, even though it took me a bit longer to actually gel with the story it was telling.“Would there be no end to publishing? he wondered. Perhaps it would be a good idea if everyone just stopped writing for a couple of years and allowed readers to catch up.”This is a story in three parts, but each part is predominantly focused on Maurice Swift. We meet him as a young man and follow him throughout his life. Maurice is a man with two dreams: he wants to be a celebrated author and a father. And he won’t let anyone or anything get in the way of those dreams, including his inability to think of any stories to actually tell. Ambition is quite literally all that drives him, and he doesn’t care how many people he uses and ruins on his way to achieving his goals. “The more you read, the more you write, the more the ideas will appear. They’ll fall like confetti around your head and your only difficulty will be deciding which ones to catch and which to let fall to the floor.”I’m pretty sure Maurice Swift is the most despicable literary character I’ve ever experienced. Even Humbert Humbert, the narrator of Lolita who is obsessed with the titular girl though she is far from grown, seemed to have more a conscience than Maurice. Maurice seemed incapable of viewing other people as, well, people. They were merely dolls to be played with until he tired of them and threw them away for something new, or a source from whom he could leech ideas like the creative vampire he was at his core. And the thing is, even when he was confronted with his sins, he firmly believed he had done nothing wrong. I find that utter lack of basic human decency both baffling and disturbingly believable, and Boyne did a phenomenal job crafting a character who is both despicable and memorable.“Writers are all fascists. We like to control the discourse and crush anyone who dares to disagree with us.”There were times that I felt sure I knew where the book was going, and in at least two such instances I was utterly and completely wrong. The concept of idea theft is nothing new, but Boyne managed to set his iteration apart through some pretty wild plot twists. Even when I felt sure of my predictions, I would be blindsided by some new facet to the story. Also, I loved the things Boyne had to say about books and their readers. He really captured some of our most common disagreements as readers and managed to show both sides of said arguments without committing to either.“Life’s too short. As far as I’m concerned, a writer gets one hundred pages and, if they can’t keep my attention during that time, I move on.”“You can’t say you’ve read a novel unless you’ve read it cover to cover. Yes, perhaps you’ll be bored at the start but what if it gets better and suddenly everything that went before falls into place?”My only issue with A Ladder to the Sky was it rampant and unabashed sexuality, especially in the first third of the book. There were multiple characters who seemed utterly consumed by their own sexuality and their lust for Swift, to the point where their sexuality seemed to completely dominate every other personality trait. I enjoy sex as much as the next person, but I think it’s really unhealthy to completely define yourself by your sexuality, and to let that one portion of yourself overwhelm any other definitely characteristic within you. “When the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers.”While it took the story a bit to begin growing on me, A Ladder to the Sky is one of the most compulsively readable works of literary fiction I’ve read in quite some time. I was gripped from the first page, even though I was unable to root for anyone. There are no heroes in this story. But it’s a tale very well told, and undoubtedly worth reading.You can find  this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Dec 09, 2019","Dec 12, 2019","Sep 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40400269-a-ladder-to-the-sky

But though it was compelling from page 1, it didn’t start out fun. Having an apocalyptic eventThe Calculating Stars was such a fun, compelling story. But though it was compelling from page 1, it didn’t start out fun. Having an apocalyptic event occur that wipes out your family and the city you call home, and having to come to terms with the fact that your entire planet will become uninhabitable within a matter of decades is understandably a difficult situation for our perspective character, Elma York. She is a mathematics savant and a killer pilot, and is married to a legit rocket scientist. The couple find themselves at the core of the International Aerospace Coalition, earth’s response to the disaster that struck in the book’s early pages. If the planet will soon be inhospitable, then the only option is to find a way to get mankind into space and colonize other heavenly bodies. Elma and her husband, Nathan, are working night and day to make that plan become reality. But Elma wants to do more than compute equations; she wants to become the first female astronaut.I loved the setting of this book, and thought that Kowal did a brilliant job balancing fact and fiction. The feel of the US in the 1950s was spot on, including appearances or mentions of real people from the era. The Space Race, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Cold War were such huge parts of that time period, and all of those elements were present in and vital to this novel. I would strongly recommend reading (or watching) Hidden Figures before picking up The Calculating Stars. My decision to do so radically improved my experience with this book, because I was already very familiar with the female computers of NACA and NASA, and the fact that they weren’t given the same rights and recognitions as the men they worked with, as well as who role racism played in the space program.This is only the second book I’ve read from Kowal, and it couldn’t have been more different from Regency period fantasy of manners that is Shades of Milk and Honey. Because of my experience with the aforementioned fantasy novel, I was expecting a level of cleanliness along the same lines. I was amused to find that wasn’t the case. Not that The Calculating Stars was dirty in any way. If movie ratings were applied to books, Shades of Milk and Honey would’ve been a mild PG, while The Calculating Stars would be PG-13 for occasional strong language and sexual innuendo. Speaking of sexual innuendo, there was a lot more sex in this book than I expected. It was never detailed, but it was frequent. And cheesy in the best way. Seriously, I rolled my eyes and legitimately laughed out loud on more than one occasion. I love the relationship between Elma and Nathan. I feel like strong, happy marriages are a rarity in fiction, which made the York’s marriage a breath of fresh air. The love and support they have for one another, as well as their healthy appreciation for each other’s physique, was a wonderful contrast to the romantic angst so prevalent in fiction.Kowal has a deft and delicate hand with characterizations, and that was displayed wonderfully in The Calculating Stars. Both the main character and all of the supporting characters were fun and vibrant and driven to make the most of every opportunity they were given. I also wholeheartedly approve of the levels of sass and sarcasm packed into just over 400 pages. It’s fantastic that something on the lighter end of science fiction won a Hugo this year. I can’t wait to see where Elma York and the other Lady Astronauts go from here.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Sep 12, 2019","Sep 18, 2019","Sep 12, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33080122-the-calculating-stars

Actual rating: 3.5 starsI’m going to be honest; the only reason I decided to pick this up right now was because I am crazy excited for The Institute. Based on the synopsis, I wanted to have read this book and Carrie before starting King’s newest novel, and I was already halfway there. While both Firestarter and Carrie involve girls with some kind of extraordinary mental ability, Carrie and Charlie couldn’t have been more different. While both were capable of great destruction, Charlie has far more control even though she is far younger. And I think the main reason for this vast difference can be found in the way they were parented.Even those who have never read or watched Carrie tend to know at least the basics of Carrie’s story. She’s had a very difficult upbringing, raised by a fanatical mother who has basically beaten the poor child over the head with misinterpretations of the Bible her entire young life. She’s been mistreated and ridiculed by nearly every classmate and teacher and random stranger who has ever crossed her path. We all know the events that brought all of her trauma to a head and led to her losing it. She had a really rough life. It’s hard to hold her terrible decisions against her.And then there’s Charlie. Charlie was born with a crazy ability just like Carrie. But she was thankfully born to loving, intelligent parents who did all they could to keep her safe. Firestarter began much more high-speed than most of King’s books. You were immediately in the middle of the action with the main characters, with very little idea how you got there. Charlie and her father are on the run from some shady government organization because of their abilities. Her mother is no longer in the picture, having been killed by the same organization. Even in the midst of the terror that emanates from these two characters, you can feel the healthy foundation of their relationship. So many of King’s parent/child relationships are horribly unhealthy. Not so with Charlie and Andy. Andy is a great dad, and will do anything to protect his child. It was so refreshing to see a wholesome relationship between a father and daughter in a King novel. I’m trying to recall a similarly healthy relationship in the other books of his I’ve read, but nothing’s coming to me.This was a fun read. The main characters were interesting and found themselves in interesting situations. But I found Firestarter pretty forgettable in comparison to the other books I’ve read from King. However, I will say that John Rainbird is one of the most disturbing human villains I’ve come across. The ending of the book was decent for King, which is saying something since endings really aren’t his strong suit.

Tales are like honey cakes. Once you have tasted one, you want another, and another, and always more.”This was my first encounter with Juliet Marillier, but it certainly won’t be the last. I can see her becoming one of those authors I turn to when I’ve just had enough of the darkness, and need something bright and pretty in my life. The Harp of Kings is lovely and lush and bright, a wonderful change from the grimdark that populates the fantasy genre. And from what I gather, that’s par for the course with Marillier’s work. While there are stakes here, it’s still a quiet story, inviting and soothing and somehow peaceful even when the events of the story are not. I found it to be a story that calls one to meander along instead of racing ahead. This book is the first in a new series of standalones, set in a world that will already be familiar to Marillier’s fans. But even if you’ve never read any of her work before (like me), this is a great starting point. I never felt lost in the least, though I am now definitely more curious about her various other series. Also, even thought this book is the first in a new series, it stands on its own perfectly well, with a plot that feels self contained and completely finished.“Magic is real. It may not come in just the way you want, or exactly when you want it, because it’s tricky and unpredictably and…difficult. And sometimes it’s hard to believe it’s possible. But what about all those old stories? And the songs we sing every night? They are full of magic.”I must confess that what drew me to this book was the title, of both this book in particular and its series. With names like The Harp of Kings and Warrior Bards, I knew that music would surely be a central theme. And it was! My favorite micro-genre of fantasy, if that’s even a thing, is musical fantasy. Whether the main character is a musician, or a song is at the core of something, or music just makes frequent appearances, I’ll always have a soft spot for books where music has some importance. The Name of the Wind, Bloody Rose, and The Troupe are among my favorite books of all time, and music is an important part of all three. Happily, The Harp of Kings scratched that itch, giving me a book with musicians serving as two of the three perspectives, a hunt for a mystical instrument that has mysteriously disappeared, and songs themselves even being used as weapons at one point.“Thank the gods for music. The harp is my map and my lodestone, my balm and my comfort. It quiets my circling thoughts like nothing else can. I sing and play every night. Even when I am fighting, my mind teems with tunes and verses.”The Harp of Kings is the story of three young warriors training in hopes of becoming Swan Island warriors, a renowned group with a strenuous selection process. Liobhan is hoping to join the even more elite group of female Swan Island warriors. She’s highly skilled and strong and fiercely determined, with a temper as fiery as her hair. She knows her mind and often acts or speaks before she thinks, though she’s working on that. Her brother Brocc is gifted and quietly charismatic, but lacks the drive that fuels Liobhan. Both siblings are talented musicians, but Brocc’s talent runs deeper, as does his passion for music. He can’t breathe without it. And while he wants to help his sister attain her goal, he would rather write and sing and play the harp than fight. Rounding out the trio is Dau, a stiff and unbending warrior who thinks that both Brocc and Liobhan are unworthy to become Swan Island warriors, Brocc because he would obviously rather be a musician, and Liobhan because she has the nerve to be female. “…To be the best, you must give body, heart, and spirit… You have to put all of yourself into whatever you chose to do. That means one vocation and one only; if you’re the best, there’s nothing left to give.”While there is no love lost between Dau and Liobhan, the each have to admit that the other is their greatest competition for one of the few slots open to new Swan Island recruits. Before their training is even complete, the three trainees are sent on a mission to recover the Harp of Kings, a mystical instrument that must be played at the coronation of a new king. Liobhan, Brocc, and Dau must become a team and find the lost harp before Midsummer, or the kingdom will have to wait another year for their king to be crowned. Throughout their journey, all three characters grow by leaps and bounds. Dau, who I had little liking for early on, proved to be the deepest, strongest character and ended up being my favorite of the three perspectives. His backstory was given piece by heartbreaking piece, and every new tidbit of information made me love him more. I hope to see a lot more of him, as well as the other two perspective characters, in future installments. There were also some wonderful supporting characters, my favorite of whom was Mistress Juniper. And Marillier did a wonderful job of making animals feel vitally important and alive, especially through Dau’s eyes. “Music opens doors, yes; but only if those who live behind those doors want visitors.”This story is told in present tense from three first person perspectives. I’m not usually the biggest fan of first person present tense, but it works well here. Marillier made the voice of each perspective different enough to be convincing. I found that this choice in storytelling style also kept the book from feeling too formal, giving it a freshness it might not have otherwise had.“And there is a great magic; a power that comes from the very land we tread, from ocean and forest, from the deepest cavern to the high pathways of sun and moon. When the path ahead seems dark and difficult, when you cannot find the right way, call on that power to guid you, for within each of us, even the smallest, there is a spark of that great fire.”While I enjoyed the characters, and the fact that the story had music as such a central, important theme, my favorite element of this book was the setting. It felt very Irish, and I think Irish folklore has much to offer the fantasy world. I loved the presence of druids, and the composition and variety of the Folk, Fae-like beings who share this world but keep their presence hidden from most. There was a beauty to this mystical setting that felt both classic and timeless.I cannot come with you wherever you go,And I cannot stay by you in joy and in woe,But I’ll be beside you, though gone from your sight,I’ll love you and guard you till we meet in the light.The Harp of Kings is not a book I consumed quickly over a handful of sittings. I sipped on this book for nearly two weeks, which seems like a long time for such a small book. But I very much enjoyed having something so pretty and different to metaphorically snack on after a long day, and I wanted to prolong that enjoyment for as long as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed The Harp of Kings, and will definitely be making periodic forays into Marillier’s backlog while I eagerly away the next installment in this series.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Sep 03, 2019","Sep 17, 2019","Sep 03, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43316755-the-harp-of-kings

Magic for Liars is a murder mystery on a magical high school campus, told from the perspective of the nonmagical private eye who finds herself on the case. You can see why I was intrigued, right? Noir novels can be very hit or miss, but this one was definitely a hit. It was everything I was hoping for, and more than I was expecting.Ivy Gamble is a wonderfully developed character. She comes across a bit as a down-on-her-luck gumshoe detective at the beginning of the book, but she grows and changes so much throughout the book. When she is approached to look into a mysterious death on the campus of a magic school, the campus where her magical twin sister teaches, no less, Ivy is incredibly conflicted. She has no real relationship with her sister and doesn’t want to encroach on her world, but the pay is too good for her starving coffers to pass up. Ivy suddenly finds herself trying to balance a rekindling relationship with her sister, a burgeoning romance with one of the school’s teachers, the teenage drama running wild in the hallways, the questionable death that brought her to the school in the first place… and lies. Lots and lots of lies.The mystery elements of this novel were really fun, but my favorite aspect was the setting. I’m a sucker for any kind of school story, especially if that school is magical. What I loved so much about The Osthorne Academy for Young Mages is that it’s not Hogwarts. There’s nothing mystical about it. Osthorne is exactly like a real life preppy, private high school, but where magic is taught alongside your average subjects. I thought the lack of robes and moving stairways and haunted forests was incredibly refreshing, even though I adore all of those elements. I also really liked how scientific the magic was, and the medical implications that were discussed throughout. And the fact that our main character is an outsider looking in on this magical world was a wonderful change, as well. I enjoyed getting to see magic from the perspective of someone incapable of using it.I really liked Magic for Liars. Is it a book that I’ll remember forever and add to my shelf of lifetime favorites? No. But it was a fun ride that I would have no problem recommending to others.

I’m so glad that I somehow managed to go into this book basically blind, because it was a wild an unpredictable ride that I enjoyed to the end.“We all of us have our particular devil who rides us and torments us, and we must give battle in the end. We have conquered ours, or so we believe.”Rebecca really starts off with a literary bang. The opening line, “Last night I dreamed I went to Manderley again,” has become one of the most iconic openings in literature. And for very good reason. I can’t remember any other book sucking me in quite so quickly, not because of a character or plot, but from the sheer magnetism of the setting. The descriptions of Manderley in this dreamscape are lush and dark and tense, a captivating ruin that feels equal parts alluring and sinister. The story is cyclical, so we know how things end before they even begin. That writing decision gave the book a tension that I don’t think it could have delivered in any other way. It’s undoubtedly one of the most atmospheric novels I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading.“There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and the terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.”“Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy, even upon a dreamer’s fancy. As I stood there, hushed and still, I could swear that the house was not an empty shell but lived and breathed as it had lived before.”“We would not talk of Manderley, I would not tell him my dream. For Manderley was ours no longer. Manderley was no more.”Another of du Maurier’s choices that I found really compelling was the decision to never reveal the narrator’s name. Instead, we see her only in the roles she surrenders to, the inexperienced companion and the young wife and always, always the interloper of Manderley, the girl trying to fill the shoes of her larger than life predecessor as Mrs. de Winter, the titular Rebecca. When our narrator falls in love with and immediately marries Rebecca’s widower, she has no idea of the huge shadow that Rebecca will cast over the narrator’s every move and decision. But Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who runs Manderley with an iron fist, ensures that the narrator is reminded of Rebecca and the innumerable ways in which the narrator will never live up to Rebecca’s legacy at every turn. Danvers is one of the most disturbing characters I’ve come across in fiction. Her description is just as visceral and sinister as the opening portrait of Manderley, but without the charm and allure. “I am glad it cannot happen twice, the fever of first love. For it is a fever, and a burden, too, whatever the poets may say.”Almost every character drove me crazy in one way or another, especially the central characters of Maxim de Winter and the narrator. However, they were conveyed in such a way that I could be both annoyed and sympathetic simultaneously, which I think is quite an accomplishment. I found it fascinating that the most concrete character in the entire book is the only one never physically present: Rebecca. From blood red rhododendrons to strong and slanting penmanship to the wildness of the sea, the amount of symbolism linked to Rebecca is astounding. And the second most dominating character in the novel is, in my opinion, Manderley herself. Never have I read a place that felt so alive and powerful and central to a story. The narrator is somehow the least tangible member of the cast, and I think that’s in large part due to the fact that she lives far more within her own mind than she does in the real world. “I had said the name. I had said the word Rebecca aloud. It was a tremendous relief. It was as thought I had taken a purge and rid myself of intolerable pain. Rebecca. I had said it aloud.”I’m not going to discuss the plot at all, except to say that this is the only book of its age outside of the novels of Agatha Christie that has been able to legitimately surprise me multiple times over the course of its narrative. Rebecca took the concept of a gothic novel and modernized it.Wuthering Heights and almost on equal footing with Jane Eyre, which are the only two strong examples of gothic literature I’ve really experienced outside of Poe. Daphne du Maurier is a fascinating author with a style all her own, and I will most assuredly be reading more of her work in years to come. I can see why Hitchcock was so taken with her, and I’m interested to see how the screen interpretation of Rebecca differs from the novel.This was the second installment of the Novel Notions Classics Club is a go!

It was wonderful, balancing thought-provoking philosophy with nearly breakneck-speed action in this final installment. Pullman crafted a world, or should I say worlds, that I found captivating, and characters whom I grew to care about deeply. Many of these characters, especially Lyra and Will, have taken a little piece of my heart, and I believe they’ll reside there from now on. What a marvelous adventure.“I have stolen ideas from every book I have ever read.”While reading this book, I did something fairly unusual for me: I kept having to write about my thoughts. Usually, I might take notes on my phone and compile them all after finishing the book, or simply take no notes at all and write a  with nothing but my final thoughts circling around in my head. I could do neither here. I had to actually write out my thoughts as they came to me, so I didn’t forget to address something that I felt was important or forget why that element felt important in the first place. Because I responded to this book so differently from most, my  is going to be a bit different, as well. The next four or five paragraphs are thoughts I had to write out while I was reading. I decided to leave them mostly in their raw form instead of polishing them up and trying to wrangle them into some kind of flow that made sense. Most of these observations and opinions are very religious in nature, as this trilogy hinges so strongly on both belief and Christian mythos, so remember that these are incredibly subjective leanings. Without further ado, here are those thoughts. If you tire of my rambling, feel free to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final views.“I stopped believing there was a power of good and a power of evil that were outside us. And I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do, not for what they are.”The problem with the Church of Lyra’s world isn’t their belief or their faith, which I actually saw very little evidence in the series. The problem is that they wish to erase the gift of free will. God could have prevented the original Fall of man in the form of Eve’s choice and Adam’s decision to follow her example. But He didn’t, because one of the greatest gifts He gave us was the ability to make our own decisions through free will. Mankind has no right to revoke that right from future generations, because it’s not a right we bestowed on ourselves to begin with. Instead of taking away our ability to make our own decisions, God gave us another option: accepting the gift of salvation provided by His Son’s death and resurrection.“All the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity.”The theory of gaining absolution before the committing of a sin is one of the most disturbing concepts I’ve encountered. It flies in the face of God’s gift and His claim to judge us by our motivations even more than by our deeds. I know that this is a tenet that was once held by very radical sects of the Church, but it’s absolutely repugnant and theologically unsound. Which actually made it a perfect fit for the Church as portrayed by Pullman.“I’m just trying to wake up - I’m so afraid of sleeping all my life and then dying - I want to wake up first. I wouldn’t care if it was just for an hour, as long as I was properly alive and awake…” A number of the epigraphs in the book come from John Milton’s Paradise Lost, which would have seemed like an almost too obvious decision from Pullman if this weren’t so obviously inspired in large part by Milton’s work. And as Milton conveyed Lucifer more as an antihero than a villain, it was easy to guess which side Pullman would favor in his narrative. However, Pullman’s take was original enough to maintain a level of unpredictability often absent in stories that are so closely linked to a retelling.“People are too complicated to have simple labels.”The descriptions of the Mulefa and their world reminded me of Perelandra, a world visited by Ransom in Lewis’s Space Trilogy. The mood, the innocence, the vast difference between the sentient creatures and humankind, and the relationship one of the adult human characters develops with these unique creatures all hearkened back to Lewis’s Ransom, and his experiences. This was a welcome addition, and was a much needed change of pace in the midst of so much action and trauma throughout the rest of the book.“What work do I have to do then?"" said Will, but went on at once, ""No, on second thought, don't tell me. I shall decide what I do. If you say my work is fighting, or healing, or exploring, or whatever you might say, I'll always be thinking about it. And if I do end up doing that, I'll be resentful because it'll feel as if I didn't have a choice, and if I don't do it, I'll feel guilty because I should. Whatever I do, I will choose it, no one else.”The spoiler that was thrown in my face when I was a child, (view spoiler)[namely that the two main characters kill God (hide spoiler)], was vastly overstated by the person who delivered it. Yes, this event does occur, but I was expecting premeditated brutality, not the quiet, heartbreaking outcome of an act of kindness. The whole worldview of this trilogy, while different from my own, was not nearly as radical as I was led to believe. This is a story of growing up, of leaving childhood when all you want to do is cling to it, of choosing one dream from many and mourning as the other possibilities move from could-be to might-have-been. It’s about doing good when it would be so much easier to be selfish, and redeeming yourself when the decisions of your past had a hand in harming others. It’s about love and free will and that fact that being able to choose your own path is both blessing and curse. I believe all these things. Where I differ from Pullman is in my belief that God is near, that He respects your choices but cares deeply about you, while Pullman conveys a God who is distant, uncaring, and fallible. I very strongly disagree with this quote and others like it for pretty obvious reasons: “The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake.” Pullman and I couldn’t be more opposed on that statement. Did that difference make me love this book, and the trilogy in its entirety, any less? Absolutely not.“When you choose one way out of many, all the ways you don't take are snuffed out like candles, as if they'd never existed.” I was honestly blown about by His Dark Materials. It is one of the richest, most lovingly crafted trilogies I’ve had the pleasure of reading. It is epic and heartbreaking and sweet and fierce, and I absolutely loved it. Both Lyra and Will, and many of their supporting cast, will always have a place in my heart. Especially Lyra. She is kind and brave and incredibly loving, and I think every little girl could use a role model like her. Each book somehow improved the volume that preceded it, and it’s a series that I believe will lend itself very well to rereadings. His Dark Materials is a modern classic of the fantasy genre for a reason, and it’s well worth your time.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Aug 31, 2019","Sep 03, 2019","Aug 31, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/5949392-the-amber-spyglass

I quite enjoy Will, and found him a great counterpart for Lyra. Their personalities are very different, but they are both defined most by the protectiveness that fuels them and the fierceness that courses through them. Will is both more civilized and more violent than Lyra, which shines a softer light on our original protagonist than we saw in her first book. The two children on the cusp of their adolescence are quite obviously being set up as either the salvation or damnation of the countless worlds they now know exist. “It’s like having to make a choice: a blessing or a curse. The one thing you can’t do is choose neither.”  I enjoyed how Pullman made some of these alternate worlds so similar, with just enough differences to be jarring. The further implications of the importance of dæmons, whether they be externally expressed or contained within a person, are fascinating, as is the relation of Dust to dark matter in our own world. Even though I enjoyed these philosophical elements, this book felt far more like a thriller than the adventure story found in The Golden Compass. And yet, I also felt this book was a good deal slower, suffering in places from middle-book syndrome. There’s no was that this book could stand well on its own, at least in my opinion. The events of the previous book are absolutely necessary knowledge in order to understand what’s going on in The Subtle Knife, and the cliffhanger ending would have been infuriating had I not been able to immediately pick up the final installment. “I found folly everywhere, but there were grains of wisdom in every stream of it.” Besides the philosophical questions and wonderfully fleshed out child protagonists, my favorite elements of this series are the title objects. The Golden Compass, or aliethiometer, of the first book was a fascinating concept and was so well described that I could almost feel the weight of it in my palms. The namesake of The Subtle Knife is just was intriguing and easy to visualize. I’m already excited to find out the significance of the finale’s title, The Amber Spyglass. As a side note, I was also taken with the adult characters from The Golden Compass who have developed a love for Lyra and determined within themselves to do all they can to stand in for her parents. They’re lovely individuals, and the hard choices they made were so incredibly worthy of respect. “Every little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit.” I didn’t love The Subtle Knife as much as I did its predecessor, but I still enjoyed it and found myself excited to pick up the final installment. While I definitely don’t share the worldview conveyed in this series, I don’t feel at all like Pullman was trying to preach through his trilogy; he’s just telling a good story that feels both vastly different and sometimes similar to series that shaped my childhood. As much as I love Narnia, it’s definitely a series that pushes its worldview, because that was the intention behind its authorship. I’m interested to see how I feel about The Amber Spyglass, and if I can maintain my objectivity in the face of the events that were spoiled for me so many years ago.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Aug 29, 2019","Aug 31, 2019","Aug 29, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6470718-the-subtle-knife

When I was in elementary school, I was just beginning to develop a lot for fantasy. Harry Potter was fairly new, with only the first couple of books having been released. I had consumed those, and A Wrinkle in Time, and the majority of the Redwall books that had been published. But my favorite series was The Chronicles of Narnia. I loved the Christian allegory, as I had come to my faith quite young. When I picked up The Golden Compass, I enjoyed it almost as much, even though I found the concept of dæmons both fascinating and disconcerting. However, a well-meaning teacher informed me that His Dark Materials was known as the anti-Narnia, and proceeded to spoil some plot points of the next book in order to discourage me from continuing the series. I was appalled at the thought of a series that was so vehemently opposed to my faith, so I steered clear of it and let myself forget about how enjoyable I found the first book. “We are all subject to the fates. But we must act as if we are not, or die of despair.” I’m an adult now. I’ve read things that are greatly opposed to my faith and I’ve found that these works encourage me to question in a healthy way, and my faith is stronger for it. So why was I still so hesitant to approach this trilogy again? My best guess is that opinions developed during childhood are difficult to overcome. But I decided it was time, since my favorite books still tend to be the classics of children’s fantasy, and I’m endeavoring to read my way through those I missed in my childhood. My expectations were pretty high for this opening installment, as I remembered it being addictive and engrossing. I wasn’t wrong, and The Golden Compass met and exceeded those expectations.“Men and women are moved by tides much fiercer than you can imagine, and they sweep us all up into the current.” This is honestly not set up as a children’s book as much as it is a fantasy featuring a pre-adolescent main character. The writing is wonderfully engaging, and has a maturity that lends itself well to adult consumption. There is never a sense of omniscient narration; instead, we only learn important information, be that new revelations or background information as our the knowledge is revealed to our child protagonist. Said child protagonist is a marvel, though, and is surely why so many children have come to adore this series in the twenty-five years since The Golden Compass was first published. Lyra is the scrappiest heroine I’ve ever come across. More recent heroines, like Nona from Book of the Ancestor or even Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, surely were inspired at least in small part by her. She is tough as boot leather, and too fierce to let anything or anyone stop her from accomplishing her goals. I adore her and am both excited and nervous to see what the rest of the series holds for her.“You cannot change what you are, only what you do.” There’s a good bit of philosophy present here, including a great conversation late in the novel about free will. I have yet to run across anything as vehemently anti-Christian as I was led to believe would be present here, though there has been some critiques of the Church. But I found those critiques fair, to be honest. And because Lyra’s world is not exactly ours, but more of a funhouse mirror version, I felt no discomfort at all over the critiques. One of the elements I find the most fascinating that is certainly at the core of the religious and philosophical elements I’ve encountered thus far are the presence and mystery of dæmons. I don’t want to discuss them too much, as I think certain revelations about them are important to the plot, but the entire concept of them is incredibly intriguing. I can see where the concept of dæmons could make some uncomfortable, but I think they raise some great questions about what makes us who we are at our core.“You speak of destiny as if it was fixed.” I very much enjoyed revisiting this book, and wholeheartedly agree with the respect and love it inspires in the fantasy community. Will I feel that way about the series in its entirety? I have absolutely no idea. But I’m very interested to see what I think about the remaining two novels, as well as the newer, spinoff installments. Pullman has quite the way with a story, and I’m eager to see what happens next.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,1,18,1,"Aug 27, 2019","Aug 29, 2019","Aug 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/119322.The_Golden_Compass

The third is that we dehumanize our enemy.”I would’ve never picked up this book had I not enjoyed another book of Backman’s so much. But Beartown couldn’t have been more different from A Man Called Ove; honestly, I wouldn’t have even guessed they were by the same author. That being said, they were both masterfully done. A Man Called Ove made my heart swollen and tender in the best way. Beartown shattered my heart and sharpened the fragments into deadly shrapnel that threatened to rip into those I love. It absolutely wrecked me. And not at all in a healthy, cathartic way. No, I wasn’t myself the entire time I was reading this. I was barely suppressed rage. “Bitterness can be corrosive. It can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.” Beartown shows how success can burn your world down around you just as surely as failure can. If winning is more important than anything, it can cost everything. “Never trust people who don't have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.”I don’t do sports. The closest I get is watching American Ninja Warrior or World of Dance or the gymnastics portions of the Summer Olympics. Sports just never really clicked for me. I don’t get the appeal. Part of this is because I’m the most athletically challenged person I’ve ever met. I had to be taught how to swing and slide and do a plethora of other things that most kids just instinctively know how to do. I found my identity in words and music instead. So I didn’t expect to care about a book about hockey. But I did. I cared so much that it ruined my life for an entire week. Beartown is a small, hard town with nothing going for it but hockey. The sport is all that matters to the town, so when their beloved hockey team is threatened, the town amasses to protect the team. Even if the team is in the wrong.“What an uncomfortable, terrible source of shame it is for the world that the victim is so often the one left with the most empathy for others.”I’m not going to talk about the plot or even about particular characters, as I’m not sure I can be objective enough to avoid inadvertently spoiling something for those who haven’t read it. So instead I’ll say that I’m completely blown away by Backman’s deftness when it comes to characterizations. The citizens of Beartown were so varied and believable that I actually had a hard time convincing myself that their story was fictional. As everything came to a head and imploded in on the town, I felt less like an observer and more like an actual resident of the town. I had great difficulty remembering that the events weren’t actually happening to me or someone I knew. “If you are honest, people may deceive you. Be honest anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway. All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. Do good anyway.”“What you create, others can destroy. Create anyway. Because in the end, it is between you and God. It was never between you and anyone else anyway.”I’ve read countless amazing books, many of which have caused me to feel deeply on behalf of one or multiple characters. I’ve read through tears, or felt my blood pressure skyrocket, or had to force shaking hands to put the book down and walk away until I could remember that it was just a story. But never in my life have I been as emotionally impacted by a book as I was by Beartown. For days I felt like anger and tears were simmering just below my skin, and I couldn’t figure out what I was so upset about. Finally, it hit me; I was upset by the book. I woke up angry and went to bed angry for nearly a week, even if I made myself not pick up the book at all over the course of a day. And I’m not an angry person by nature. Backman created a town and a plot and characters that were so believable that I felt physically sick with rage until I finished their story. It was powerful and viscerally real and the best book I hope to never pick up again. It really wasn’t good for me.“Religion is something between you and other people; it’s full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith . . . that’s just between you and God.”Something that just blows me away is the fact that this is a translation. Backman is obviously insanely gifted if he can ruin my life for a week through someone else’s translation of his work. I applaud Neil Smith for doing such a tremendous job translating this book into English. Every word choice was purposeful and powerful. The prose was lovely but spare, sucking me deeper into the narrative instead of ever distracting me away from the story to meditate on the words themselves. I honestly don’t think it could have been crafted any better. Because I so desperately want to avoid spoiling this powerhouse of a book for anyone, I’m not going to give trigger warnings.

I love Louisiana and the entirety of the American South. In my opinion, there’s something magical and incredibly atmospheric about the South. However, I also see the failings of the area, the poverty and lack of education and propensity to hate whatever is different. It’s the kind of place where people will bend over backwards to help a person in need, but only if said person is an accepted part of the community. People who are different are often met with ignorance, distrust, and judgment, and that’s if people decide to notice you at all. Southerners are old pros at pretending a problem doesn’t exist if they can just ignore it hard enough. Thankfully, my community has grown past this, and it far more accepting of those of different religions and ethnicities and sexualities than we were even a decade ago. Even here in the South, things can change.“There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.”The reason I feel so strongly about Southern literature is that authors so often choose only one of these sides to represent. Either they gloss over the problems of the South and focus on the charm, or they harp on our failings without ever recognizing our strengths. While Southern Lit is something I thirst for, I have put down books in frustration more times than I can count because we so often come across as two-dimensional. But when I find good Southern Lit, I rejoice. There was much rejoicing in the land when I picked up Where the Crawdads Sing. There might be hundreds upon hundreds of miles between Louisiana and North Carolina, but Delia Owens made me feel right at home, like I was seeing the place I love most in the world decades in the past. The beauty of the South mingled on the page with combination of small-minded judgment and overwhelming kindness that defines us. Owens was never preachy about the South’s shortcomings, but she laid them bare for the world to see. And she did so in such an honest, balanced way that I don’t think anyone can refute her portrayal.“I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.”Kya Clark has been left all her life. First, her mother walks out, leaving Kya and her siblings to survive their harsh life in the marsh and find a way to live with their drunken, abusive father. Gradually, Kya’s siblings leave as well, and she’s alone with her father. Not long after, said drunken father doesn’t come home one night and Kya finds herself alone in their little marsh shack. No one ever comes back. Kya is ten years old. Raised to fear and distrust those in positions of authority, Kya stays one step ahead to the social workers who want to take Kya in and find her a family. Nothing would hurt Kya more than being forced to leave the marsh. Because the marsh has always been there for her. When everyone in her life left her, the marsh was steady and reliable and constant. Kya loves the marsh with her entire being, and becomes known simply as the Marsh-Girl by the community at large. She has never attended school, but she knows more about the marsh than probably anyone alive, and believes that she is the only person that truly loves it. That is, until she one of her brothers’ friends makes a reappearance in her life. Tate is kind and compassionate and the only person in the world who sees how special and bright the Marsh-Girl is. He changes Kya’s life in so many ways. But has she been alone for too long? How does long term isolation and loneliness intrinsically alter a person’s character?“Why should the injured, the still bleeding, bear the onus of forgiveness?” I was blown away by Kya. Out of all the orphans in literature, she’s the one I yearned to pluck from her book and adopt the most. Owens did a marvelous job crafting this little girl who raises herself in the wild. I’ve always loved stories of man versus nature. Stories like Hatchet and Julie of the Wolves, My Side of the Mountain and Island of the Blue Dolphins were staples of my childhood, and they’re books I still revisit as an adult. But Kya never warred against nature; she embraced it and adored it and became one with her marsh in ways that I think very few people could. I’ve lived my entire life in the midst of nature and, though I love it and wouldn’t trade my life and my home for anything, I’ve never become part of my surroundings like that. But it’s a concept that really appeals to me. If only there weren’t mosquitos and water moccasins and leaches in the swamp behind my house…“She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn't her fault she'd been alone. Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.” While Kya’s character and the marsh itself were by far my two favorite elements of this book, Owens also incorporated a compelling and multifaceted mystery into the narrative. It was never predictable. I had no idea how things would turn out in the end. Which is just another reason that I absolutely adored this book. Kya’s story is sad and beautiful and inspiring, and I can already tell that this is a book that I’ll be mulling over for years to come and revisiting often. Whether you’re from the American South or from a world away, I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy of this book and meet Kya. She’ll immediately win you over.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Aug 12, 2019","Aug 17, 2019","Aug 12, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing

When I watched the movie inspired by this book with an American History class I was temporarily teaching, my eyes were opened to just how little I knew about the Cold War and Civil Rights eras, and how the two were so deeply entwined. I’m thankful for the information; I just wish I had realized it sooner. After having read the book as well, I have a new appreciation for the story overall, but also for the title of the book. I love anything with a dual meaning, and both the math behind these amazing advancement and the women who calculated them were indeed hidden figures.“Their dark skin, their gender, their economic status--none of those were acceptable excuses for not giving the fullest rein to their imaginations and ambitions.”I have so much respect for the women whose stories were so lovingly told through this book. They held themselves with such aplomb, when so many people would’ve been happy to watch them fail. Everything that both women and people of color had to put up with and endeavor to overcome during this period is infuriating, but the ways in which they rose to the challenge again and again was more than inspirational. I know that without their quiet determination and refusal to bow to pressure and make easier decisions, today’s Americans who share their gender or skin color or both would have fewer rights than we enjoy today.“Women, on the other hand, had to wield their intellects like a scythe, hacking away against the stubborn underbrush of low expectations.” I’m glad to have read this book, because it shed so much more light on the women whose stories I came to know through the movie. However, I have to confess that I enjoyed the movie more, as I was able to develop more of an emotional connection to the women through that format. This preference is solely subjective; I’m just not a big nonfiction reader, and rarely develop deep emotional ties to works that aren’t fictional. I probably would’ve left my experience with Hidden Figures strictly to my consumption of the film if it wasn’t for my desire to read this year’s Hugo Award Winner: The Calculating Stars, which was surely inspired in large part by this powerful true story. I can’t wait to read The Calculating Stars, and I’m even more excited about it after having read Hidden Figures. I highly recommend this work of nonfiction to anyone interested in learning more about the women whose supporting roles in the sciences prepared the way for every girl who has ever been interested in STEM subjects, and for those who want to see the Civil Rights Movement and the Cold War from a fresh perspective.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Aug 10, 2019","Aug 24, 2019","Aug 10, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25953369-hidden-figures

The story wasn’t anything mindblowingly original, and the plot twists were fairly predictable, but overall this was a very enjoyable middle grade work.

When the book advertised itself as traveling back in time to history’s most famous concerts, I was expecting to see Woodstock or at least concerts featuring actual famous artists from history. The closest Jukebox Joyride came to delivering on this was the inclusion of a young Mozart; every other major musical event mentioned might have been based on historical happenings, but were in fact fictionalized.

Or if they’re not fair, they’re not fair with purpose.I wish I could tell better where stories end and life begins.Sometimes you just need to escape into a good book. But if you’re Charles Sutherland, sometimes you inadvertently facilitate the escape of fictional characters into the real world. Imagine being able to read out your favorite character from a story and have an actual conversation with them. That sounds like a dream come true for most bookworms, but it’s been a nightmare that Rob, Charley’s big brother and our first person perspective character, has spent his life trying to avoid. He’s had to clean up Charley’s fictional messes a multitude of times throughout his life, but the current fictional mess they find themselves in is the zaniest and more far reaching, and frankly the most dangerous, that the Sutherland family has ever faced. Their world is going to be changed forever if they can’t figure out a way to thwart what’s coming. “That’s the danger of stories… They bring things into the world, and they can’t be put away again.”When I first started reading this book, I was strongly reminded of some of my favorite pieces of children’s fiction, most specifically Inkheart by Cornelia Funke. That book also involves the reading out of fictional characters from their books. However, The Unlikely Escape of Uriah Heep takes this concept a few steps further. Whereas the characters in Inkheart came from an imaginary book of the same name, Parry used real books and real characters from them to populate her fictional cast. We have Dorian Gray and Heathcliff, the White Witch from Narnia and Roald Dahl’s Matilda, Sherlock Holmes and five different incarnations of Mr. Darcy and a plethora of Dickensian characters who make themselves known in this novel. It was a delightful inclusion that made me actually want to read more Dickens, especially David Copperfield and Great Expectations. I’ve only ever read Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and A Christmas Carol, but I now find myself looking forward to remedying that lack.“If you’re wanting some sort of theory about what we’re made of, old thing, that’s the best I can do. We’re half words, and half thought.”“The point where language and interpretation meet…”I also deeply appreciated how much textual interpretation influenced the appearance and character of any fictional entity read from the page into reality. While each character took on a life of the their own once they were read into being, their identity was shaped by how their reader viewed them. I love that Parry used this to show how radically two people can view the same character, and how that dichotomy can completely change how different people understand the same story. And yet, each character who appeared in this book felt very true to their character in their original work, and often quoted either themselves or their author, which was a delightful inclusion. So while interpretation definitely matters, it can’t change the core of the character as written by the author. Also, the fact that certain characters were summoned by readers who only ever had this one moment of connection to and clarity regarding a fictional character was a fun addition, because that means that everyone is capable of magically connecting to a novel. It’s a lovely thought that I firmly believe is representative of the truth about reading; it really is for everyone, and there’s no magic quite like it. “…you know when you read a book, sometimes, and you suddenly realize that you’ve been missing something your whole life, and you weren’t even aware, and all at once you’ve found it and are just a little bit more whole?”This is one of the first books I’ve ever read that was set in New Zealand and written by an author native to the area, which added a fun element that I didn’t know I’d be getting from this book. The settings, both of the Wellington of reality and the fictional Street that hides within it, were very atmospheric. The Dickensian Street was incredibly easy to visualize, and I can see why so many fictional refugees made their way to said Street and settled there. I also loved how these characters built their own motley family, and how tightly knit they were. “This street is complicated, isn’t it?”“Thousands of years of the written word, filtered through countless readerships… How can it not be?”Both Parry’s original characters and those she pulled from other works of fiction were delightful and uniquely their own. However, I have to confess that it took me a while to connect to Rob, Charley’s brother and our only first person perspective character. He seemed so irrationally close-minded and judgmental when it came to Charley and what he could do that I couldn’t bring myself to like him. However, he truly grew as the story progressed and as Parry showed us more and more the reasoning behind his mentality. While he still wasn’t my favorite by the end of the book, I did appreciate and respect him. But Charley takes the cake. He is one of the most precious characters I’ve come across in adult fiction, and I just wanted to both protect and delight in him.“Truth, at least complete truth, isn’t held in words. But there can be no truth at all without them. It lies behind them and lurks around them and shines through them, in glimpses of metaphor, and connotation, and story.”The Unlikely Escape of Uriah Heep is such a fun ode to books. Books about books always spark joy in me, and this particular book fanned that spark into a cheery and inviting fire. Stories matter, and Parry’s debut celebrates that fact. If you’re a lover of the written word and believe that there’s nothing better than getting lost in a good book, this book is so definitely for you.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,90,1,"Aug 05, 2019","Aug 18, 2019","Aug 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42779072-the-unlikely-escape-of-uriah-heep

I tried so hard. But I just ended up actively disliking it, which makes me sad.Wendig bit off something really vastI really wanted to like this book. I tried so hard. But I just ended up actively disliking it, which makes me sad.Wendig bit off something really vast with this novel, and he actually executed it very well. It’s been billed as an epic saga, and that’s a fair description. Wanderers is as large in scope as the novel it is most commonly compared to, Stephen King’s The Stand, and mirrors the novel in other ways, specifically in its inclusion of an apocalyptic epidemic, its varied cast of characters, and its cross country journey on foot. However, Wanderers was far more hopeless, to the point of nihilism. The elements that should have been hopeful ended up being among the darkest and most disturbing. Don’t get me wrong; there were moments of loveliness. But overall it ended up leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth. I also deeply hated the ending, and that further impacted my view of the book.“I love you in the future tense: I will love you, tomorrow and the day after and the day after that until there are no more days left for us.”I’m aggressively optimistic, so I have a very hard time dealing with bleakness, especially when hope is portrayed almost as a weakness. The Stand sounds like a book that would bother me, but there was a good bit of hope to be found there, and you could tell it was written from a deistic worldview. Wanderers was its opposite in that respect. Believers in God were often portrayed as naive, and faith was something to be overcome in most cases. I know realistically that many people, if faced with the types of situations in which these characters found themselves, would question God and possibly lose their faith. But there was just something about how that loss was handled in this novel that seemed as though such crises and the denial of God were something to be praised instead of pitied. It just really bothered me.“That is how science and medicine are practiced best, though—we are best when we admit our ignorance up front, and then attempt to fill the darkness of not-knowing with the light of information and knowledge.”Wanderers was also far more political that I was prepared for, and the politics present in the novel were thinly veiled versions of America’s current political climate. When asked about my political views, I bill myself as moderately conservative, though I try to just steer clear of politics as much as possible. Mostly, I just see myself as an egalitarian, and believe all people should be treated with dignity. That’s how Jesus lived His life, and it’s how I try my best to live mine. In this novel, almost everyone with a conservative view point is not only portrayed as wrong and small-minded, but as downright evil. It’s a portrayal that I can understand, as there are indeed many people like this in the world and our nation in particular, but I strongly disagreed with the implications that all political conservatives are evil, and that the vast majority of religious individuals only have faith because said faith has never been tested, and that it will break at the first sign of hardship.“You didn’t change anyone’s mind about politics by hammering away at them—all that did was drive the nail deeper into the wall of their own certainty.”The plot of the book was interesting, and I found it compelling enough to continue reading even though I disliked the implied worldview. Wendig did a great job of slowly building on the plot, and including multiple twists along the way. I’m a fan of slow burns, and Wanderers definitely qualifies. While I didn’t love the book, it never felt like it dragged, which is quite an accomplishment for an 800 page book. The portrayal of a world under siege by a disease, and the resulting breakdown in societal infrastruction, was very believable. I also thought that Wendig did a great job compiling his cast, and having such varied interests and viewpoints and personality types. “Hell, nobody's okay. Maybe we never were, and we damn sure aren't now. But we're here. Until we're not. And that's all I find it fair to ask for.”While I really respect what Wendig crafted in and with Wanderers, it just didn’t work for me. Our worldviews are too different. Nihilism is anathema to me, and I would never had read this book had I known it would leave me feeling so hopeless. However, I can definitely see why this book would appeal to so many, and I foresee it being very popular. I would recommend this book to fans of apocalyptic fiction like The Stand and Station Eleven (though I far prefer those two to this book), but know yourself; if you have a difficult time with nihilism, you might need to skip this one.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Jul 27, 2019","Aug 06, 2019","Jul 27, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/32603079-wanderers

I don’t tend to read all that much in the contemporary or romance genres, but she’s my exception. I’ve been reading my way through her back catalogue since I was fifteen or so, and for the past ten years have been reading her new releases as soon as I can get my hands on them. Now, she’s one of the few authors who is an insta-buy for me. While Under Currents didn’t blow me away, it was another strong offering that demonstrated to me once again that Nora seems incapable of producing a dud. She’s just awesome.“The couldn’t take who we are away from us. We’re who we are despite them.”Over the past few years, Nora’s writing has undergone a shift that I both respect and regret. She’s always been the source of my ultimate comfort reads, but that light easiness has fallen by the wayside. And I respect her so much for it. Nora’s stories have shifted from fairly straightforward romances to books that, while still romantic with an almost guaranteed happy ending, deal with some pretty hard topics. Recently, these topics have included mass shootings and how survivors wrestle with the aftermath decades later, kidnapping and sex-slavery and how families adjust to having a broken family member returned, and how the children of serial killers have to deal with the horrors wrought by said parents and the fear they feel that their blood might be tainted with violence. And that’s just to name a few. In Under Currents, Nora addresses domestic violence and abuse in various settings, from suburbia to squalor to affluence. We see how abuse impacts children from their first contact with it and through their adulthood. We see how easily hidden the worst abuse can be, and how it can pervade even the seemingly nicest and safest neighborhoods. We also see how abuse can become a cycle for some, but that others break free of it and often spend their lives helping pull others from the wreckage.“You showed me what was real. Real family, real parents, even real husband and wife. Without that, without you… Abuse is a cycle. Without you, I might have become like him.”Mixed into and rising above this trauma were characters who were Nora’s patented blend of funny, engaging, hardworking, and empathetic. These were people who would come together to help each other or outsiders at a moment’s notice. They are incredibly self motivated, and most of them are self-employed entrepreneurs on a small scale. The setting is lovely, the community charming, and the writing is beautifully descriptive and easy to envision. As always, romance and family are the key binding agents of the story Nora weaves. The only thing that didn’t ring true for me was the mystery element. It was glaringly obvious who the secondary and tertiary villains would be, so much so that the main characters should have guessed it immediately. Their ignorance was almost jarringly unbelievable.“Maybe there were undercurrents and always would be, but they’d never drag him down again.”I love that Nora took a chance and started incorporating issues close to her heart into her fiction. It was a huge risk to take, especially with such a large fanbase. Thankfully it’s a very loyal fanbase, and they/we seem happy to follow her anywhere. I applaud her for stepping outside the box and producing meatier works like Under Currents.

Especially when those friends know your reading life incredibly well and understand your love for music, both in literature and reality. And while I didn’t fall as head-over-heels for the story as they did, they were right; I very much enjoyed it. The Bard’s Blade is a compelling introduction to a world that’s lovely at first glance but is teeming with dark forces and hypocritical religion and unforeseen magic below its surface.“Never allow the wickedness of others to dictate who you are.”There two main protagonists in Anderson’s story: Lem, an immensely talented and renowned musician who finds himself fleeing his homeland to protect everyone he loves; and Mariyah, the daughter of a wine maker who loves Lem too much keep herself from following him. The secondary character with the biggest role is Shemi, Lem’s elderly uncle who would do anything to protect his nephew and the woman Lem loves. But the world is far larger than either Lem or Mariyah could have guessed, and finding each other begins to seem wildly improbable. Both of these characters find themselves in crazy situations where they are no longer in control of their own fate. All they can do is keep moving forward in the hope if being reunited someday. “Evil is not defeated by good… Evil is defeated by the strength and conviction of those who refuse to break.”This was a compulsively readable book. I wanted to know what happened next, and and I wanted to know more about the strange new world Lem and Mariyah found themselves in. However, there was something about the prose and character development that struck me as overly simplistic, which resulted in my caring about the characters on a cerebral level because I wanted to see how the plot lines tied together, not because Lem and Mariyah felt tangible to me and evoked much of an emotional response. I admit that such opinions are incredibly subjective, and didn’t prove to be the case at all for Petrik, Haïfa, and Eon when they read this book. It’s quite possible that my views of the writing were the result of picking up the right book at the wrong time, as I just recently finished reading The Secret History, which delivered stunning prose and characters so tangibly real that I expected them to show up drunk on my doorstep. That being said, there was a twist to the whole prophecy element of this book that I really appreciated, and I can’t wait to see where said twist leads.“The deadliest blow is not dealt with a cry of fury but with a smile and a song.”I love the worlds Anderson created in The Bard’s Blade. And yes, I mean worlds, because Lem and Mariyah’s home, Vylari, is magically separated from the world they find themselves in, Lamoria. The Kylorian faith, and the Arch Bishop and the Hedran that enforced its laws, reminded me very much of Judaism in the time of Jesus. (Hedran? Sanhedrin?) Because of this, I was greatly reminded of multiple Christian fantasy series I’ve read in the past, though Anderson took the tale somewhere completely different in the end. He did a great job of showing religious zeal taken too far, demonstrating the hypocrisy and fear that become prevalent when a belief system becomes the law of the land. I’m very interested to learn more about the religion and magic of Lamoria in the upcoming sequel, A Chorus of Fire. I also loved the musical element of the story; my only complaint is that it didn’t play a bigger role or enjoy as much time in the spotlight as I would have liked. “Evil absent repentance is beyond redemption.”The Bard’s Blade is a strong first installment into what I hope will be a captivating trilogy. Anderson did a great job with his world building, and I’m excited to see what kind of character development Lem and Mariyah undergo in the next installment. I also really appreciate how clean this book was; I could give this to my fourteen-year-old nephew with a clear conscience. That’s not to say there was no tension but, like Brandon Sanderson and Rachel Aaron, Anderson understands how to convey tension without dwelling on gory details or throwing in a ton of profanity. If you’re looking for a fantasy that is clean and romantic and fairly bright and addictively readable, pick up The Bard’s Blade.

It doesn’t erase it.” I wasn’t immediately charmed by Eleanor Oliphant, but she completely won me over. Eleanor is a woman on her own, and she does just fine living her life alone, thank you very much. She comes across as awkward and prickly, but beneath the surface she longs for relationships more than she’ll let herself believe. But it’s hard to let anyone in when, beneath your hard exterior, you’re battling against a plethora of issues, from childhood trauma to suppressed grief to raging pain. As long as she adheres to her rigid schedule and keeps everyone at arms length, she can ignore the emotions churning within her. And if she keeps herself mildly drunk over the weekends, she can pretend that she’s completely fine. One day, she spies the man of her dreams and embarks on a mission to make herself into the kind of woman he notices. Along the way, Eleanor meets people and forms friendships that she didn’t realize she desperately needed. As she changes, old wounds are ripped open. Is a new outlook on life worth the pain it brings?“Although it’s good to try new things and to keep an open mind, it’s also extremely important to stay true to who you really are.”This is a book I had come across in the past, but didn’t strike me as the type of book that could maintain my interest. But after having read and loved A Man Called Ove, I decided to give it a try since I’ve seen it recommended to fans of Ove’s story. That was a very prudent recommendation, and I very much enjoyed my time with Eleanor. Like Ove, her story mingles laughter and heartache in a way that is very endearing. I didn’t enjoy Eleanor quite as much as I did Ove, because there were a few scenes that felt contrived and unnecessarily awkward for the sake of eliciting a laugh instead of being central to the plot. Besides that, I found Honeyman’s debut novel compelling and engaging. There was an air of mystery to the story that I very much enjoyed, and I deeply empathized with Eleanor as she faced her past, feeling both her pain and relief as things finally came to light. The character of Mummy is one of the most disturbing I’ve come across outside of the horror genre, and made me intensely thankful for my own mother. “I simply didn't know how to make things better. I could not solve the puzzle of me.”Eleanor Oliphant is not completely fine, but she’s getting there. Honeyman did a wonderful job on her characterization of Eleanor, as well as with the supporting cast. Eleanor has a strong and unique voice that made her a pleasure to read, and very sympathetic as her life took her directions she hadn’t anticipated. I also think that Honeyman did a magnificent job of demonstrating how the mind deals with trauma, and how that varies from person to person. Eleanor’s story is also a brilliant reminder that everyone needs connections with other people, no matter how convinced they are that they’re fine alone. Our relationships are what keep us human; without them we are automatons, merely going about our routines instead of truly living.“These days, loneliness is the new cancer–-a shameful, embarrassing thing, brought upon yourself in some obscure way. A fearful, incurable thing, so horrifying that you dare not mention it; other people don’t want to hear the word spoken aloud for fear that they might too be afflicted, or that it might tempt fate into visiting a similar horror upon them.”If you’re a fan of contemporary fiction, especially books like A Man Called Ove that somehow manage to be funny and heartbreaking on the same page, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine is a book that you should pick up, if you haven’t already done so. It’s sad and sweet and funny, and Eleanor’s journey will make the world seem just a little bit brighter.“In the end, what matters is this: I survived.”You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jul 23, 2019","Jul 27, 2019","Jul 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31434883-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine

Judging from the cover and synI remember when A Man Called Ove first took the book world by storm as a book in translation that everyone should read. Judging from the cover and synopsis, it didn’t at all seem like it would interest me. I’m not normally a lover of contemporary slice-of-life fiction. Give me dragons and magical libraries and quests to save the world from imminent doom any day of the week. As with everything, there have been notable exceptions, but A Man Called Ove didn’t strike me as a contender for that role. I can’t believe how wrong I was. This is a book that I loved so fervently that I honestly don’t have much to say about it. My words won’t be able to do it justice.“Men are what they are because of what they do. Not what they say.” Ove is the very definition of a curmudgeon. He’s been forced into an early retirement and now he just wants to be left alone to die. But life keeps getting in the way as new neighbors move in next door and old neighbors suddenly become a larger presence in the area. It seems like the neighborhood just can’t function without him. He begrudgingly starts addressing the problems plaguing those around him, engaging with life for the first time in a long time. Against his will and better judgement, he finds himself becoming part of a motley family.“You only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away.”I loved how slowly Backman fed us Ove’s backstory. We weren’t immediately told everything we needed to know about him, and it was delightful to gain insight into his character and understanding of his worldview as such a meandering pace. I also was completely blown away by Backman’s characterization across the cast of neighbors. Each and every included character was vibrant and tangibly real, and were incredibly varied from one another. Ove’s internal monologue was likewise brilliant, and while I know there’s already a foreign film incarnation in existence and an American version in the works, I just don’t see how a screen interpretation could ever work as well as the novel, because that internal monologue is so important to Ove’s character. I’ll be interested to compare the story across the two disparate mediums. Even more, I can't wait to get my hands on every single Fredrik Backman book that has been translated into English. I think I found a new author to add to my favorites shelf.“We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.” A Man Called Ove is one of the most charming, delightful, funny, poignant books I’ve every read. I laughed more times than I can count, but that laughter almost always had to find its way around the lump in my throat, because tears threatened to hit the pages almost as often. This book moved me more than I can express. I could barely read the last chapter through the haze of unshed tears, which finally spilled as I read the final words.

The Dry is a lauded debut with a respectably high ratingIf I were asked to describe this book in one word, I would reply with a single syllable: meh. The Dry is a lauded debut with a respectably high rating, but I was obviously missing something. It wasn’t a bad book, I just couldn’t quite manage to connect. Two simultaneous mysteries plague Aaron Fawk’s tiny hometown when he returns after twenty years, one a triple murder/suicide that is the sole reason he has chosen to return to the town, and the other a more than twenty year old questionable death that was the reason he was driven out of the town in the first place. The narrative jumps back and forth between timelines and Fawk tries to find answers regarding the death of his friend and his family, as well as the death of another friend decades in the past. Both plot lines presented intriguing mysteries that weren’t easily solved, and both were wrapped up neatly by the book’s final pages. Fawk is a really good guy who has had a rough life, mostly because of the small-minded townspeople of Kiewarra who drove him and his father from their family home. These same people give Fawk hell when he returns, hoping to understand what happened to his friend Luke and why that drove him to kill his wife and child before turning the gun on himself. But the deeper Fawk digs, the more old wounds come to the surface, and the less sure he is that Luke’s death is as cut and dried as it first appeared. Even as the town that hates him tries to drive him away for a second time, Fawk refuses to give up his off-the-books investigation until he has answers. And if those answers also lead to more information about Ellie’s death twenty years ago, so much the better.I love reading about places that I long to visit. Australia is among those places. But if that visit involved a stay in Kiewarra, I believe I would rather pass. Very rarely have I encountered a setting I hated more, which I know was part of the point. Kiewarra is an agricultural community in the midst of one of the worst droughts on record, so obviously tensions are high. And those tensions are ratcheted up even higher by the apparent murder/suicide of a family of their own. If one farmer lost it and took out almost his entire family to escape the drought, will the same idea worm its way into the minds of others? This was a well written debut, with a compelling cast of characters, a three-dimensional setting, and mysteries that kept you guessing but whose answers made complete sense with the clues sprinkled throughout the text. I felt that the pace was a bit plodding, but I recognize the allure of a slow burning suspense such as Harper delivered. While I respect it and appreciate it for what it is, it’s a book that I feel myself already forgetting. I don’t know why it didn’t work for me, but I’m far from the norm. The Dry is popular for a reason; don’t let my experience in any way hinder your own.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jun 17, 2019","Jul 12, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27824826-the-dry

I often have a difficult time connecting to bookThere’s something about the way Lewis strings together his words that has always struck a cord in me. I often have a difficult time connecting to books concerning theology and apologetics, though there is within me a thirst for them. This is never the case with Lewis. The Great Divorce isn’t my favorite of his works, but it still resonates with me in a way that few works from other authors have ever been able to replicate.I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region in Hell: and earth, if put second to Heaven, to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.The Great Divorce is Lewis’s imagining of a theoretical Hell that allows day visits to the other side. Those who embark on the journey are invited to stay, though most of them end up returning to the bus, eager to head back “home.” The grey town they generally inhabit may be disappointingly sallow and tiresome and boring, but at least they can maintain a semblance of control there. Not so in Heaven. There, the residents of the netherworld find themselves incorporeal ghosts, without the strength to move even an acorn or a feather. The grass hurts their feet, and the bright bodies of the residents there offends their weakened eyesight. These heavenly residents try their hardest to awaken these close-minded visitors and help them to see how much they’ve been missing by remaining in the shadowlands. While many choose to close their ears and return to what they know, the few who choose to stay and acknowledge their faults are radically changed.“There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, ""Thy will be done,"" and those to whom God says, in the end, ""Thy will be done."" All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened.”I find Lewis’s theory that hell is escapable but that its residents often choose to stay incredibly interesting. I don’t know exactly how the afterlife works. I believe everything the Bible says about it, but there is a lot left to theorize. While I’m not sold on the idea that people can change their minds after death, I think that’s less because God won’t allow it and more because by that time people are too set in their ways to truly desire change, even if it would decrease their suffering. I believe that God is a giver of not only second chances, but hundredth and thousandth chances, so who knows? The reason that this book is 4 stars for me instead of 5 is twofold: first, I think that Lewis has said almost everything in this book in his other works, and that he did it better; second, the dreamlike quality of the narrative made it difficult to latch onto some of the very important topics covered.“There is but one good; that is God. Everything else is good when it looks to Him and bad when it turns from Him.” Any work by Lewis that I read is destined to be heavily highlighted and annotated, so much so that it was almost impossible to narrow down quotations to share. But whatever your theological beliefs, Lewis delivers a lot of fodder for deep thought and interesting discussion in The Great Divorce. It’s a short, dreamlike little book that raises a lot of questions about morality and the inner workings of mankind’s individual hearts and collective conscience. If you’re interested in philosophy and Christian theology, and aren’t opposed to plot and fantasy playing roles in such works, you should give this one a try....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jul 08, 2019","Jul 15, 2019","Jul 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17267.The_Great_Divorce

Even if you don’t share all or many or any of the author’s views on books at all, there’s something about the knowledge that this person took the time to write an entire book for the soul purpose of expressing their fervent love for the medium that produces instant camaraderie between writer and reader.“I have never been able to resist a book about books.”Anne Fadiman is overly loquacious and verbose in her writing, but I think that’s easily forgivable when someone is writing about their greatest passion. Fadiman is a huge believer in book collecting, with a library of thousands of volumes crowding her and her husband and children into tighter quarters. I relate to that need to collect on an almost spiritual level, and would happily wear rags and eat nothing but cereal and sandwiches if I lived alone, so that I could buy books with every spare dollar. Thankfully, I have a husband who keeps this desire in check, encouraging my love of reading but reminding me that space is limited and bills must be paid. I’m glad I have someone who understands my desire for more books but helps me find a balance. But Fadiman is married to a man who shares her deep and abiding love for the written word, so her collection makes mine (of approximately 2,700 volumes) seem paltry in comparison. “Other people’s walls looked naked to me. Ours weren’t flat white backdrops for pictures. They were works of art themselves, floor-to-ceiling mosaics whose vividly pigmented tiles were all tall skinny rectangles, pleasant to the touch and even, if one liked the dusty fragrance of old paper, to the sniff.”Fadiman writes not only of her love for reading and collecting, but of the vocabulary that reading has given her, and the compulsion to edit everything she reads right down to restaurant menus and instruction manuals (I am so guilty of this), and her propensity for annotating her books with gleeful abandon. The merits of reading aloud are proclaimed in great detail. She discusses the difficulty of marrying libraries and the fact that new books will never be as enticing to her as ratty, second-hand hardbacks. “I have come to view margins as a literary commons with grazing room for everyone—the more, the merrier.”In one essay, Fadiman explains the difference between courtly love and carnal love when it comes to books; those who value the physical book itself and could never annotate in the margins or dog-ear a page are courtly lovers of books, while those who love books only for the words they hold have no respect for the physical book and have no qualms about reading a book in the bath for breaking the spine so said book will lie flat are book lovers of the carnal variety. My friend Petrik is the epitome of a courtly book lover. Fadiman and her family are carnal book lovers who believe that the more battered a book is, the more personality it shows. I am somewhere in between the two. While I try to keep books in the best shape I can, I also have a soft spot for used book, and though my heart aches a bit when a book is returned in less than stellar condition, I will never stop lending them out. Though I do mark them with my fancy library embosser first, so no one ever “forgets” where the books came from. “When you read silently, only the writer performs. When you read aloud, the performance is collaborative. One partner provides the words, the other the rhythm.”This was a lovely little collection to nibble away at while reading other, denser, more serious books. If you love hearing about the reading lives of others, I believe you’ll really enjoy Fadiman’s essays on her passion for the written word.You can find this  and more at Novel Notions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 08, 2019","Jul 18, 2019","Jul 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46890.Ex_Libris
