Verdict: handled really well. Especially the diverging reactions of the parents, the mom who slowly, slowly changes her mind and the father who vehemently doesn’t. It felt realistic in a painful way. Also Theo’s sister swooping in with the extensive theological and historical research (she is me!) and the father just chucking it in the bin. Oof.Some of the rest was more meh; I didn’t get engrossed in the viral tiktok plot, but that’s me showing my age. Big points for how the ex-girlfriend who outed them was handled though.

The uncritical way this was presented, without any commentary on the subject, bothers me the way grand Disney stories aimed at kids usually do, guaranteeing a (patriarchal, heteronormative, often impossible) happy ever after without any of its downsides, like the high risk of destructive relationships, immature emotional intelligence and lack of healthy communication skills. I don’t mind a story now and then that goes for romance over reality, but when it’s the dominant cultural narrative to the extent that it is today, then the stories that present it uncritically, especially to young people, get an extra dose of skepticism from me. It seemed extra odd to do that here when a main part of the story is that the adult relationships are all in shambles.Anyway. 3.5 stars and I could round up when I’m thinking about the art and the uncle, or round down when thinking about the cliches and grand gestures.(It’s also wayyy more text heavy than some of the other comics/graphic novels I’ve read recently. That’s neither here nor there, nothing wrong with that, but there were a few times it felt like the authors didn’t trust the images to convey the meaning, and I like feeling that trust instead.)...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 09, 2024","Mar 12, 2024","Jan 15, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/123023430-lunar-new-year-love-story

It counters all my usual problems with cozy witchy books, and sometimes cozy fantasy in general, not to mention the fraught subject of fertility. It’s full of lines that devastating in their quietness and truth. It was strange, sharing the silence with a man who’d always fit into his life like an organ, and a man who’d wandered into their home like a leak or a bear—capable of causing invisible damage or very real, very visible problems. That was the messiness, wasn’t it? The consequence that came with magic as intimate as necromancy.There’s grief and loss too, and change, part of the messiness right along with love and hope.

Robin and Maud, respectively, were the most difficult parts of their own books Here is my theory from book 2: the Blyths suit me best in small doses. Robin and Maud, respectively, were the most difficult parts of their own books for me. They’re just so young, energetic, athletic, upstanding, so shiny, so beautiful, so aggressively… “normal,” for lack of a better word, when I prefer crankiness and weariness and a bit of tarnish on the bronze these days.Here, their presence in the ensemble was a much better balance. Enough without too much. And that clears the decks for Jack, deeply scarred, and Alan, deeply insolent, to take center stage. In book 2, they’re stalking around each other and scrapping like alley cats in the background, and that dynamic ratchets up a few notches here, to my endless pleasure.It’s the best of the trilogy, by a long shot. And/or it just hit every one of my preferences in a perfect way. The kinky power dynamics vs. real world politics. The class differences. The exquisite emotional development. (view spoiler)[The betrayal that is immediately understood and admired. (hide spoiler)] Crackling tension and careful tenderness.Complexity galore, KJ Charles style. At least for the romance—the fantasy still lagged a step behind the best KJC plotting. There were some WTF turns, but ultimately I really liked where it went, and Marske wrote to her strengths. For the second book I’ve read recently, it upends the idea of a magic system dependent on bloodlines. I thought the metaphors and parallels of imperialism came together a lot better here than in the first two books—or maybe my expectations, by now, were just more in line with what Marske delivers. Either way, it was excellent, I would read it straightaway again. Just given my tastes, I had the highest hopes for this book out of the three, but was still surprised and pleased at how well it delivered.A few stray notes:- The whole Roman storyline was utter catnip for me: concept, commentary, and execution. Best inclusion of an erotica-novel plot since Jonathan: And The Struggles of Virtue.- Actually, come to think of it, a lot of what earned the five stars for Nobleman’s Guide to Seducing a Scoundrel was the same kind of thing that earned high marks from me here.

The prose (and/or translation?) is more functional than beautiful on a sentence level, but on a plot level, with the overall character arcs, QJMX has some mad skill. Especially when she was writing as she went, chapter by chapter, serial style. (Says me, who can’t plot my way out of a paper bag.)Every time I thought we’d reached a point where it was going to drag, nope, there’s a twist, a plot development, a time skip. Never a dull moment, which is more than I can say for most 100-page books, much less any clocking in at this massive length.Of course it helps that I go nuts for complex court politics played out at this scale. And morally gray (to put it kindly) heroines.A few more thoughts in list form:- If you’re gonna do a romance where one (nearly both) of the protagonists is underage at the beginning, then a 20-year timespan to get to the happy ending, with a complete flip of power balance, is the right choice to make.- Hurrah! It does the thing I love where obtaining the throne is not the happy ending—it’s detrimental to the happy ending, a problem to be solved.- The way the stress ruins Qi Yan’s health is so much more relatable and weirdly gratifying than the superhero protagonists who sail through plots unscathed.- There’s an absolutely bonkers side plot where QY (view spoiler)[offs a lecherous prince by kidnapping the young man he’s been aggressively harassing, drugging the young man, covering him in a poison that interacts with the liquor in the prince’s system (he’s an alcoholic) and makes the prince drop dead at first kiss (hide spoiler)].

I’ve actually read it thrice, because I got the paperback via preorder, but then my friend Meg convinced me I could not miss the audio. She was 100% correct. And then I started the audio again over the long Thanksgiving weekend when a little comfort was needed.

While technically the latter might apply—Shannon was incredibly young when sucked into the whirlwind courtship and marriage with the evangelical celebrity Josh Harris—it’s still quite strange to see an independent, feminist, mentally-healthy young woman from a secular family undergo the transformation into perfectly submissive, conservative pastor’s wife that left her a shell of her former self.She still keeps many things private, as is her right, but it’s a great outsider-turned-insider-turned-outsider perspective on the beast that is charismatic reformed Calvinism, abuse and all.

The study of trauma in sexual and domestic life becomes legitimate only in a context that challenges the subordination of women and children. Advances in the field occur only when they are supported by a political movement powerful enough to legitimate an alliance between investigators and patients and to counteract the ordinary social processes of silencing and denial.In the absence of strong political movements for human rights, the active process of bearing witness inevitably gives way to the active process of forgetting.

I appreciate that Blake acknowledged the difficulty of walking that tightrope, and it is a rom-com—of course it’s gonna be an HEA.I think it’s just a strange choice to have the family AND the friend group (really, guys?!) pushing so hard to get her coupled up, even to the point of slut shaming, and then… proving them right. Going lighter on that pressure would have made more sense. What happened to the awesome, supportive friend group of book 1? What happened to the part where even all the side characters had fully developed arcs?I initially rated it four stars, but the longer I think about it, the more certain decisions bothered me. I don’t know! I didn’t dislike it, but it was a much rougher ride than book 1 or even book 2 for me. It was tougher to gloss over the flaws when it was pushing so hard for an HEA at the expense of its character arcs.

This got me, I admit it, the part where Lydia, untoward card sharp, has stacked a deck of cards for Will:By the time he set down the king of spades he was sitting up straight, his whole face alight with such a look as Paris of Troy must have worn when those three goddesses showed up to demand he judge one of them most beautiful.No man had ever looked at her that way. No man would likely ever do so again. But he made her insides feel like clockwork for a moment, ingenious subtle clockwork instead of fallible flesh, and it occurred to her she might stay in that moment forever, given the choice. She might bask wordless in such a transformative gaze for as many moments as remained to her life.No. Not transformative. This was who she was, quick and gleaming and intricate.

One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. Despite the different circumstances, there’s so Incredible memoir. One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. Despite the different circumstances, there’s so much to relate to on every page (and not just because she had the same Jimmy Eat World song  as a lifeline in the early aughts).It’s heartbreaking and eye-opening that her upbringing (Asian, middle-class, immigrant; raised in what she correctly calls the wreckage of America’s brutal proxy wars against communism) is almost a 1:1 overlap with what was going on behind the scenes for the majority of those I knew growing up (white, middle-class, evangelical; basically the inheritors of the “American dream”). All the punishment, dysfunction, shame, rejection, generational trauma, and often the outright abuse (sexual, physical, mental) that just got silenced and covered up. All the unseen kids and unseen suffering, when kids need literally the exact opposite to survive: love, acceptance, safety, trust, respect. A voice.I am a product of a place. I am one of many. All of us are victims of a dysfunctional community that was very good at throttling itself while murmuring, “Smile through your tears. Swallow your pain.”It is within this normalcy, this transformation of a unique misery into the utterly banal, that I finally feel empowered. Maybe I can change my programming after all. Because the more common the disease, the more survivors there must be. A whole damn neighborhood can’t go down together in its entirety, can it? There have to be people who escape the stranglehold.It’s so validating when the key things that help her heal are the same things I’ve discovered. Note: she does not break it down into 1-2-3 steps for healing; these are my own notes, a list I made when what worked for her has worked for me as well:- Self-regulation (calming your nervous system, creating an internal sense of safety)- Curiosity (instead of judging or shutting down emotions, befriend them and listen to them; learn who you are when no one else is around)- Compassion (every trigger has a purpose; learn to ask “what is this? What is this thing in my body right now? What are you trying to teach me?”)- Communication (complex trauma is fundamentally relational trauma—people who were supposed to be caring and trustworthy and safe were hurtful instead; practice healthy relationships)- Agency (you have power, you have choice, you have a voice)- Love (love, love, love, in abundance, for others, for yourself; the opposite of shame, blame, and fear is love)There’s no single magic fix; there’s a mix of what works for each person at various points in their lives. But there is healing, and hope, and I love her definition of both:So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: fullness. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection.

Reading them side by side: Mitchell’s version is what we expect spiritual texts to be; Le Guin’s is what spiritual texts should be. In the introduction, he says he played with the text, but there’s very little playfulness involved. Also he says he wants to exhort femininity, but the main way is just by swapping ‘she’ for ‘he’ at various points. (Where neither is necessary; note how Le Guin fails to need either.) Also, he’s very quick to denounce that wei wu wei could be passivity. Oh no! It’s like an athlete! Le Guin, in contrast, isn’t scared off by passivity (see also: Lathe of Heaven).His metaphor is an athlete “in the zone”; hers is a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers: “uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force.” Note the profound difference in those images.Incidentally, Le Guin comments on Mitchell’s translation, which I had forgotten and didn’t find again until her translation notes at the end of the book. It’s one of the versions that blur the language into dullness and vagueness, she says. “Lao Tzu is tough-minded. He is tender-minded. He is never, under any circumstances, squashy-minded. By confusing mysticism with imprecision, such versions betray the spirit of the book and its marvelously pungent, laconic, beautiful language.”Indeed....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 21, 2023","Feb 22, 2023","Mar 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/439655.Tao_Te_Ching

Just gonna dump a bunch of my highlighted quotes here, snacks for thought: “Because mythologies and sciences alike aspire to be true, they are perpetually under revision,” Bringhurst explains. “Both lapse into dogma when this revision stops.” - - -Monotheism is trapped by its attachment to a mythic monologue. Sky gods think sunshine, abstraction, and ascension are the answer to everything. But the problem with the sun is that if it isn’t tempered by darkness and rain and decay, it tends to create deserts instead of biodiverse ecosystems.- - -How can honoring our “both-ness” change courtship into a terrain that is more egalitarian, playful, and reciprocal than the patriarchal modes of romance that seem to invite sexual violence and domination? - - -Bodies, liquid in a flesh silhouette, are tides of lunacy, constantly shifting their internal shorelines. To be lunar means to change—to be full and ripe one night, and tired and reclusive another.- - -Hundreds of years of simplistic binaries have led us to believe that the hearth fire is tended by the feminine, while the hunt or external world is governed by the masculine. The man is welcomed back into the home, fed, and cared for, but he is never the lap of plenty. He rules the home. But he is not allowed to “be” the home. - - -Myths that stay the same don’t survive.- - -As philosopher Isabelle Stenger urges, we must somehow make decisions in the presence of those who will bear their consequences.- - -Dionysus was also popularly called Liber. In fact, this version of the vegetal god’s name is the root of our words for freedom and liberation and deliverance. Why, then, do we only think of Dionysus as a god of drunken foolishness? His worshippers very clearly saw him as a god of revolution and independence. Mythically, his arrivals signaled the inversion of social norms and the blooming of unfettered, uncivilized celebration, often conducted by a society’s underdogs. This behavior isn’t just fermented ecstasy. This is spontaneous, unruly revolt.- - -Climate collapse will not be solved by techno-narcissism. Patriarchy will not be cured with shame and guilt. Racism cannot be cut out of our brains with a sword. - - -My favorite aspect of their relationship is that in many stories and images—a wonderful example being the frieze from the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii—Ariadne is depicted as occupying the sovereign throne while Dionysus sits in her lap. Their relationship is flipped, dynamic, unfettered by gendered stereotypes. There is no dominating “king.” - - -What does it mean to approach the beloved knowing that they have been wronged? What does it look like to tenderly heal that wounding and that power imbalance? My guess is the answer is more luscious and beautiful and sexy than we can even imagine. Healing doesn’t have to be hard work. It can be romantic. It can be a bacchanal.- - -The body and the psyche’s place is distinctly opposed to the culture’s suicidal sprinting. - - -Real healing cannot be rushed. If we don’t emerge slowly from the shallows, we won’t give our lungs time to adjust to the intoxicating chill of fresh air. If we don’t give our wings time to dry, we will never be able to fly. Stepping out of dominant cultural narratives involves a process of grieving, tending to our losses, and transforming our dreams. This doesn’t happen in an hour. And it can’t be “gamed.” - - -But let us halt the story, because stories are often defense mechanisms used to distract from pain. Trauma can look like heroism. It can look like strength. Sound like beautiful music. It can be handsome and well behaved. What beautiful Tristan really represents is pain. - - -So much of the current rhetoric about healing is wedded to progress and to narrative. But the body is not a story. It is porous and complicated and changeable. It needs to dance and swim. It needs to lie on the ground for days, re-regulating its nervous system to the seasonal heartbeat of the soil. The concept of “healing” has become the time-sensitive demand of a culture bent on progressing, and unwittingly taken up by wellness and new age spiritual communities. They say we must be “integrated” and whole again; we must achieve functionality so that we can keep the narrative moving. But a body doesn’t need to move through healing. It just needs to move. And then it needs to be still. It needs to feel safe. - - -It is ironic that Joseph Campbell’s favorite hero, Tristan, is so desperate to escape the very thing Campbell wanted to enshrine him inside: the hero’s journey. - - -We have to admit that our world is not a linear romp into civilized eloquence, with cardboard cut-out temptresses, riddling dragons, and singular heroes. It is a polytemporal explosion of contingencies and sorrows and contamination....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 07, 2022","Dec 13, 2022","Dec 31, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60138088-the-flowering-wand

Second book delivers the very necessary half of the whole. I adored it, and now I adore this one on re-read. Everything that just felt a slight step off pace the first time was solved with a deeper, closer read, and the addition of Luke’s story. The pair of books together land firmly in the top of my KJC rankings, five stars and then some.- - -Original :Wavering on the fifth star, and it’s only because I am so spoiled for choice with KJC, and have books (plural!) by her that have touched my soul, and this one didn’t quite reach the upper tier of my rankings. I’ll be re-reading when book 2 comes out, and I’ll reassess then. But. But! What I loved, what did touch my soul, is the Marsh. The setting, Romney Marsh, is basically a character in its own right, and it’s KJC at her brilliantest with the lush sense of place. Ever since she announced that was going to be the setting, I have been eagerly anticipating it, and every bit of it was what I hoped for and then some. The language, the natural history, the way it shapes the characters, I soaked it up. For example: (view spoiler)[Joss finally calling Gareth ‘Marshman’ was the more emotional scene for me, not the exchange of rings at the end. In fact, that may be one of the few things I bounced slightly off of: she hit more of the traditional regency romance beats, as one would for their first major trad-pub book (yay for that!), whereas my all-time faves are when she subverts more of those beats. (Think Kim and Will desperately trying to free themselves from an earldom, etc.) (hide spoiler)]So yes. Thoughts! I have them! And feelings. Will see which wins out after book 2.

And yet…is it Sade who speaks through his canon’s most libertine characters, or is he an ironist an order of magnitude more accomplished than Swift? I recommend a brief familiarity with his biography and political beliefs, and probably reading his Philosophy in the Bedroom, before reading Juliette. When a reader falls in stride with Sade, and any prudish shock wears off, it becomes easier to discern what’s true to his idealistic vision of humanity, what’s buffoonery, and what are prescient satirical riffs and exposés of the cultural idiosyncrasies he endured in eighteenth-century France. Otherwise Sade can appear to be a mass of contradictions. He respects the state and the institution of democracy yet rejects law. His characters expound on their superiority over other living things yet he writes brilliantly on the equality of animals and humans. And so on.Agreed. Read Philosophy in the Bedroom first, acquaint yourself with Sade the philosopher instead of Sade the grotesque distortion, and proceed accordingly. The one thing I’d argue is that instead of only appearing to be a mass of contradictions, he is a mass of contradictions, intentionally, provocatively, profoundly. As I said before, I get the feeling he very pointedly and gleefully contradicts himself, over and over, just to get readers to think. Don’t take it all as read, even what he’s saying.

You can hardly pick up any book on sexuality + Christianity and not have the story of Sodom immediately and thoroughly debunked. In fact, it’s been debunked so thoroughly and frequently that most recent books don’t even bother with much more than an eyeroll. Y’all know this one already. Let’s move along. That wasn’t completely satisfying my curiosity though. Yes, but how did the biblical story of Sodom come to mean the condemnation of “sodomy,” so much that the word was coined from it? Even the Christian bible debunks it thoroughly! More than a dozen verses, old testament and new—every mention of Sodom, in fact—state explicitly what the sin of Sodom was: hostility to strangers, oppression of the poor, arrogance, greed, idolatry. (Amos 4:11; Isaiah 1:9-10 & 16-17; Lamentations 4:3-6; Ezekiel 16:48-50; Zephaniah 2:8-10; Deuteronomy 29:22-28 & 32:32-33; Matthew 10:12-13; Luke 10:10-12; Jude 1:7; also Ecclesiasticus/Sirach 16:8 and Wisdom 19:13-14 if you wanna go apocrypha.) There’s even a bonus story in Judges 19:14-29 that recycles both the narrative and the moral of the story point for point—and with a much worse outcome—yet there’s no preoccupation with a “sin of the Benjamites,” nor did anybody adopt penal statutes against “Benjamy.”So what tf happened? How did the “sin of Sodom” come to mean a sexual act, or in the greatest distortion, a condemnation of same-sex love? How has the story been misread so systematically for centuries?Turns out: shameless fanfiction. Theological madlibs. Textual abuse. A centuries-long game of telephone with disastrous consequences.“Sodomy” gets coined in the 11th century by theologian Peter Damien, and thanks to faulty exegesis, scribal error, hypocrisy, and prejudice, the complicated and disturbing story of Sodom eventually collapses down to the punishment of a single (unscriptural) sin.It’s a fascinating and troubling history, and Mark D. Jordan does it justice. He goes a step further, thoroughly showing the actual silence of scripture when it comes to “sodomy,” much less condemnation of same-sex relationships. As he says, “homosexuality” is no more addressed by medieval theology than phlogiston, Newton’s inertia, or quarks. And yet here we are, with modern laws still being enacted and upheld on this nonexistent foundation.It’s a dilemma that’s played out before, in fact: Christian doctrine upheld slavery, and was exposed as immoral. Same with the doctrine of just war and other medieval beliefs. We’re seeing that play out again in our lifetimes with LGBTQ rights.Ironically, the historical invention of “sodomy” involves what the story of Sodom was about: arrogance, oppression, hostility. If we want to take a moral from the story, we’d do best to condemn what it actually condemns....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 10, 2022","Feb 14, 2022","Nov 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/470340.The_Invention_of_Sodomy_in_Christian_Theology_Volume_1997_

We’re starting to see the books written during the pandemic where authors are writing what they WANT, not what they SHOULD. It happened here, it happened with Delilah Green—it’s a joy and it changes the shape of the story in ways I want to see more of.⠀2. Valentine with the slow realization he’s the villain of his own story is such a necessary twist, and one I hope we see more of, especially in historical fiction, especially with dukes.⠀3. The way Alexis Hall removes the obstacles he’s set up to the romance is a deft touch and perfect in a queer book that has to invent its own happy ending. Most if not all of them are in Valentine’s head, and doing away with them involves listening instead of making assumptions + rethinking what’s possible outside the chokehold of convention.⠀4. The JOY in this book. It’s one bananas gothic trope after another, and it’s riffing on the joy and power of stories, the way they save our lives. See again: pandemic fiction. ♥️⠀5. I wrote a post recently about what it feels like to find out there’s a word for what you are and that others like you exist, and Valentine—his chaotic distress, indignant grief, baffled anger, and disorienting joy—might be the most relatable portrayal I’ve read yet. (Well, except for all the parts where he’s going, but I AM A DUKE.)⠀“Nobody told me it was a possibility.” Valentine suddenly discovered he was quite aggrieved. “Why has this never been brought to my attention?”⠀So yes, that made the book very very special to me, with whole pages I wanted to tear out and curl up with like blankets.

Do they listen?- Are they interested in your needs, limits, and desires, and do they prioritize, respect, and support them?- Do they express their emotions in a healthy way, and allow you to express yours in a healthy way?- Do they take responsibility for themselves? - Do they have your best interests at heart?- Do they encourage you to get other perspectives and seek other sources of support? - Do you feel fulfilled and happy?- Do you feel any fear, tension, or a heavy, dreadful feeling that you wish you could avoid?- Are you confident you could change your boundaries, or end the relationship if you wanted? Would they take it well and respect your decision?- Does it feel good? Relationships can be challenging and can mean not getting your way about a lot of things, but it should always be something you want to be doing, not just something that you endure, or that you accept because you’re afraid of what will happen if you don’t, because that’s the only way your partner will love you, or because it’s what you’ve been told you should do.brb, wanna apply this to all romance novels, and romcoms, and basically life....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 15, 2021","Dec 19, 2021","Nov 21, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/46041576-the-dominance-playbook

Boswell isAs someone who reads the scholarly tomes, Mondimore does a great job of translating the scholarly tomes into a succinct and enjoyable read. Boswell is still my sentimental fav; Greenberg challenges some of Boswell’s historical claims, and Mondimore reconciles both. My favorite chapter is the one on Alfred Kinsey and Evelyn Hooker, who, respectively, as a biologist and a behavioral scientist, took one look at the data psychiatrists presented on homosexuality and said “WTF is this methodology?!” The entire basis for classifying homosexuality as mental illness was a botched combo of Degeneracy Theory, Freud out of context, and anecdotal evidence taken from inmates in asylums for the criminally insane. (!!!) Appalled, they each set about dismantling that argument, did so thoroughly and resoundingly, and helped change the course of history. The other thing I want to bop over people’s heads: Greek and Hebrew don’t have a word that we could translate as ‘homosexuality’—they had a one-sex model and categorized sexual acts completely differently—so any time you see that word (say, in scripture *cough cough*) it’s always a mistranslation. This was published in 1993, so it could stand to be updated, especially regarding the B and T in LGBT. If I was a publisher, I’d commission those updates and release a new edition, because it’s an otherwise handy resource, especially when there’s still so much misinformation and prejudice to correct. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 24, 2021","Sep 15, 2021","Nov 11, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1249752.A_Natural_History_of_Homosexuality

And I realized, I still hadn’t come up with words to talk about it yet, how the first two books of the series encapsulate 2020 for me in a specific and uncanny way, a century past the series’ historical setting, the same kinds of stresses and shifts going on in the world, and now the third installment does the same with 2021.⠀It IS the 2021 mood for me, in so many respects. Okay, but not okay. Out of the woods, but not yet. Boredom, but chaos. One day at a time. The ground not exactly steady under anyone’s feet.⠀But also the glimmer of sunlight a long way down the tunnel. The cracks and the fissures. The exhale. The shift. The amount of vulnerability and love packed in the “I’ve wondered where you were hiding the damage” scene is three books worth of payoff and it’s made me cry each time I’ve read it. I’ve never identified with Will more. And yet with all the serious stakes, the book sparkles like Phoebe walking into a room, radiating joy and goodwill.⠀I don’t know how KJ Charles does it. Much less how she did it during this year. She dug deep, and it shows, an emotional depth that I dare say surpasses even what she’s written before. Just Kim’s transformation alone is gorgeous. Several times I kept thinking, who are you, and what have you done with Lord Arthur Aloysius Kimberly de Brabazon Secretan? In the best way, because he’s still utterly Kim, the true Kim at the core.I do need to state one final thing: my undying devotion for a book that FINALLY makes the threat of an inherited title the worst possible outcome to be avoided at all costs. She takes the marriage of convenience trope (darling, we must commit ourselves prematurely to secure title, wealth, and societal approval) and does the inverse (Darling, we must rid ourselves of this blight at all costs because it will quite literally be the end of life and love as we know it and the only way we’ll be whole and healthy is to refuse to participate).⠀I keep thinking, this is what happens when you really queer history. Or, eh, queer the pulp fiction version of it anyway. You get to consider the inverse of things. Disrupt the idea, for one, that love = possession, or that there’s any scarcity in it. Explore the margins. Question the narrative. Rethink a few key assumptions. Step outside prescribed roles. See what else is possible when guided by tenderness and vulnerability, instead of propriety and power.⠀What other tropes—what other trajectories of history—what other scripts that we follow—could be turned upside down?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"Aug 12, 2021Jun 24, 2021","Oct 14, 2021Jun 26, 2021","Oct 14, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/52238002-subtle-blood

I saw someone call him the origiReading Blake, I always get the sense he’s working in a fever, trying to translate an ecstatic vision for us mortals. I saw someone call him the original troll—that too, the radical printmaker in the time when printmaking was a real threat to the established order. Blake harnessed its power, provoking the church and state with his unorthodox satire.My favorite work of his is probably easy to guess: A Marriage of Heaven and Hell.At the chaotic end of the 18th century, William Blake, radical, takes aim at Swedenborg, theologian, for his treatise on the afterlife. He scorns Swedenborg’s theology, claiming it full of “all the old falsehoods.” In fact, Blake takes offense at his lack of creativity as much as his stolid ideas: dividing heaven from hell, soul from body, angels from devils, sinners from saints.In Blake’s cosmology, there’s no division, just one whole. He flips the script, giving “the Devil” a voice that sounds awfully sensible. ‘Heaven’ is the staid authority, certainty, order; ‘Hell,’ therefore, according to Blake, is the necessary energy of humanity. Passion, chaos, creativity, emotion, desire. You can’t call one good and one evil, he contends, without an irrevocable loss. “Without contraries there is no progression.” In his fervent vision, we ARE the divine, soul and body together, good and evil together, culminating in his epiphany: “for every thing that lives is Holy.”At around 15 pages, this work somehow feels like a magnum opus. What Blake calls his “Proverbs of Hell” are frank and energetic: “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” “What is now proved was once only imagin’d.” His art fills the page, clotting the margins with childlike intensity. It’s provocative and irreverent, disconcerting and droll, ingenious and moving.To be fair, C.S. Lewis comes for Blake in turn, undoing his great marriage in The Great Divorce. But arguably, Blake has outlasted Swedenborg. Arguably, he’ll outlast Lewis too. Life has a way of overturning the certainties. And thus Blake resonates, at least with me, in a way his rivals don’t. The contradictions are necessary. We could do worse than to listen, embrace the energy and the passion, the chaos and the doubt....more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,"Sep 2020Jun 22, 2014","Sep 2020Jun 22, 2014","Sep 01, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20416325-the-marriage-of-heaven-and-hell

(And inefficient.)Of course, in 2020, Silas’s politics have taken on a new relevance. I hate to even say that, though—it was relevant three years ago, and 10 years ago, and 200 years ago, and will retain that continuity with both the past and the future. But the events of 1820 have a symmetry with the events of 2020, and while it’s disingenuous to claim that’s anything new, it’s why I found myself wanting—nay, needing?—to read this series again. The comfort of it. The discomfort of it. The agitation and progress and subversive belief that love can still win.If I’ve read a book four-plus times and it only gets more meaningful, I’d say that’s an endorsement. That also makes A Seditious Affair my most re-read KJ Charles—so far—if only because it had the head start. It’s forever special to me, and the reason I like my romances to be historically accurate.

When I read Slippery Creatures, I wanted to say, this is what it looks like when an author levels up. I refrained, but I’m not going to wait til book three to say it: this is what it looks like when an author levels up. The Will/Kim dynamic isn’t one I’ve seen her write before. Especially with Phoebe and Maisie taking such an integral part; especially given that it gets three books to play out. She takes her time in setting up the layers of trust and conflict, and it builds up as beautifully as anything could. I like books that build. I tend to use “slow burn” derogatorily because too often it’s stalling, and it’s not a good descriptor here either. But there’s a long, slow build over two books now and counting, all with satisfactory payoffs each step of the way, all with the fun, pulpy trappings of the genre, and it feels so deeply gratifying that I go speechless like Will, confounded and impressed. The plot hustles, the characters twist and develop, and yet what sticks out to me is how much talking there is. Scene after scene after long scene after chapter of Will and Kim talking, a whole book of Will and Kim talking, in a way that feels like what a romance should be. I know an author’s got me completely when the conversation is even better than the sex. And it’s really good sex.Oh yeah, and remember how Will was my favorite? Nope, Kim. Kim, Kim. Kim all the way. Although Phoebe nearly steals it, the secret heart of the book, lighting up rooms and sliding down banisters into brawls. Watching her and Maisie is like a book within a book, taking place under the boys’ oblivious noses. It’s a treat. The book ends on more a promise than a cliffhanger, with more good things to come. Just the blurb has me tingling because it’s gonna go where I hoped. (Kim. Kim’s family. Kim’s demons.) I’m not gonna toss off a blithe “can’t wait,” because I can, and it will be so very worth it. Although I swear, if KJ Charles levels up again, it might do me in.(Or, you know, this is just her average but it hits so many of my buttons I can’t tell the difference. Either way, pick it up.)...more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,"Aug 31, 2020Aug 26, 2020","Sep 02, 2020Aug 30, 2020","Jul 23, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52237997-the-sugared-game

It should really work for me— the woman who’s romance-averse; the guy who likes her for her mind— but even flipping the gender stereotype script isn’t enough, so once upon a time, I’d be left wondering why I just didn’t get it and didn’t want something like it. That list of books is loooong; hence what I dubbed the romance project a few years back, the determined effort to read until I worked out what did work for me. Now, hurrah, I know I’m not broken. It’s just liking a different flavor of ice cream. I can enjoy the story without wondering what it says about me, or wanting what it offers, or better yet, worrying about what’s normal and what’s not. It’s fun, and there’s some great banter, and I love what it does with both sports and anxiety, and if it’s your flavor of ice cream you’ll find it smoking hot. I was set to praise it too on the lack of possessiveness, but then Zaf did get all possessive and growly, which couldn’t be shown as a flaw because he has zero flaws. (This is one flaw with the book.) Le sigh. And I do get how that’s a popular flavor of ice cream, but I don’t care how many puppies and kittens you cuddle, growl “mine” at me and you’re out the door, buddy. So let’s say I knock off some points for that, but I’ll add some back for the narration, which was nice enough that I’d seek out Ione Butler so she can read me more books.In sum. I love the genre. I’m happy I can like books like this one without stressing over why I’m not hot and bothered. It’s just one template of very, very many for what love, sex, and relationships look like. And for those who read it and find themselves represented— rock on. P.S. Fair warning, the next thing I’m going to start pushing back on, after possessiveness, is the ingrained belief that you can’t care about [insert passion here, usually a job] unless you work around the clock and stress yourself sleepless to prove you are a Good Person. Even when that plot exists, like it does here, so people can show they care, I’m ready to get past that step and not even validate it as a thing in the first place.

Also, Venetia would totally be into the orgies. I’m just saying. But then of course the last two chapters arrive, and they’re so splendid that I couldn’t wish the book shorter after all: She looked at Damerel. “Well, my dear friend?” “Well, my dear delight?” he returned, a glint in his eyes.“Do you think you will make me unhappy?”“I don’t — but I will offer you no promises!”“No, pray don’t!” she said seriously. “As soon as one promises not to do something, it becomes the one thing above all others that one most wishes to do!” She turned her head towards her uncle again. “You mean to warn me that he may continue to have mistresses, and orgies, and — and so on, don’t you, sir?”“Particularly so on!” interpolated Damerel. “Well, how should I know all the shocking things you do? The thing is, uncle, that I don’t think I ever should know.”“You’d know about my orgies!” objected Damerel.“Yes, but I shouldn’t care about them, once in a while. After all, it would be quite unreasonable to wish you to change all your habits, and I can always retire to bed, can’t I?”“Oh, won’t you preside over them?” he said, much disappointed.“Yes, love, if you wish me to,” she replied, smiling at him. “Should I enjoy them?”He stretched out his hand, and when she laid her own in it, held it very tightly. “You shall have a splendid orgy, my dear delight, and you will enjoy it very much indeed!”...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 24, 2020","May 12, 2020","May 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10051392-venetia

So many ways this could have fulfilled its potential. So many questions where I go, “Wait, but… WHY?”The worldbuilding is a half-baked thing after the feast of Ada Palmer. It’s your standard-issue made-to-order near-future dystopia with no sense of history or larger context, or even logic within its own world. It’s like our world… but it’s not. Cool tech is just there to be cool or fill plot holes.* Elisha is all enlightened about BDSM and polyamory but doesn’t know what “giving head” is at 21 years old. His IQ (or experience?) changes, I can only presume, based on what a scene needs because there’s no consistent indication of what’s changed in this world. He doesn’t know what a plaintiff is— why? This actually has bearing on the story. Because he’s brainwashed? Because he’s undereducated? Because he’s dirt poor, even as he’s supposed to be exceptionally smart? Is he actually exceptionally dumb? How far in the future is this world? Is that word unheard of for the lowest classes because of generations of oppression— which is a stretch to erase the concept itself. Yet there’s still your standard bureaucracy in place and news radio and billboards on the highway and EDM and preppy clothes are the hot trends? How? Why? WTF?It doesn’t even discuss slavery in regards to slavery. In Maryland, of all places. (Why Maryland? Why Baltimore? To say Preakness a lot? How is the city so white?)** It mentions Rome once, but only to donate the word “nexus” to the concept of indentured servitude. What makes debtor’s prison the worse option? What are the laws in other states? How enforced are state lines? If this is all enacted at the state level, what keeps people from moving elsewhere? What happens at the federal level? What happens in other countries? Would there be a mass exodus, or would there be an influx to Maryland for those who want Dociline? (It is a drug, after all. Is there a black market? How do you not ask this in Baltimore?) If there’s perfect racial and gender equality— there’s no mention of race except for descriptions of (minor) characters; ditto gender, and sex is all very inclusive— then how did this society achieve unprecedented social progress yet remain complacent with persecuting extreme economic inequality? (view spoiler)[How is one group, funded in secret by one guy— employed by the “bad guys,” no less— the only form of opposition? How do they— Bishop Labs, or Alex himself— not even think to look for other potential victims like Elisha’s mother, if only to cover the scandal up? (hide spoiler)] The list goes on, and on and on. For a short story, or for fanfic, you could paint in broad strokes. For a 500-page novel, it begs for solid worldbuilding so the actions add up.I think that’s the thing; Szpara doesn’t have to have those answers. It could be fluffy fic or do one dynamic well. But either Szpara or the marketing team have positioned Docile to take these big issues seriously. Okay then. Capitalism. Slavery. Debt crisis. Class warfare. It NEEDS the context. There should be major waves rocking this world, and instead it’s a very self-centered story that wants Alex,*** the ‘trillionaire,’ to wake up to the fact there’s a larger world out there, but then defeats its own purpose by ignoring the world beyond his and Elisha’s small circle. And what is within that circle is often nonsensical.The potential is there. I wanted to see it unlocked. Characters to invest in, concepts to tackle, boundaries to push. Instead, it’s a pretty stock parable with predictable politics and a few sex scenes that forfeit most of their power because the characters are blank slates.More dialogue about exploitation, agency, consumerism, power— that’s always a good thing. But this book doesn’t push nearly as hard at the system as it thinks it does. Tiffany Reisz, C.S. Pacat, Ada Palmer;**** the examples are plenty of what can be done with sex, power, and politics. Tochi Onyebuchi or P. Djeli Clark for the battle cry a well-built dystopia can be. I hate to say it, because I wanted another smart, complex book to rock my worldview, but the real questions here are the ones the book ducks.- - -*Physical objects can materialize out of a glass “smart table” but you still need a doorman or laundromat to call a car or wash clothes? Why is the doorman a job, not a drone, if businesses can own Dociles? If smart phones are stuck to the roof of your mouth (!!), how does that not affect everything, not just the fact that (view spoiler)[Elisha accidentally calls Alex when he’s going to kill himself? (hide spoiler)]**I lived in Baltimore briefly; it’s unrecognizable.***I kept picturing Alex as Pete on Mad Men, so yeah, not great, Bob, but I’m sticking with it because not enough evidence to confirm or disprove.****I did the unwise thing of switching last night to my re-read of Too Like The Lightning, the scene at Ganymede’s party where Sniper gets introduced.

After years of possessive heroes, and jealous heroes, and lack of boundaries, and Happily Ever Afters, all the things that fit the modern romantic narrative, it’s a gift and a balm and a blessing. I’ve said it before, but Tiffany Reisz is so good at introducing characters you can’t help but love, even in the midst of an eight-plus book series when you already have loyalties elsewhere. She’s also so good at capturing how relationships ebb and flow over time. Some endure and evolve; others burn brief and bright. And each one grows the story (and its persons) into something it (they) couldn’t be otherwise. Instead of narrowing down myopically (see my list above), she opens the world up. I love it.

Yes, that’s the plot of an erotica novel. Yes, it’s glorious. What’s more is that Tiffany Reisz has some of the soundest theology I’ve heard.

Just like we’re awful and snobby and wrong in our own times. No historical revisionism, and still a happy ending. There’s great beauty within.Not far from the lodge there was a nasty little climb, and the road, always in bad condition, was edged with dog roses that scratched the paint. Blossom after blossom crept past them, draggled by the ungenial year: some had cankered, others would never unfold: here and there beauty triumphed, but desperately, flickering in a world of gloom. Maurice looked into one after another, and though he did not care for flowers the failure irritated him. Scarcely anything was perfect.

My pick so far is Betty Dodson, Sex for One, i.e. the book that proves time travel isn’t real, because if it was, Future Jamie would have zapped back to grade school to give Past Jamie that book. But now this book: it’s up there. Sure, there’s a heavy dose of the Brooklyn millennial speak, but instead of annoying, it’s fun and clever, and the opposite of condescending or trite. It’s the sex-help equivalent of the show You’re the Worst— containing all appearances of being the worst and annoying, but actually brilliant and the best. Or better yet, like Amy Rose is writing the Alexis Rose advice column, with all the generosity and unexpected insight therein. I want to add her to our chats, which may be more of an endorsement than liking the book she wrote. She’s refreshing and candid, and while your own mileage may vary, it did me good.The more of other people’s intimate and nuanced approaches to sexuality that you try to understand, accept, and welcome, the more of that generosity you can then pass on to the rest of the world with respect, bravery, and extraordinarily messed-up pillow hair.

It’s for those who have read Ada Palmer, who understand tongue-tied and giddy, too much to translate at once. Spoilers to follow, of course. This book took a month of my life, and maybe only four days of reading; I gulped half the book each time. In between, though, it took essays and histories, detours to frame the context, turning over old stones, the Rinascimento, the Enlightenment, the Greeks, the Roman Empire, Cicero, Dante, Montaigne, Sade. That isn’t required, of course. It was all self-inflicted. It was all worth it, too, a thousand percent. I fell on it like a feast. Someone, finally, finally, glutted with these ideas, is playing out the experiment, attempting afresh to find out where it leads. Not just the humanitarians like the Patriarch and the romantics like Jean-Jacques, but the underbelly, La Mettrie, Diderot, de Sade. The Enlightenment tried to remake society in Reason’s image: rational laws, rational religion; but the ones who really thought it through realized morality itself was just as artificial as the aristocracies and theocracies they were sweeping away.The first book was a stunner; this book topped it completely. In the first, I guessed at what Mycroft’s crimes meant—the horrors of war writ personal—and also at what Madame was up to. I was right on both counts, and still wrong, wrong, wrong, because the depth, breadth, and lengths to which Palmer plays out these ideas goes beyond what I could imagine. The world-building is immense, and yet the story is intimate. Keenly personal. It’s all the stories, universal in its specificity, the way they’ve played out through history, time and again, over and over. It’s the thought experiment of all time. Take three millennia of ideas, history and myth, fact and fiction, pile it all together, ignite the fuse. Petty conflicts, world wars; religion, philosophy; heroes, saints, witches, priests, censors, madmen, kings, whores, saviors, lovers, traitors, a Christ-child, two Christ-childs, their imperfect protectors, the idealistic, the corrupt, the laws, the empires, modern, ancient, future, everybody, everything, all at once. Palmer is a historian. She knows the tipping points, the mass complexity. Only a historian could write this book, someone who spends their days plucking at the threads and asking ‘what if?’ and ‘why this?’ and ‘what then?’ With the joy, I might add, of a kid playing with all her toys at once. “When you were a kid, did you never have the urge to build an atom bomb, just to prove with your own hands that people could?”I’m already doing the book a disservice because I’m leaving out other massively cool things it does, but to describe it in full would take the length of the book. The sheer density of ideas, many tossed off as asides, is boggling. And by that I mean, humbling. Boggling, humbling. That’s the achievement you want. I thought, after Mycroft’s trial early on, “I don’t know if this book could get better.” And then the ‘Rose-Tinted Daydream’ happened, and then ‘Deo Erexit Deus’ happened, and then Caesar and Mycroft at Apollo’s tomb; I thought the same thing each time. Can this book get better? And then the last three chapters happened. ‘I Was Wrong,’ ‘Hero,’ and ‘Last Prayer’—I’ve read them three times already because I want to absorb them into my cells, imprint them on my skull, think and think and think about them. I yelped out loud when: DIOGENES. (YES, she went there.) I yelped again when: Achilles. As I may have mentioned, I spent the last chapters pumping my fist in the air. After which I lay there til all hours of the night, thinking, thinking, thinking. Caesar demands of Madame in that antepenultimate chapter: “You’re obsessed with the Eighteenth Century, have you never looked at what came later?” Golden Ages end with dark ones. What if? Why this? What then? What happens when it’s Achilles instead of Bridger? What happens you try to raise a Montaigne and get a Jehovah instead? What about when Diderot was right, but Hobbes was right, but Diogenes was right, but God was right? Which God? Why Them? What happens when Alexander has Aristotle, when Achilles has Patroclus, when Jehovah has Mycroft? When tyrants are extinct, but peace begats war just the same? When miracles have proof, when faith has reason, when reason fails? The Great Experiment continues. As for our author, there’s this part at the end of her Machiavelli essays I keep thinking about. She hypothesizes hosting her guest of honor, saying: and we would stay up all night, and eat all the cheese and olives, and drink all the wine, and Voltaire would come, and Hobbes, and Locke, and Rochester and Rousseau would get plastered and piss themselves, and Diderot would help me mop it up while we talked about Leibnitz and the imperfection of Creation, and Machiavelli would keep pace with us even though most of the ideas in question would be two hundred years younger than him. I can’t help but think this is what she’s done with this book. These are her co-authors. The conversation continues. They planted the seeds and, centuries later, this book was born. I feel lucky to have it. I feel like Mycroft, inadequate. If it takes me years to unpack it, I welcome the challenge. It’s one of those books of a lifetime. And there’s still more to come. “What I gave them was a fraction of what they planned to give the world.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,3,"Jan 2023Aug 20, 2021Jan 11, 2020","Jan 10, 2023Sep 10, 2021Feb 07, 2020","Jan 11, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36273973-seven-surrenders

I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in Too Like The Lightning, when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view. I had to go to the source to confirm it, and confirm it I have.“I am about to put forward some major ideas; they will be heard and pondered. If not all of them please, surely a few will; in some sort, then, I shall have contributed to the progress of our age, and shall be content.” (from “Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans”)Sade wants you to think. It’s all to a point—one that kept him imprisoned for much of his life. He’s in dialogue with his peers. He’s parodying 18th century scientific logic. He’s invoking taboo because, as Palmer would put it, that’s the Enlightenment art: mixing forbidden sex acts with forbidden things, especially forbidden talk. Context is everything. And Sade, within context, isn’t a beast who’s willing to file down his teeth. His pornography is ideas—scathing, provoking, often remarkably funny, terribly, boldly uncensored ideas. About God. Philosophy. Crime and punishment. Sexuality. Morality. On and on. There isn’t an extreme he won’t push. I get the feeling he gleefully contradicts himself, intentionally, again, just to get readers to think. Don’t take it all as read, even what he’s saying. Think you get his point? Wrong again, think some more. He’s a piece of a larger puzzle, and I would argue a crucial one. All these centuries later, he has refused to die, and it’s worth listening to what he has to say, if only to see where we might still be blind. Sade warns that he who would use Reason as a key to open one door opens many, and he who would make Reason a scythe to fell injustices must beware what else the blade might cut....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 08, 2020","Jan 20, 2020","Jan 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13517739-the-complete-justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings

Chomsky and Pappé cut through the murk of propaganda and politic with much-needed clarity. As per usual, things get spun as a “peace process” when the real words are too ugly: colonization, ethnic cleansing, and incremental genocide. And when there’s a profit involved.The peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is a medical miracle: it died several times, was resuscitated for a while, then collapsed again. It holds on not because there is the slight chance it will succeed but because of the dividends its very existence brings to many involved.That means there’s a precedent, though, that such things can be stopped once people see through the narrative and start taking a stand. Excellent primer on where to start looking, i.e. how big a role the US plays in the atrocity, and what it will take for that to change. The dehumanization in Iraq and Syria is widespread and terrifying, as it is in Gaza. But there is one crucial difference between these cases and the Israeli brutality: the former are condemned as barbarous and inhuman worldwide, while those committed by Israel are still publicly licensed and approved by the president of the United States, the leaders of the European Union, and Israel’s other friends in the world....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jan 05, 2020","Jan 08, 2020","Jan 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23129811-on-palestine
