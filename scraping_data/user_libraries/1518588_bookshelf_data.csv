Audiobooks have been my thing lately because I never have time to sit and read. I especially love popping the baby in his carriage, popping my ear buds in my ears and listening during a long walk on a cool, but not cold, day. This story was an enjoyable book about time travel that made an attempt at answering some existential question on what might be, what couldn't be, and why. Some thought this book was pretentious and it does start out that way, if only because Tom the main character is pretentious. However give it time and it changes, as characters and stories should during the unfolding. And while there is quite a lot more exposition than dialogue, by a lot I mean this is mostly exposition, it worked for me because it was as if the book was written directly to the reader. Time travel is one of those precarious pursuits that we will never really understand. And while this story relies on a few tropes of how changing something changes everything, there are some surprises in it's pursuits of change and survival. And also I suppose I didn't expect it to go where it went.

Mostly because there were two stories I felt the urge to skip. Not sure if it was the story itself, or the narrator reading the story, or a little of both. Maybe they just weren't my pot of coffee (I like it black with one sugar, so not too particular. Although straight coffee is a particular flavor in and of itself). But, never-the-less, I moved on without finishing them. Those two were All I Care About is You and The Devil on the Staircase. On the other side of the table, I liked all the others, and I loved Late Returns. Late returns was my favorite of the bunch. It had less of a horror story vibe and was instead a ghost story with some hope tied to it. There's a story about maniacal carousel horses, one with a war veteran, a fantasy with half human, half animal creatures, and a few others worth reading. All in all, Joe Hill writes a great short story. He drives you deep into the characters, not just a particular point in their life, but you feel like, in a short time, you've know them. They could be a friend, a neighbor, a co-worker. Maybe you went to school with them. But you know them and your eager to learn why their story matters.

Within the first few lines we are well aware the narrator may not be giving us the whole story, or the real story, after all she says ""sometimes I lie."" However, with each turn of the book I found myself drawn to Amber, absorbed in her confusion, feeling her sorrow and needing to know what happened and why. There were so many hidden observations, the ending surprised me. And I am hardly ever surprised by endings anymore. Amber telling us the story, her story from a coma means we won't know everything. We aren't privy to things she is not. We observe the world around her as she tells it from her confused state of mind. Feeney presented a skilled narrative, engrossing at every turn. Sometimes I lie is a page-turning, inventive and engrossing novel with complex characters and an unexpected plot....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,May 2018,"Jun 12, 2018","Jul 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32326398-sometimes-i-lie

I read this every day for 12 days before finishing. Granted I have kids and my own writing to complete, it was a long read. What more can be expected of a SK book? The layout of the story kept me reading. It was interesting and left me curious. SK does a great job of making the characters real and natural before building up to the supernatural elements that are likely to occur in his stories. He is a master but I felt, at many times, descriptions related to scenery and locations could have been drastically cut short by a page or two. He may have overdone it in that aspect which is why I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars. It was easy to doze off at night reading this long ""flowery"" prose when his settings trailed off into minute detail. While I wanted to find out what happened next, I didn't mind shutting the book and getting some shut eye before doing so. It might be faster paced with a little less description.

Omololu was different from most of the books I choose to read. Having not grown up in a traditional household, knowing what it felt like to harbor hatred and embarrassment as a teenager, and understanding how family secrets can drown you, I was drawn to this story and what it would take for Lucy to find herself and find her way out. This isn't just a story about what it is like to struggle with hoarding, or someone else's hoarding, but a character study into how hoarding takes control of your mind and life, everyone and everything around you, and tears it apart piece by dirty little piece. Lucy's mom, her siblings, and her friends lives all swim under the microscope, over the course of a few torturous hours, as Lucy first hides her true reality and it's affect on her psyche and then forces us into the overwhelming world that has shaped her life around them. This emotionally charged, vivid and unforgettable portrait into a hoarder house will not only make you want to get up and clean, but will leave you interpreting the way people live around you....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 30, 2018","Jun 05, 2018","May 30, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6759426-dirty-little-secrets

It's not because it isn't well-written or a great story. It is both eloquent in its writing and a well-thought out. Lisa Jewel took great care with her words and piecing together the saga that is Laurel's life. She wrote meaningful, beautiful descriptions and dialogue that weren't boring, drawn out , or unrealistic. I felt every heartbeat, every corner turned, every chapter ended. But I figured out the story, full of heartache and heartbreak, early on and sensed how it would end. I felt the tidbits presented in the beginning were just enough to let me know exactly what's happening and so when the villain, so to say, of the story first appears in her own words I was sure then sure how the story would end. While I wished for more surprise and not to have figured it out, the story itself was fast paced and written so well that I enjoyed it anyway. Enjoyed being a word I use lightly since it is a sad and terrible story to tell. It rushed on with suspense. I read it in a weekend, often unlikely for me with a family and busy lifestyle. And though I knew I was rushing to an end I expected I still couldn't put it down. A recommended read and I look forward to reading more of Lisa Jewels stories. Four stars should really be four and a half with the only reason it is not five because I figured it out earlier on than I would have liked. Though I immensely enjoyed watching Laurel find her place and her end to the sad story. P.s.
