It’s not hard to see “Dominant women are disturbing” says a woman interviewed by Nathalie Lugand for her book on femdom in hetero BDSM relationships. It’s not hard to see why, given that dominant women refuse to follow one very simple patriarchal rule: men dominate & women submit. In the 19th century, psychiatrist Krafft-Ebing, who used to be the ultimate authority on perversions, believed that dominant women were “excessive and monstrous.” He couldn’t get over how much they deviated from the expected submissive nature of “normal women”. Nowadays, at least in theory, dominant women disturb traditional views about the correct power dynamics between men and women. Dominant men are, of course, dominant everywhere, but they keep their sadism strictly in the bedroom (according to some theories, sadism is - for ever and without exceptions - tied/roped/bound/chained&locked to dominance). Dom women, however, are believed to take their sadism into the bedroom, office, on the street, and at dinner parties, because femdom is seen as totalitarian and essentialist, in addition to being abnormal. What about feminism, you might ask. I want to tell you that feminists have the best answer; one that is both nuanced and fair to femdom. But, the truth is, feminists have a complicated relationship with femdom. There are ideological conflicts between team #sexpositivefeminism and team #feministsagainstbdsm. There is much to say about this, and you’ll have to read the book to learn more, but for now I’ll let you know that the author is on team sex positive feminism.Women who like to use whips, floggers, canes, paddles, riding crops and restraining equipment on men are not exactly models of femininity, gentleness, or submissiveness. Upending traditional gender roles is their favourite sport. But here is the problem: quality submissive men are hard to find. In more cases then you’d think, femdom is yet another practice where traditional power dynamics are mimicked. For example, in almost every submissive man’s mind, a great dominatrix is secretly a caring, empathic and emotional woman who is able to *act* dominant, hard, & indifferent *for him*. One common narrative is that a dominatrix is either a great sadotherapist, or a fantastic educator. But, maybe she’s both. Or maybe - and I can’t believe that this is controversial for some people - a dom woman is much more than her dominant side. Of course, for a Domme there is pleasure in staging, directing a scene, taking initiative, and maintaining control. But, hardly anyone wants to hear about the complexities of her desires. Too many submissive men are afraid of ruining their fantasy if they were to start seeing a Mistress as more human and less Goddess. What many want is a femdom that is focused on male needs and desires. In other words, a Domme is expected to create a fantasy environment for submissive men. But, this takes a lot of emotional & practical resources. Dommes will do it, but very few will do it for free. And instead of appreciating their effort and creativity, too many submissive men criticize pro-Dommes for being shrewd and financially exploiting men with unconventional desires. Nathalie Lugand is one of the few academics willing to discuss the laminated layers of stigma pro-Dommes face, such as the reinforcement of male economic power. And the cultural and sometimes ethnic or racial asymmetry. Many men who pay for pro-Domme services are white, relatively wealthy, and educated. For some, part of the thrill is to submit to women they view as socially, culturally and educationally inferior to them. Powerful men eroticising shame and powerlessness by submitting to vulnerable women is problematic in more ways than one. Add to this the requirement that the women will display sadism, superiority, indifference and distain flawlessly, and you’ll begin to see why pro-Domme sessions cost as much as they do. It is true that during the pandemic, and after, new forms of femdom, such as findom, began to be available mostly online, leading to a much greater variety of men clients, not just the privileged white. Nonetheless, in most cases, the power and authority are never really the woman’s. At the slightest misstep, the male client, or male partner, pushes her back to where her father and grandfather intended her to stay. But, one thing’s for sure: dominant women will always find new ways to take the power back. And they won’t mind being sadistic about it. I highly recommend this book.

Now, this father of a family coming in through the door, perhaps during the War he killed a man or two. But now his face as he sips his coffee and scolds his children is not the face of man fresh from murder. Just as with the show window in West Matsubara, past which the trucks rumble, the dust of the years settles on our faces too.”Towards the end of World War II, at Fukuoka Imperial University Hospital a number of doctors and nurses performed vivisections on several American airmen. They reasoned that everyone was at risk of dying anyway. Those that didn’t die in the hospital got a chance to die every night in an air raid. The city was diminishing daily, as the burnt out section of Fukuoka was expanding. The general view was that sentimentality was a luxury forbidden in hospitals during the war. Also, doctors weren’t saints; they sought promotions, and looked for opportunities to try out new techniques. Their experiments were not limited to dogs or monkeys. It was easier for Suguro and Toda, both interns, to submit to peer pressure from their superiors and let things go as they were. Trying to figure out motives and morals felt too heavy and oppressive for them to think about. And so, one day, they found themselves in an operating room eviscerating, experimenting on, and eventually murdering prisoners. All in the name of science. What about their conscience, you might wonder. Well, people always find ways of coping with their capacity for evil.“There is something I would like to ask you. Aren’t you too, deep down, unmoved by the sufferings and death of others? Aren’t we brothers under the skin perhaps? Haven’t you, too, lived your life up to now without excessive self-recrimination and shame? And then someday doesn’t there stir in you, too, the thought that you’re a bit ‘strange’?”I loved this book.

Sad sex is the saddest of all.” Julian Barnes, The Only Story.At nineteen Pa“Sad sex is always far worse than good sex, bad sex, self-sex and no sex. Sad sex is the saddest of all.” Julian Barnes, The Only Story.At nineteen Paul fell in love with a married woman. Susan was his mother’s age. Being young in brain, heart, and cock he carelessly–or carefreely–imagined that the thrill of love, the good sex, the unpredictability of an unconventional relationship will last a lifetime. Paul was an idealist, convinced that he had both the will and the power to rescue Susan, but she never asked for that. After a while, good sex turned to bad sex, and bad sex to sad sex. And sad sex created conditions ripe for an existential panic that “takes some to God, others to despair, some to charitable works, others to drink, some to emotional oblivion, others to a life where they hope that nothing serious will ever trouble them again.” Neither Paul, nor Susan, were driven to God. Or to charitable works.“Sad sex is when, the toothpaste in her mouth not fully disguising the smell of sweet sherry, she whispers, ‘Cheer me up, Casey Paul.’ And you oblige. Though cheering her up also involves cheering yourself down. Sad sex is when she is already doped by a cheering-up pill, but you think that if you fuck her it might cheer her up a bit more. Sad sex is when you are yourself in such despair, the situation so insoluble, the pre-history so oppressive, the very balance of your soul in doubt from day to day, moment to moment, that you think you may as well forget about yourself for a few minutes, for half an hour, in sex. But you don’t forget yourself, or your state of soul, not for even a nanosecond. Sad sex is when you feel you are losing touch with her, and she with you, but this is a way of telling one another that the connection is still there, somehow; that neither of you is giving up on the other, even if part of you fears that you should. Then you discover that insisting on the connection is the same as prolonging the pain.”At the heart of the novel is the question of whether you’d rather love the more, and suffer the more, or love the less, and suffer the less. But-and Barnes knows this-it’s not a real question, because we don’t have that choice. I thought the novel was good, but it’s not Barnes’ best work. For a book that deals with the devastating consequences of unconventional love, abuse and addiction, I felt that its tone is a little too emotionally detached. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 12, 2023","Feb 18, 2023","Feb 12, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35570812-the-only-story

By page 541, I had already visited my primary care physician, my ob-gyn, a dermatologist and two doctors in preventive screening. They assured me that I am healthy. You see, Verghese writes about illnesses in vivid detail. If you have a vivid imagination, expect to develop a new set of symptoms every few chapters. After spending hundreds of pages with Dr Thomas Stone, Dr. Hema, Dr. Ghosh, Dr Marion and Dr. Shiva inside operating rooms, I won’t judge if you’ll strip naked in front of your mirror (multiple times, like I did) and thoroughly look for lumps, bumps and suspicious skin patches. You’re probably fine, but please get that thing checked. Much of the book is about the lives of people working in hospitals, especially surgeons. They are so dedicated to their profession that it often looks as if they are imprisoned by it. It begins in Ethiopia during the 1950s to 1970s, a country full of possibilities and chaos, but then moves to different places, following the doctors who chase the odd beauty of working to heal others. The book takes a hard look at fatherhood and brotherhood, dissecting facets of masculinity. A recurring theme is the human need to find meaning by making something beautiful. The problems I had were that the plot relied on too many coincidences to be credible, felt overly ambitious and unnecessarily long. But, I enjoyed it. I often forgot that I was reading. In Verghese’s words, I inhabited the story. It drew me in, broke me, and put me back together, with no loose ends. If you like your books to feel like a BDSM session this one will give you plenty of visceral pain and expert aftercare. It won’t end until you’re feeling cozy in a comfortable headspace. But you’ll be emotionally bruised for days. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 17, 2022","Oct 02, 2022","Sep 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3591262-cutting-for-stone

I think it’s more than that. I see iPeople say that de Beauvoir wrote this novel as an act of revenge upon the woman who came between her and Sartre. I think it’s more than that. I see it as a story about de Beauvoir's journey to asserting herself freely: the point where she acted “as alone as in death”. She tells the world that she chose herself, consequences be dammed, because she could only know her reality (this btw is solipsism - de Beauvoir wrote a philosophical novel on the subject of a failed romantic trio and I think that’s very cool). Okay. So, before *she* came to stay, Françoise and Pierre (based on Simone & Jean-Paul) were simply one. They thought of each other not as an “I” or a “you”, but, lovingly (and toxically) as a “we”. They belonged to each other and the world belonged to them. And by “the world” I mean the attractive actors who worked for them and who they wanted to possess. Françoise & Pierre were one and they were free. Françoise freely decided that there was no room in her life for another lover. But, she wasn’t against having intimate friendships when she could see some continuity of the friendship. Pierre freely chose to have frivolous affairs that could be easily terminated. He only enjoyed the early stages. According to him, no harm was done, since, “none of these dear little creatures has ever been really in love with me”. But, by ignoring power imbalances in dating people they hired, Pierre and Françoise were not exactly models of ethical non-monogamy. Needless to say, they were not ready for Xavière. No one is ready for Xavière. Graceful, ruthless and treacherous as a cat, she offered them the temptation of a rich experience. She came with demands, smiles, pouts, and deliciously unexpected reactions. She had a scent of risk and mystery. The couple dreamed of an exciting trio. They hoped to break Xavière s obstinate will. They wanted to lead a yielding Xavière through life and make her happy. But, this rare treasure resisted the two strong, generous, and patronizing intellectuals. Françoise, exasperated, decided that Xavière was an insignificant spoiled child, while Pierre, intrigued, saw a precious black pearl that he wanted to own. Loyal only to herself, “Xavière, from head to foot, was nothing but a living assertion of herself.” Pierre saw the value in that. Françoise saw the danger. Because of Xavière, they no longer acted as one. Xavière existed between them. She breached their serenity. Françoise, alone, “felt rising within her, with a kind of joy, something black and bitter that she did not yet know and which was almost a deliverance: powerful, free, finally bursting unhindered into bloom. It was hate.” Did she finally assert herself as separate from Pierre? Yes, she did. And it was monstrous. The book is passive-aggressively dedicated to the woman who awoke de Beauvoir’s hatred and will for freedom....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 02, 2022","Sep 12, 2022","Aug 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21121.She_Came_to_Stay

Two three houFor reasons that make no sense, Mathias, a travelling watch salesman, returned to the island of his birth, for one day, to sell watches. Two three hours crossings was a great loss of time for such a small island, and neither friendships nor any early memories attracted him to the place. His sales plan was awful: sell 89 watches in 6h & 15min. That is, arrival, sales talk, display of watches, choice of watch, payment, and departure had to be completed every 4min. He did not take into account any hesitation that people may have, further explanations he may have to give, discussion about pricing or the time needed to get from one door to another. Shops, houses, hallways and kitchens led to failure after failure.Everything from that day was recounted by Mathias in great detail. But very soon gaps and inconsistencies accumulate. Mathias’ memories are not reliable: “the room he entered was not at all remarkable – except for an unmade bed with a red spread trailing on the floor. There was no red bedspread, nor was there an unmade bed; no lambskin, no night table, no bed lamp; there was no blue pack of cigarettes, no painting on the wall. The room he had been directed to was only a kitchen, where he put his suitcase flat on the big oval table in the middle.” Things get more confusing because, a young girl – Jacqueline, or was it Violette? - was found dead. The clues, if there’re any, are in the details. Mathias’s memories and thoughts are terribly distorted tho. What had he been doing since morning? The whole extent of time seems too long, too uncertain, too unaccounted for. And the more confusing his memories are the more suspect he seems. Mathias keeps on playing back his day, carried away by the flood of his own words. From sentence to sentence, the ground beneath his feet gives way a little more. To secure his narrative, he repeats himself, but he can’t quite get the details to match. His concern for exactitude is the very thing that accuses him. I think. By the end of the novel, Mathias’ reality lost all meaning and as reader you can never be quite sure what the underlying facts were.This novel is disturbing & confusing (on purpose). But, it is well executed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 04, 2022","Aug 11, 2022","Aug 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/102000.Le_Voyeur

My favorite is the title story. Subject: terror in the face of death. Setting: the Spanish CiThis is a collection of short stories written by Sartre. My favorite is the title story. Subject: terror in the face of death. Setting: the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Main protagonist: Pablo Ibbieta, a prisoner awaiting his unavoidable execution. Sartre opens the door to his cell and invites us to watch him, and two other men, as they struggle with the realization that they have no other power except, perhaps, the power over their own emotional consciousness. Ibbieta cannot escape his execution, but the philosophical question is: can he escape his feelings? Will dread and anxiety lessen if he accepted that his life was ordinary and unimportant? Worthless? According to Sartre, emotions do not happen to us, we happen through emotions. We care about the world we live in, and, to make things even more painful, we care about other people’s feelings. Unless you are a psycho, what others feel will affect, move, seduce, scare, hurt, anger, or annoy you. Your own sudden emotions of horror, awe, grief, or terror will always change the way you look at the world, and the way you exist in it. When we are faced with a situation that we cannot escape we have no other choice but to start emoting. Add to this the awareness that as long as we exist, we cannot escape our existence, and you’ll start to see that we are prisoners of our own consciousness. But, Sartre wants to convince us that we also have a choice. Think about it: we are only going to feel emotions about the things that matter to us. Strictly speaking, we are the ones that decide what is important and what isn’t. So when we don’t care, we don’t suffer. But is not caring ever worth it? What about Ibbieta? Should he care, if caring means that he will be consumed and driven to madness by the terror of trying to grasp what it means to be executed? The Wall is a mindfuck, complete with a plot twist that will make you laugh so hard that you’ll cry. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,2,"Aug 26, 2022Jul 29, 2022","Aug 28, 2022Jul 30, 2022","Jul 29, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10031.The_Wall

I told eachSeveral people told me that I’d love Emily Nagoski’s book “Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life”. I told each of them that it’s unlikely that I’d like a book that uses a sensationalized title un-ironically. But, for reasons I don’t fully understand, I gave it a try. I didn’t like it. It’s one of those books that try too hard to convey research in a relatable way. The information’s ok & the research is worth looking into. But, I have a problem when intelligent authors assume that their readers are stupid. This is not a scientific book about sex. It’s condescending & it infantilizes its readers. This is especially annoying to me because the book is written for women. I hate to type the obvious, but women can read research. There is no need for silly metaphors after we pass the age of six. We don’t need to imagine that our brains are like a flock of birds or that our sexuality is like an overgrown garden. I think the book is mostly about providing advice and encouragement to women who want to have fun, but can’t read anything complex about sex health. I find that assumption offensive. I am again stating the obvious here, but fun content does not have to be dumb. Even Playboy knew this. The magazine, for many years, had very high-quality editorial content. Vonnegut, Atwood, Kerouac, Capote, Mailer, Palahniuk & Bradbury wrote for Playboy and none of them assumed that their (mostly) male audience needed to be warned that, and I quote: “it gets pretty nerdy here”. Or, after some science part, to be told: “Did you make it? Whew! That was the hard part. Nice job”. Or use the word “feels”, instead of “emotions.” That’s how Dr. Nagoski talks to her (assumed female) readers. I strongly dislike the underlying belief that most women are not interested in and cannot read hard science or interpret research data. We can, and many of us do. Maybe, this book is more appropriate for teenage girls, but even then, I would think that the tone is condescending. “For realsie real” - to use Nagoski’s words - my personal opinion is that women want, and deserve, much better written books about sex than this. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jul 19, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22609341-come-as-you-are

I’m sure there’s much more to it, as the text is brimming with religious metaphors, literary references, and historical allusions, but as far as I’m concerned, that’s the main idea. Bulgakov drew from the stories of Faust and Christ, mixing and combining plot motifs and character traits to create a clever, ridiculous and weird story of good and evil. It begins with a poet who wrote a contemptuous poem about Jesus, which you’d think was PC, given the time & place (1920s & 1930s Russia), but it wasn’t because it assumed that Jesus existed. An editor, a believer of rationalistic materialism, stepped in to fix the ideological error. However, the Devil felt compelled to show up and teach the Soviets a thing of two about the supernatural and reveal their personal and institutional corruption. The Dark Lord, well dressed, educated, gentlemanly, and totally a cat person, was evil (obvs), but his heart was in the right place. He wreaked havoc in Moscow, rewrote biblical history, got several people locked in a psychiatric hospital, and a few killed. But it was all in good fun. (Btw, don’t ever try to explain the Devil’s existence using Marxist vocabulary. It will make you sound like a lunatic.) The intellectual Muscovites are the main butt of the satire. Bulgakov exposed their bribes, squabbles, intrigues, empty lives, and pointless jobs with so much zest that for years after his death the novel was distributed only as part of samizdat. He also muddied the waters for the religious because in this story the Devil’s the good guy, and God is, well, also the good guy. It’s like Faust’s world, only upside down. Pacts with the Devil were made and Moscow was liberated from rationality by a colourful, whimsical, and chaotic group of demons and witches. In Bulgakov’s world there were only three choices: accept the status quo and the corruption, go mad in an asylum, or join the Devil and his gang of weirdos and make absurd jokes about it all.

One of them he damages beyond repair. The women trigger transformations in the main character, leading him to a better understanding of himself. And that is the only role women have in South of the Border, West of the Sun.Murakami writes male characters well. And I love his stories. But the way he characterizes women is sexist and misogynistic. I understood Murakami’s writing better after reading about eastern folklore. Unlike western folklore which features a strong brave man saving a beautiful helpless princess from evil, in eastern folklore, women are the saviours. The man is down on his luck, and a very beautiful woman, often magical, falls in love with him. She begins to take care of him, doing daily chores like cooking and cleaning. She provides emotional support and has sex with him until his luck improves. After that, she quietly leaves him so he can marry another beautiful woman, often from a rich family. Much eastern folklore follows this pattern. Generally these stories are written by men for male readers. Murakami follows this formula, and was clearly influenced by it. The women he creates are beautiful, strong, sexually available, loving, nurturing in a mother like way, happy to provide free house work, and then quietly leave to allow the men to move on to a better life with a deeper understanding of themselves. Murakami can only write what he knows and understands, and so far he was not able to do better: “Without demanding it be positive or negative, the best that I can do is approach these stories, as they are, inside of me. I’m not a thinker, or a critic, or a social activist. I’m just a novelist. If someone tells me that my work is flawed when viewed through a particular ism, or could have used a bit more thought, all that I can do is offer a sincere apology and say, “I’m sorry.” (Murakami interviewed by Mieko Kawakami, 2020). ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 26, 2022","Jun 30, 2022","Jun 26, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17799.South_of_the_Border_West_of_the_Sun

For Graham Hendrick, a middle-aged historian, the location of all pleasure and emotion was in the small space in the middle of his head. All he valued happened between his ears. When he met Ann, he felt as if his head and body began to communicate. He stopped thinking of himself as a brain lodged inside the container of his body. He promptly left his wife, and for a short while he was very happy with Ann. Until he watched a film. Ann used to play small parts in movies. He knew that. But what he didn’t know was the emotions that one mediocre film would trigger in him. He began to think about the actors who pretended to have sex with Ann on screen. Then he began to worry about the actors who had sex with Ann off screen. He gave in to the urge to line them up in his head and analyse them one by one. It began to hurt him that, before she met him, Ann had sex with other men. He spent hours carefully researching Ann’s past lovers. After all, what’s the point of getting jealous unless you were accurate about it? To him, it felt like she cheated on him. And he knew that he was being ridiculous. He didn’t blame Ann, it’s just that, for him, history always mattered. His relationship with Ann was going well, and there was nothing in his present life to give him sleepless nights, but he seemed keen on having sleepless nights. Strangely he was both entirely happy and entirely sad. He worried that however good his relationship was, Ann might at any moment start dreaming of an extra oomph. Did he feel confident that he satisfied her? No. Yes. No. Not sure. Ann’s past lovers hung around in some back alley of Graham’s brain at all times, half-seen figures, ready to saunter out and mess with his emotions. His jealousy came in rushes. Its source was trivial, its cure unknown. It lingered, unwanted, resented, “like a middle year, only there to make you lose your sense of balance.” How does one stop jealousy? What do you do when your brain becomes your enemy? How does a sensible and intelligent person, like Graham, deal with it? Because no one can go on being fueled by such a powerful emotion for ever....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 21, 2022","Jun 26, 2022","Jun 21, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/110973.Before_She_Met_Me

An orphaned brother and sister escape iLes Enfants Terribles is an extremely poetic but utterly unholy novel about the fascination for the forbidden. An orphaned brother and sister escape into a private world of their own making and become unable to function outside of it. Largely unsupervised, their vibe is at first playful, but then grows into something darker as they engage into increasingly intense, violent and sexually charged mindfucks. Additional characters are brought into their Game – especially a school friend, Gérard, who develops an obsession with the siblings’ D/s dynamic and its latent eroticism and aggression. But, Gérard is not an equal player. He is mostly a keen spectator to the ritualized power play between sadistic Elizabeth and her bratty brother, Paul. The relationship between the ungodly duo and Gerard brings to mind the impervious ménage à trois from Bertolucci’s The Dreamers. Like Isabelle and Theo from the film, Elizabeth and Paul are quite the symbiotic pair. There are incestuous undertones implicit in everything they do. In Cocteau’s book, the sibling’s lair is their shared bedroom where the Game is being played. This Game is at its core a ritualized psychological torture: Elizabeth teases Paul with intensifying violence, and Paul is making great efforts to remain unmoved. The winner of each game session is the one who succeeds in driving the other one to a temper tantrum. These two have a kink for provoking and irritating the hell out of each other. Elizabeth’s gets her kicks by cruelly taunting Paul, Paul gets his by remaining stubbornly impassive as a way of annoying his sister. As a reader, you get to experience the voyeuristic pleasure of watching a toxic relationship implode. The tension builds up as les enfants terribles engage in escalating cycles of mental domination and submission that traps them into the claustrophobic world of The Game and puts them into an incurable state of transgressive desire that ends like a Greek tragedy, but with French stylishness....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 06, 2022","Jun 10, 2022","Jun 06, 2022",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/896800.Les_Enfants_terribles

It’s a comic book story, but written for Playboy. A guy named Hanio fails to commit suicide. A free and empty world opens up wonderfully before him. He is alive and he no longer gives a shit. How freeing! Right?! So what does he do with that freedom? He places an ad in a tabloid: “Life for Sale. Use me as you wish. I am a twenty-seven-year-old male. Discretion guaranteed.” This gets him into situations involving sex, smuggling, murder, drugs, bombs, espionage and carrots. Yup, carrots. But, it’s not what you think. As long as Hanio’s life is meaningless and he’s prepared to meet death at any moment he has no fear, sadness or joy. He just has ennui. But, eventually he meets a woman. He falls in love. He falls out of love. Before he realizes what is happening he begins to desire life. He starts to care and that fucks up everything for him.

Was it really more than just pretty language, he wondered. Was it more than brocade? Anaïs Nin has a way of throwing you straight into the impossible tangle of her thoughts. She does not lead up to anything and she gives you no clues. She wrote intensely about her volcanic life hunger and her sensual participation in experiences that fully negate her mother’s Christian values. Anaïs Nin sinned with sacred religious fervor. With a madonna face, she swallowed God and sperm (her words, not mine). She was fascinated by evil (in the sense of transgression) and her desires hid obscenities and a brutality that are hardly pure. But her writing isn’t vulgar. Instead, her sentences are pretty and elegant. Those who wanted to see her in an idealized way, saw only poetry on her pages. Some looked for the symbolism in her writing. But for her- the puritanical Catholic who awakened to sinful passions during the year when she fell in love with Henry and his wife June - there were other meanings in her brocaded pages. Finally, Henry understood. He seized, responded and expanded the side of her that was “disturbed, dangerous, erotic”. She did something unique. He said that she owed it to the world to share those parts of herself after nurturing this work with a lifetime of journal writing, “the orange squeezer, where all the rinds are left behind.” Ultimately, I think her writing was an act of love, because love was at the root of her being as she walked into the chaos of June, Henry and herself.

You can finish it so fast that you won’t even need to use both hands. On every page, the characters indulge in acts meant to arouse and horrify you. The young male narrator and Simone, the woman he loves, are on a quest to defy modesty as immodestly as possible. Both of them have an eye for debauchery and debasement. This is how the narrator explains it: “But as of then, no doubt existed for me: I did not care for what is known as ‘pleasures of the flesh’ because they really are insipid; I cared only for what is classified as ‘dirty’. On the other hand, I was not even satisfied with the usual debauchery, because the only thing it dirties is debauchery itself, while, in some way or other, anything sublime and perfectly pure is left intact by it. My kind of debauchery soils not only my body and my thoughts, but also anything I may conceive in its course.”Story of the Eye is the story of an object – the Eye - that migrates through two main images: eggs and balls. There are also other minor images that have in common their whiteness and roundness. All ocular metaphors are linked to liquids: a saucer of milk, runny eggs, glands, tears, milk, sperm and urine. Even objects that generally do not have anything to do with eyes are given eye-like qualities (what do the sun, the bowels of a horse and Simone’s buttocks have in common?) Through the eye metaphor Bataille explores how all things that seem solid - hard objects (eggs, balls, and other body parts), values, norms and institutions - are, in fact, transitory, like liquids. Everything degrades and anything can be corrupted. Simone and her lover, their homes, their friends, the institutions they come in contact with (an asylum for the mentally ill, a church), and traditions (bullfighting) are changed and cause changes, and during their transformation they acquire the lewdest of meanings.The book is filthy. But, as Susan Sontag notes, for Bataille filth “simultaneously revives his most painful experiences and scores a victory over that pain.” Once you read this, you’ll never look at eggs in the same way again. It’s an eye-opening experience....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 28, 2022","May 30, 2022","May 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/436806.Story_of_the_Eye

The novel’s skeleton is autobiographical, but its flesh is made of kink, fetish, identity and the internal struggle of a man who came to realize that his desires had no place, well, anywhere except in his imagination. His kinks were incompatible with the rigid imperial wartime Japan of the 1940s. Imagine young Kochan. He was fascinated with soldiers, uniforms, aesthetic paintings of young Christian male martyrs, and athletic-but unintelligent-young men. His fetishes were extreme. In his fantasies he tortured, maimed and killed men. He wrote prose poems about the beauty of men who were destined for death. He delighted in imagining situations in which he was also dying in battle or being murdered dramatically. His heart’s leanings were toward death, night and blood. And yet, he had an unusually strong fear of death. He glittered “with debauched loneliness” but also felt a compulsion to conform. He put on a mask, and the mask protected and tortured him. The mask was his public identity, always at odds with his private self. He played a part, without ever once revealing himself. Yet, he could not fully engage in anything. Without his natural and spontaneous sadistic desires, his pain grew into detachment. His numbness resembled fierce pain. He tells us: “I felt my entire body becoming paralysed with such a pain, a pain that was intense, but still could not be felt at all.” He was waiting for something to do him the favour of killing him, which was the same as if he was waiting for something to do him the favour of keeping him alive. The masked voice of his pain told him “you’re not human. You’re a being who is incapable of social intercourse. You’re nothing but a creature, non-human and somehow strangely pathetic.” He could only be comforted by visions reeking with blood. Brutal images were his most intimate friends, and he surrendered himself to them, but always reluctantly and with shame.This novel is dark and disturbing, but also a work of beauty....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"May 23, 2022","May 27, 2022","May 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62794.Confessions_of_a_Mask

Unlike de Sade,I think that what Bataille is saying in the three stories included in this volume is that eroticism will always destroy the innocents. Unlike de Sade, whose language is jarringly crude, Batalille writes poetically about violent sex. He is less interested in obscene technicalities, and more in the soul-destroying and body-decaying effects of sex as a response to loss and grief. Bataille philosophy is filthy and dark. And he may have taken pleasure from making his readers unhappy. Each central character lost someone or something important to them. In the first story, My Mother, seventeen year old Pierre lost his father and his piety. He was the submissive son of a woman who became revolting to him. He continued to venerate her like a saint, while painfully realizing that he had no basis for that veneration. His mother’s debauchery nauseated him and his continued respect for her made him – but never her – the object of his own horror. He entered a delirium where he felt lost, and in that lifeless void, he glimpsed God. He decided to follow through the interwoven joy and terror that strangled him from within. The sole remedy for his suffering was to heighten it. After all, doesn’t everyone enjoy walking on the edge of a cliff? Along with revolt, Pierre was gripped by greediness for terrifying pleasures. The more his pleasures strangled him, the more they overpowered him. Happiness hurt him like poison, because, as his mother explained, “pleasure only starts once the worm has got into the fruit, to become delightful happiness must be tainted with poison. All the rest is childishness.” More than love for his mother, Pierre loved the possibility of loving her to the point of no return. In all of the three stories, the characters crave poisonous sweetness blended with pain and suffering. The unnamed man who spent a night with Madame Edwarda, whose presence was as mindless, absent and rapt as God’s (she was God), and Marie in The Dead Man, who was suspended in an unintelligible emptiness after her lover Edouard died, wanted to enter fully into destruction because destruction is always more complete and more violent than any simple desire....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 12, 2022","May 17, 2022","May 12, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/135460.My_Mother_Madame_Edwarda_The_Dead_Man

Marlon James wants you to imagine the “unending vortex of ugly”. Blood red, dirt brown, clay brown and shit brown. Zinc shining like nickel or rusted the color of Jamaican dirt, riddled with bullets. Sweet like baby powder on women’s breasts, or Old Spice and leather mixed with the raw smell of slaughtered goat. The scent of pimento in goat’s head soup. Detergent, cocoa butter, fermenting pee and aging shit running down the side of the road. Again pimento but in jerk chicken. Cordite from a recently fired gun, “the iron in blood congealed from street kill, still there after the body has been removed.” If this wasn’t enough for you, and M.

From this soup of dirt, blood, gunshots, pimento, and rhythm comes a story about slum life, one-night stands, drug lords, journalists, music, fucking hell and shit. I think Marlon James is a writer who likes to joke. But he only tells you the blackest of black jokes. Like a capable rigger, he will lure you in with his skills and then he’ll tie you up and drag you down the darkest pit of hell you could ever imagine. He’ll “smile like he and the devil have a secret” and watch you try to get untangled. Just wait until he tells you about the Electric Boogie. You will never be innocent again. The book is repulsive. It is “a vision of hell that twists and turns on itself and grooves to its own soundtrack.” It is horrifying, disgusting and sick. There is a lot of sex, swearing, violence and brutal death.

Jake is compulsive, restless, penniless, and in love. Like Salinger’s Holden Caulfield and his angsty trip around NY, Jake takes us on an existential trip in London & Paris. He tries to find out what he thinks, what love is, and where his life is heading. He is successful at avoiding jobs, and not so successful at translating trashy French novels. Jake comes to realize that words are unreliable. Language conforms to a subjective “net”, while the real world slips “under the net”. This, by the way, is Murdoch’s sly reference to Wittgenstein, who used the net metaphor to argue that truth cannot be fully expressed in words. Language, the philosopher explained, blurs the truth. On this view, Jake’s life – or any life for that matter – can only be lived, not explained. And Jake, like all of us, searches for the deeper meaning of his life. Language gets in his way. In his conversations with the woman he loves, Anna, (who loves Hugo), Hugo (who loves Sadie), Sadie (who loves Jake), and Finn (who loves drinking), Jake notices that language is vulnerable. Everyone distorts, exaggerates, and tries to manipulate others. Jake gets closest to truth when he falls into a silent, dreamy, unlucrative reflection which he enjoys more than anything in the world. He finds peace in the company of the inscrutable Mrs. Tinckham and her wordless cats. He finds comfort by taking the fabulous - and also wordless - hound, Mr. Mars, for his daily walk. Truth is in actions, not language. But Jake loves literature, and obviously you cannot have literature without words. For a long time, he hides behind other people’s words by translating smut. But, if you’re patient with Jake, you’ll see that eventually he finds his own words, which he then uses to tell us about the maze of misconceptions in which his selfish, ego-centered ways had landed him....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 24, 2022","Mar 04, 2022","Feb 24, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11324.Under_the_Net

Life, with its drama, sadness, humor, intimacies, and absurdities is told in tangential fragments. Each sentence is rich with rhymes, almost-rhymes and alliterations. You don’t read Lutz for the plot (there isn’t any) or the characters (left as unfinished sketches). You read Lutz for the language, word-choices, rhythms and sounds which fizz, tinkle and bong on the page. In the essay “The Sentence is a Lonely Place” Lutz writes that the sentence is like a theater where writing attains its ultimacy. Lutz produces “narratives of steep verbal topography, narratives in which the sentence is a complete, portable solitude, a minute immediacy of consummated language - the sort of sentence that, even when liberated from its receiving context, impresses itself upon the eye and the ear as a totality, an omnitude, unto itself.”Some examples:“My life reeks of other people, least of all me. As a boy, I’d been daughterish, dawdling — hardly the type to stay put in the lineage. Of my parents’ bedroom I remember mostly a bedside table that opened only from the back.”“It was mostly students who dropped by, students in curricular dishevelment…Once in a while he would get a student on the lookout for herself in everyone she met. There were never enough of these.”“It was as if we could look all the way through her, back to when she’d been babysat. But we could picture the babysitters only partway, only about as far up as just above the knees. Anything further up on those girls must have long ago been crossed out or cut off. Their breasts, their arms and faces, were as much as zilch to us. Their voices might as well have been smoke. But why is it that there’s never enough to people? Why must my own life remain to be seen?”“(One morning alone, I was taken for a Lisa, a Cindy, an Andrea.) It was a good thing because it got me thinking that I might possibly have the markings in me of some other person completely.

He started painting in his twenties to escape boredom. He kept on being bored, so ten years later he figured he might as well stop painting. For as long as he could remember he suffered from an extreme case of boredom. For Dino boredom wasn’t just ordinary boredom that you or I may experience. His boredom had been elevated to philosophical heights. Dino’s boredom was existential.As a young boy, when he was living with his very rich mother on the Via Appia, he found everything insufficient and lacking. Reality felt like a too short blanket upon a sleeping man during winter: “he pulls it down over his feet and his chest gets cold, then he pulls it up on his chest and his feet get cold.” He wished to escape his boredom by moving to a studio in Via Margutta, where he could paint all day and live on a modest allowance from his mother. He hoped that by pretending to himself and others that he was poor he’ll be cured of boredom. Unfortunately he wasn’t, because Dino couldn’t forget that he was, in fact, rich. His boredom resulted from the reality of his wealth, and his artistic sterility resulted from boredom.At this point in his privileged, pampered-by-mommy, selfish, and miserable existence, he met Cecilia, a young woman posing as a model for painters. They began an affair. Unsurprisingly, Dino’s boredom became incarnate in the person of his mistress. He planned to break up with her. But, before that, he needed to utterly possess, dominate and master her. And Cecilia, in a seemingly oblivious way, resisted all his efforts to control her. Before he realized what was happening, Dino’s boredom evaporated. Instead, he began to experience corrosive jealousy, sexual obsession, frenzied desire, emotional suffering, intrusive but highly analytical thoughts, and an all-consuming ambition to understand and possess Cecilia so that he could finally disentangle himself from her and return to a peaceful life of boredom.Do you think he succeeded?

She mixes class, race, ethnicity, disability, sexuality and trans identities. Every character has a hyphenated identity: Amma is a middle-aged-polyamorous-lesbian-slut-socialist-and-theatre-maker; Dominique is a lesbian-feminist-music-festival-producer-abuse-survivor-and-transexclusionary; Morgan is a trans-non-binary-social-media-influencer-and-school-dropout. And these are just three of the messy and flawed humans we get to meet. There are: radical feminists, moderate feminists, anti-feminists, homophobics, transphobics, monogamous, non-monogamous, kinky, vanilla, rich, and poor. All of them try to find a place to fit in. They form communities, friendships, and families and try to make it in a society that views them as “other”. They open up, become vulnerable, argue, start feeling like the “other” in small or big ways, and inevitably fallouts happen. The problem isn’t that sometimes people do not fit well into each other’s lives. The problem is that when people form a community some of them can abuse their position of power and privilege and make others feel unsafe and unwanted. Some are gatekeepers to their communities and have the power to invite people in, keep people out, put pressure on some members to become less visible, push members out, and advance some narratives, while silencing others. Communities, friendships and families are complicated, togetherness comes at a cost and fallouts are never simple. But Evaristo nudges the reader towards empathy. Even those who mess up from a position of privilege are portrayed as weak, rather than evil, and weakness is hard to judge because we all have our moments.The story structure is unconventional. It’s a hybrid, not quite prose, not quite poetry. It has no capitalization, the whole thing is one long sentence. The lines run-on, like thoughts, and there’s a messiness and disruption of expectations, similar to the disruption of community achieved by the characters.

He mingled with wealthy aristocrats and beautiful women who loved art and literature. During times of great social turmoil his main concern was how to preserve church buildings from pigeon shit. For a while, Urrutia was at peace with himself. His conscience was quiet, the horrors he saw were dulled by routine. “And then the storm of shit begins”. And this time it’s not pigeon shit.On his deathbed, haunted by Dante’s Sordello (“Sordel, Sordello, which Sordello?”), Urrutia is afraid he’ll run out of time to confess and burn. But, confess what? “Sometimes at night, I would sit on a chair in the dark and ask myself what difference there was between fascist and rebel. Just a pair of words. Two words, that’s all. And sometimes either one will do!” Urrutia was neither fascist nor rebel. He was a passive observer of events and that was his sin. He wonders if he should have risked everything for a lost cause. Why would a priest go out on the streets and protest against the crimes he sees around him? What is the cost of rebellion? What is the cost of compliance?“Was it the voice of a demon? It did not take me long to discover that it was my own voice, the voice of my superego guiding my dream like a pilot with nerves of steel, it was the super-I driving a refrigerated truck down the middle of a road engulfed in flames, while the id groaned and rambled on in a vaguely Mycenaean jargon. My ego, of course, was sleeping. Sleeping and toiling.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 27, 2021","Oct 31, 2021","Oct 27, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63031.By_Night_in_Chile

And yet, Kink Stories aims to do exactly that: examine what torments people as they search for intimacy.An exploration of kink is in many ways an exploration of psychology. It is also an interrogation of the cultural narratives about gender, race, class and power. This is not a book about sex, although parts of it are sexy. It’s unlikely that it will shock or tantalize an adult reader. What this anthology does well is provide examples of problematic and complex relationships that use kink as a tool in communicating desire.Kink Stories is for the kinksters with imperfect relationships. I think it’s comforting to find that you are not alone in second-guessing yourself and your desires. There is fellowship to be found in reading about others who question the emotional dynamics of kink. There’s the woman who cannot get enough of things she does not need. Her desires are insatiable because needs, like fire, cannot be met. They only grow when fed. Then, there is the person who feels the tension between his rich shame and his defiant pleasure, not knowing which will win. There’s the woman willing to trust and fall in love only because another person was willing to use a crop, whip and knotted red rope on her. Or the husband who hopes that his wife’s desires are like a short trip into a foreign land, but from which they both come back to a cosy, normal life in which they take care of each other, without an expectation of kink. Or the person who was relieved when they no longer looked like themselves – or, rather, when they looked exactly like themselves for the first time. Or the couple who invited a third lover into their lives, only to push him away after he fell in love with both of them.The stories do not dig too deeply into any type of kink, and, inevitably perhaps, some work better than others. The strength of the book is that it opens up space between a wide range of binaries and invites compassionate reflection on non-normative desires....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 03, 2021","Oct 11, 2021","Oct 03, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54304256-kink

Stevens wrote that appreciation for At Night All Blood Is Black will depend on whether you agree with the Shakespearean idea that in a mad world, the madman is best equipped to diagnose our deepest illnesses. David Diop takes two absurd illnesses of our times - war and racism – and tells the tale of a Senegalese soldier’s descent into madness while fighting for the French during World War I.Deciding who exactly is the enemy for this soldier is complicated. The Germans clearly are, but then so are the French and more generally all colonizers. Alfa Ndiaye is also an enemy of himself, hating his humanity, his inner voice of duty, and his innocent sense of morality. When reality has lost all sense of reason, he embraces brutality, revenge, twisted justifications, and an absurd sense of devotion to a more-than-brother who took too long to die. He understands that on the battlefield everyone needs to embrace madness in order to survive. Some become madmen of rage, others become madmen of pain, others madmen of fury. But it is expected that these are all temporary states of madness that are striped off after the fighting ends. Continuous madmen are not tolerated: “madness, after the captain blows the whistle to retreat, is taboo.” Up to a point, brutality and rage are the things that make up a war hero, but after that point is passed the soldier becomes a bloodthirsty savage, a madman, someone to avoid and lock away.At Night All Blood is Black is the confession, and also the testimony, of an experience of war, where race and colonialism are added to the mix. Alfa Ndiaye, tells us in his own unreliable voice, how he turned into a madman with an obsessive sense of purpose. Once he abandoned norms of civility all that is left is a heart wrenching howl of innocence destroyed. Some readers may find this novel hard to digest. You get no moral clarity, no heroes and no villains. Instead you get ambiguity, stories hidden beneath other stories, and plenty of inscrutable violence. If you can stomach that, I suggest you give this book a try.

It is vague, it avoids accountability.”Half of the characters in Consent have to make decisions that directly affect other characters who, for different reasons, cannot say what should happen to their bodies. It’s a story about four women, two pair of sisters, and their knotty relationships. The cause of almost all of their problems turns out to be a man. The forms of consent explored are wide, covering issues such as: the ability of people with mental disabilities to consent to sex & marriage, medical decisions for people with locked-in syndrome who still have consciousness, accountability when drunk or drugged, consent when caring for dependent family members, power imbalances in professor/student and photographer/model relationships, bdsm, and informed consent for practices with irreversible consequences. I love books with moral ambiguities. But I don’t love when a character’s irrationality and compulsiveness are linked to her bdsm practices. Or when a man’s abusive behaviour is connected with his kinky desires. Or when each time kink is mentioned it’s tied with some form of pathology. I’ve rolled my eyes on more occasions than Sara (one of the four sisters) acted on one of her unhinged obsessions.In the late 19th century, Krafft-Ebing, Freud, and others used to conflate bdsm practices with violence, insanity, childhood trauma, addictions and compulsions. They did it so often, and with such zeal, that you’d imagine it was their favourite kink. But researchers today assure us that kinksters are no more likely to be mentally disturbed, have addictions, compulsions, or seek riskier experiences than a typical vanilla person. Violence and unhinged behaviours are not caused by kinkiness. A quick search on Google scholar tells us that what sets kinksters apart from non-kinksters are their curiosity, lower neuroticism, higher secure attachment, & less sensitivity to rejection. All of that is still correlation, not causation btw. I wish Lyon would have learned more about bdsm before writing this novel. I would have given her all the stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 13, 2021","Jul 17, 2021","Jul 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52539553-consent

Edie, a young black woman, is an artist with an avoidant attachment to painting. She works a low paying job at an all-white publishing house where she is both hypervisible and invisible. She is anxiously attached to Eric, a middle aged white man in an open marriage. From a distance he seems intriguing, self-aware, and capable of engaging in quality conversation. But, in his most honest form he’s a self-absorbed dude, unaware of his privileges. He basically wants some sex on the side, but won’t commit or assume responsibility for his actions. He is lonely and aware of becoming irrelevant. His body is deteriorating and he’s angry at how much he has failed in life. He occasionally and irresponsibly engages in light sexual power-play and emotional domination. The power imbalance is like a potent drug for Eddie. She reluctantly desires that place of limbo between his emotional disinterest and sexual expertise. She risks getting hurt by engaging seriously with someone who engages theoretically.His wife, Rebecca, is efficient, reserved and calm. She is also vulnerable and insecure about her marriage. She begrudgingly agrees to her husband going on dates, as long as these remain casual. She has a list of ever changing rules, which her husband predictably breaks. They have an adopted teenage daughter, Akila. She is one of the only black kids in the neighborhood and no one knows how to help her do her hair. Eventually, the plot moves Edie into their home. Here her connection with Eric becomes less interesting. As the relationship progresses his interests are reduced to receiving nudes and having sex. In contrast, the kinship between the women grows in complexity and nuance. Sometimes they show compassion and care for each other. Other times, they are cynical and cruel. At all times, they acknowledge and honor the unquenchable human desire to be seen and affirmed by at least another pair of eyes.Leilani’s writing is an artistic feat. She has achieved an unapologetic, funny and sharp portrayal of a young black woman navigating sexual politics, racism, couple privilege, corporate life, and art. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 11, 2021","Jun 17, 2021","Jun 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51541496-luster

In the first A self-absorbed, ordinary man of retirement age tells us two very different narratives about who he is, who he was, and who he might be. In the first narrative, he paints a believable portrayal of himself as an easy going, typical middle class educated man. Based on this story, we form an opinion of him as a respectful, ordinary and peaceable man. He is unambitious and pretty apathetic, but he’s ok. And, in many ways, he’s relatable. He is still friends with his ex-wife, has a good enough relationship with his grown daughter and listens to Dvořák. Basically, according to his first account he’s a decent guy whose company you’d probably enjoy. But then, revelations completely reshape the plot, revealing a second narrative. In hindsight, Toni is forced to re-evaluate his positive self-image, and I was compelled to re-read the book, in light of what I found out at the end. The clues were all there, but like Toni, I couldn’t see them, except in retrospect. It becomes clear that Toni didn’t have a clear view of himself, so I didn’t have a clear view of Toni. He is an unreliable narrator, but his dishonesty seemed so honest that I fell for it. Toni seemed as surprised as I was that his memory played such tricks on him. But is Toni ever believable? Toni obsessively contemplates the (in)accuracies of his recollections and the effects of time on truth. He has no choice but to admit that what he ended up remembering is not the same as what he had witnessed. Part of it has to do with Toni’s complexity. While, he can be respectful and gentle and a good conversationalist and brilliant story teller, he can also be bitter, revengeful, manipulative and extremely nasty to people he cares about. You might wonder if Toni experienced any transformative changes after he came face to face with his nastiness. Well, [spoiler alert] no, he hasn’t. It’s fair to say that he’ll continue to be both the decent guy and the a$$hole he always was. But it’s likely that you’ll relate to him more than you’d like to admit, and forgive him because that makes it easier to forgive yourself.

In his vision of a perfect sexual dynamic, he is the slave of a selfish and attractive woman. His desires find release in her need to be the absolute focus of admiring attention. His yearning to please her grows as her intense sensitivity to slights exacerbates. His love for her turns to obsession when her natural impulses drive her to focus on her needs, while ignoring his. She constructs dominance hierarchies based on beauty, athleticism, intelligence, wealth, and social status–all things where he is lacking. She admires people above her and devalues those below her. She is a narcissist par excellence and his most intoxicating fantasy is to completely submit to her will. She uses him for her pleasure and when she inevitably grows bored she discards him like a piece of garbage. Pain and humiliation are the cost of his pleasure. He wants to be disposable, and it hurts like hell to be treated as disposable. In that unique head space where his biggest desires intersect with his biggest fears is where he finds bliss. After all, what else do you expect from a sexual and emotional masochist?As far as fantasies go, Masoch’s masochistic tale, although pioneering in its revelations in late 1800s, is, by my standards, pretty mild. My guess is that Venus in Furs will not scandalize, but rather bore, readers who know a little bit about literary explorations of sexual fantasies.My problem with this work is not about its perversions; it’s about its philosophy. Masoch, unfortunately, uses (mild) kink and BDSM dynamics to draw sweeping conclusions about human nature. In his view – possibly arrived at during various stages of frustrated submissive heterosexual arousal - women (yes, all of them) fall in love with selfish men who dominate them physically and emotionally. So, what about those nice guys™, who, if given the change, would treat women (all of them, for sure) as goddesses? Well, according to Masoch, women toy with nice guys ™ and toss them aside once they tire of playing.I can appreciate the literary value of the work, but philosophies that give fuel to incel narratives are a hard limit for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 19, 2021","May 22, 2021","May 19, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/427354.Venus_in_Furs

Mariana’s writing is not going to set the mood for leisurely relaxation. Instead, this book will pull you into a world of realistic horror, urban madness, and spooky curses. There is an oppressive atmosphere on every page, but the horror isn’t exactly visceral. It’s more of an ambiguous dread. Each story is narrated by different women, and none of them are okay. In their voices you can hear desperation, rivalry, passion, revenge, envy, and madness. If any of this sounds delightful, you’ll have a lot of fun with this collection of stories.

When I look at it from a fault-finding angle, it seems that Baker wrote a tremendously silly and pretentions smut. When I approach it from an angle of open curiosity, I see a thought-provoking analysis about the limits of morality, consent, kinky desires and the contextual relevance for the criteria we use to evaluate harmful sexual behaviours. Baker is an attentive writer. He identifies shades of desire, consent, harm and beauty. He can write filth that somehow feels artsy.This book is written as an autobiography. The protagonist, Arno, is a good-natured, sensitive and morally confused voyeur with the power to pause time. Although he could put his gift to useful intellectual uses, he settles for undressing women. He tries to convince his readers that his actions are ethical, because he is not harming anyone when he admires naked women who are frozen in time and will have no recollection of his actions. The typical rules of morality do not apply in a different time dimension, he says. Arno admits that he is dishonest and exploitative, but because he is careful not to physically or emotionally harm anyone, he thinks he’s a decent guy.A layer of complexity is given by the way Arno looks at women. By the act of gazing during paused time he plays out the gendered power difference that reflects the patriarchy. He is the gazer, aware, and in full capacity and the women being gazed upon are helpless objects, unaware and frozen in time. The sexual and aesthetic pleasure he gets is the very definition of the male gaze. The women are completely passive and for a limited time Arno is an active viewer with absolute power. Only Arno’s gaze does not fit into a stereotypical misogynistic box. He is an equal opportunity voyeur, loving the bodies of women of all ages and shapes. Arno does not stop with undressing a body; he imagines detailed female stories and experiences in a surprisingly tender way.Even if all of his tolerant voyeuristic perversions flourish and expire in a timeless space, he hasn’t convinced me that he’s not a sexual predator. But, he has kept me curious and interested in trying to understand him....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 26, 2021","Jun 04, 2021","Apr 12, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12455144-the-fermata

In most cases the stories move to an entirely different narrative and remain only loosely connected to the brief catalogue of lost things.Schalansky excels in vivid descriptions of scenes and works of art. She paints detailed melancholic pictures with words about places, objects, and creatures that the world will never see again. She uses the notion that everything comes to an end to comment on a broad range of topics including the silencing of lesbian love poems and letters from most of history, Schalansky’s childhood in East Germany, Armand Schulthess’s obsessive plans to lure women into his home where he staked multiple handmade books about sexuality, and the fictionalized inner speech of an aging Greta Garbo worried about the loss of her Hollywood fame.In a way this is a book that creates space for mourning the things that are missing. It is also a meditation about the echo of absent things that found its way to us, and the human compulsion to preserve the past.Schalansky plays with styles of writing switching from the concise sentences and brief paragraphs of The Love Songs of Sappho, to the grim disparaging soliloquy of The Boy in Blue, to the meticulous account of the scenery of Greifswald Harbour, and the animal consciousness of Caspian Tiger. No two essays are alike in style or mood.The idea for the book is fascinating, the writing beautiful and atmospheric, and the historical research that has gone into it is commendable. I really wanted to like this book and can see its merits but truth be told it bored me. The cover is gorgeous though. ­­...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 04, 2021","Jun 08, 2021","Apr 12, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53739633-an-inventory-of-losses

In his nonfiction novel “Are the limits of our understanding of mathematical and physical sciences also the limits to our understanding of the world? In his nonfiction novel “When We Cease to Understand the World” Benjamín Labatut takes us on a short, intense and uneven journey into the dark side of science.Scientists like de Broglie, Einstein, Göring, Grothendieck, Haber, Heisenberg, Mochizuki, Scheele, Schrödinger, Schwarzschild, Turing and others made discoveries that bettered human existence. But they also led the way to horrendous suffering.For example, Haber’s discovery of how to extract nitrogen from the air saved the word from famine. He was also part of the team who created Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide that was used to kill millions of Jews.Schwarzschild provided mathematical evidence for the existence of black holes. He also calculated the most efficient trajectories for the poison gas used by the German army during World War I.The search for the Theory of Everything and the scientific struggles between Schrödinger and Heisenberg led to the birth of quantum mechanics, which gave us the internet, our smartphones and also the nuclear bomb.The strokes of discovery are often inexorably tied to insanity, obsession and isolation. The lives of extraordinary people are rarely simple. One of Labatut’s themes is how scientific discovery happens. He envisions thought processes and circumstances that lead to epiphanies, using available historical information and filling the gaps with his own imagination.Fluctuating between fiction and non-fiction, Labatut achieves a book that resembles a dystopian novel. Part historical, part eerie mystery this book is a disturbing and gripping story about the scientists who expanded the boundaries of our world. Some of them continued to discover equations and principles which not even they completely understood, tantalizing us with mind-bending discoveries but also warning us of the human propensity for self-destruction.The narrative is not always even, but I enjoyed this a lot....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 22, 2021","May 26, 2021","Apr 12, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55219981-when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world

Packed with neuroscience, peer-ed research, case studies and gut-wrenching stories of surviving trauma the book explains how trauma floods the body with stress hormones which lead to harmful physiological changes in people’s bodies and brains. Prolonged stress impacts mental and physical health, affecting relationships, employment, education, and enjoyment of life. Trauma primes people to be on constant high-alert, their bodies prepared for a fight or flight response. The parts of the brain that evolved to spot danger remain activated and any small sign of possible danger triggers an acute stress response and overwhelming emotions and physical sensations. These post-traumatic responses make in nearly impossible for survivors of trauma to meaningfully connect with others. Yet, healing from trauma means learning to re-connect with people. The author argues that any trauma treatment needs to help people integrate their traumatic experiences within their overall life memories. In short, with the help of therapy, a traumatic event is slowly transformed from an experience that is constantly relived in the present into a bad memory that no longer makes the body go into a fight or flight response. The book is written in a fairly accessible style, with some technical sections and a lot of human stories. It is an emotionally intense read and a treasure of helpful and science-based information. I thought that some of the treatment suggestions were a bit silly (for example pretending that the couch is one of your main caregivers, and the flower vase another main caregiver, and move them around the room to project your inner world into a three dimensional space), but they are backed by research and do work with some people. If the subject of trauma is of interest, I highly recommend you give this book a try....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 04, 2021","Apr 11, 2021","Apr 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score

The backdrop is Sofia, with its quirky cafés, beautiful parks, claustrophobic streets and filthy crumbling gray buildings. The language of the prose reminds me of journal entries, which the narrator, an American teacher and gay man, uses to write down his private thoughts in a detailed, but unfinished manner, with long paragraphs - at times longer than one page - and hypnotic language building up to a near climax only to retreat and repeat the process. Each chapter feels like the intimate confession of a nameless man about anonymous characters who had a lasting impact on him. But the style of writing also keeps the reader at arm’s length. The narrator invites you in his most intimate spaces, only to push you away - mirroring the tensions between his sexual fantasy of dominance and submission as BDSM play and the true powerlessness he desired. The writing about sex is explicit, precise, graphic, artistic and sensual, mapping both the physicality of the act and the complicated needs of the characters. The descriptions of the loss of love are graceful and raw, painful and tender, and the atmosphere of disquiet in modern day Sofia reveal what it means to seek connections with the place we inhabit and with those around us. The nine stories are free-standing. Together they make up a non-chronological but tightly symmetric novel, where eight stories reflect each other in thematic opposites about teacher-student mentorship, sadomasochistic sexual encounters, hopes and disappointments about Bulgarian politics, and the power and vulnerability of falling in and out of love.

The tetralogy, which reads like a single story spanning over five decades, is narrated by Elena, who is - as all the women in Ferrante’s books are - shaped by her surroundings, especially by the violent patriarchal culture which she both interiorizes and resists. By describing her own life, Elena also documents the history of the late 20th century Italy: class divisions, violence, mafia power, accumulated wealth as the ultimate marker of emancipation, conflicts between communists and fascists, protests and rallies, the good intentions of the left-wing educated upper class and the dire reality of the working class struggling to survive. Ferrante does not shy away from delving into the most intimate thoughts and feelings of her protagonists. She describes their conflicting desires, shame, ambitions, resentment, jealousy, envy, intellectual competition, self-destruction, revenge, and self-doubt in such a passionate and visceral way that you feel immersed inside the thoughts of the brilliant women she writes about. Elena and Lila feel the tensions between being daughters and having daughters, being wives and staying independent, being inseparable best friends, and pulling away to define themselves as distinct and original. I have enjoyed these books tremendously. The story is compelling and the writing is beautiful: a mix between mater-of-fact descriptions and thought provoking metaphors and symbols. Parts of the narrative sometimes stretches out more than necessary, but overall this is a brilliant read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Mar 05, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/26828169-the-neapolitan-novels

After meeting an extraordinaryRay Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 presents a dystopian world where books were outlawed and firemen were hired to burn them. After meeting an extraordinary young woman, one fireman began to question the values and norms of the book-burning society, risking his life in the process. The book was written in the early 1950s. At that time, America was under political repression and there was censorship of art and literature created by McCarthyism. Also, black and white TVs became more affordable and Bradbury was concerned that people would soon replace reading and critical thinking with easy entertainment. In the novel, people voted for political parties that would keep them amused and entertained, rather than informed and critically engaged. In the author’s imagination it was this desire for things to be easy and fun that eventually made reading books illegal. And Fahrenheit 451 was the temperature at which knowledge burned. The book is certainly influential and has many merits. On a critical note, I thought that parts of it were moralizing and preachy and the dialogue was a bit clumsy. For me, the novel was not a page-turner. Neither was it an incendiary read. However, it is a book rich in beautiful symbolism, full of memorable imagery and many important warnings. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 04, 2021","Mar 10, 2021","Mar 04, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451

The reason is that in the copy I own, the first 38 pages are not from Bel Canto, but from Happiness (TM), a satire about consumerist culture by Will Ferguson. It also kills me that I don’t know how Happiness (TM) ends (this sadistic bookbinding error is brutal!). At the bottom of p.38 there’s a tongue-in-cheek observation about Jenni who felt the flow of the universe directing her towards fortune cookies. As I was becoming emotionally attached to Jenni’s story, without my consent, p.39 pushed me into Bel Canto’s suspenseful plot with these words: “armed man behind him.” For the rest of the book I had constant anxiety the narrative would jump back, mid-sentence, to Happiness (TM), which wouldn’t have made me happy at all.Bel Canto is loosely based on the historical hostage situation known as Lima Crisis. Patchett is a good writer, but here she romanticizes a life-threatening situation. All hostages develop Stockholm Syndrome. There are some flashes of violence, as you would expect, but most of the book consists of long tender passages about love, tenderness, and a bit too much about opera singing. Without exception, everyone in Bel Canto is obsessed with the opera singer at the centre of the plot. We are told that she sings as if “she was saving the life of every person in the room.” I wish I was more impressed by this.A few quotes:“He believed that life, true life, was something that was stored in music. True life was kept safe in the lines of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin while you went out in the world and met the obligations required of you. Certainly he knew (though did not completely understand) that opera wasn't for everyone, but for everyone he hoped there was something. The records he cherished, the rare opportunities to see a live performance, those were the marks by which he gauged his ability to love.”“It was too much work to remember things you might not have again, and so one by one they opened up their hands and let them go.”“Maybe there would be a bad outcome for some of the others, but no one was going to shoot a soprano.”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 14, 2021","Sep 25, 2021","Mar 01, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

Also, they were basically all hypocrites. Virtually none of them practiced what they preached, which isn’t to say that their preaching was faultless.The book has a couple of pages dedicated to each philosopher, and after the part about their disastrous encounter with love, there’s a quote which points to their arrogance or hypocrisy, or the irony of the situation. If you read this book, you’ll learn some fun, terrifying and gag-inducing facts:-Abelard had his penis cut off by his father-in-law as revenge for getting his daughter pregnant. She was tutored by Abelard, who was twice her age.-Althusser strangled his wife to death, but he swore it was an accident; he was only trying to massage the front of her neck.-Camus divorced his first wife after he learned that she had sex with her doctor in exchange for morphine. He was averse to drug use.-Descartes had sex only one time in his life, and as bad luck would have it, he got the woman pregnant.-Engels pretended to be the father of Marx’s illegitimate son, to save Marx's marriage. He revealed the truth on his deathbed.- Rousseau, who publicly championed conventional moral codes, was in fact a flasher and had a spanking fetish.-Beauvoir and Sartre legally adopted their lovers to insure the sanctity of their literary legacies.This book isn’t meant to be taken serious.

In the 1950s America, light skinned twins Stella and Desiree disapThe Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett is a story about the dilemmas of racial passing. In the 1950s America, light skinned twins Stella and Desiree disappeared from Mallard, a fictional town where light skin became norm, value and measure of perfection. The town was more of an idea than a place, and that idea became too constricting for the twins’ hopes and dreams. They set out in search of a better life. Stella, abandoned her sister and disappeared once again to become white. Desiree married the darkest man she could find and, after leaving him, returned to Mallard. The novel explores the notions of reinvention, erasure, and the performances of race and gender. For example, Therese, after being bullied by their family and community, became Reese. He tried to save money for his top surgery. On weekends, Barry became Bianca. Jude, the dark skinned bookish daughter of Desiree, failing to lighten her skin, reinvented herself in intellectual ways. Kennedy, the golden-haired self-absorbed daughter of Stella constantly ran away from herself, hiding behind her performances as an aspiring actress. The book is narrated with compassion and has great insights about the roles people play throughout their lives. Bennett doesn’t delve into the psychology of the characters and sometimes it feels as if they are reduced to the performances they played: the reserved twin, the vivacious twin, the loyal boyfriend, the abandoned mother, the egocentric daughter, and the introverted bookish daughter - to name just a few. Also, some of the coincidences in the book seemed a little bit stretched. Overall, I really liked this book. I especially enjoyed its exploration of the things we sacrifice to escape the parts of us that we do not accept, and the price we pay when we decide to be who we are....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 26, 2021","Mar 04, 2021","Feb 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

His novel Crash is a stylized and clinical dissection of cars and human bodies into units of pain and desire. Ballard’s world “flowers into wounds”, and vehicles are systems of eroticism, waiting to inflict punishment on human bodies. The horror of death and the love of spectacle are inextricably linked into an unholy union. Car crash victims sit in damaged cars like deities occupying a shrine. The language is calm and ruthless, describing blood, contorted bodies, semen, vehicle design and highways. It’s reads like a porn novel about technology. It’s repetitive, flat and it lacks human depth. Sequences of cars crashing are arousing to the fetishists who inhabit Ballard’s denatured landscapes. Each collision sets off a shudder of excitement: “in the complex variations of crushed radiator grilles, in the grotesque overhang of an instrument panel forced into to a driver’s crotch as if in some calibrated act of machine fellatio.” The novel looks at modern life: speed, drama, aggression, advertising, engineering, mass production, paradises of electric highways and the “shared experience of moving together through an elaborately signaled landscape.” People possessing a natural curiosity for the perverse follow car crashes with their cameras and zooming lens, observing and recording every detail of auto-deaths. Some of them go further and begin to fantasize and visualize the deaths and injuries they fear most – those involving their lovers or themselves. Reading this novel is like watching short unrelated clips of crushed machines, dead people, stalker-sadists with cameras and thousands of drivers with their auto lights blazing. It is written with the purpose to unsettle and disturb. Once you are inside the story, there is no place to hide. Ballard will provoke you by saying that car crashes are really a union of sex, human bodies and technology, and if you truly feared crashes you would be unable to ever drive a car. But if you are still driving your car, Ballard will try to convince you that on some level the idea of a crash excites you.I rate it a 3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 15, 2022","Jun 19, 2022","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/70241.Crash

Impurity, cruelty, abuse, error, excrement, semen - there’s no other way to be here. Nothing to do with disobedience. Nothing to do with grace or salvation or redemption. It’s in everyone. Indwelling. Inherent. Defining. The stain that is there before its mark.”The Human Stain presents academia as a ground for hypocrisy. The ever tolerant and open-minded community of scholars forced their classics professor and Dean, Coleman Silk, to an early retirement because he, innocently, but damagingly, called two students who missed class “spooks”. He was (wrongly) accused of racism. His career and reputation were ruined. His wife died shortly after. He began an affair with Faunia Farley - an illiterate cleaning woman half his age - and his former colleagues assumed he was taking advantage of her vulnerabilities. He liked her because she wasn’t religious, or sanctimonious, or deformed by the American fairy-tale of purity. He became estranged from his adult children.The demon of Roth’s tale was the purity binge of 1998. Silk’s scandal is set against President’s Clinton impeachment hearings. That was the summer when the cock sucking of a virile middle aged president by a smitten twenty-one year old employee “revived America’s oldest communal passion, historically perhaps its most treacherous and subversive pleasure: the ecstasy of sanctimony.” The righteousness mania creeped up and people’s smallness became crushing clear. They blamed, punished, and moralized. When the demon of purity “had been unleashed in the nation … people wondered ‘Why are we so crazy?’”The country reacted with lascivious consternation to the Clinton scandal. The academics responded with prurient agitation to the socially inappropriate actions of Silk. In the summer when the president’s penis was on everyone’s mind, Silk’s life with its shameless human stains, confounded his colleagues, and his children, who were obsessed with purity....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 27, 2021","Jan 09, 2022","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11734.The_Human_Stain

But then, Roth is an author who’s built an entire career by exasperating readers. When I think of Sabbath, I think of a raging 64 year old former puppeteer who seduces twenty year old women, alienates everyone who’s ever loved him, snickers at any form of respectability, sniffs the stolen panties of teenage girls, and either masturbates or urinates on his late mistress’ grave. Sabbath is what you get if you take a nice guy and squeeze all decency out of him drop by drop, with aggravating persistence. To compensate, Roth gave him generous amounts of sexual perversions and a propensity for speaking in delightful literary sentences. Roth also created one of my favorite characters ever, the unapologetic Drenka, who is Sabbath’s equal in every depravity imaginable. If wickedness was all there was to Sabbath, this book wouldn’t be the masterpiece that it is. Assuming that one of the aims of literature is to teach empathy, with Sabbath your capacity for understanding will be greatly tested. The moment you start to admire something about him, he’ll spit in your face. He’ll do something so awful and deliberately shocking that your tolerance for him will be pushed to its limits. When you are ready to give up on him, he will surprise you with his humanity and tenderness. Sabbath is fragile, isolated, lonely and in near constant physical pain. Imagining him alone, by the sea, taking stock of his life, mourning his mother, brother, first wife and latest mistress, and contemplating suicide while holding his late brother’s belongings, it’s hard not to feel for him. But you’ll regret it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 20, 2021","Aug 04, 2021","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11654.Sabbath_s_Theater

The noveJonathan Coe’s Middle England is a compassionate and utterly funny story about the effects of Brexit on a few families living inside England. The novel looks at the the world of mass-media, academia, politics, and English geography, to address the rise of populism, political correctness, privilege, discrimination, class, race and gender. Political tensions and opposing ideologies create plenty of opportunities for knotty conversations and hilarity during funerals, dinners, academic conferences, and children’s parties with rival clownsThe older people, who voted Conservative in every election, complain about the very things that their grandchildren love most about progressive politics. Middle aged people are mostly good-natured centrists, nostalgic about the passing of time and baffled by the young people’s outraged and uncompromising views on inequality and racism. Different family members witness the same events – the London Riots of 2011, the 2012 Olympics, key speeches by Prime Minister David Cameron, the Referendum, the murder of Jo Cox, Nigel Farage’s “Breaking Point” poster – but their interpretations and conclusions are miles apart. With a few exceptions – the conspiracy theorist believing in a plot for white genocide comes to mind - most characters are decent people, although sometimes misguided, doing their best to navigate complex political realities, misplaced hatred, unhappy marriages, impossible loves, and missed opportunities without losing their ability to laugh at themselves. This is not a very nuanced book; it’s about as wholesome as a favourite high-carb comfort food, and just as enjoyable. The main problem I had with it is that, although it includes a few minor characters who got the short end of the stick, most discussions are from the points of view of the socially privileged who were not seriously affected by Brexit.This novel is the third book in the Rotters’ Club series, and several central characters appeared in the other two books. Middle England can be read on its own, but it will take a bit to figure out who’s who in the large number of characters who appear right from the start. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 16, 2021","Mar 25, 2021","Feb 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40175320-middle-england

What does it take to be treated as fully human? Some of the The book takes the idea of human value and asks what the defining feature of humanity is. What does it take to be treated as fully human? Some of the answers include: originality, social function, the ability to form meaningful connections and falling in love. Much of the plot questions the extent to which originality sits at the heart of being a human. Of course an extreme preoccupation with originality completely ignores the fact that all of us are mix of what we inherited and what we acquired. Taken apart, human desires, questions, ideas, preferences, needs, decisions, and even art, are not as original as we would like to pretend. But taken as a whole, everyone is unique. When you have a society that values originality, narratives about copies, un-originals, and imitators become a powerful strategy to portray people as “less than” and justify using them for the benefit of the originals. The idea of a “copy” pushes on our anxieties and discomfort when our individuality feels threatened. Calling someone a “copy” creates an emotional distance that allows for their oppression and ultimately their instrumentalization. A copy is only valuable in terms of the function it provides for the original. Ishiguro writes critically against this idea of originality. In his book, the human copies – the word “clone” is never used - have unique personalities. They are completely human even if they were modeled after an “original”, and raised as organ donors. On an interesting side note, as another reader of the book pointed out, Ishiguro, in an interview, even extended the idea of originality to translations. When you don’t stop to question it, you’d assume that a translation is not an original text. It’s a copy in another language, right? Ishiguro disagrees. For him a translation is basically a conversation with the original text, not a copy of it, and a good translation, he says, is as valuable as the primary text. In Never Let Me Go, the attempts to portray copied people as less than human are unsuccessful, because people’s uniqueness has a way of squeezing out of the limits the originals impose on them. But that does not save them, since their social value is tied to them being spare parts that they “donate” to save the lives of the originals who occupy a privileged position. In Ishiguro’s dystopian society the donors’ value is their biology and their ability to be good carers for other donors before becoming donors themselves. Art has a special place in the book. Creativity is one way to measure someone’s humanity, because if someone can produce something: a poem, a drawing or a painting, that act of creation gives evidence that there is something deeper inside them. However, at the end, art and creativity did not change the oppressive system. Their only role was to give a voice to people who were on a journey of self-discovery which, heartbreakingly, led to nowhere. Never Let Me Go mirrors the common human experience, but in a magnified way. The characters have short lives, most of them “complete” – a euphemism for dying - before middle age. So, they live briefly under the shadow of death. As they are always outside the nuclear family, their only way to forge connections is to claim community. When they were engaged in relationships they discovered the most about themselves, their desires, needs, fears and anxieties. It was relationships that helped them escape isolation. I thought it was a brilliant move to have one of the copied humans as narrator, because from the start there is a relationship between the story teller and the reader, and that relationship confers agency and freedom to a narrator that is otherwise kept silent in a society that wants to ignore her uniqueness, and only value her for her organs. The role of love is different here than in other sci-fi novels. In dystopias such as Nineteen Eighty-Four or Brave New World, love at least has the potential to become a subversive force that destabilizes an oppressive system. In Never Let Me Go love fails to change anything. Love does not mobilize. Love is like a drug that dulls the senses – like a narcotic, a literature critic wrote – that functions to help donors accept their fate with dignified passivity. And I’m still thinking about that. The plot and the book’s title stand as examples that despite the fact that the characters wanted to be truly seen, none of them were completely understood by the others. Each of them was stuck in their own interpretative repertoire. Each interpreted the experiences of others through a glass darkly. They desired to be understood, and yet, the book suggests that they never were – a conclusion that rings sad but true. I give it a 4/5 rating (the characters’ passivity wasn’t entirely credible to me, but maybe that’s just my bias speaking here). ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 12, 2021","Nov 19, 2021","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go

All of his life he had the typical attitude of a repressed man. He was joylessly self-righteous about everything. He was moody and he bullied people. After retirement he began to suffer from Parkinson's and developed some early symptoms of dementia.Her problem was that “she had to tell him, while she still had time, how wrong he’d been and how right she’d been. How wrong not to love her more, how wrong not to cherish her and have sex at every opportunity, how wrong not to trust her financial instincts, how wrong to have spent so much time at work and so little with the children, how wrong to have been so negative, how wrong to have been gloomy, how wrong to have run away from life, how wrong to have said no, again and again, instead of yes: she had to tell him all of this, every single day.” She was passive aggressive, perhaps neurotic, and definitely delusional. Throughout her life she set her heart on various plans which she pursued obsessively. Her latest dream plan was to have “one last Christmas” with her three grown children. They left the family’s Midwestern nest long ago to form their own dysfunctional relationships.In The Corrections each character is on the verge of a self-inflicted catastrophe.

Bancroft, who worked many years as a counselor for abusive people, argues that abuse stems from value systems and beliefs, and has little to do with someone’s psychology, mental health or external influences such as work stress or a bad day. Unfortunately, culturally and socially, men are raised with toxic messages about entitlement, control and ownership. Even a progressive and self-aware man is exposed to these messages which, if they are interiorized, are the main cause of physical violence or emotional cruelty in relationships. Bancroft dispels many of the common myths about abusive people. For example, some of the things which do not cause someone to act in abusive ways are: alcohol use problems, mental illness, difficulties in expressing emotions, a rough and abusive childhood, attachment issues or a relationship with someone that “pushes sensitive buttons.” Fundamentally, an abusive person believes that their emotions and needs entitle them to hurt someone they do not respect. Bancroft stresses that an abusive person lacks the respect and understanding necessary to honor a partner’s emotions, needs and overall health. The book provides many strategies and resources for people living with an abusive partner or dating someone who they suspect might turn abusive. The author is firm in his multiple criticisms of abusive people, reserving his empathy and gentleness only for the abused. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 19, 2020","May 27, 2020","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/224552.Why_Does_He_Do_That_Inside_the_Minds_of_Angry_and_Controlling_Men

A group of social psychologists joined a cult who prophesied that the end of the world was only a few months away: on December 21st, 1954. The social psychologists were interested in documenting the kind of things that the cult members would say and do when confronted with their unfulfilled prediction. It turns out that, although the disconfirmation of the prophecy determined some members of the group to abandon their faith, the convictions of others were strengthened. Instead of admitting their error, some believers adjusted their perception of reality, and their faith in the cult’s teachings and doctrines became much stronger after the failed prophecy - as was their eagerness to proselytize.

ThClementine Ford’s book Boys Will Be Boys argues that aggression and feelings of entitlement and superiority are not innate characteristics of boys. The point that Ford makes is that there are specific social conditions that encourage a significant number of men to abuse their privilege and power at the expense of women. One of the central points of the book is that toxic masculinity and patriarchy create a harmful and limited idea of what boyhood is. Ford uses some statistics, numerous examples from media about rape, sexual assault, #metoo, and feminist theories to highlight the problems women face and argue against persistent myths about what it means culturally to be a boy, and the effects this has on both men and women. The tone of the book is less academic and more on the side of a frustrated rant peppered with sweary, aggressive and sarcastic language - which works really well for a book that aims to rally feminists, feminist allies, and social justice warriors and encourage them to work even harder to dismantle a patriarchal system....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2021,"Jan 03, 2021","Feb 26, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40737717-boys-will-be-boys

Blind and meaningless chance seems to me so much more congenial - or at least less horrible. Prove to me that there is a God and I will really begin to despair.” Peter De Vries's novel, The Blood of the Lamb is semi-autobiographical. It chronicles the life of Don Wanderhop, a man questioning the religious doctrines of his Calvinist immigrant family living in Chicago in the 1950s. The story is mainly about death, grief and loss. De Vries covers these topics with a powerful mix of fury, wit, love and humor. He also uses the plot to deliver a sustained attack on religious belief. There are many scenes in the book that are absolutely hilarious, but the humor comes with a raw punch, as this smart and funny man is dealt some terrible blows in his life. Somehow, along the way, Wanderhop remains witty, and finds ways to keep laughing, even in the face of devastating tragedy. But his sharp satire is intertwined with raw grief and wild rage at the absurdity of life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 22, 2020","Mar 27, 2020","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/259789.The_Blood_of_the_Lamb

The rest of the novel is about the effects of that gruesome event on his surviving family. The main character is Harriet, the tough twelve year old who is almost destroyed by her desire to avenge her brother’s murder.Tartt is a queen of gothic style mystery and suspense. She presents a portrait of family life in the American South. In a pace that reminded me of a slow-burning surreal nightmare, she lingers over the family members’ different ways of coping with grief, solitude, family misunderstandings, obsessions, hostilities, every-day racism, white pretentiousness, pointless grudges, and the moral confusion over the unsolved murder.This novel is very different in tone and aesthetics from Tartt’s first novel, The Secret History. Here, Tartt presents violence in a raw, heavy, unstylish, and ultimately bleak manner. There is no beauty or elegance to the cruelty of The Little Friend. The violence is not poetic, there is no elitist airs or glamorization of the act of killing. Instead, the dark mood feels claustrophobic, and the violence is gory and repugnant. The inner lives of her characters and the never ending ramifications of misery, guilt, and revenge are masterfully done.If you like atmospheric novels and find satisfaction in exploring morally flawed characters - and you don’t become too frustrated if you don’t get closure - then you’ll love this. If you need a novel to tighten up all lose ends and give you clear answers, then it would be better for you to pick up The Secret History, instead. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 06, 2021","May 19, 2021","Feb 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/775346.The_Little_Friend

I was too young to have any of the tools needed to think critically about its message. At that time, I thought everything about O was disturbing and therefore hot. I’ve re-read it as an adult and, well… I’ll begin by saying that I am well aware of the perils of the dark corners of erotic desires. But, I still feel the seductive pull of brutality and the beauty that can be found in something repulsive. The Story of O is the erotic tale of a woman who desired to become the sexual slave of her lover. As his property, she entered willingly into a world where men had absolute power over women. It’s like walking into Margaret Atwood’s Gilead, but with the important difference that the women here are not trapped. They consented to their submission. And one of them is telling us her story. In the most elegant language you can imagine, Pauline Réage describes the most extreme sexual situations. The work is meant as fantasy, and if you find it arousing, it’ll be safer for you, and your sex life, to try to remain on the side of the author, rather than identify with its main protagonist. In this book you will find all of the usual items of the BDSM porn repository: the isolated château, whips, chains, masks, luxurious furniture, extravagant fireplaces, hot women and rich men. You cannot take the plot seriously. Please, don’t take the plot seriously. Susan Sontag said that it is possible to read it as a meta-pornography, a parody of extreme lust written in dignified language. Réage did not simply write about a woman who was reduced to a sexual object. She wrote about the intense emotions, contradictions and complex motives of a woman who wanted to be reduced to an object. To put it differently, Réage explored the idea of actively pursuing a passive role. The woman in the story, named O, after the void she so desired, was clearly masochistic. She knew exactly what she wanted, and that was to get to the point where she no longer had any wants. O desired to experience the pain and fear of becoming a blank. She transcended herself when she emptied her personality. She ascended by degrading and humiliating herself. She became perfect by becoming nothing. Her progress was always tied to her extinction. I think the Story of O is a tragedy of a woman’s downward journey to self-fulfillment. Similar to Françoise from Simone de Beauvoir’s She Came to Stay - a woman who existed within the confines of other people’s perceptions of her - O also lived as an object bound within the limits of the male gaze. Unlike Françoise, who stood up for herself and gained a painful form of freedom, O stood up for nothing and crawled towards a painful form of happiness. Can you see the beauty in that? Can you see the horror? I don’t know how to rate this book, except with my heart. And my heart is conflicted. That’s why I’m giving it 5/5.

The loosely-connected episodes oAfter the US-Mexico War, the Catholic Church strived to reinstall its authority in the neglected areas of its empire. The loosely-connected episodes of Death Comes for the Archbishop centre on a titular cleric and his vicar general’s missionary struggles to expand the reach of Catholicism, promote the goals of the US Government in New Mexico, and create fruitful, artistically intricate and visually orgasmic gardens: “The rays of the sinking sun illuminate the orange, oleander, and ilex trees with a ruddiness as of much-multiplied candlelight.” The book is saturated with Christian symbolism, Christian hagiography and a romanticized version of the Christianization of a culturally & ethnically diverse people. In the not so wise words of Father Latour “The Church can do more than the Fort to make these poor Mexicans good Americans. And it is for the people’s good; there is no other way in which they can better their conditions.” The forced integration of formerly Mexican regions and the consequences on the native people are merely alluded to as normal consequences of development. The narrative fails to criticize the Church’s complicity in the political events of the 1850s. The bishop and his vicar general viewed Mexican people as either “poor creatures” in need of pious guidance or as lazy and selfish. The Indigenous people were seen as exotic beings, whose culture was out of reach, “like crustaceans in their armour.” Father Latour lamented that he may “never separate them from their own beliefs.” But, that didn’t stop him from trying. There are few women in the book and their representation is problematic. The good women are Catholic, compliant and chaste. Any sexuality that they may have is contained by their daily devotions, old age, or voluntary chastity. The one not-so-good woman is educated, French, refined, and vain. The most nuanced aspect here is the intense friendship and the emotional intimacy between the two Fathers. The book is purposefully chaste. But, I was getting some gay vibes and imagined the possibility of erotic overtones. In Wila Cather’s words, “whatever is felt upon the page without being specifically named there-that, one might say, is created.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Apr 2022,"Apr 02, 2022","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/545951.Death_Comes_for_the_Archbishop

It relates two slowly merging stories told in alternate chapters. One is the coming of age of fifteen-year-old runaway Kafka Tamura who tries to escape both his past and his future, and the other is the slow decline of sixty-year-old Satoru Nakata who can’t remember his past or plan his future.Murakami's protagonists are reserved – at times almost aloof - but they radiate a good-heartedness that wins them crucial friendships with humans and, most importantly, cats. There is a lot of unrealness going on in this book. Murakami presents the absurd in such a matter-of-fact tone that it renders it at least sincere, if not entirely credible. There are also many mundane happenings that have a surreal quality to them. The simple acts of eating (nutritiously), walking (a lot), driving (a great deal), reading (abundantly) and having (consensually ambiguous) sex have laminated meanings. There are numerous symbolisms that can be read into them.The language is straightforward and simple, almost to the point of flatness. Strangely enough it works. Murakami’s style resembles the minimalist fiction of the 1960s and 1970s. The writing is devoid of flowery descriptions, without lacking emotional complexities, similar in style to minimalist writers such as John Barth or Raymond Carver. Murakami dives into the intricate emotions of main characters, their development and the multi-layered relationships between them.What lingers after finishing the novel is a particular mood, which I cannot quite decide if it’s a drowsy uncanniness or a soothing quietness. What I am certain of is that Murakami’s prose is bewitchingly addictive and I want to read more of his work.The only problem for me is Murakami’s portrayal of women. They are reduced to plot devices for the self-discovery of male characters. Instead of independent and thought-provoking humans, women are a bit too passive and too willing to provide emotional comfort, sex, help and support for male protagonists going through periods of existential crises....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 12, 2021","Apr 22, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore

It spans 4000 years of attempts by powerful men to stay-on-top by regulating status threatening sexual desires and practices. It starts in ancient Mesopotamia, with the Code of Hammurabi, and gropes its way up towards modernity, finishing with the trial of Oscar Wilde. Because the book was written by a lawyer-cum-journalist its focus is on court cases. This could have led to a painfully dry reading, but Berkowitz, being the cunning linguist that he is, generously lubricates the narrative with plenty of humor.Legal collections from Western law provide a surprisingly enlarged arena of opportunity for colorful examples about the mercurial passions of sex legislation. Berkowitz makes a penetrating argument for the link between property laws and sex. He shows how the thrust of Athenian sex law was to ensure that men would leave their property to legitimate sons. Women were owned by men and in almost every court case they got the short end of the stick. In ancient societies women were even punished for being raped. The history of punishing sex is not smoothly straddled but full of bumpy inconsistencies. In Babylon women were forced to be temple prostitutes, in ancient Rome prostitutes were not allowed to enter temples, and in 17th century France, religious groups collected alms from their congregations to revamp their brothels - just because the church damned prostitutes to hell wasn’t going to stop church leaders from making a profit from sex work. Adultery laws, male bonding church ceremonies, lesbian executions, and various laws against people who did not conform to the sexual norms of the day show that sexual practices remain the same. The difference is whether society punished you for them or not. One notable improvement is that, as a direct result of a bottom-up opposition from women, LGBTQ+ people and other minorities, Western sex laws are slowly moving away from protecting those in power to protecting the vulnerable. If you like flesh-and-blood historical cases – some flesh, a whole lotta blood - this is a book you’ll enjoy getting down with.

She’s the mad woman locked by Rochester in his attic. In Brönte’s book, Rochester told Jane that Bertha’s nature was “the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw.” And he meant that in a bad way. Bertha is portrayed in a totally unsympathetic way; it’s as if her character was written with the sole purpose of adding dramatic tension to the novel. I think Brönte assumed that all of her readers will want Jane to find happiness with Rochester, and look at Bertha, his West-Indian born wife, as an intrusion to the couple’s happiness and a barrier to their marriage. But, Jean Rhys couldn’t accept that narrative. When Rhys read Jane Eyre, she noticed that almost everything we know about Bertha comes from Rochester’s descriptions of her. She began to pay more attention to the things that were not said in the novel about Bertha and wrote Wide Sargasso Sea to fill in the gaps. She explored the history of the madwoman in Rochester’s attic. Like Jane, Bertha (birth name: Antoinette) had a wildness that could not be tamed by society’s norms for women. Neither woman conformed to the Victorian expectations of docility and subservience. However, unlike Jane, Antoinette’s unbridled personality brought about her own destruction. She was a woman torn between two cultures. She was never a slave, she was white, but still considered Caribbean and shunned by Europeans. Rochester was fascinated by her at first, but ultimately he could not accept her resistance to classification. He took away her money and identity, and decided that she must be monstrous. He even changed her name, as English men commonly did when they married Caribbean women. In her brilliant feminist response, Rhys ignored his name throughout her novel, and refused his imposed image of Bertha. Rhys gave her a voice, and altered the portrayal of her husband and abuser. In WSS, Bertha is not a mad woman in a dark attic. She is Antoinette: a lively young woman, with free will and independent thoughts. In her story, Rochester is the real monster....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 29, 2023","Feb 07, 2023","Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27829509-wide-sargasso-sea

The narrative explores what it’s like to live in post-9/11 America as a Muslim. Akhtar looks at the contradictions and ambivalences of belonging and estrangement of people shaped and socially defined by Islam in a culture that not only lacks understanding, but is also suspicious of them. Akhtar - the author, main character, and narrator of the novel - is neither a practicing nor a believing Muslim. Born in the 70s, on Staten Island to immigrant parents, Akhtar feels like an American, but also like an outsider. His politics were shaped by his liberal arts education. In a nation where debt and money influence every aspect of people’s lives, he tries to experience the American dream. He observes and closely comments on his journey from near poverty to a member of a sophisticated cultural elite living a privileged life. Although Akhtar feels a little out of place among the rich and famous, he does enjoy the financial and sexual opportunities that his own fame as a writer opened up to him. His father, an important part of Akhtar’s life, is an enthusiastic American patriot and - much to Akhtar’s frustration - a Trump supporter. His most special memory seems to be the time he spent as Trump’s heart doctor. Akhtar’s mother, also a doctor, has never really fitted in and is often nostalgic about Pakistan. The contradictions of being an American are explored through other notable characters such as Akhtar’s hedge fund operating buddy, his girlfriend, a university teacher, and an array of Muslim relatives. Although the novel largely follows a chronological timeline, each chapter is structured as a personal essay illustrating a different facet of what an American-Muslim identity entails. I found the novel fascinating, entertaining, raw, ambitious, thought-provoking and memorable. I highly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 20, 2021","Feb 05, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50358133-homeland-elegies

His wide variety of sources and the amount of historical minutiae are commendable. The problem is that I’m not sure how reliable his work is. For instance, Hieronymus Bosch’s painting, “Ship of Fools”, left an impression on Foucault, who wrote about a medieval tradition of putting the mad on ships and sending them away across the seas and canals of Europe. He described the great entertainment sane people had when the foreign lunatics docked at their harbors. As fascinating as that sounds, it didn’t happen. The painting is symbolic and the ship was inspired by an allegory written either by Sebastian Brant in 1493 or Guillaume de Deguileville in 1486. Given Foucault fertile imagination, his work needs to be read with a grain of salt. Nonetheless, it’s interesting to learn about how the concept of madness changed throughout history, from the inability to cope with horrors, to a consequence of immorality, weakness of character, excess of passion, and the result of an overactive imagination. Classical medical theories assumed that women were especially prone to madness. Women who read too much fiction were at the highest risk, followed by those who liked to sleep late in the morning, and finally, those who dreamed of freedom. With those criteria, it’s no surprise that so many women were considered mad.The ways madness was treated also changed. Mad people were ignored, exposed for entertainment, put to forced labor, locked away in chains and cages, and finally placed into asylums under the supervision of psychiatric doctors. Foucault stressed that none of those solutions worked. I think he wanted to convince readers of Madness & Civilization to become suspicious and critical of social institutions. If you’re curious to see if he succeeded, you’ll have to read the book :) ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 28, 2021","Apr 04, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51933.Madness_and_Civilization

The sex which one catches unawares and questions, and which, restrained and loquacious at the same time, endlessly replies. One day a certain mechanism, which was so elfin-like that it could make itself invisible, captured this sex and, in a game that combined pleasure with compulsion, and consent with inquisition, made it tell the truth about itself and others as well.”Do you get it? Yeah, me neither. So, after reading the volumes on The History of Sexuality, I came to the conclusion that Foucault might have been a cool thinker, but he wasn’t a cool writer. He used complex language to make too many incomprehensible points - a four volumes worth of them. He often didn’t bother to define his terms and he complicated his arguments unnecessarily. As a reader you’re left in confusion and you need to overuse your imagination to understand what he wanted to say. And he did this A LOT. However, ambiguous prose and badly expressed arguments have one huge advantage: they are super hard to argue against. Who knows, maybe Foucault wanted to protect his work from criticism by making it impenetrable. At times, his abstruse writing is so bad that it becomes meaningless. According to Open Culture, Foucault told his friend John Searle that he complicated his writings on purpose and turned some of it into, and I quote, “incomprehensible nonsense” so that he would be taken seriously by French philosophers. And it’s not a matter of jargon - because with jargon if you’re familiar with the field of science you get it. With Foucault you have to do your own interpretation, and come up with your own meaning, because otherwise it makes no sense. If you’re a postmodernist, you’ll love it. It’s like you’re (re)writing the text yourself. But if you want your reading material to be a bit more scholarly, Foucault’s History of Sexuality will frustrate you. Oh, and you want to know another irritating thing? The few times Foucault mentioned women in his text, he exclusively focused on their hysterical tendencies.

In 1785 he began drafting the hefty plot of The 120 Days of Sodom and blended the fetishes into the main narrative. De Sade wrote in secrecy while imprisoned in the Bastille, and today we only have a draft of his novel. The first chapter is nearly finished and the other three are briefly sketched. But, the material is enough to form an opinion.De Sade tried to do several things. He wrote about the dark side of humans and the natural consequences of absolute power. The book is an example of what a human mind can imagine, and how far a writer can take stories of violence. Four libertines - a duke, a bishop, a judge and a financier - abduct a group of young people and torture them to death in a remote castle. He gave absolute power to royalty, religion, the law and the economy over vulnerable people (mostly children), and set the stage for extreme level of abuse. De Sade introduced into the plot four older women to act as story tellers of unusual sexual experiences. He turned his libertines into an active audience, re-enacting the stories they heard. Maybe Sade hoped to tempt readers into imagining what it would be like to participate in similar activities. But, De Sade did not have Nabokov’s genius in seducing readers into accepting a pedophile and child molester. De Sade’s writing is about as subtle as a guillotine. You’d probably hate his four libertines, and I assume (hope) you’d disapprove of much that goes on in the novel. De Sade aimed to take his readers on a brutal ride. He liked the violent abusers he imagined and admired their thirst for rape, murder, torture, pedophilia, and disemboweling. The experience of reading this book is not that much different from putting yourself through a session of forced orgasms. You’re in it for the pain, but if it goes on for too long, you become completely desensitized and by the time you reach the end, on page 373, you are numb, exhausted, and bored.De Sade’s novel also illustrates the diversity of human sexual desires. He serves readers, similar to the way various food plates are served during a banquet, 600 sexual possibilities. As Aggrawal observed, sexual arousal, like allergies, can occur from anything under the sun, including the sun (if you don’t believe me, just google actirasty). De Sade pointed out, rightly, that a catalog of desires separate from the body of a story is monotonous. He wanted to blend the thrill of porn with the much drier taxonomy of paraphilias. Although, I admire de Sade for his contribution to our knowledge of unusual sexual practices, he hasn’t really done what he’s promised. He did cover quite a bit of ground. Depending on what you’re like, you can find examples that will disturb, disgust, shock, bore, or warm you and your deviant heart. But the number 600 is misleading. There are only a few dozen passions that repeat themselves, growing more extreme as the plot advances. After finishing the book, I was left with the impression that, as far as the diversity of human desires goes, de Sade wrote mostly about variations of coprophilia (especially coprophagia) and pygophilia. I am genuinely impressed with the amount of detail de Sade used to describe hundreds of buttholes....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 19, 2022","Jan 26, 2022","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6351885-the-120-days-of-sodom

In theory, if consensual and not harmful to anyone involved, any behaviour should be fine. In practice, harm is subjective, and given how varied and wide-ranging the triggers of human desire and lust are, Bering wrestles - and not always successfully - with how ethical and legal boundaries can be set in order to protect both the erotic outliers and their potential partners. For example, there are important distinctions between those who have foot fetishism (aroused by feet and toes), or melissophilia (a lust for bees), or titillagnia (climaxing from ticking), or objectophilia (such as the woman in a relationship with her flag, Libby), or normophilia (a desire for consenting adults in socially approved ways), or pedophilia (aroused by minors). Some structures of desire, if acted upon, can cause irreparable harm - for instance a pedophile who turns into a child molester, or a masochist who voluntarily undergoes through progressively more excessive forms of amputation. With a few exceptions, however, Bering argues that the majority of sexual deviancies are harmless when acted upon consensually. Moreover, perversions are not really a choice as research shows that sexual proclivities become fixed in early childhood. The patterns that our desires take, who or what we are attracted to and the kinds of things we fantasize about are not in our control.In a sympathetic, but jokey manner, Bering’s writing entertains and informs even if he only scratches the surface of his subject.

Stanley Milgram’s Obedience to Authority is a social psychological account of how humans have a tendency to follow orders regardless of consequences. In a series of experiments carried out at Yale University, Milgram has challenged common sense perceptions about free will and morality. He has shown that in certain experimental conditions study participants - the “teachers” - administered increasingly powerful and painful electric shocks on an innocent person - the “learner”. Although the “learner” was not harmed during the experiments - he was an actor, and did not actually receive any electric shocks - the book is a troubling account of how far regular people will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which they are ordered by an authority figure to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim.Milgram’s motivation for setting up and carrying out these experiments was to understand the psychological factors that made the Holocaust possible. The inhumane policies that systematically murdered millions of people may have originated primarily in the mind of one person, but they could not have been implemented at such a massive scale unless a large number of people obeyed orders. While conservative philosophers routinely argue that the fabric of society needs obedience in order to survive, Milgram suggests that obedience can be dangerous, as it is a “dispositional cement” that binds men to systems of political purposes, which - as history stands witness - can be harmful for some groups of people. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 10, 2020","Jun 23, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/676723.Obedience_to_Authority

But on closer examination the exact point where one wishes to return might not actually be there, because, as Julian Barnes reminds us, what we end up remembering isn’t the same as what actually happened.In The Way We Never Were, Stephanie Coontz examines the nostalgia many Americans apparently have to return to family values that never existed. Ok, they may have existed a little bit, but not in a way that anyone today would be nostalgic about. Coontz has looked at pretty much all available historical data about families and family values and based on mounting evidence she concluded that (spoiler alert): families of the past were not at all idyllic and families of the present are not, by comparison, more dysfunctional. In other words, the past wasn’t that good and the present isn’t that bad. When I say it, it does not sound terribly optimistic, but Coontz manages to keep things hopeful. She actually strikes me as a bit of an idealist. By the time I was half way through the book, I was thinking that any argument that uses the expression “family values” is moralizing rather than mobilizing, not to mention that it’s based on myths about what families were like throughout history. Coontz, however, adopts an optimistic middle ground, where she doesn’t completely abandon the value of family values but broadens it to include community values and meaningful social network values that go beyond the ideas many of us have about traditional family borders.Overall, this is a rich scholarly text that unravels mythical conceits about love, parenting, the gendered division of labour, attitudes about family privacy, family rights, sexual practices and relationship types. A side benefit is that it could help some people give up on nostalgia for a type of family that most likely never was, while making us (and by “us” I mean “me”) feel better about our own imperfect families or intimate network of meaningful relationships.

The booJohann Hari argues that depression and anxiety are often reactive responses to life experiences, rather than innate brain chemical imbalances. The book is part memoir as Hari chronicles his battle with depression since early adolescence. For most of his teenage years and early adulthood he took antidepressants, which generally had a modest effect on improving his life. As an adult, with a background in journalism and social science, Hari began to rigurously investigate the flaws of his treatment, traveling the world to talk with an impressive number of scientists, psychologists, and people suffering from depression and anxiety and ing the scientific literature on the causes and treatment of depression. A large part of the book deals with reactive depression, which according to scientific consensus, is caused by the cumulative effects of things such as: childhood trauma, loneliness, lost connections to community, meaningful friends, and family; the loss of a sense of hope for the future; loss of love or a painful breakup; and a general lack of fulfillment. The more negative and painful experiences someone has had, the more likely it will be for them to feel depressed and anxious. Although, to his credit, Hari does not advocate for a complete halt of prescribing antidepressants, he is critical of the research practices of the pharmaceutical industry, which routinely push for chemical treatments for both endogenous and reactive forms of depression. Moreover, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on average, are not very effective, and more research is needed if people are to receive better treatment. The book uses an evidence-based investigative approach. Hari is meticulous in his methods and the book is less self-help and more medical literature. However, the language is accessible and the stories of the people Hari traveled across the globe to interview are fascinating, insightful and moving. Broadly, the conclusion of the book is that people need to find ways to reconnect to others and form meaningful and compassionate connections with friends, lovers, family and community - a conclusion I firmly stand behind....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 18, 2020","Jan 20, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34921573-lost-connections

But, not Philip Zimbardo. He built an entire career asking what makes Social scientists usually stay away from moral concepts like “good” and “evil”. But, not Philip Zimbardo. He built an entire career asking what makes good people turn evil. Zimbardo is the author of the classic Stanford Prison Experiment. He was also one of the expert witnesses in the trial of a US serviceman who took part in the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib in 2003. The gist of The Lucifer Effect–which offers a detailed analysis of SPE and the Abu Ghraib abuses-is that good people can become evil when placed in stressful or unusual circumstances. So, clearly, good and evil are interchangeable. Given the right setting (or wrong-depending on how you look at it), anyone can act cruelly. Instead of talking about “bad apples” we should be talking about the “bad barrel”. Cool, right? I thought so, too. In fact, Zimbardo used to be one of my favourite social psychologists. I read all of his publications, watched his TED talks, and read his blog entries with the ardour of the uninitiated. And then, my grad school methodology professor knocked the stuffing right out of me. Turns out that the seminal SPE (have you seen the movie?) was not peer-ed, it has biased and incomplete data, and its methods, procedures and validity are not great. The problem is that Zimbardo’s study presents humans as naturally conforming to an oppressive authority. When you look at his data, what it shows is that the students participating in his study were really eager to please him. There is no evidence in SPE for the hidden darkness of the human soul, or its submissiveness. Sorry.You’d think that once the debunking of Zimbardo’s research was published–in a peer- journal, may I add–the scientific truth has triumphed. But nope. It was like closing the barn door after the horse has run off, Le Texier (the truth-bearer & author), grimly observed. I guess people fell in love with the message that we are all susceptible to the lure of the dark side. And the message isn’t the problem. There are plenty of historical data to provide evidence for it. It’s just that the experimental data isn’t there. It would be so much simpler if it were. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/359194.The_Lucifer_Effect

Wollstonecraft argued against the dominant male thinkers of her times and in many ways laid the foundation of feminist thinking. In a cynical and forceful tone she criticized women’s education and the social conditions that forced women into adopting values such as delicacy, sensibility, and beauty rather than firmness, resilience and reason. She believed that gender roles were socially constructed and not mandated by god. She hated the idea and practice of female manners and the social roles designated to women - including marriage which she memorably referred to as “legal prostitution”. Wollstonecraft vehemently insisted that women were not inferior to men in intellect and that they should receive the same education as men. I think this is an important read for people interested in the history of feminist thought. The writing is direct, brutally critical of patriarchy and personal. Her impressive vocabulary might make a few passages more difficult to understand, but overall the language is clear and precise. As a reader, I could not help but admire Wollstonecraft’s fearlessness in fighting for women’s rights at a time when they had virtually no legal or political visibility....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/224387.A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman

Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason and everything that Sartre wrote were listed on the Index. Hitler's Mein Kampf, however, was not included, which should be argument enough to question the methodology used to identify “dangerous” books.One can certainly see how Simone de Beauvoir’s work scandalized the conservatives of her time. She wrote passionately against the status quo. She argued that one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. And becoming a woman is difficult because history, psychoanalysis, biology and literature paint women with the mythical colors of femininity, hindering their ability to become and exist as free humans.Using existentialism as a conceptual frame, Beauvoir drew from biology, psychoanalysis, ethnology, anthropology, philosophy, economics, mythology and folklore, tracing the history of women’s secondary position from the age of hunter-gatherers to the middle of the 20th century. Beauvoir was highly critical of how social institutions - including marriage and motherhood - limit women’s freedom in a patriarchal society. The work is quite pessimistic. It also reflects the shortcomings of second wave feminism. To get the most out of it, one needs read it in context. When it was published, French women had been able to vote for less than 5 years and birth control was not yet legal. Also, although Beauvoir examined some of the differences and similarities between working class women, Jewish women, Black women and white middle class women, her work is not intersectional in the way that the concept is understood today....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/457264.The_Second_Sex

By using some impeccable research skills, Perez presents an impressive array of case studies and empirical investigations to show all the ways in which women are excluded from society and made invisible. For example, women are often not included in research samples - such as drug trials - because their hormones would complicate the research testing. Also, many things - including safety belts in cars - are poorly designed for people who grew breasts. Due to the fact that society is ignoring the physiological, cultural and power differences that exist between people, women end up with: prescription drugs that were not tested for women’s bodies, cars designed in such a way that makes women almost half more likely to die or be seriously injured in cases of accidents, and countless hours of unpaid or undervalued work. Perez compellingly argues that there is a pervasive gender gap in our knowledge, which leads to systemic discrimination of women, putting them at multiple risks. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 29, 2020","Dec 27, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41104077-invisible-women

Psyche was a beautiful princess worshiped by men as a goddess. This awakened the wrath of In the 160s AD Apuleius wrote the tale of Cupid and Psyche. Psyche was a beautiful princess worshiped by men as a goddess. This awakened the wrath of Venus, who plotted her destruction. But, her son Cupid fell in love with Psyche and protected her. Psyche became his prisoner and lover. She was forbidden to look at him and they only met in the dark. One night Psyche sneaked up to look at Cupid while he was asleep. She broke his trust and he abandoned her. Wretched and desolate she became Venus’ slave. After being forced to perform a series of impossible tasks, she was left unconscious. The God of Love, moved by her suffering, came to the rescue. Jupiter transformed Psyche into a goddess and Cupid married her.This myth is the source of CS Lewis’ novel. He reworked it into an allegory for the Christian faith. He kept the structure of the myth intact but changed the motivations of characters. We have the POV of Orual, Psyche’s ugly sister. What Orual lacked in beauty she made up in intelligence and toughness. She fought men, gods, and social restrictions against women. She rode horses, led armies and outsmarted enemies. Orual was fiercely rational. Her sister Psyche was romantic. Psyche accepted suffering with faithful resignation. She submitted to the will of gods. Psyche’s beauty and unexamined faith connected her to the gods. Orual questioned everything and raged against all injustices, including the face veil that covered her ugliness.TWHF is about religious surrender. Lewis believed that myths immerse rational readers, like Orual, into an imaginative dream-state where they can choose to be like Psyche, with her implausible beliefs. Finally, Orual surrendered. She was physically weak, unveiled, naked and with a foggy mind. Between life and death, in complete vulnerability, and without her strength of intellect, she trusted the gods and became as beautiful as Psyche in soul and face. Lewis stops the story here. He has to, because we all know Orual would not remain irrational for long. A strong, intelligent woman like her would eventually question all of Lewis’ premises and either burn that face veil or wear it with pride for reasons of her own....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17343.Till_We_Have_Faces

The plot chronic“All is vanity, nothing is fair.” William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair is a satire of English society in the early 19th century. The plot chronicles the adventures of two women who could not be more different. One the one hand, there is Becky Sharp: an ambitious and unscrupulous woman who uses her wit and smartness to raise in status and wealth. On the other hand, there is Amelia Sedley, the kind hearted, naïve and pampered daughter of a wealthy and influential family. The backdrop of Thackeray’s novel is the moral universe of Pilgrim’s Progress: a vanity fair where sinners are doomed to live with the pain and misery of their own choices. Nonetheless, in this novel without a hero, Thackeray does not adopt Bunyan’s stern moral stance, but instead paints a picture of relaxed amusement towards his characters’ sins. The author’s voice is frequently present on the book’s pages, and his sardonic observations, dripping with dry wit, make the novel greatly entertaining. One thing, however, that becomes evident to a modern reader is that Thackeray tends to save his sharper criticism for the women of vanity fair, without applying the same moral stick to his male characters. Also, when he directly talks to his perceived readers, it is clear that he addresses educated, wealthy and white males - people who own land, servants and wives. Overall, I thought that his characters were somewhat mere caricatures. The author does not leave much space for moral ambiguities and complexity, but rather prefers to have protagonists who remain the captives of entertaining satire and mockery....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5797.Vanity_Fair

We have no law but the single principle of mutual aid between individuals. We have no government but the single principle of free association. We have no states, no nations, no presidents, no premiers, no chiefs, no generals, no bosses, no bankers, no landlords, no wages, no charity, no police, no soldiers, no wars. Nor do we have much else. We are sharers, not owners. We are not prosperous. None of us is rich. None of us is powerful. If it is Anarres you want, if it is the future you seek, then I tell you that you must come to it with empty hands. You must come to it alone, and naked, as the child comes into the world, into his future, without any past, without any property, wholly dependent on other people for his life. You cannot take what you have not given, and you must give yourself. You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution.”Anarres society is non-authoritarian and anarchic. Urras is the exact opposite. It has states, military structures, industries and a consumerist culture. Urras has oceans, beautiful nature, and cute animals. Anarres has a lot of sand. Both are imperfect because aliens are fallible and so are their ideas. But, Le Guin roots for Anarres. The interesting part is that Le Guin makes a utopia and then reveals its problems. Cooperative living crushes individuality, tribalism is harmful, alien nature is territorial, and even with no laws, constrains will creep into your utopia, constantly threating to transform it into a dystopia. Anarres is not ideal, but it’s better than Urras which suffers from a clusterfuck of issues. Although, Le Guin’s intellectual alliance remains in Anarres, she suggests that unless a society constantly challenges the status quo, it regresses into an oppressive system.This is not an intense SF action book (what action?). It’s a meticulous book of ideas for those who enjoy dreamy reflections about systems of government, temporal physics, the control of information, freedom, individuality, community, and the tyranny of majority. I have to warn you: expect no final answer.

The book is written as a fictional confession of an annoying, restless, spiteful and lonely middle aged retired bureaucrat. His imagined audience is a group of educated “gentlemen”, whom he addresses throughout the narrative.In just a bit over 100 pages, Dostoyevsky produced a fascinating psychological analysis before psychology was even a thing. The existential angst of the Underground Man, his frustration with the Russian political climate of the 1860s, his lack of trust in the underlying rationality of people, his own conflicting, inconsistent and self-justifying attitudes, all set against the backdrop of a sordid, neglected, and negligent St. Petersburg still pack a punch today....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 05, 2021","Feb 09, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49455.Notes_from_Underground

It is a fictionalized account - written as a play - of the Salem Witch Trials from 1692. During the trials, 185 people (mostly women) were accused of witchcraft: 156 were charged and 19 were executed by hanging. Miller used this event as a metaphor for the mid 20th century government persecution of people suspected as being communists. The drama is a compelling portrait of a rigid and theocratic community where hysteria takes over, and the religious leaders, prosecutors and townspeople join forces in ruthlessly labeling people opposing the community norms and the theocratic policies as evil and less than human. This sets the stage for socially endorsed violence against those considered diabolical and deserving of cruel punishments. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 11, 2020","Dec 13, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17250.The_Crucible

In many ways GibsonWilliam Gibson’s Neuromancer is a classic cyberpunk, science fiction novel about the fall into a dystopian computer driven future. In many ways Gibson has influenced the ways in which both literature and film have dealt with the genre ever since the publication of the novel’s first edition in 1984. In his vision, the very notion of physical space has been transformed in a future governed by advanced technology. From the first page, the reader is thrown into this alternative universe and - in order to start making sense of the fast pacing plot - needs to figure out how the physical world is organized and how far the reaching capabilities of technology go. As a result, for people who are unfamiliar with Gibson’s writing style, the book can seem somewhat confusing and disorienting at first. The plot is simple and pretty typical: a computer hacker is rescued from death by an underground organization, who in return ask him to hack into the system of another organization. Above all this we find that the most powerful beings in Gibson’s universe are artificial intelligences, and unsurprisingly, the protagonist will try to subvert their plans for control. The novel’s power and lasting influence is not in its plot, but rather in the creation of transformed reality, space and vocabulary - such as the invented word cyberspace which is now firmly stored into our language, profoundly influencing the limits of our imaginings of possible dystopian futures....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6088007-neuromancer

The totalitarian order imagined by Atwood segregates people by categories based on their gender, occupation, caste and social function. Strict dress codes play a significant role in achieving social control.The major voice in the book, which is also the most nuanced, ambivalent, and brilliant belongs to Aunt Lydia. Her character is what gives the book depth and complexity. Aunt Lydia’s power comes from the secrets she patiently and ruthlessly collected over the years. With some impressive cunning skills she helps the resistance and along with the two courageous and resourceful young women risks everything in order to crush the patriarchy.The novel is structured like an action-packed spy thriller. It is a page-turner, but it is also somewhat predictable. The story telling is very different in tone from The Handmaid’s Tale. It feels like it’s written for a much younger audience, and it’s pretty obvious that it is a spin-off the television series. In The Testaments, Atwood sharply divides the good and the bad, resolves pretty much all conflicts and neatly ties up all of the loose ends. The novel does not have a sophisticated literary style, but the plot is dynamic and exciting. Although not as powerful as The Handmaid’s Tale, this book is an important read, if only for the fact that some of the harrowing events described feel real enough to become cautionary tales for us. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 30, 2020","Jan 15, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42975172-the-testaments

It is definitely historical fiction, but it is also a murder mystery, metafiction, theology, philosophy, and literary fiction. The Name of the Rose is basically a Sherlock Holmes detective story set in a 1327 Benedictine Italian Abby. There are as many theological debates as there are mysterious murders, and the two are luxuriantly interweaved as tensions and heresies thicken. The period novel both entertains and educates. The plot creates a bookishly labyrinthine about books, spinning around the work of Aristotle, Aquinas, Bacon, the book of Revelations and several other medieval texts. The contents of one book are used to decipher the meanings in other books as evidence is collected, secret symbols decrypted and mysterious texts decoded in order to solve the strange murders happening at night. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/119073.The_Name_of_the_Rose

She is shy, anxious, insecure, imaginative, an incurable romantic, a dreamer and a very sharp observer. She marries Max de Winter and becomes the mistress of the haunting Manderley. Her fears slowly grow, taking her close to paranoia, as she learns about the strange events that happened in that place, including sunken ships, murder and complex betrayals, all of which seem to be intricately tied to Max’s first wife - the charming and seemingly perfect Rebecca. As the plot progresses, the narrator’s passion and desire increase, but not for Max, but for her imaginings about what Rebecca was like: her slender body, the way her dresses swayed as she moved, how she walked in the garden carelessly stepping on petals of blood red azaleas, the way her lips looked covered in lipstick and how the subtle scent of her perfume lingered in the air. This is an interesting novel. I recommend it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 17, 2020","Oct 24, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/17899948-rebecca

The dystopian novel offers an image of a future where at night teen gangs take over, rebelling against society. Alex and his droogs are the perpetrators of ultra-violent crimes, and the novel includes lengthy and vivid descriptions of the gang’s enthusiastic rampages after dark. There are many horrors in this book, but there is also unexpected beauty. For example, Alex, the gang leader, is a cultured hooligan with a passion for Beethoven. The discrepancy between his tastes in music and art and his desires for violence make him an atypical anti-hero. Burgess narrates the story using language that echoes Shakespeare and the King James Bible, giving the text a poetic and liturgical feel. The protagonists speak a language that flows with made up words and words borrowed from the Russian language. The inventive slang has a Cockney rhythm to it, making the novel such an artistic achievement that it is likely to give any linguist a brain orgasm. The beauty of the text - which for the first few pages it takes the reader to get accustomed to it, seems almost gibberish - sharply contrasts with the repulsion one feels when reading about the horrific things done by the gang, and the sympathy invoked when bad things are done to Alex. These contrasts and the explorations of morality and free will make this an unforgettable and thought provoking novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,2,"May 18, 2023Dec 25, 2020","May 25, 2023Dec 31, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41817486-a-clockwork-orange

The book was published in the 19th century, but the setting of the story is the 17th century town of Boston. Hester becomes an archetype for a strong, independent woman with a critical mind, struggling to come to terms with her own sexuality in a patriarchal culture. Although presented as a romance, the novel’s genre is more of a psychological fiction. It is full of interesting religious symbolism and a complex and pretty nuanced analysis of sin, guilt, shame and legalism. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12296.The_Scarlet_Letter

This book has influenced our collective cultural imagination and gave rise to countless adaptations in literature, film and theater. One thing that makes Stoker’s monster stand out from the rest of the vampires of classic literature is that he is not the usual grotesquely dangerous dark being, but a dangerous dark being that emanates sexual energy. The novel is composed of a series of journal entries, telegrams, letters and newspaper clippings that begin by telling the misadventures of a young lawyer who goes to Transylvania in order to manage the affairs of the mysterious, intelligent and charmingly dangerous Count Dracula. Eventually, the Count creeps into England where he releases his undead curse among people - including some beautiful and innocent young women living in a seaside town.Stoker draws upon many folktales and myths, and mixes them with bits and pieces of scientific knowledge and insights from psychiatry that were popular in the 1890s - the novel was published in 1897. The story is not without shortcomings - what comes to mind is the fairly typical for its time patriarchal attitude regarding women’s place in society - but what makes it tick is its preoccupation with the darker nuances of Victorian sexuality. The novel taps into taboo masochistic sexual pleasures, and the prevailing feelings throughout the plot are the fascination, but also criticism, of female sexuality....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17245.Dracula

Emma Donoghue’s novel, Room, is told through the point of view of Jack, a lively and smart five years old boy living with his mother in a small room. As readers, we only know what Jack knows. We see that he lives happily within the limited confines of his world. He has a routine that makes him feel safe and secure. He sees his mother every second of every day and the objects of the room are not just objects, but named friends of Jack’s: Bed, Rug, Wall, Chair. As the story progresses, through bits of dialogue and eavesdropping, Jack reveals to readers the actual horror of the situation - a horror that escapes his understanding. I think that the brilliance of the novel lies precisely in that gap between what we grasp by listening to the young narrator’s voice and his own comprehension. Room is a safe haven for Jack, because his Ma has made it so for him. But for her, Room is a prison in which she is locked in against her will by an abusive man holding the key. For Jack, Room is the only world he had ever known. His mother, however, had to survive and adapt to a nightmare situation. This novel can be read from a plethora of angles. It can be seen as a psychological analysts, a political commentary or a sociological investigation. It is a story about a mother’s love for her son, but also a metaphor about the ways in which we live our lives in our confined and limited worlds. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/31685789-room

His entire life was propelled forward by his wants, which were as huge as his ego. The way things were always irked him. He even played his guitar upside down. But, he met Tricia’s mother and she managed to make a Catholic out of him. Eventually. First, he became a Lutheran priest, and then, after he got tired of grape juice, converted to Catholicism. He applied to Rome for a dispensation to become a married Catholic priest. They allowed him to keep his wife and children, and drink wine.The author is his daughter, Tricia, a contrarian who instead of growing towards heaven grew towards feminism. “I emerged from my own mother in the form of a tiny psychic covered with tits,” she says, and I instantly liked her. As the prodigal daughter, Tricia tended “the pigs of liberalism, agnosticism, poetry, fornication, cussing, salad-eating, and wanting to visit Europe.” But, after a medical emergency which set her and her husband back financially, they went to live temporarily with her parents. At first glance, it’s all light and innocent fun, but on a closer look Tricia is revealing some disturbing things. She laughs and teases, but what else could she do? She had no real power. Her father and other men like him were in charge of so much of her life. They could decide at any time that she had to cover her hair, wear skirts, pray separately from men, not read some books, or swallow some pills. “To have that bald dynamic of power on display in your home every day, pretending to arch over and protect you–it does something to a person.” At one point, women were compared to the ‘tabernacle of life’, “an ornamental box that is largely important for what it holds. It is shut up and locked when men go away, so the consecrated elements cannot be stolen.”Tricia is hilarious. She also carries more trauma than I’ve expected. She looked at her religious family and saw straight through their good intentions. She didn’t approve, but didn’t want to offend either. The result is that her memoir has brilliant insights, but her anger and pain are often watered down....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 15, 2022",Nov 2022,"Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31920820-priestdaddy

The first is about Makiko, a middle aged woman obsessing over her breasts. She works as a hostess in a dilapidated bar, and is painfully aware of how the job hierarchy – aka the amount of money earned – is dependent on the male gaze. Makiko decides to improve her life by improving her body. She visits her younger sister Natsuko in Tokyo to explore breast enhancement options.Makido’s teenage daughter, Midoriko, communicates with her family exclusively in writing. She is also concerned with her changing body and is disgusted by eggs and menstruation. A period is yet another trapping cycle for women, like motherhood and female poverty. Midoriko projects her hatred of her body on her mother, who is a constant reminder of the costs of living in a woman’s body.Natsuko, is a struggling writer and the narrator. Her voice is unsentimental, raw and brutal. She listens impassively to her sister and reflects on her niece. She observes the imperfect bodies around her with ferocious sharpness but struggles to describe her own. Hers is the only vaguely acknowledged body in the book. In the first section, Natsuko is part observer of her sister’s obsession with breasts and part chronicler of their abusive childhood.In the second section the narrative is more reflective and less tight. Natsuko goes on tangents about the literary world, body dysmorphia, illness, feminism, and the hardships of working-class women. What holds the narrative together is Natsuko’s concerns about the violence of bringing a human into the world. She cannot have sex, but she obsessively desires to have a child in a country where artificial insemination is forbidden to single women.Natsuko’s dreams are haunted by the idea that she will be responsible for creating a life that will go through pain and end in death. Giving birth is to place an unfair bet on someone else’s life. The person born has no door to go back to before birth.

The idea is interesting and the writing is excellent. The problem is with its framing. Ethan is a man stuck in an unhappy marriage. He falls in love with a young woman. The entire plot is seen through his eyes and I think we are supposed to be on his side. This is his side: he’s married to Zeena, a gaunt, sickly, wrinkled older woman with false teeth, and a whiny voice. She suffers from a chronic undiagnosed illness which can only be hysteria–the protean ailment for 19th century women who didn’t fit into the role of the gentle, refined ideal female. She drains his resources by going to expensive doctors. Ethan is struggling to maintain the farm and keep everything afloat, a difficult task given that money was scarce. Zeena is expert at using her illness to manipulate. She has an “evil energy” and wants control. According to Ethan, there is nothing in Zeena that could appeal to anyone. She is simply awful. Mattie, whose family died and left her in poverty, moves in as Zeena’s servant. She is pretty, full of life, young, healthy, and enthusiastic about every little thing. She rarely completes the tasks she is given, but she is so cute in her clumsiness that Ethan cannot help but fall in love with her. Mattie’s position is vulnerable, especially since Zeena dislikes her and plans to send her away. We are encouraged to root for Ethan and Mattie’s infidelity. A “smash-up” happens, where a stupid idea and some extremely unlucky circumstances bring retribution to everyone.I wish I could learn the women’s side of the story. I bet there’s more to Mattie than the silly pretty woman Ethan loved, and I am sure that Zeena’s not the villain Ethan wants her to be. I recommend it for those interested in symbolism in literature. The writing is good. In fact Cynthia Griffin Wolff even called it “a feast of words”. The book can also open up discussions about the conservative 19th century New England views of women. But, if you’re looking for literature that moves away from stereotypes about women, this isn’t it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 10, 2021","Sep 14, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5246.Ethan_Frome

Also, the only person I know who would think to give me this book, and hope I’d learn something from it, is my mother, and I don’t recall her doing so. Anyway, Apple Tree Yard is a psychological thriller and a court room drama about a scientist on trial for murder. Before this trial she was not only a respected geneticist, but also a relatively happy married woman and mother of two. What happened, you may wonder. Um, she had a hot love affair. I’ll summarize Doughty’s main teaching points – the book is a cautionary tale, after all - since I suspect the majority of you are not going to read this book: 1. If you are a woman, don’t have an affair, because “being the most respectable science professional or suburban mother counts for nothing set against one f**k in a doorway.” I mean look what happened to Yvonne. Her affair practically ruined her life. Everything changed for her. She might end up going to jail for murder!2. If you are a married man, and you have an affair, you’ll be fine. Sure, your wife won’t be happy and she might leave you, but your entire life and career won’t be ruined. At least not as long as Louise Doughty writes the plot. Yvonne’s husband, Guy, also had an affair, but he wasn’t the one to end up on a murder trial. 3. If you are a man and you assault and rape women, the legal system is on your side. However, you’re going to pay in ways you didn’t even imagine. Things will not end well for you. 4. Friendly, ordinary men can be more dangerous than hot strangers you meet after dark. 5. Regardless of your gender, it’s much safer to stick to book affairs than love affairs. Don’t cheat, because that one event might divide your life into a before and an after that you won’t like.Rating: I didn’t exactly hate it, but I had much to complain about (3/5)....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 25, 2021","Oct 03, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17452179-apple-tree-yard

Classical Persian literature along with forbidden works of Western Literature - Nabokov, AuThis is a memoir about reading as an act of transgression. Classical Persian literature along with forbidden works of Western Literature - Nabokov, Austen, Fitzgerald, James and others - were read, discussed and critiqued by seven students of literature living in Tehran during the 1990s. They were all women. Every Thursday morning they re-created a sanctuary, a self-contained universe squeezed into one room in their teacher’s house. That was a place where they were free to keep or shed their mandatory black robes and head scarves. Imagine the pause before each young woman enters the room. Then picture the closing of the door that functioned to momentarily block out the tyranny of time and politics. Most of the women took off their robes and scarfs, shook their heads from side to side and burst into colour. A few kept their head coverings. But that was not the point. The important thing was the freedom to become distinct through personal choice, whether that was colour, hair length, fashion style or modest coverings. Each woman gained an inimitable shape, a unique expression of individuality. The work of literature that most resonated with their lives under an Islamic religious fundamentalist hold was Lolita. Despite Humbert’s attempts to erase the real Lolita, and replace her with his own perverted image of her, we can still glimpse her voice and her story if we pay close attention. She was a girl who used to enjoy ordinary instances of life – which really are extraordinary when you think about it – listening to music, reading, sunbathing, dancing and falling in love. Then, she was robbed of her childhood. Her past, her voice, and even her name, were taken away from her. The women secretly reading Lolita in Tehran understood all too well what it feels like to have regular life confiscated and driven underground. And their teacher, Azar Nafisi, wants readers to really see the women behind the veils: they never became what the cultural purists of their day tried to will them into becoming. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 14, 2020","Feb 22, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7603.Reading_Lolita_in_Tehran

The narrator, who hides behind the pseudonym Humbert, is a pedophile and a sexual predator. But he doesn’t see himself in this light - and he gets to write the story. In his mind he is a tragic lover seduced by young Lolita. He uses all of his wit and charm to seduce his readers into accepting his version of events. A quick glance at some of the s on goodreads shows that he did manage to deceive quite a few readers. A careful reading, though, exposes the cracks in Humbert’s narrative about how Lolita cunningly manipulated him into having sex with her and how she coldheartedly used him for his money.There are many examples of conflict between Humbert’s general presentation of events and details that slip through which put his sincerity and innocence under suspicion. For example, Lolita had a habit of crying after having sex with him, something that he coldheartedly dismisses as “salutary storm of sobs”. At one point Humbert complains that he has a “sensational but incomplete and unorthodox memory”, so clearly his words should be taken with a grain of salt. But, at another point, he boasts that he is “a very conscientious recorder” of past events. In high pressure situations, he shows how adept he is at jovially twisting the truth. He often complains about his mental health in ways that are meant to draw the reader’s sympathy. He implies that he is a victim of his obsession with young girls, and that Lolita takes advantage of all his vulnerabilities.Humbert is a bit too confident in his ability to distract readers from the fact that he is a murderer, a rapist and a child molester by his mastery of language. Early into the book he announces: “You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.” Indeed, the language does not disappoint. The puns, the word games, the literary allusions, the linguistic tricks are all glorious. I think that Nabokov wanted to show how easy it is to sympathize with an abuser.

She stumbled upon the obvious title, “The Sexual Life of Catherine M” and became the subject of her story. She felt no obligation to understand, explain or justify her unconventional sex life. This allowed for a dispassionate delivery of indistinguishable threesomes, foresomes, moresomes, orgies and gang bangs. Like a person who stands in front of a large mirror, clarifying their thoughts by answering questions from an imaginary audience, Catherine M took the same position, only in this case, she glimpsed and uncovered the folds hidden between her thighs. She used her excellent observational skills to talk about a topic readily accessible to her. “There is no trial, no case to be made, because there is nothing more than a laying-out of facts”, she says. At all times the focus is on her, and the effect is similar to a series of nude self-portraits taken at different stages of life, intermingled into a single shot. Like Pollock, who was present in all of his canvases, CM portrayed her naked self within the pages of her book. She was aware that some will criticize her narcissistic approach, others will label her as a slut and a few will call her brave. She coldly replies that she has “the overriding impression that her adversaries are sticking their pins into a fetish of their own making”, which of course has no effect on her. To those who admire her bravery she says that she is only brave with respect to most people’s attitudes about sex, but she never paid attention to such things. Her only need was to reflect on her own image as she searched for sexual pleasure. The book stands out for its permissiveness and not its transgression, and those, who like me, are drawn to narratives about taboos will find it a bit bland. I prefer transgressive literature because of its motivation to take up perspectives about disapproved and fucked up things and give them back to people so they can question both the taboo and the mainstream.

That’s exactly the narrative Sade dismantles in Justine or The Misfortunes of Virtue and he does it - well, he does it sadistically.Sade transforms his readers into spectators of violence against virtuous young Justine. He is serving an alternative discourse about the merits of virtue. In his world we see a nightmarish spectacle of escalating abuse. No matter how hard Justine tries to derive a higher meaning from suffering, the textual audience of her victimization is only further stimulated by her tears and up their violence.Justine’s suffering is pointless, but Sade’s allegory makes a few interesting points. Between scenes of torture, Sade makes room for his philosophy. He thinks a novelist must describe man not only as he is, or wants to be, but also as what he is capable of being when subjected to the full impact of his vices. Sade wants to test common ideas about morality. He also wants to make his reader squirm.Sade portrays vice in the colors of hell, because he believes that anything less isn’t pure or honest. He wants to expose the sentimental narrative of his time as false. Around him, the political climate was a mess and ideas about divine justice weren’t making much sense. Sade puts Justine - who btw would have fit very nicely in a sentimental novel - inside a perverted narrative. She tells everyone she meets the tale of her suffering hoping to find mercy. Because Sade is author, she only meets perverts and her story only lubricates their imagination. She is virtuous and, as a consequence, she doesn’t adapt, doesn’t learn from past experiences, repeats the same pattern and is subjected to increasingly violent abuses. She refuses to face the facts of Sade’s world: virtue is punished and vice is rewarded.Sade violent demonstration re-enacts hierarchies of power. Everyone has to choose between two options: sinful agency or passive victimhood. Justine chooses the later. The arguments in the book reflect multiple problematic social and sexual attitudes. They also open up questions about whether there should be limits to what is expressed and if engaging with sadistic texts is ever a good idea. Personally, I’m in agreement with with Simone de Beauvoir’s conclusion about Sade: we mustn’t burn him and his texts just yet. He’s not entirely wrong....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 03, 2020","Apr 09, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/796267.Justine_or_The_Misfortunes_of_Virtue

It’s about ordinary people trAnthony Marra’s A constellation of Vital Phenomena is not entirely credible, but nonetheless it is a strong debut novel. It’s about ordinary people trying to survive while living in a state of constant trauma caused by the Chechen wars. The raw recounting of the destructive conflicts between post-Soviet Russia, Chechen guerrillas and the jihadis are contrasted with profoundly compassionate insights about how people’s memories of events become ways of coping with historical abuses. The plot moves back and forth into the pasts and futures of characters. When their lives intersect, the intensity of their ancestors’ hatred tests the moral strength of the descendants. The way the characters are constructed feels a bit stretched, as if Marra created archetypes. This works on some level because each character’s arc will pleasantly tickle your brain. What’s missing, though, are those complex humans who you feel that you can connect with emotionally, not just cognitively. But, Marra is a brilliant story teller and the prose is beautiful. There are many graphic descriptions of torture that show the human capability for causing atrocities, and a thin undercurrent of hope for the resilience of the survivors. In the worst moments of war, Sonja - a doctor working in a run down, almost completely equipment-free hospital - compares life to a moth that pointlessly circles a dead bulb. In moments of flickering hope she returns to a scientific definition of life from a book that she loves: “a constellation of vital phenomena — organization, irritability, movement, growth, reproduction, adaptation.” This description of life has stayed with me long after I put the book down....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 08, 2020","Mar 19, 2020","Feb 25, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18428067-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena
