There’s a lot of good-natured descriptions ofIt’s weird to read a book about an artist whose work you admire but whose personality you kind of abhor. There’s a lot of good-natured descriptions of Edgar Leeteg, painter of black velvet masterpieces, as a boozer, a brawler, and an all-time lothario. These aspects add to his myth, and I love that sort of myth-making. I’ve read a lot of histories about talented white straight dudes from the early-to-mid twentieth century and there’s always a bit of legend that comes with the reality. Less easy to incorporate into the fun-loving concept is Leeteg’s misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, and racism. The authors are clear on all these fronts but tend to shrug them off. I don’t think a wide-eyed biography (bordering a little on hagiography) has to necessarily decry its subject matter on moralities not consistent with 21st century values, but it’s something that took a little of the shine off of Leeteg’s legend for me.As for the art? It’s amazing. I’ve read a lot about lowbrow art (a designation Leeteg himself would probably approve of for his work), and I think it’s time to start recognizing it as legitimate art. I’m not one of those people who think we should canonize every formerly “bad” thing because it now has a cult following (yes, even Grease 2, which I love). But Leeteg’s art - despite the medium, despite the fact that he painted from photographic inspiration - evokes such a time, a place, and an attitude that I believe it deserves recognition as art, full stop. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 31, 2024","Mar 31, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55889485-leeteg

When it first opened, no one had ever seen anything like it. Birds were singing calypso! Flowers were singing in Hawaiian! The very walls were coming to life! The attraction, a favorite of Disneyland parkgoers for half a century, came to its current form after years of painstaking trial and error, sponsorships coming and going, assistance from a government missile system, and more. The creative talents of designers, actors, singers, artists, and technicians came together to bring Walt Disney's astounding (and ever-shifting) vision to life, and Ken Bruce's book delves into every aspect of that vision.

While doing research on a book about King special editiI fell into the world of Lawrence Block as I fall into most new authors: through Stephen King. While doing research on a book about King special editions, I discovered that the novelist from Maine had written an introduction to a limited edition of one of Lawrence Block's crime novels. Now: I love crime fiction, and I'd somehow never heard of this guy. All at once, I was presented with a new-to-me writer with scads of unread novels, and I was the happiest reader on the planet.It took me two years to get through the majority of Lawrence Block. He's written plenty of worthy fiction and nonfiction, but his two major series are probably the biggest draw. One, focusing on gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, is comic and almost cozy in its episodic, rarely-changing way. They're delightful. The Matt Scudder novels are different. Dark and dramatic, they follow an unlicensed private detective named Matthew Scudder, solving murders and wrestling with his private demons in New York. The first few books are very good, but they're living inside the mind of an alcoholic who is doing his best to bear up under the weight of his own failures and unbelievable trauma. It's when Scudder hits rock bottom and starts going to AA that the books gain a deeper resonance - as he moves past his dependence on alcohol and pain and starts putting his life on a better, happier path. I was slightly apprehensive, then, when I realized that the Autobiography of Matthew Scudder was going to focus exclusively on the early years; in a way, this would be a prequel to the first Scudder novel, 1976's Sins of the Fathers. My apprehension was unwarranted. It's not just that we're reading a book written by Lawrence Block, who continues to command language, tone, and character at an immensely high level this late in his career. It's that we're reading a book ""written"" by Matt Scudder, whose life experiences and way of thinking make those early recollections thrilling, in a low-key and weary sort of way. Most of the Scudder books are about the how, about the what. This one's about the why. Matthew Scudder is such a well-crafted, well-developed character that even without shootouts and explosions and chases and struggles, the why is immensely compelling.One conceit I loved (because I love writerly peccadillos) is that the Matt Scudder novels really are written by Lawrence Block, based on stories told to him by Scudder. Block intrudes a few times in this manuscript, but never in a distracting way (although one winking aside late in the book blames Block for getting a detail wrong in one of the earlier novels; the ""real"" Scudder doesn't remember what actually happened). As badly as I would love more Scudder novels, both the character and his author are in their 80s. I don't think we'll be seeing Scudder again, and if not, that's okay. We've got a long line of fine books, none of them duds, and this is a fantastic capstone to one of the best crime fiction series of all time. That's good enough for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 25, 2023","May 02, 2023","May 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/123263146-the-autobiography-of-matthew-scudder

Really, really loved it despite the fact that it was like a classic sports movie with all the same tropes and beats. And my current obsession with rollerskating immediately had me buying the book that inspired the movie, and I was positive. I would love it, because the author wrote the screenplay.But the book is… kind of difficult. A lot of it is trying to be extremely cool in a late aughts way. I didn’t really realize until recently that that was a profoundly uncool way to be cool. I mean, we were pretty disaffected in the 90s and Reality Bites has a terrible message but the language and the dismissal of anyone who isn’t you in this book is a little hard to take. Did people really say ‘rents? Like for real, and not making fun of hip slang?In the movie, Bliss Cavender is a bit self involved, but still really interesting and a good person to have as your main character. Her relationship with her dad is a lot more interesting. She actually has a pretty good heart. I’m guessing that some of that came in the screenplay as like a second draft to make the main character a little less of a jerk. I nearly gave up on this book a couple of times, because I was like, I want to like you, but you are really hard to like.Things get a lot easier and better in the second half of the book, and you get to like Bliss and understand her a little bit more. I didn’t really like how the major, massive dénouement is a sort of shoved offscreen into a side paragraph. I was really looking forward to reading that part.I hate to be giving this book fewer stars, because the movie was better, but the movie really was better. Whether it was the writing, directing, the acting, the nuance in the side characters, or just the fact that it felt more like a complete story , the movie was just better. I would recommend this book but with reservations.

Willian Henry Deveraux, Jr - Lucky Hank - was charming and foolish and smart and also kind of a jerk, and following him was fascinating but not quite satisfying. Events were occurring but nothing really seemed to be happening. And then there's this one-two punch near the end of the book that offers a symmetry I was not expecting, elevating this small story into something larger, smarter, more engaging than I had realized when I was in the middle of it. Lucky Hank spends so much time on his ironies and desire to push everyone away that when actual emotion intervenes, it's a little shocking. This would have gotten three stars for me until Russo upped the stakes and threw the entire story into a new context.

His name is as close to a guarantee that I will like a book, then almost any other factor. Still, I was skeptical. A book about Prince and Dickens as twin souls across a hundred plus years seemed almost gimmicky. And yet, as I read the book, I found more and more evidence that people of genius and incredible output do have more similarities and differences.I loved Hornby’s discursive delves into both artists, comparing, and sometimes contrasting who they were, where they came from, and the people whose lives they impacted. There’s similar upbringing, their relationships to, and with women, their reactions to superstardom and the perception that they were not being paid what they were worth. All of it really does seem like these two creative people are intertwined in some profound way. Most interesting is that while I like both Dickens and Prince, I’m not what you would call a giant fan of either. This book made me think that I should become one. It also made me think that I should write a book similar to this about two similar men in the same fields as Prince and Dickens, who have inspired me endlessly, and who are similar enough to base a book on.

But it’s also just extremely well written, and features a science-fiction premise that I have been reading about in books for sometime. When I was a teenager, I read a book called Building Blocks, which was about someone who travels back in time and sees how his grandfather really was towards his father. Not the kindly old man that he thought he was.I got some similar feelings from this, but it’s a lot more intense. Dana, a Black woman from the late 1970s, travels back in time to save the life of a young boy, who is the son of a slave owner. She has keep going back to his time and saving him, sometimes with her husband, who is white, most of the time alone. What she goes through in the early 1800s is so intense and so brutal, but mostly this is a book about compassion. Or, it’s about how when you start to see somebody as less than human, you can’t ever see them any other way. Compassion, and anti-compassion.

It’s I don’t think I would be the Stephen King fan, and occasional scholar, I am today without the work of so many people writing about Stephen King. It’s a bit of a cottage industry; looks about King take up an entire bookcase in my home office. I’ve written a few of them. Our passions drive us.This new book by Bev Vincent is the sort of book I would have wanted to read when I was 14 years old. I had gotten into King In a big way, and reading books by George Beahm, Stephen Spignesi, Michael Collings, and Douglas Winter helped to fuel my interest in the writer and the man behind these books I liked so much. This book falls into that category, halfway between an appreciation and a primer for the work of King. It’s not fan nonsense, which is always a worry when you pick up a book about a writer is popular as Stephen King. It also doesn’t go down that literary rabbit hole where everything has to be rationalized in order to justify an interest in a pop writer. Vincent strikes and excellent balance, serving both a new reader, and somebody who has spent 3/4 of their life steeped in the man’s fiction and lore.Also, I’m a sucker for any book that looks at the newer work with an unjaundiced eye. I’ve been around long enough to have heard “Stephen king was good until…” for most of my reading life. I love Vincent’s look at King work from the beginning all the way up to present day, treating each novel and collection as an individual work, even as he takes on decade chunks as natural summations.I wish I could give this book to myself at 14, when I was reading those Stephen King quiz books, and the Stephen King Companion for the first time. I might’ve helped me get better than a C- on that first essay on King I wrote. Or maybe it would just make me want to read more. And that, I think, is why book like this exists in the first place....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 02, 2022","Sep 05, 2022","Sep 05, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/60657798-stephen-king

The whole Gen X thing doesn’t really make any sense to me, even though I staunchly identify as such. I’ve read a lot of books about specific phenomena in the 1990s, books and movies and books and sweeping generational changes. But I’ve never read something that takes on the entire decade, tries to unpack what it was, and, it to a slightly lesser degree, explain what it meant.Klosterman’s topics range from pop culture to politics, sports to domestic terrorism. Occasionally, all those things are the same thing. In a decade remembered as being kind of soft, kind of quiet, a lot of really crazy stuff happened. We kind of forget that the stuff we kind of lauded Bill Clinton for the stuff that we kind of hate him for now. We kind of forget how insanely into the movie American Beauty we were, because it’s easy to talk about how queasy it always seemed. Klosterman talks a lot about revisionist history, the kind I often see on twitter whenever people try to claim that people always liked The Phantom Menace.And, even though the movie Reality Bites bothered me at the time, I never really understood why until I read this book. Part of it is that Winona Ryder’s character sides with the ostensibly principled terrible boyfriend instead of the virtuous, slightly shallow boyfriend. Only in that specific time in American history could that have been seen as the right choice (though I knew it wasn’t, even then). Though this book talks about politics and O.J. Simpson and 9/11, I think that that movie really sums up the most of my 90s experience. We were all trying to pretend we were after something real, after something authentic, and all of that was its own form of fake.I don’t know if the 90s themselves were real. But I do know I’m glad I have this book about the 90s, because it helps me understand that unreality just a little bit better.

The first book I ever read on this thing we call ""tiki"" was a slim volume by Foshko and Henderson called California Tiki, published by History Press. I picked it up in a California bookstore while visiting my friend Josh, knowing a little about tiki but not being all that versed in it. It was a great introduction. I learned a little about the history, the culture. I think I was more interested in classic Los Angeles at the time, but the whole Polynesian Pop thing grabbed me in a way I didn't expect. It gave me a foot in the door. The Press has dipped back into the waters of classic tiki and establishments a couple of times in surprising ways. I mean, you expect a tiki retrospective of California. You don't expect Ohio Tiki, which came next. And you REALLY don't expect Detroit Tiki. Detroit? The Motor City? Home of Bob Seger and Stroh's and Motown? Tiki!?Indeed yes! This is one of those books where it feels like the author really wanted to talk about one establishment (like the books on the Mai-Kai or the Kahiki Supper Club), but there wasn't QUITE enough information to fill a full volume, so they had to branch out. I'm glad they did. The big focus of this book is on Chin Tiki, a tiki palace that was open for decades in downtown Detroit, created and managed by Marvin Chin. All the usual nostalgia markers are there: the exotic decor, the waterfalls, the dancing. But Chin's was three floors and the bandstand rose from floor to floor on a hydraulic elevator, which ... holy shit, the opulence of the 1960s. The book also covers the Mauna Loa, which is a tragedy of extravagance. Booth huts and pearl diver girls and authentic carvings and more waterfalls than you could ever hope to count. There and gone in four years. Detroit Tiki talks about all the hardships the city faced in the mid-60s: the riots, the GM strike, the economic downturn ... not to mention the supposed end of the tiki craze, which coincided with the cynicism of Vietnam and Watergate and the rise of hippie culture. A quick check in to the Detroit Trader Vic's and the book is complete, but even though it only really focused on three establishments, I got more of a feel for the era and the place than I did in the technically more widely encompassing Ohio Tiki. This one really felt more like the Kahiki Supper Club book. And now I'm wondering if there shouldn't be a New England Tiki book.

When asked to describe why, of all places, LA, my stock answer is that it's because it's so sincere about its insincerity. (That's the whole tiki thing, too: authentically inauthentic. I apparently love places and themes whose oxymoronic natures make them both appealing and unknowable.)Author Matthew Specktor has his own strange romance with LA - and, perhaps necessarily, with the Hollywood of it. At times he insists he's a novelist and doesn't want to be dragged into the role of screenwriter, which seems almost beneath his contempt until he's lauding screenwriters. He hates the city unless he's in love with it. And he can't stand Hollywood, except this whole book is about Hollywood, and the love of it, and its almost inevitable heartbreaks.It's a book about failures, either eventual or baked-in. We get probing looks into the successes and downfalls, or the unsung and under-sung careers, of figures like Carole Eastman, Eleanor Perry, Warren Zevon, Tuesday Weld, Hal Ashby, Michael Cimino, more. Specktor likes the real stories but he has no problem talking about the myths either, the way Hollywood lionizes or buries talent, seemingly on a whim. Throughout this look into the intermittent renown of talented Angelinos threads a narrative of Specktor's own life: his excruciating relationship with his alcoholic mother (and boy, did that slice cut deep); his romantic failings; his literary failings; his obsession with a break-up that meant more to him than it should have. Bizarrely, none of this feels self-indulgent. In relating the tale of Hollywood's forgotten, Specktor finds communion - if not comfort - in his own stories of wasted talent, dark turns, forgotten names. It's not a love letter to Los Angeles, nor is it a condemnation. It's somewhere in between, and the title underscores that: for every success in Hollywood, there is a failure. Sometimes those things happen to the same people. And it doesn't end, it just perpetuates. Hollywood is the car. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Feb 2022,"Feb 09, 2022","Feb 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55678467-always-crashing-in-the-same-car

ElmOf course the reason why I started reading City Primeval was because there’s going to be a new Justified mini series, and it’s based on this book. Elmore Leonard created the characters that were later adapted to Justified, and even though this book has nothing to do with those characters, it’s still Elmore Leonard in the Elmore Leonard world.Now, a confession: I have never read an Elmore Leonard novel. I know I should. I like crime novels, I like dark novels, and apparently I like his writing style. But until city primeval, I never really gave him a shot. This may be the year that I go deep.It’s interesting, reading crime novels sit in the 80s; as a somewhat progressive reader in 2022, the novel at times comes across as shockingly sexist … until it doesn’t. When it comes to stuff like sexism, classism, and racism - not to mention homophobia and transphobia - you sometimes have to ask yourself if it’s the characters or the author making these judgments and saying these things. Still, it’s a little shocking seeing the n-word dropped just all the time, even though it’s the bad guy dropping it. And there are three main women in the book - one competent and smart cop who’s sort of “just like the boys,” one a smart lawyer who makes a lot of bad judgment calls (and the good guy main character calls her out for trying to be a “tough broad”), and a simpering girlfriend. Maybe I’m judging all of this with contemporary eyes, but it just didn’t feel as well realized as it could have. Maybe that was just the 80s.Did I like it? Yeah I liked it. In a way, I would have liked it more if what seemed like the ending actually happened. As it stands, the ending we get is a little bit more conventional than the one that seemed promised. It’s still a good ending, and it provides better closure, but the ending I thought we were getting would have meant more, I think. Or maybe I’m just a psychopath. It would have been a very dark ending.So: not my favorite crime novel, but quite entertaining and very readable.

I didn’t even know Susan Orlean was writing another book. As it turned out, she wasn’t, precisely. Like the Ann Patchett book of essays I read last year, this is a collection of pieces from across Orlean’s career. Unlike the Patchett book, this focuses on one particular interest: the world of animals. The essays are quite good, bookended by dissertations about Orlean’s interest in animals and her life on the small farm she runs herself. The last part is presented in a form of small blog entries about the goings on at her farm and what happens when things start to get uprooted. It’s a good finale for the book, but it did make me a little sad.In between her introduction and the final slow goodbye, there are plenty of essays about donkeys, mules, whales, pandas, chickens, and lost dogs. About animal actors, and animal activists. About the many ways in which rabbits can cause devastation, and the fine line they straddle between being pets and being dinner. About oxen, and how they are the most important thing in the world until they are not.I read some s of this book; some folks seem to be up in arms that Orlean has not followed through on updating some of these essays. For example, Keiko, the Free Willy whale, Did not last long in the open season. The way Orlean presents the story, it’s a little open ended. I don’t really see a problem with that. The breadth of an animal’s life can’t be summed up in a single essay. Things are going to happen after the essay is over.

There were some fun and funny parts of this book, but basically it's the same diatribe over and over again: by connecting with everyone, you connect with no one, especially yourself. Nothing is real, everything is manufactured, and everything you ever loved will be stripped away.Certainly I agree with Paul on some of this stuff, and yes it's alarming that the internet has rendered some of our old practices obsolete so quickly. But the sort of moral panic and hectoring that crops up in so many of these entries feels a bit much for a book like this. Was it me? Was it the marketing? Was it the expectation?

It certainly seems personal, and grisly. The hunt for the killer takes him first to Hong Kong and then to Japan, right as the US is entering World War II. He becomes a victim of circumstance, of timing, and maybe of people putting him in the wrong place at the most convenient time.Everyone kept telling me how great this novel was, and when I first began it I was like well, the writing is good and the murder is really intense, but I didn’t understand why people liked it so much.

The first four Bachman novels are odd little pockets in the Stephen King canon. They’re bleak, harsh, and don’t have happy endings. They’re about singular-minded straight white men determined to win at any cost, despite the fact that society is trying to kill them.

Blaze does, kind of.I’m a little bit further away from the ages of the walkers in the book now, and there are some holes that I never really thought about before.

Last year, I set myself a goal of 70 books and because it was Our Year of Covid, I blasted well past that number. My twin obsessions, tiki history and Ann Patchett, took up so much of my year, but there was so much comfort in re-reads and one-off discoveries. I devoured books, both the physical and the audio (and occasionally digital). When I look back on 2020, it's reading (as well as, like, constant, unending fear) that is the undercurrent of things. This year ... well, look, 2021 didn't exactly get back to ""normal,"" but I got a lot busier. My art picked up. I was going into the office. Midday naps and the attendant reading fell by the wayside. I was going to the gym instead of working out at home. And I was writing more. I had a 300,000-word novel to finish. So reading, as it does, takes a hit.70 is a funny number. To some folks, it is a pinnacle of books read that will never be reached. To others, it's a way station whose actual destination is somewhere in the hundreds. For me, it's good. Not great. Not astounding, like last year's. But good. And I'm glad I hit the 70 mark on a terrific book.I've been wary about reading Virginia Woolf. I'd read Mrs. Dalloway a while back and I found it difficult to get through. It was impressionistic and stream-of-consciousness, and I can get into that sometimes, but that one proved a little ungraspable. Her fiction, I may have determined, might not be for me. But this was non-fiction, and non-fiction about writing. That's my catnip. So I plunged in.I spend a lot of time thinking about writing. Stephen King was and is my main inspiration, at least as far as fecundity and work ethic go. He says that life isn't a support system for writing, it's the other way around ... but he also never stops writing. He just never stops. I've taken that model on in my own work. I like writing so much. I like it when it takes too much out of me. I like it when I can devote my whole self to it. It's maybe not healthy, but it's my approach. It's my first obsession.So it's alarming, sort of, to read this short book about being told you cannot do that. A Room of One's Own is Virginia Woolf's thesis that, in order to be a writer of fiction AND a woman, you must have your own money and a room you can lock yourself away in. It's kind of shocking to me that in the 1920s, these concepts seemed relatively new, and somewhat shocking. We think the whole ""patriarchy reacting badly to social change"" is sort of new, but good God! Virginia Woolf isn't allowed on a college campus because she's a woman, or into a certain set of rooms. If she didn't have her own money, she wouldn't have been able to write novels, because she would have been forced into a life of either servitude or scraping. We learn that the suffrage movement made men of the age so, so angry, because equality has always, to a segment of the population, seemed like disparity. If I cannot have an inferior, then how am I superior?One of the most interesting discourses in this series of essays is when Woolf reads a contemporary woman novelist's not-very-good novel. In one minute, Woolf is talking about how clunky the book is, and that she kind of doesn't like it. But she's also thrilled that it exists, that a woman was given the chance to write a merely okay novel in her own voice. It's that age-old problem when it comes to art and pioneering, isn't it? If you are a woman (or Black, or gay, or trans), you have to be the absolute best in order to be given a portion of the recognition as your middling white cis male contemporaries. I listened to this podcast about Sidney Poitier's roles, and how he had to be one of the best doctors in the world to even be considered an equal to the white family in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? That spirit is sadly alive in so many fields - not just artistic, but in academia, as well. A little while back, there was a news story about a scientist who landed a rocket on a comet. All the headlines read, ""This young lady did this."" Like our impression should be surprise and admiration that the person who did this was a WOMAN; like a dog standing on hind legs, what a marvel it seems that it happens at all.I was furious for much of the book. Woolf is never passive in her dealings with the rules of men, but in the first third of the book, every time she is met with a patriarchal obstacle, she shifts her way of thinking. ""Well,"" she says over and over again, ""I found a better use of my time than doing that thing I wasn't allowed to do. Isn't it great that I get to do that thing rather than the thing I really wanted to do, but can't because I'm just a girl?""It's a terrific book. A hard book. A book that, unfortunately, is contemporary enough for me to not be as shocked at ""how things used to be,"" because so many of those things still are. Women write whatever they want now, and that's, at least, better ... but it's not where it needs to be. Look at what happens when a woman wins an Oscar for directing. Look at what happens when a woman asks that more female journalists interview her. A lot has changed, and a lot hasn't. So this book, as well as being my current favorite Woolf (the same thing happened to me when I read Hemingway's A Movable Feast; nonfiction by fiction writers seems to be a thing I like), is also important. I'm so glad I read it.Now, let's see what lies past 70. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 11, 2021","Dec 14, 2021","Dec 14, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18521.A_Room_of_One_s_Own

I wasOne thing I didn’t take into consideration when I started this book was that I wasn’t only reading a book about the 1912 sinking of the Titanic. I was also reading an author writing that book in 1955. It’s a nonfiction novel, written like an historic epic with a cast of thousands. It paves the way for stuff like In Cold Blood … the main difference being that Walter Lord, unlike Capote, doesn’t figure into his own account. Lord’s omniscient narration works to capture a whole story, narrowing in on as many human experiences as possible. In his book, there are heroes and cowards, but curiously, Lord himself stays out of those sort of judgments (mostly). The reader is left to decide what they would do when faced with such unthinkable decisions. There are women who are stronger and more gallant than the men (the unsinkable Molly Brown makes an appearance). There’s the Captain who, indeed, seems to have gone down with the ship. There’s the story of a man escaping the sinking ship being dressed as a woman. It’s a scandal … unless it’s an Irishman who did so; then it’s barely interesting. The class thing is interesting. I read some s by publications contemporary to A Night to Remember, and they all say Lord’s book totally avoids recounting the events through an upper-class lens. He doesn’t really avoid that, though, and it’s easy to understand why: first-class passengers got off the ship in far greater numbers than second-class or steerage. More of them lived to talk about it.And it’s kind of interesting when he says that everything changed then, and people were a lot more willing to be disillusioned. It seems, in the middle of the book, that Lord argues that that may be a good thing… even at the same time as he laments a new lack of gallantry and manners. “It’s cool that we understand the precariousness of the world a lot better now, but remember when everything was nicer?” It’s kind of apt sentiment for the mid-century, when nuclear families were a thing and everyone moved to the suburbs.The big shadow, of course, is cast by James Cameron‘s film from the 1990s. It’s almost impossible to read this book without thinking of the images in the film. There’s also a lot of scientific stuff that the movie was more concerned with than the book was. It’s funny; the movie tends to get dinged for over-sentimentalizing things, cluttering up an historic recounting with Jack and Rose. But the movie was also concerned with historical accuracy to an almost weird degree; knowing that the ship is slowly sinking is eerie here, but I’ve been spoiled by seeing it crack in half and plunge.I really liked this book, though. So much of it seems like chaos and then the chaos stops and everything gets really quiet for a while. Then you sort of missed the chaos. There’s so many ironies about the Titanic, and so much in the way of mistakes and hubris and just bad luck.

In it, she has an essay about the children’s book author Kate DiCamillo, and how she, Patchett, had to get over her prejudice of children’s lit not being “real” lit. I listened to the audio of that essay, waiting in the baggage claim of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, for Warren to pick me up.Two days later, we’re in an independent bookstore, which I’d wanted to go to shop for Christmas gifts but also to see if they had any Kate DiCamillo books. I was about to ask Warren if he knew where the Children’s section was so I could find her books, and he says, unprompted, “Hey do you know that author Kate DiCamillo? She’s local and walks her dog past my house all the time.”I gawped at him. Could he read my mind? This was a signal that I needed to read this woman’s work.I picked up a few books, having read Because of Winn-Dixie for the first time at the start of what we’re all calling “the pandy” now.

I honestly didn’t. Throughout the story, Edward is neutral. He moves when people move him. He can’t look at the stars unless someone tilts him that way. That his immobility can be read as a metaphor for stagnant emotion might be beside the point. The point is that he has no interest in loving or being loved at the start of the novel, and his miraculous journey is all about discovering whether love is possible. It is a remarkable story that made me tear up at least twice.

While we were all binge-watching TV, I was also binge-reading Patchett. I’d read The Dutch House in 2019 and 2020 was my whirlwind Ann Patchett year. While we were all binge-watching TV, I was also binge-reading Patchett. I’d read The Dutch House in 2019 and made indefinite plans to “really try some of her other stuff,” when I had time. In 2020, I had so much time.The problem with a binge-read of a writer who has written under a dozen books is that you can come to the end relatively quickly. I’d cut my teeth on Stephen King, whose accurate mantra is “Here, sir, there are always more tales.” Not so with Patchett. I read Run in a day. I read Taft in two. I craved her books. Needed them on some fundamental level I couldn’t entirely explicate. They were water in the endless desert of time.Then I finished, and the waiting began. When would the next Ann Patchett come? I needed the new book. I needed my Patchett fix. The answer came in early 2021: her new book was coming in December. Not a novel, but a book of essays.At first, I was ambivalent. I’d loved Patchett’s book on her friend Lucy Greely, and I’d liked her prior book of essays, This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage. But the fact that it wasn’t fiction made me preemptively wary. It was statistically impossible that I would like this book as much as I would enjoy a novel.So why did I binge-read it? Or, more accurately, binge-listen? Patchett had read her own audiobook of These Precious Days, and listening to her tell her own stories might have been the balm I needed on my anxieties this cold season. I traveled to Minneapolis with the book in my ears, reveling in her essay on the cover art of her books.(Jhumpa Lahiri has a book on the subject I read this year, and even though both authors are smart and witty about the failures and occasional successes of cover art, I preferred Patchett’s take. Maybe because I’m more familiar?)The book is structured in such a smart way, a way that allows us to read it with the momentum of reading a novel. The introduction is titled “Essays Don’t Die,” and it’s followed by a surprisingly funny tale about the three men who’d functioned as her father over the course of her life, all of whom who have since died. This is a taste of what’s to come, but not immediately.It would be wrong to say that These Precious Days is all about death, even though the shadow of a pandemic hangs over much of the book, and even though its title essay is a long, heartfelt ode to her friend Sookie, who is dying of cancer. The book is brimming with life: stories about a youthful trip to Paris, about knitting as an act of salvation, about a lack of children and what that doesn’t mean. Nearly every essay grabbed me and held me in its temporary thrall (my one holdout being “The Worthless Servant”; I find religion interesting and writing about it smart, but this one didn’t work for me).As we near the end, however, the essays about death and dying rise to a crescendo. They are about the people who die, the legacies they leave, and the people left to remember them. It’s not sad, really; to me, these ruminations on dying only underscore the earlier essays on living.

This book, Taboo: I really need to pinpoint when the big tiki revival began, but it started happening in the mid-1990s and has only grown since then. This book, Taboo: The Art of Tiki, was written in 1999, sort of at the precipice of acceptance as a revived art form/trend/vibe. Shag was already making himself known as THE mid-century/tiki revival artist, and folks like Mark Ryden were offering highly detailed illustrative art that reinforced the tiki precepts while making them new for a generation that was playing catch-up.But … art in the 1990s, man. I mean, no tiki artist has the same style or adheres to the same specific subject matter, but there were definitely trends in which the 90s indulged. This was the decade of EXTREEEEEME everything. Commercial art and design was in your face, blowing everything up, exploding with New and Bold and This Ain’t Your Dad’s Tiki.There’s a place for a lot of that. I mean, tiki was never really subtle. And there’s no way I can sit here and love classic Edgar Leeteg black velvet wahine art and try to get prudish about naked ladies in this book’s art. (And I’m not in general; Van Aron’s “God’s Gift of Spam” doubles down on the tiki idol’s original phallic symbolism by having a tiki present Spam on his dick, and there’s a topless hula dancer. And a bat. It’s ridiculous and a little offensive and I love it.)But some of the art in here goes beyond unsubtle and approaches garishness. That might have been the point. The revival owes a lot of its initial success from the punk scene and the influence of underground comix, so it’s not really surprising that some of this art feels like an extension of those aesthetics. Maybe a lot if this stuff isn’t for me. I’ll tell you, the parts of the book I loved most were the three introductions - one by editor Martin McIntosh, an examination of the original movement by tiki expert Sven Kirsten, and a great deep dive into the rumblings of the revival by Boyd Rice. All fantastic.And some of the art really spoke to me, too, and what I think I’m discovering is that a lot of my favorite stuff is both mid-century and timeless. The aforementioned Shag and Ryden, the carving and sculpting by Bosko, and the fantastic black and white photographs of tiki-themed apartment buildings by Lesley Marlene Siegel were among my absolute favorites. Maybe a lot of the other stuff just wasn’t for me.I think though that this slim volume might actually be a necessary text. Along with The Book of Tiki by Kirsten, this presents a look at the beginning of the tiki revival, just as it was gaining steam. Books written now, or more recently, are all about the current look at Tiki, or deep dive into the original history. A contemporary look at the start of this new era is pretty damn exciting, but like all art, your mileage may vary....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 26, 2021","Nov 28, 2021","Nov 28, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1189550.Taboo

I didn’t understand that the title was meant tWhen I first saw the cover of this book in a bookstore in New York City, I didn’t understand the irony. I didn’t understand that the title was meant to be, at the same time, real and cheeky and ironic and a little heartbreaking.“No one is talking about this.” It’s one of those Twitter things. Sometimes you mean it in an absurdist way: “There was a cartoon about a sentient Rubik’s Cube?! No one is talking about this!!!” Sometimes it’s used to describe something that everyone is talking about, because irony is Twitter’s bread and butter, even if we can’t always define it properly, because it’s like rain on your wedding day.And sometimes we don’t talk about it on Twitter because no one likes to read about grief. No one likes to read about tragedy unless we can be militant or woke about it. No one likes to read about personal atrocities, because that’s not funny or performative enough. No one is talking about this because no one wants to read about this.Patricia Lockwood’s book is broken into two parts. The first part basically talks about Twitter and Instagram and meme culture, and it’s so hard to talk about that stuff without sounding out of touch. I wonder if in 10 years, the stuff she describes is going to feel as outdated and post generational, like what happened when I tried to go back to Microserfs. My friend Jeff, who read this book before I did, underscored exactly how difficult it is to catch the right tone of Twitter in book form. Lockwood does it, and it’s almost upsetting how accurately she paints a picture of the online world. But it’s also funny. Like, extraordinarily funny. In the first 10 minutes of reading this book, I laughed out loud at least three times. When you talk about Twitter, and the jokes and the memes and the absurdist cultural references, you have to remember that this sort of ephemera is often really clever. It’s hilarious much of the time, triggering those tiny little jolts of dopamine that give us minor happies. It’s why we keep coming back even when it consumes us.The second half of the book posits the question what happens when actual tragedy hits a person who has spent their life extremely online. I kept expecting a life lesson, an exploration into the dividing line between being a persona and being a person. The issue with that - and the reason Lockwood isn’t interested in a lesson like that - is that there’s no real dividing line anymore. We are all persons and we are all personas. I don’t know if it’s funny or sad or just life.I was kind of rocked by this book. Some parts in the second half were a little difficult to read, but the prose is so compelling I never considered stopping. Lockwood has a style I’ve never actually encountered in a novel, but which I have seen online. Tweets, a lot of them, are meant to be short, pithy, and interesting enough to get you to engage with them. What happens when the tone of that is stretched across a narrative that describes something so real you can’t really tweet about it? I really liked this book. But I’m also really just glad I read it. I’m still trying to figure out what it means, because I saw myself so much in the life of that narrator. Have I lost the ability to live a real life because I live so much of it in my phone? Or has my phone made me a more conscientious, thoughtful, and maybe even funny person? I’m writing this  in the notes app using speech to text, and I’m going to copy and paste it into Goodreads. Maybe that says something too. But probably not.Man, this is a minor miracle of a book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 12, 2021","Nov 13, 2021","Nov 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53733106-no-one-is-talking-about-this

I watched, with growing excitement and not a little recognition, as Lily slowly starts to piece the puzzle of her own queerness together. That my own coming-out happened in the early 1990s and repeated a lot of the same patterns both comforts and appalls me. In Lily's terror of her desires, her reluctances and hesitations, her insane mood shifts, I absolutely saw myself. I just wish that in the intervening forty years, things had changed a little more.But Lily's got the deck stacked against her in a lot of other ways. 1. She's a woman. 2. She's a Chinese-American (in the book, Caucasian characters call her an ""Oriental,"" which was common enough back then and not necessarily considered an insult, but I liked that Lily bristles at the othering term, just the same), and 3. She's living in the 1950s, when being either of those things was more than a little suspect. I liked that author Malinda Lo didn't spend too long on the male gaze or the T R A G E D Y of homosexuality. I sometimes find in books and movies that depict queer people of different eras, it all has to be about SADNESS and LONGING and PUNISHMENT. Even progressive stuff in the 70s had lonely people dying alone, in the 80s and 90s had AIDS as a finale to too many lives, in the aughts had feints toward cohesive stories that always fell in the shadows of their heterosexual counterparts (and sometimes murder and torture). It long stunned me that one of the best and most progressive depictions of gay people I found in a 1980s novel was in Stephen King's It, which edges into stereotype and ends in brutal murder.What I've long wanted is a book that gave a historical context for a queer existence and a queer relationship that recognized the dangers of the day without necessarily giving into them. Sometimes Lily's reluctance and nervousness frustrated me, but of course I understood all of that. How strange was it for young me discovering what it is about men I liked, and being repulsed by myself and afraid about who I was? How infinitely more strange it would be for someone like Lily Hu, and for the girl she starts to fall in love with. I first saw this book on my last trip into New York, and ... I think I bought it for Tracey? Or she had already read it and couldn't stop gushing over it.

For a little while, the hype around Normal People was everywhere, and ... well, not annoying, but all-consuming. Sometimes I love that. Sometimes it puts me off. I didn't really have any desire to read this one. So of course eventually I gave in and figured out why it had all this hype and it's now one of my favorite novels of the year.Two main characters - Connell and Marianne - keep bashing against one another, bouncing off, and coming back together. They're sexual. They're friends. They're not speaking. They're intertwined inextricably. And on and on, and it should feel repetitive and annoying but it never does. Sometimes I get frustrated with the characters for not saying what they really need and want, and it's kind of fascinating to watch both of them change eventually. Late in the book, Marianne asks Connell something and I cringed because I was like, he's going to be evasive and not answer directly. And then he DOES, and that's when I realized that these people have grown both as a team and as separate entities in so many ways from where we first see them.You wonder if Connell's confidence is at the expense of Marianne. You try to figure out if Marianne's kink is healthy emotionally or not. You continue to see Connell giving Marianne chances, and then Marianne giving Connell chances, and there's a cycle of need and want and desire that was so compelling that I am forced to accept the open ending, even though I don't totally want to.

She was hemming and hawing about having to write this three page essay, and so I told her that every time she mentioned the title, she should call it, “Frankenstein, or, the Modern Prometheus.” We were very funny and clever in our twenties.I don’t know why I was never compelled to read this book. I read Dracula when I was in high school, and I’ve been reading Stephen King my entire life. For some reason, I just thought that this was going to be a really tough read. As it turned out, the language, the characterization, plot, all of it – it was remarkably easy to read and understand, at times actually kind of compulsively addictive.As it further turned out, a lifetime of knowing this book only through the movie, and many allusions to that over the years, gave me an extremely incomplete concept of what this book was all about. There was no Igor. No late night grave robbing. Lightning as a means of animating dead flesh was alluded to, but not explicit. I knew going into this at the creature was a lot more articulate then I had been led to believe, but I had no idea that it was sort of a monologuing villain.Most of the visceral horror is “off stage,” which is fine for a novel like this. Our real horrors come from the tenuousness of life, what it means to be alive if all it is is torment. One of the cleverest things about the book is how the creature turns the tables on Frankenstein; after being born into a life he didn’t ask for and being rebuked by his creator, the creature curses Frankenstein to keep living. I loved how he gives Frankenstein just enough sustenance to survive, specifically so that he’ll remain haunted and depressed. That’s harsh as hell.After all these years of not having read this classic of the canon, what have I learned? Mostly that a good book is a good book, and has the power to move us and scare us over the course of centuries. It’s a powerful novel, and its power has not diminished - neither in the years since it was written nor due to the pop culture flotsam and jetsam of a work interpreted and reinterpreted countless times. Now, of course, I want to read all about it, to study the various meanings that smarter folks than me have figured out.

Normally, when I read books in a series, the series has been around for a while and I binge. So for the first couple chapters, getting reacquainted with Detective Matthew Venn, his husband Jonathan, and his small detective team of Jen and Ross, was as much of a commitment as learning all the new characters, AND dealing with a murder. (A grisly one, too, where someone is found stabbed to death with a shard of glass in the neck.) Eventually, I caught up and grew involved. Yes, Venn with his inadequacies and guilt and mother issues; yes, Jen with her drinking that might be a problem and two kids she worries about; yes, Ross, torn between trying to be a traditionalist and a good husband and tolerant person. All these people started coming into focus as we delved further into the community surrounding them, and the murders unsettling this arty, touristy seaside town. I always feel like I'm damning a book with faint praise by calling it easy to read, but I can tell you from experience that a book being challenging doesn't mean it's good (it doesn't mean it's bad, either; either extreme is limiting). Mysteries tend to be plotted affairs, and this is a good plot, moving along with precision and speed and enough red herrings to fill an aquarium. In some mysteries, the plot is beside the point, a convenient hook to hang good characters on. But Cleeves doesn't operate like that. The characters are important, and I love looking into their lives and their slow growths as people - but it's almost refreshing that the mystery itself is front and center.I have a bunch of other Cleeves to read. She isn't showy, necessarily, for some reason, her settings and prose don't seem to lend themselves to binging (that could be the drier UK crime novel thing; I feel the same way about the Maisie Dobbs books). But I know that when I go back to her eventually, I'm going to find a well-written, exciting, easily digestible novel that will linger in my head awhile.

It’s such an unassuming place for some thing that has loomed very large my mind. They used to be a couple of great mystery bookstores in Boston, but that no longer seems to be a thing. Even the best things are ephemeral.When Otto Penzler, proprietor of the Mysterious Bookshop and the press associated with it, announced the annual anthology of best mystery stories (this time compiled and edited by superstar Lee Child), I was excited. Then I found out that Stephen King had a story in there, and I could not have smashed that order button fast enough.As it turned out, I had read the Stephen King story - “The Fifth Step“ - before, and had forgotten I’d read it. That didn’t really matter of course, because the thing about the fifth step is that King is not appearing in this volume because his name is Stephen King. It’s because his story is really one of the best of the year. Of course, none of these stories was in here because of name recognition. Sometimes with anthologies, some second-rate story by a famous person will make it in just so you’ll buy the book. That did not happen here. Not even with the presence of Sara Paretsky, whose VI Warshawski gets to strut her stuff. Not even with a lost story by Sue Grafton, who never got to write the last book in her alphabet series. Lee Child would have been forgiven for including her story in here even if it wasn’t all that great. Rest assured: it’s all that great.All the stories in here are great. You’ve got private detectives, police procedural rules, crimes of passion and crimes of circumstance. Sometimes you hate the killers. Sometimes you cheer them on. There is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche in here by David Marcum that I was sure was going to feel a little arch, and then I was completely sucked in by it.This year, I’m giving anthologies a shot in the way that I really haven’t in the past. I have long bought volumes with a single Stephen King story in them, because I have a great interest, and failed to read many of the other stories in them. I don’t really know why. Maybe it was my unfamiliarity with the short story medium. Stephen King was cool, but it was a bridge too far for other authors for me. I think I’m curing myself at this time. This is the second volume of a fantastic short fiction I read this year, and I kind of want to read more.

In the intro, he specifically states that this isn't real, this is a figment of my imagination. In the afterword, he reiterates this point, calling out by name all the people he made up and all the events that didn't happen. None of that matters. Throughout reading the book and now, after it's over and I'm thinking about it, all I can think of is: those poor dead girls.Because Chizmar has structured his book like a true-crime story, it's easy to get lost in the invented reality - especially because he tells it from a first person point of view, and ladles on the verisimilitude early and often. It's as much a childhood memoir as it is an ersatz true story about a serial killer stalking his hometown; think of it as part In Cold Blood, part Dandelion Wine. The parts merge uncomfortably, but that's by design. This is a rite of passage story, and unfortunately the rite is the (invented) unsolved murders of four young girls in Chizmar's (real) hometown of Edgewood, Maryland. Chizmar puts on his amateur investigator hat and faces darkness over and over, emerging on the other side a writer, a married man, and the publisher of the magazine Cemetery Dance. The Rebecca/Psycho-esque interview near the end of the book, in which we get a lot of explanations, should have tamped down the effect of this creepy book, but it somehow only made it creepier.

How excited I was, then, that I found a book that explored how mid-century modern design defined Star Trek, and how Star Trek and its design influenced America?! Answer: extremely.I’ve been obsessed with Star Trek my entire life, but for some reason never really paid attention to stuff like set design or props beyond a tricorder or a phaser. This book goes deep into how the sets made Star Trek look super futuristic, even though most of the furniture, artwork, and fashion came from commercial stores that sold to everyone. With its swooping curves and space-age philosophy, the 1960s were, in a design sense at least, all about the future in every way, shape, and form.I liked learning about the designers and manufacturers behind these modern pieces, but I really loved seeing them in context. I also loved the chapter on brutalism and how this seemingly dystopian concept also helped shape the idea of a stark, but no less beautiful, future.As long as Star Trek exists, even in just our memory, there is going to always be a new way to examine and talk about it. This book just really hit exactly my serotonin centers. At the end of the book, there are a few pages of ads for mid century furniture and they are so exciting and kitschy and interesting. No Googie stars, but lots of those arches and points I love so much. At the end of the book, the authors provide a catalog of pieces found on the show, along with the designer and which episodes the pieces are found in.This is a very niche book, but I think it is exactly the sort of thing that a fan of both Star Trek and mid century modern design can get into easily.

And she tweeted back, ""Me neither until I started researching I tweeted to the author: ""I kind of didn't think TV really existed before I Love Lucy."" And she tweeted back, ""Me neither until I started researching this book!""But of COURSE there was television before I Love Lucy. Lucy tends to overshadow much of what went before because she was not only super popular in her day, but syndication makes sure she has remained popular in perpetuity. But it's not just Lucy that hid the early days of early television. See, as a culture, we tend to think of ""early TV"" in the way that the advertisers and producers and, heck, politicians at the time thought about it: patriarchal, with the happy female homemaker in the kitchen and 2.5 kids running around like scamps. It's not how reality ever was, but because this was such a pervasive image in the formative years of TV, it sticks in our minds - both as what TV was and what America was. We were fed lies that made us forget the pioneering women who made television possible. Gertrude Berg, who took her radio serial, The Goldbergs, about the exploits of a Jewish-American family living in New York onto live TV. Irna Phillips, who invented soap operas, starting with The Guiding Light. Hazel Scott, the first African American to host a national evening variety program. And of course, Betty White, was one of the first women to produce, write, and star in her own show ... and who is still shining today. All these women helped force people to sit up and notice TV, and notice the women at the center of the programs they watched and loved. Hazel Scott refused to play pickaninny characters - or maids, or servants - preferring to play herself and to sing her swinging versions of classic songs. And she was heard. Betty White, who co-starred on a FIVE AND A HALF HOUR DAILY SHOW that was mostly improv, before she became a talk-show host and early sitcom star. It's kind of astounding to discover this rich history, and to learn how it was all swept aside in the wake of McCarthyism, the Red Scare, and post-WWII patriarchy, as men realized they could wrest control over the airwaves.In a lot of ways, When Women Invented Television is frustrating. To learn that Gertrude Berg - who basically invented the sitcom - was seen as possibly ""too Jewish"" to hold down new shows is insane. Even more insane is how they tried to tone down the Jewishness of Fran Drescher and Jerry Seinfeld, believing that Jewish sitcoms could not be popular. And this is like FIFTY YEARS after Berg had her first successes. Hazel Scott should have paved the way for a whole generation of talented Black women, but she was labeled a Communist (though she was anti-Communist) and eventually the white men in charge decided she wasn't worth the hassle. These women's stories are structured as inspirational, and they are ... but the codas are a little sad. You start off with the knowledge that these pioneering careers are mostly forgotten, but you forget that as the stories continue and success starts to pile up. None of those successes were really built to last ... except, of course, in the case of Betty White, who is still going strong in her 90s. At least, the book seems to be saying, one slipped through. It's not enough, but it'll do. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 30, 2021","Sep 07, 2021","Aug 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54236116-when-women-invented-television

The fees are almost astronomically high ... and you'd better pay them. Because the way Ehrengraf assures that his clients are innocent is by making sure someone else is guilty - by fair means or foul. Mostly foul.The cool thing about this collection is the thing that some of its detractors seem to hate. The stories follow a basic formula. A client comes to Ehrengraf needing to beat a murder rap. Cut to: the client meeting with Ehrengraf some time later, discussing how they beat that rap, with attendant exposition and often some gory details. We rarely see Ehrengraf kill or forge or break and enter up close; everything is inference, and viewing everything from something of a cold distance is even more unsettling. For me, the best part of these stories isn't ""How is Ehrengraf going to set his client free,"" but ""How is Lawrence Block going to twist the formula to make THIS story fresh and exciting enough?"" I love how he makes the absolutely guilty innocent. I love how sometimes he has to walk back someone's innocence and make them guilty again. I love it when his characters try to get out of paying Ehringraf, and what happens. All of it is sneakily exciting, and fun in a detached, yet thrilling way.

It was getting some great notices, but mainly I was into the title. Nightbitch. What a strange and thrilling name for anything. Then I found out it was about a woman who believes she's turning into a dog. Sold. A++, no notes. I'd probably have liked it if it was the sort of straightforward tale I'd initially thought it was. I'm a sucker for werewolf stories and this seemed at least adjacent to that. What I got was a lot more thought-provoking. I keep wanting to describe it as ""post-partum lycanthropy,"" even though that's not entirely right. I also want to call it a feminist work that plumbs the weird world of inherent bias against women and mothers, and how that bias extends to the women's and mothers' sense of their own capacities. It is that, absolutely; one of the novel's most interesting and provoking points is that believing you have no support structure doesn't mean you don't ACTUALLY have a support structure. Sometimes you just have to ask. But that's not it, not all of it. We find ""the mother/Nightbitch/MM"" at a crossroads in her life, in her motherhood, and in her career as an artist. She's at the breaking point. We don't know if her belief that she's turning into a dog is all in her head, all real, or something in between. I'm pretty sure we get answers eventually, but I'm not positive. There's an interesting intersection here of magical realism and horror and straightforward drama that is fascinating and compelling to experience. How much of the mother's life is a performance? How much of the performance is her life? Where does art end and motherhood begin, and vice versa? And does she really eat living rabbits with her jaws?I hesitate to call this book thought-provoking, even though it is, because that term comes with a lot of baggage. It doesn't explain how much FUN this book is. You keep expecting the mother's acceptance of her more feral self to hurt her in some way - estrangement, castigation, ridicule. We are instead treated to the idea that commitment to your authentic self can actually set you free, and it's told in such a way that you believe it entirely.

I make it a point to buy these Lawrence Block anthologies because Block is one of my favorite writers (#3 after Stephen King and John Irving, right before Ann Patchett and and John Steinbeck), and I like to support my favorite writers. Unfortunately, what often happens when I pick up an anthology like this, I read one and a half stories and then put the book down and I'm like, do I really want to stop and start like this all the way through? It's weird. I'm weird.And as it turned out, I'm also wrong. I DID want to stop and start all the way through. This collection (ha!) is so strong, story in and story out, that it eventually stopped feeling like a collection of stories and started to feel like one piece. A BOOK rather than A JUMBLE OF TALES. The deeper I got into Collectibles, the more the volume took on the resonance and excitement of a novel.Will there be ghosts? Maybe (Junior Burke's ""The Evan Price Signature Model""), but not necessarily terrifying ghosts. How about crimes and double-crosses? Yes, to great effect in Joe Lansdale's ""The Skull Collector"" and ""Devil Sent the Rain Blues (Pm 13040),"" by David Rachels. Dark hearts abound in Dennis Lehane's masterful ""A Bostonian (In Cambridge)"" and Block's own ""Collecting Ackermans,"" but there are plenty of good souls, too - look no further than S.J. Rozan's ""Chin Yong-Yun Meets a Mongol,"" or ""Bar Wall Panda,"" by Rob Hart. This collection is bursting with stuff I didn't know I needed. Gay mafiosos (thank you, Thomas Pluck), comic book nerds who have to decide whether or not to be villains (Alex Segura), and a wacked-out Marilyn Monroe robot from the future, thanks to Joyce Carol Oates and her ""Miss Golden Dreams 1949.""I at least liked every single story in this collection, but loved most of them. There were so many endings I didn't expect, so many twists I didn't see coming. I especially liked the excerpts from Otto Penzler's Mysterious Obsession, a memoir of rare books he's collected over the years. I am a sucker for stories about books, especially the ones people cherish and fall in love with. And this right here is a book I fell in love with and am going to cherish. Plus, it introduced me to a bunch of writers I didn't know before that I now need to read more from.

A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream (and even more obscure ones like Silent Night, Deadly Night and Leprechaun) are real-life events. The women who survived their killers - usually by ""blooding,"" killing their potential murderers - are known as ""final girls,"" as they are in those movies horror fans love so much. So in this alternate reality, what happens to those final girls after the slashing is done? Who do they become?The answer lies in the title, but that's just the beginning of it. We narrow in on our hero, Lynette Tarkington, who attends the group monthly with her fellow survivors. There's some tension here, because Lynette isn't ""really"" a final girl. She merely played dead while her killer cut a swath through her family and several cops on Christmas Eve. Those events (and their ""sequel"" - another meta touch in a book that's beyond meta is how the remaining final girls are actually targeted again and have to keep surviving) have haunted Lynette so deeply that she's built literal indestructible walls around herself, and adhering to an OCD routine that is so byzantine it borders on madness. Beyond that, the group is falling apart. One of the big questions of TFGSG is how long a person should relive trauma before it stops being healthy and starts being a habit. The book also wonders what it says about a society that reveres slasher films, and how when we talk about them, we don't often talk of the dead or even name the final girls. These are films about Freddy, Jason, Michael, Leatherface, Ghostface ... and their attendant body counts. That Freddy Kreuger, a literal child murderer, could have become a pop culture icon is a little bit bizarre. I can't say anything. I still have my Freddy glove I got when I was twelve. One of the reasons the women in TFGSG find it hard to move beyond their worst experiences is because movies have been made about their lives. Not documentaries, but slasher films. In one of the book's interstitial epistolary excerpts, people actually rank the series best to worst, reveling in the bloodiness of these exploitative films. Maybe the final bow that ties this whole meta package together is that it is, in itself, a slasher story. The final girls are being targeted, and the only one that seems to want to do anything about it is the one no one believes: our hero Lynette. Because she's crazy, just like Nancy was crazy in the first Nightmare movie, or like Laurie Strode was crazy in Halloween. We follow Lynette as she proves and disproves her own theories, gets arrested, almost gets killed, and eventually faces her monster for the last time. An interesting subtext in this novel is what purpose a slasher film serves in a world where mass shootings are disturbingly commonplace; what use is bringing a machete to a gun fight? I like that we got all the answers to those questions, and that the big finale felt, well, final. I was wondering if Hendrix was going to set the book up for a sequel, which might have been interesting. I suppose he could, and I'd definitely read it, but I really like the way things are now. Damage happens, but it can be dealt with. The monsters don't always win. Sometimes, the final girl lives another day, and doesn't have to fight to do it.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 11, 2021","Aug 18, 2021","Aug 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55829194-the-final-girl-support-group

At first, it seems like a greatest-hits sort of book. What it lacks in bears and Amsterdam, it makes up for in clairvoyant children and religious discourse (a la Owen Meany), circuses (Son of the Circus), a clinical look at the AIDS crisis (In One Person), transsexuals (The World According to Garp), and sexually aggressive older women (Until I Find You and ... well, most of John Irving's novels). But dig just a little bit below the surface and there's a rich, idiosyncratic novel that Irving tells just so well. It concerns a novelist (!) named Juan Diego, who is on a journey to Manila to fulfill a promise to a itinerant draft-dodger he'd met in his home country of Mexico. The destination almost doesn't matter, but the fact that Juan Diego spent his childhood in Oaxaca and the rest of his life in Iowa City gives him a feeling of displacement that he doesn't really ever shake. He's a little unstuck in time, too; while he's on his travels to Manila, his mind keeps insisting he remember his childhood in Mexico, and the sister with whom he'd spent it, and how he finally escaped. All the while, the novelist is caught between a mother and daughter (maybe?) who direct his travels and have sex with him. Muriel and Dorothy might also be ghosts, or angels, or some otherworldly sorts. One of the cool things about John Irving novels is that sometimes there's a supernatural element that kind of inserts itself but doesn't distract from the realism of the book. Is that magical realism? I don't know. I just kind of like it.I almost don't want to say this is a cozy book, because I don't know how cozy a book can be where bonfires of burning dead dogs, lion attacks, and tragic deaths involving AIDS-related complications can really be cozy. But I felt very safe inside the book, as I often feel safe in John Irving's hands. I find, as I get older, I can still be critical of novels ... but I can't be all that critical about re-reads, about the books by the novelists I really love. My responses to re-reads are emotional only. This book made me happy and sad in equal measure, and I loved reading it again.

And what might be approximating his real self, he’s both intelligent and thoughtful, reading Émile Zola and developing bonds with his fellow citizens. Add to this a third iteration of his personality, one who is busily crafting his life story as a novel, and you have a man whose many parts may not add up to a whole he likes.His final job puts Billy in the suburbs undercover for a few months, making friends with the neighbors and blending in. This might be the best part of the novel, reminding readers of the “living in the past“ section of 11/22/63, or the on-the-job trials of Joyland. One of King’s most exciting gifts is his alacrity with the mundane, making peoples’ everyday lives feel rich and thrilling. Billy easily makes friends with his neighbors and building-mates, none of it feeling forced. The fact that it’s all an act is one of the things that Billy has to reckon with later on in the book.His moral code throughout is that he won’t kill anybody who isn’t a bad person. But the question that nags at him, especially in the second half of the novel, is what makes a bad person. Can a bad person redeem themselves? Can a good person do bad things? Can an assassin who kills people for money balance the scales by saving a life?These questions haunt the second half of Billy Summers (in all senses). I’m not sure there’s any firm resolution, either, which is probably how it should be. That’s true of a lot of King novels. Speaking of: the classic Stephen King trope about the redemptive power of writing finds a new angle here, just when you thought there couldn’t be new angles. I love that King keeps finding those new angles. Just because we love our protagonist doesn’t mean he’s a good person. I’ve read crime novel after crime novel about antiheroes and criminals you root for, but this isn’t Lawrence Block’s Keller or Richard Stark’s Parker. Billy Summers is kind and sweet and a pretty great mentor. And he also kills people for money. Billy never lets us forget that, and Stephen King doesn’t either....more",Notes are private!,0,10,2,"Jan 26, 2023Aug 03, 2021","Jan 31, 2023Aug 06, 2021","Aug 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56852407-billy-summers

Collectively, we've been listening to this book for the past 10-11 weeks via the My Dad Wrote a Porno podcast; Jamie Morton, whose father (""Rocky Flintstone"") actually wrote this barely-researched, poorly-edited, and occasionally baffling erotic tale of intrigue and suspense, narrates this series of books while his friends Alice and James listen and comment. It's one of the funniest experiences ever, like MST3K for bad erotica, but it's also weirdly cathartic and, dare I say, involving?I believe it was in Book 4 when I realized I was actually caught up in the (almost completely nonsensical) story; there's some sort of accident, and we worry that Belinda (the, uh, titular star of this book series) might be dead. Like the readers who clambered onto London's docks for the next installment of Little Dorritt, I waited extremely anxiously for the next installment. My thoughts ACTIVELY turned to whether Belinda would be all right. Now here we are in Book 6, which gets off to a somewhat lugubrious start. I worried that, since this was the first of the books to be written after Rocky was aware of the podcast, the story would be more outrageous and/or less bonkers. Nope. Rocky has a style (?) that has evolved over the years, but he remains true to himself, his characters, and his readers. Yes, there is a full-on facial in the last chapter, but there's also such a reversal of fortune at the end that I was left genuinely shocked. Like, this ridiculous story I shouldn't care about that features so much perverse sex (furries! rimming! basically, all the good stuff!) and insane description that the shock ending shouldn't matter ... but it DOES.This experience, honestly, is like reading serialized novels - it's a filthy version of the Saturday Evening Post, or The Green Mile.

Fiction or nonfiction, he has a way with classic horror that I don’t find in a lot of contemporary authors. So when I say that the Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires is his best book, I’m speaking with some authority.I didn’t quite know what to expect from this one. I’m a sucker (ha!) for books about books, so I kind of assumed there would be some discussion of canonized books and then the folks in the book club would turn into the Scooby Gang and there would be a whole adventure-horror component.What I got was a lot more interesting, and revelatory. SBCGTSV has a lot of interesting things to say about big concepts about what “sticking together” and “saving the children” really mean, especially when you take class and race into the equation. The book is set in the early 1990s in the Deep South, where it’s worse to look embarrassed than to talk about how one of your neighbors might literally be a murderer. The sexism and intense adherence to unspoken rules and mores is enough to make a reader scream, so you can only imagine what it’s doing to Patricia, our hero, who no one believes when she does just that.There’s a part in the novel when I got so disappointed with Patricia that I very nearly gave up on the book. Then I didn’t and I am EXTREMELY glad for it. Her story isn’t the slayer adventure I thought and maybe hoped it would be. This isn’t that kind of horror. This is the horror where things in body bags won’t stay still, where women get impregnated by hellspawn, where children find lethal uses for dental floss. It’s harsh but it’s damned compulsive.I was already enjoying this book when I picked it up this morning and blasted through the final 3/4 of it in a white-hot heat. Sometimes the tension and terror were so amped that the slightest noise made me scream. I love books like that. And it occurs to me that I haven’t read a book like that in awhile.

If you like crime fiction, goes the party line, you'll like Parker. So I got in. And I ... didn't like Parker as much as I wanted to. I've had the same issue with Harry Bosch. Maybe we don't all have to like everything, even if it's by an author you like in a genre you adore. The last book I'd read in the series was called The Mourner, and I liked it so little that I didn't think I'd continue with the series.But the other thing I'd heard is that the books get better as they go along. New characters come in and they recur, changing the nature of the guy at the heart of things. The Rare Coin Score is where, I'd heard, that starts. So I jumped ahead and gave it a whirl. And what a whirl!It's standard Parker heist stuff. Good stuff. The first two sections are Parker setting up the score, the last two sections are fallout from the score, and the middle section, the one not from Parker's point of view, is all about the complications. It works so well here, as does the addition of an actual love interest for Parker. Claire is a great character, because she's neither a total sop nor is she a hard-as-nails tough broad.

Their methods, their tales of writing, and how they became writers in the first place. So when I found out one of my favorite writers, Lawrence Block, was going to publish a book about his beginnings, I thrilled at the notion. I've read enough essays and forewords by Block to know I like the way he talks about himself, never aggrandizing but not overly minimizing, either. He has always come to the subject of himself with a somewhat guarded interest, as if it's a topic he knows very well but doesn't entirely trust his main sources. It's a great way to write and a delight to read. The worry when it comes to autobiographies of creative people is that they're going to spend a lot of time looking for those signature moments in childhood that helped shape them. I understand why those are important, and they can be interesting when told correctly and with economy. Sometimes what we get is a mire in family history that's ... not as fascinating as the writer seems to think, Bruce Springsteen. People who admire someone's work are drawn to the stories of the work before the stories of the person behind it, I think, and I also think that if a writer is doing a good job, those things can become intertwined in a narrative. Lawrence Block does this so deftly in A Writer Prepares that it attains the pace and excitement of a Lawrence Block novel. The thrill comes not from whether Scudder will find the killer or whether Rhodenbarr will get out of the scrape he's found himself in, but whether Lawrence Block can pull another erotic novel out of the ether this month, so he can continue to make a living doing what he does best. Along the way, we delve into the heady world of pseudonyms, the grift of early publishing houses, and the mental state of a man who realizes, after writing dozens of novels, that he might be a very good writer indeed. This is the story of an apprenticeship, of a beginning. As such, we don't really touch at all on much of Block's major fiction; you won't find Scudder, Bernie, or Keller in these pages, aside from a brief mention or two. The magic of A Writer Prepares is that you don't miss the stories behind those stories much, because what we get is so compelling. I'd gladly read an entire book of Block's reminiscences in the publishing world, but I'm content with - and grateful for - this fascinating and often exhilarating look at the life of a novelist who becomes a writer. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 26, 2021","Jun 28, 2021","Jun 28, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57466395-a-writer-prepares

So many of them were heyday places, from the early days of the American tiki thing, so a lot of them were long gone - either fallen to the downturn of tiki in the 80s or simply shuttered for other reasons. The book got a little monotonous, because so many of the stories were, ""This wonderful place that everyone loved. It's now a desiccated ruin."" That's essentially how Lost Restaurants of Omaha operates. Here's a gleaming majestic place out of a literal dream and then it became a Wendy's until a fire razed it and they sowed the ground with salt. Okay, not quite that dire.

I wonder if it sold well.The major problem endemic to the book is that there's nothing overarching. Every chapter is well-researched and well-documented, and there are a lot of great photos throughout. But although a lot of the entries talk about how ""exotic"" the food in some of these restaurants was for Omaha at the time (Mexican! Seafood! Italian! Anything that wasn't steak!), it really only focuses on the success. ""Changing tastes"" seems to be the blame for most of these restaurants' demises, but Reiner doesn't really work to tie that together. The last essay in the book, about the chain restaurant Maxine's that was nevertheless more interesting than other Maxine's restaurants, just sort of ends. No epilogue or feeling that these essays were tethered together by any sort of thesis. It was like reading an online listicle - a fascinating one, and one that showcases a lot of this city's more exemplary places - but without hinting at a more trenchant meaning.

I was a little taken aback by the soap opera aspect, and the shark attack parts were not as exciting or interesting as I thought they might be. The problem with me is that I was comparing it to the movie, and the movie is one of the best, most exciting films ever made.One thing I didn’t know is that book and movie based on actual occurrences. Close to Shore is an account of the real shark behind Jaws, a great white that stalked the New Jersey shore in 1916, killing four people.The end of the book makes it very clear that this is aberrant behavior, and that great white sharks don’t usually behave this way. It also pushes the idea that the shark behind the 1916 attacks might actually not of been a great white. But all that is the back matter. The book understands why we have come to it. We want assurances that a single great white shark killed those people, that it went out of its way to do so, that it took a journey so unusual that it would seem silly if it had been in a movie. But it doesn’t seem silly in the book.Author Michael Capuzzo knows how to talk about shark attacks, managing to infuse terror into scenes when sharks simply graze a human (literally every part of a shark can hurt you, including its skin). But he also is a whiz at verisimilitude, Resenting us with the world of 1916, when swimming in the ocean was new, in the world seemed a lot more innocent. Capuzzo name drops authors, movie stars, and all manner of famous people in his pursuit of giving us an idea of what the Jersey Shore was like in the new 20th century and how a shark attack could go misdiagnosed for so long. I don’t know if this is a case of truth being more interesting than fiction, but I certainly liked this book a lot more than I liked Benchley’s Jaws.

I was in New York City two weekends ago, and browsing through a Barnes & Noble with my friend Jeff. This is a sentence that still seems weird for multiple reasons. I was with a friend of mine? I was in New York? I was in a bookstore? We wandered around the display tables playing our favorite game of ""how many have I read"" (Jeff inevitably wins; he's more into the zeitgeist than I am), and glancing through the new novels. And there on the cover of this new book I saw spraypainted rabbit face with a cruel red X through it. I've always had an affinity for rabbits, possibly because, according to the Chinese zodiac, I am one. So I picked it up. Euphoria intensifies. The Constant Rabbit is a novel about what happens in the United Kingdom fifty years after the Spontaneous Anthropomorphizing Event, in which eighteen rabbits (not to mention a handful of foxes, weasels, bears, elephants, gophers, and bees) became suddenly humanoid. Fifty years on, the rabbits are dealing with all the torments of underprivileged people - prejudice, hatred, and an ongoing othering. Just because the metaphor is thin doesn't mean it's clumsy; Fforde is too smart and too clever for that. The world-building and culture-building make this a gripping science-fantasy story beyond being just a polemic against racism, jingoism, and classism. Much of it is really just fun.Take the rabbits' propensity for Victorian-era naming, due to their affinity for Beatrix Potter books. Or their love of duels, and of bouncing, and their utter disregard for doors. It all makes sense, but it's also just foreign enough to rate the ire of hate groups (like ""Two Legs Good,"" the most virulent of the hominid-supremacy groups), who both hate and fear the rabbits, who mostly just want to be left alone. Our proxy into this story is a man named Peter Knox, a functionary at an anti-rabbit conglomerate run by an anthropomorphized fox and a bunch of hellish women and men who claim NOT to hate rabbits. The Constant Rabbit is mostly his story: how he realizes he's been doing evil things and pretending he's not, to befriending his rabbit next-door neighbors, to eventually being radicalized against the oppressive class. It helps that we like Peter, and his engaging daughter Pippa, very much; it makes his character arc far more enjoyable ... especially as the book comes to a close and things get, well, hairy.I'm supposed to have read Fforde by now. He writes fiction about fiction and that's some of my favorite fiction, but I've tried him before and wasn't engaged. Maybe I will be now. His inventive plot mechanics, his uniquely British (Douglas Adams-ish, specifically) humor, and his smart, well-written characters all worked for me in The Constant Rabbit, and I'm looking forward to seeing if they work for me elsewhere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 12, 2021","Jun 17, 2021","Jun 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52378911-the-constant-rabbit

In fact, Steinbeck was NEVER assigned to us in school, not even Of Mice and Men, which is both bizarre and lucky. I don't know if I would have sought him out later on and fallen so hard for his writing if I had been. And I know this novel/novella is a parable. It's a fairly obvious one, but I wonder how obvious it seemed when it was first published. The whole concept of money (or power) corrupting a person is a standard trope in fiction. Here, we have two dirt-poor people named Kino and Juana who, because their tiny baby has been stung by a scorpion and have to bring it to a corrupt doctor who will only treat those with money, have to find a way to make money quickly. So Kino dives for a pearl and ends up finding a gigantic one. You can see how this plays out. The villagers are first joyful, then jealous. The corrupt doctor decides to finally treat little baby Coyotito, who he POISONS and then HEALS, to prove his power to these people. Then they bring the pearl to some bankers who try to stiff him on the price, so Kino is all like, ""Okay, well I'll go somewhere else because this thing is worth a lot more than you want to pay me.""And then ... he is continually and systematically punished. I mean, people come to his house and try to steal his pearl. They send trackers after his family with rifles. They burn his house down. They force him on this long trek to a capital city and he doesn't even get there because (SPOILER ALERT FOR A REALLY OLD BOOK)the trackers try to kill Kino and shoot the baby instead. Like they shoot the top of the kid's head off.So, the moral here is supposed to be that money corrupts, right? Maybe the guy should have taken a thousand pesos for this pearl so the rich can get richer. Like, all Kino wants is for his son to learn how to read so that the rich can stop taking advantage of him. Maybe I'm missing the point of the book. It's very well-written, because it's Steinbeck, but ""a poor person finally gets a chance to get a leg up and is punished so fucking hard for it"" feels like shit.

My love of crime fiction stretches back almost as long as my love of horror, and yet I'm still catching up with the classics. The way I came to the genre was Robert B. Parker, on my friend Tracey's recommendation. From there, I discovered Harlan Coben and Dennis Lehane, and I've worked my way forward and backward, trying to fill in the gaps. Hard Case Crime, the publisher specializing in reprinting classic out-of-print crime fiction and new stuff written in the style, has been a big help. Raymond Chandler has always been slightly out of reach. He's a little like Hemingway, even though he makes fun of the man in this book. Everything's a classic and everything's canon. He feels like a tall wall to climb, even though he was writing in a genre many people consider to be lowly and second-rate. What a difference eighty years of re-evaluation and veneration can do. Last year, I read The Big Sleep, the first featuring private dick Philip Marlowe, and I liked it a lot. I liked Farewell, My Lovely a lot too, but so much of it puzzled me. Was I reading it wrong? I loved the language and the tone of the book, but the plot kept seeming to slither out of my reach. In preparation for writing this, I glanced at the novel's Wikipedia page, and it seems that plot confusion was either a circumstance or a feature, not a bug. The book was a ""fix-up,"" a novel cobbled together out of short stories. Chandler apparently didn't care overmuch if the plot made sense, so long as it felt good. And this book feels good. There's a jewel heist maybe? A black man gets killed early on and the n-word was unavoidable for a while; it was almsot okay when the corrupt cops and idiots were using it, but I was taken aback when Philip Marlowe did, too. Also, maybe a gay guy also got killed? It was hard to keep track. But I kept coming back to the language, and how Marlowe isn't some tough guy who couldn't be hurt or waylaid. There's one really trippy sequence where he's been injected with hallucinatory drugs and he's knocked out for awhile. He gets hit on the head a LOT. What's interesting about him is how he keeps going. And! He's not above finding out the good in people, either. I love that he and this earnest cop become sort-of buddies. The High Window is next, and it's the first of Chandler's novels not based on previous stories.

Even though the years of my deep obsession with it seem to be over and I've become more of a dabbler, the period of my life when I was more into it than almost anything stick with me. When I gain new over-arching interests, I don't give up on the old ones. Some head into the background and some just continue to insist themselves on my life. I didn't stop being into cheese because tiki swooped in, Blitzen Trapper didn't make me forget Springsteen, and Ann Patchett could never usurp Stephen King. But when you focus on a thing you like, even if you move on and develop new interests, that thing has a tendency to stick in your brain like a fly in amber. You position it at a time and place in your life when it had the most meaning, and in a lot of ways, it's always that. Frank Coniff, aka TV's Frank, was a big part of what made MST3K important for me, and only part of that was because I was extremely attracted to him at the time. So maybe it stands to reason that I assumed this book was going to be Conniff's fond, in-depth memories of all the times they had putting together this show that helped me stay sane during my fringe years. What I realized is something I've known all along about creative people and the art they make: they don't stay mired in it as long as the people who love it do. In this slim book of essays, Conniff uses his time at MST3K and the movies they riffed as a springboard to talk about other stuff: obscure pop culture, some politics, and, most revealingly, himself. While he doesn't go too in-depth, Conniff takes some time out of riffing on things to talk about his early years of drug and alcohol dependence, and how that profoundly affected him. There's one part near the end when he confesses that he wishes he could have enjoyed TV cop shows of the 70s when they were first on, but that he was too busy fucking up his life with addiction at the time. That's such a specific lament, and it's worth the price of this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 29, 2021",Jun 2021,"May 31, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31458013-twenty-five-mystery-science-theater-3000-films-that-changed-my-life-in-n

She likes the uniform look of the Penguin series from the 60s, as well as the types of books series they have in Italy that they don’t really have an America. On the other hand, the idiosyncratic look of Virginia Woolf’s books, designed by her sister Vanessa Bell, inspire her. (For good reason. I looked up those covers and they’re beyond awesome.)I may not know what I was hoping for. Compare and contrast? Painted covers vs photographic? Unsure. Lahiri is uncomfortable with accolades, statistics, and (her least favorite word) blurbs. For her, they are barriers between a writer and their reader. I can see that. You don’t want anyone’s words on a book before you’re allowed to present your own.I think maybe the most interesting part of the book is when Lahiri I was looking at her own books, and the jackets that go with them. As a writer of Indian heritage from America writing in Italy, she has a diverse background for writing, while her book covers tend to just show the Indian stuff: elephants and castles and the Ganges.

Stephen King has long talked about this being his best and/or favorite novel of his own, which always struck me as a little weird. Yes, it has to do with King's favorite subject of writing, specifically what it puts into writers and what it takes out of them. In more recent years, King has taken a deeper look at marriage and love, and what lies at the heart of people who have long histories together. Bag of Bones explored this brilliantly, and there's some of that in Duma Key and the novella ""A Good Marriage."" Lisey's Story is about both the light heart and the dark heart of a marriage, and why they coexist.My complaints about the book have generally stemmed from the fact that most of the novel isn't Lisey's Story at all; it's her dead husband's Scott's story, and, to a lesser degree, the story of her sister Amanda. Lisey is important but she's far from the only important part of the novel. Jessie Burlingame, to my mind, had more agency than Lisey Landon. But I latched on a little more to what King was trying to say. I think the book is a long mediation on grief, and how grief doesn't come all at once. Not everything in this book is a symbol, but I think there's a lot more symbolism going on than I thought. Amanda is Lisey's way of reconnecting with her family. The psycho Jim Dooley and what happens to him is her way of letting go of the writer side of her husband. She has to let him go - two years of grief is enough - and it always bugged me that Scott's last story, what he called Lisey's Story, wasn't about her but about how he killed his father. Now, I think, it feels like it WAS for her, because it's a way of telling her how to let go of the people you love. How it's necessary, even if you love them. I've always admired this book, but found it a little hard to love. Now, as we anticipate the new miniseries, I think I might have come around to loving it finally.

My husband just bought Skyward Sword for the Switch. I'm considering writing a short story set in a development office. There's a whole thing going on in my head.But a lot of that's fiction. For years, I've heard horror stories about the gaming industry; the long, untenable hours, the burnout, the layoffs, the hellish term crunch. All the terrible things game developers have to go through, with no assurance that they won't get laid off after, or the company won't get shut down, or you won't have to move your entire family cross-country. It's a particularly scary way to live and work, and a lot of people in the industry put up with it because it has long seemed the only way. Schreier's book delves deep into the lives of people behind the biggest games in today's industry. I was sort of hoping for a deeper history at first - pocket histories of entertainment industries are my bread and butter - but the more I learned about these companies and the people they marginalized, the more I grew fascinated. You tend to only hear success stories - how Bioshock Infinite was such a humungous hit - but never about the tragic backstories of those successes. I learned a LOT about Curt Schilling, the Red Sox pitcher who thought it would be fun to run a video game company, and ended up bankrupting the business and almost destroying the economy of an entire state and kind of fucked over everyone with his hubris. And I learned about how things might be changing in the industry, due to consultancy firms and unions.If all of this sounds staid and dull, I assure you, it's not. Schreier keeps things going at a fast, exciting pace, always giving you enough information to understand his context but never bogging you down. It's smart and fun to read.

In anticipation of Project Hail Mary coming out, I read a few s saying his second book, Artemis, was no good. Strong disagree; in the parlance of this new book: wrong wrong wrong. I loved Artemis, maybe even more than The Martian.And I loved Project Hail Mary more than either.The setup is similar to that of The Martian: it's a guy trapped in space, trying to solve a massive problem using science. A brilliant cavalcade of diverse smart people back on Earth are also working to solve the problem, with nations working together with little rancor or problem. One of the most exciting things about Weir's novels is that the casts are cosmopolitan and mainly focus on smart people using the scientific method to solve issues. Things go wrong. Smart people can do dumb things. Mistakes can be made. But science and fact are at the heart of it all. It's immensely comforting.The problem here is that an invasive species known as astrophage is kind of sort of eating the sun. The earth is cooling way faster than it should (one of the ironies of the book is that our terrible global warming crisis actually saved us a bit). Middle school science teacher Ryland Grace was the guy who figured out what astrophage was, so even though he's not technically one of the world's elite scientists, he gets dragged along, helping the other science people to figure out what to do.The issue is that the book is told in split narrative: the now and the then. We know Ryland is out in space from the very beginning. He gains his memories back slowly, a trickle at a time. And only as we're closing in on the end do we understand some of the darker secrets about his placement in the mission, and why he's there. I honestly don't want to give too detailed a , because figuring all this stuff out along with Grace is so honestly thrilling and charming and fun. Are there dad jokes? Sure there are. That's part of Weir's charm. And yeah, there are pop culture references, but I've seen Weir's work compared to something like Ready Player One, and it's not that at all. He references something and then moves on; science is what drives this book, not memories of Super Mario Brothers 2. (Not that there's anything wrong with Ready Player One! This is just a different experience.)Occasionally I would wonder if I was going to get over my head with the math and science in this. Never once did it matter. Ryland Grace trusts in that stuff, so you can, too. If you just accept that he knows what he's talking about, you don't ever get bogged down.

It's not the book's fault, and it's not Donald Westlake's fault. If anything, you could kind of blame the world opening back up, and the fact that my own novel has decided to capture my life again. You see, my friends Tracey and Liz are doing this thing where they wake up at 5:30 AM every day and work on writing and the idea was so alluring that I started doing just that. The problem is, the morning time with my coffee used to be when I would read physical books and not let any of the outside world distract me. The pandemic was great for a lack of distraction. It's all back now, and it's why it took me nearly a month to finish a book that should have taken me two days.Here are two things to know about Castle in the Air: 1. When the front cover says, ""First publication in 40 years,"" that means 1980. That means this book is a classic crime novel, and that classic crime novels were coming out in my lifetime. It means I'm old, and so is the rest of the GenX and geriatric millenial crime-come-latelies who are discovering Westlake and Hard Case Crime just now. 2. This book is hilarious. It's hilarious. And I didn't expect that, because even though Westlake is known for his funny crime novels, especially the Dortmunder stuff, I have never read any of it. I've read the novels he wrote under his Richard Stark name, which are also heist novels, but they tend to involve a lot of murder. I've also read Memory, which is stunningly good but extremely serious, and his two dark thrillers, The Ax and The Hook. All fantastic. Very few chuckles.So when I'm in the first few pages of this book, which involves an extremely convoluted plan to steal an ACTUAL CASTLE, and I'm laughing a little reluctantly because ... wait is this funny? And then I realize it's a caper set in Europe, and there are factions of Italian, Spanish, British, and German people working together, none of whom speak each others' language, and that there are double- and triple- and quadruple-crosses afoot. And there's an entire who's-on-first chapter where Westlake is reveling in language and its flexibility and okay. Okay. I know what's happening now. And it's good. Like, really good.

I’ve delved into spinoff subjects, like lowbrow art, Hawaii in the 1950s, and mid-century kitsch. The work of Sven Kirsten informed a lot of what I was reading; his massive The Book of Tiki was one of the major forces in bringing about the tiki revival worldwide. I devoured that one, and all his other books, learning, obsessing, becoming - against all odds - a tiki guy.But one book eluded me. The big one. The sequel. Kirsten’s TIKI MODERN came out as the tiki revival was just gaining steam,and was thus able to look even deeper into what made this trend so durable. Lke its predecessor, it was massive and picture-packed, tracing the pop culture history of tiki, Polynesian Pop, and the concept of the ""modern primitive."" One of the more interesting aspects about Tiki Modern is that Kirsten doesn't shy away from the racism and misogyny inherent in a lot of early tiki; the images and utilizations of the ""beautiful wahine"" and the ""noble savage"" were always a little contentious, especially given the Civil Rights unrest of the time in which tiki was winding down. While Tiki Modern doesn't necessarily provide a key for reckoning with these issues while still allowing us to love this movement, recognizing it in a book as informative and important as this is a great step in the right direction.One of the early s of this book I read, while still trying desperately to find it, complained that it wasn't really about tiki at all, but about Witco, a company that made its name on wood carvings (often made with chainsaws) of tiki and primitive art - some of which was huge and functional, like seats, bars, and tables. I think Kirsten makes a good point that the ascendency of Witco is a big part of what made tiki such a big deal in its mid-century heyday, and how flexible the concept of tiki is, able to encompass cultures beyond what Americans understood as ""Polynesia."" (And of course, that's always been a part of the bizarre amalgamation of tiki in America: the art and decor is Polynesian, the drinks are Caribbean, and the food is Cantonese. So why not carvings based on African tropes and, yes, cliches?)Like all of Kirsten's books, Tiki Modern helped me better understand what was so alluring about this whole trend, why it captured middle America so completely, and why it was abandoned so abruptly. And I never would have owned it had it not been for that stimulus that hit my account a few short months ago. I paid down credit cards. I paid some bills. And then I went to AbeBooks and found a listing for a like-new copy of this gargantuan tome of tiki. It was expensive - maybe too expensive - but it was out of print and man, did I want it. And what was a stimulus for, anyway, if not to stimulate? Tiki Modern completely captivated me over a period of six days, and there's nothing more you can ask of a book....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 02, 2021","May 08, 2021","May 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/600589.Tiki_Modern

I honestly don't know much about it. It's about revolution, rising up against a fascist dictatorship. AnWe're in the middle of the Spanish Civil War. I honestly don't know much about it. It's about revolution, rising up against a fascist dictatorship. And there's a man at the center of it, the incongruously named Robert Jordan, who, in this reality, did NOT write the Wheel of Time series. And his orders are to blow up a bridge. That's it, that's the whole story. But it's not. Because over the course of the four days (well, three days, as we are reminded sadly at the end), the whole bloody war plays out. It sounds so trite to say this minor act in a major war stands as a metaphor/synecdoche for the whole war, but it's inescapable. Maybe it's a metaphor for war in general. It's not just about Robert Jordan, an American schoolteacher who finds himself a soldier. It's also about a group of guerilla fighters across enemy lines with whom he must team up in order to blow the bridge and complete his mission. Much of the story is about them: the beautiful, nearly broken Maria; the strong and commanding Pilar; the shifty, untrustworthy Pablo; the aged, reliable Anselmo. More. Some of the personalities bristle at first, almost everyone fitting into a ""type."" But then sketches of traits become real people. The strong woman in charge makes a mistake. The distant Jordan falls in love. A pretentious fop has reserves of bravery. Nobody is who they first seem. That's a big part of why this book works as well as it does.But it's also the machinations of war. The waiting for the right moment, driving people mad. The bureaucracy, the untrustworthiness, the desperation. The seeming futility of war matched against the desire to do one's best, even past the point of endurance. There are harrowing backstories: terrible things the fascists did to the resistance, unspeakable things the resistance did to the fascists, and Robert Jordan's quiet, all-too-apt family history in which he resents his father and idolizes his grandfather, stances he might be recanting near the end of the book. Hemingway manages to encapsulate the horrors of war - and the brief, fleeting moments of beauty people have to find to survive - without going full gore and by using the actual word ""obscenity"" in the place of obscenities. In a more modern book, that wouldn't fly, and it seems silly at first ... and then it just becomes part of the fabric of this story. You can get used to anything, and maybe that's a meta-commentary on what this book is about. War is numbing and harsh and terrible, but you can get used to it, if you have to. Even if doom hangs over everything you do, you can get used to it. And if you have to die, do it with dignity, and do it fighting. I had no idea Our Year(s) of Covid were going to spur an interest in Hemingway. This feels a lot like when I got into Vonnegut a few years back. I'm interesting in knowing more about him now. Over the course of the last year or so, I've read Hemingway's Big Three: this one, A Farewell to Arms, and The Sun Also Rises. Not to mention A Moveable Feast, my favorite of his books. It remains to be seen if I dip back into The Old Man and the Sea or try one of his lesser books. I really liked this one, even though I don't generally like war stories, and I had my own issues with the character of Maria (who might make more sense if we know she's suffering extreme PTSD), but yeah.

I was at a Stephen King convention at 21 when I first got drunk, on whiskey sours in little bottles by my new friends I wanted to impress. I drank very little since then until I was at a work function, and my friend Jenny had me try a ""cabana boy,"" which is Malibu rum and pineapple juice. I loved it. I'd found my drink. Over the years, that was my drink of choice wherever I went. If alcohol was being served, I'd grab that. If it wasn't available, or if I was feeling adventurous, a Malibu and Coke would do. I was in a holding pattern. Then came tiki bars. It started with Trader Sam's Grog Grotto in Walt Disney World and sort of exploded from there. I loved discovering all these different exotic cocktails and finding out why I liked them and why I didn't. I didn't give all that much thought to the rum itself. Even when I started buying rum in mass quantities in Our Pandemic Year, I basically followed what the recipe said. If it asked for a white Puerto Rican rum, I'd grab a John Q Cristal. If it wanted dark Jamaican, Myers always did well. Then and still now, I was never really a rum connoisseur. I like what it does when it mixes with other things, and I'm unsure if I'm ever going to go beyond that. But it still fascinates me.My friend Josh gifted me Wayne Curtis' And a Bottle of Rum for Christmas, and I'd been eager to read it ever since. I love these history lessons when viewed through the lens of something specific (as I had when I read The History of the World in Six Glasses, because I apparently have a penchant for pop history books on beverages). (HA! ""Pop."" Beverages. Well I thought it was funny.)Books like this are always packed with awesome stories and surprising facts, like the one where we learn that, at least initially, Captain Morgan wasn't all that into rum. How rum got big during the Depression, then sank, then got big again after WWII. It's fascinating to me how relatively often rum goes from classy to tacky and back again. Does any other spirit do that? We start way back in the 1600s, when rum was called Kill-Devil, all the way to the 2010s, to the recent microstill movement in the States. Along the way, we learn about piracy and slavery, the tiki movement and Paul Revere's ride, and so, so much about Hemingway and Cuba. It's all fantastic. I'm a slow reader but I absorbed this book, and not just because of the tiki connection (although I will say whenever I'm about to dip into the Donn Beach or Vic Bergeron story again, I always feel a little cozy. It's the whole ""I know this history; how is this guy going to tell it?"" Really well, it turns out.)I'm in the phase in my obsession when satellite obsessions are finally coming to the fore. I've now read a book on lowbrow art, and about Hawaii in the 1950s, and now the history of rum. Tiki is endless, and there is still so much more to discover and explore.

This is an alternate history, and women do exist for breeding, but that’s really where the similarities end. All you need to know is that a pandemic swept the still-forming United States and the country no longer exists as it had. (Hm.) Now women are expected to marry young and produce many children. If they’re barren? They are witches, and will likely be hung.Ada, our hero, is an apprentice midwife; her mother is the town’s most respected medical person. But when Ada is barren, the town starts blaming all its other ailments on her. If someone’s child dies, it’s because of the witch. If there’s an outbreak of flu, it’s because of the witch. Ada knows she can’t stay in town, or she will be killed. So she becomes an outlaw.Most of this awesome novel concerns what happens when Ada meets up with the Hole in the Wall Gang, a group of banished women who have also become outlaws by necessity. How Ada fits in. How she fails and succeeds. And how, most importantly, she unearths the purpose in herself. One of the best things about this book is that the women at the center are so vehemently defined by what they can’t do that they have to fight to be redefined by what they can do, and by who they are. A note: I’ve read a few books with enby characters, and this one seems to handle the language and nomenclature the best. The lack of pronouns for the character - eschewing even “them” - never really stands out as arch or working too hard to define them. They just are, and that was really refreshing.

One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the way Bythell goes into peoples’ houses and looks at their collections, purchasing what he can. He talks about how difficult it is to purchase libraries of the recently deceased, some thing I never really would’ve thought of until I read this. Like, what happens when you want to be kind, but the books left behind are mostly trash? And because this is a proper diary, you get caught up in the episodic nature of it all. Someone briefly mentioned in a February entry becomes a major part of the story later on in the summer. But it’s not just the big stuff; it’s the way Bythell will find a book vaguely interesting, and pick it up. Six chapters later he’s nearly done and that’s almost as exciting to me as the run up to the book fair, or the parties around Christmas.I keep wanting to say that the author does a good job keeping this book from feeling like a standard bookshop memoir, but I’m not that sure there is a standard bookshop memoir.

I should have remembered my Michener, from whom I'd already read a fairly in-depth accounting of Hawai'i's leper colony on the island of Moloka'i. But Michener is sometimes long on events and short on human emotion; this story, delving into the life of Rachel Kalama, a young girl who, at the age of 7, contracts leprosy and and is sent away from her family forever. It's somewhat easy to look at a book of this nature and say, ""This character discovered in her exile how to truly live,"" and to treat the character as a series of stock heroics. ""Bearing up under the strain of both a disease she didn't ask for and a people who no longer want her, Rachel found freedom within."" Nope. Not that simple. Rachel has shit luck. She's born into a time in Hawai'i when the indigenous people had no natural defense against the disease. Calling it ""leprosy"" brings so many connotations, especially for Hawai'ians who had studied the Bibles left by missionaries. Lepers were not only ""unclean,"" they were pretty much unholy. Shipping them off to their own colony away from non-leprous people was seen as the best option. For whom remains one of the most trenchant questions of the novel.Against the odds, Rachel makes friends on Moloka'i, which is great. The only problem is, most of them are also lepers, and lepers tend to die early, after enduring both exile and often painful treatments to eradicate the disease. She meets a non-leprous boy who seems to love her, but who won't touch her. One of her favorite adults on the island goes through a spiral of guilt and shame and attempts suicide. The man she eventually marries ... well, there's no end to tragedy here.So why isn't Moloka'i a Hawaiian retelling of The Little Match Girl? Because Rachel herself is pretty damn awesome. She's not perfect, and boy does she suffer, but she's smart and does tend to be resilient. She decides not to give up every day, so she is noble, but not in a way that makes her feel like a stand-in for an entire people. She's just her, and just her is fascinating and interesting. Except for maybe the tsunami (at this point, it's like, can't this girl catch a BREAK!?), nothing in Moloka'i feels extraneous or harsh for harsh's sake.

This is a book about dictionaries, sure, but of course it's more about the people: one building the dictionary, and one dismantling it.

Mallory is dealing with a lot. Her job feels unimportant, she's not out of the closet (despite being in a loving, long-term relationship with a more fiery woman named Pip), and she keeps getting calls at work from a psychopath with a voice modulator, telling her they're going to blow up the building because Swansby's has de-gendered the definition of the word ""marriage."" It's a lot to take.Meanwhile, at the turn of the 20th century, we make the acquaintance of Peter Winceworth, a functionary lexicographer helping to create the first edition of Swansby's. He's forgotten by and dismissed by his co-workers, he has affected a lisp to gain sympathy, and he might be in love with a woman who is the fiancée of his greatest enemy, one of those rugged explorer types named Thrasham, who has a huge red beard and is everything Winceworth is not. These two narratives twist through one another, not quite connecting but not quite standing alone. Both Winceworth and Mallory need some sort of jolt in their lives to figure out what it is they really want. Both have people who care about them, even though they're in their own heads too intensely to understand why. And both stumble across secrets that change their perception of their small world. The more I think about the twin endings, the more I like them, and the more they seem like the absolute right finales for these two. What drives this novel is a love of words - real, made-up, imaginary. The language is so much fun, and when people banter, it's intellectual and satisfying. There are some grand action sequences you don't quite expect, which added and enriched the book. On the other hand, there's a long sequence involving a moth that freaked me out (my motteophobia is rampant), so I had to get over my crawling skin for a few chapters.

I was, believe it or not, on a Yoo-Hoo fan page, and one of the links led me to Coben's Myron Bolitar novels. Bolitar, a sports agent with a nose for solving murders, was a huge Yoo-Hoo (and Batman) fan. I didn't care thing one about basketball, or golf, or baseball, or any other sport. Yet I loved the Bolitar novels. They felt like detective miniseries on TV. Easy to follow, easy to digest, easy to move onto the next.That changed in 1998 with One False Move. I think a lot of series writers discover that, if they're going to keep writing about one character over and over, eventually you have to widen their world and deepen their stories. Coben (who, by the way, I was texting with over AOL around this time), proved more than capable of doing that. Myron Bolitar grew more complex, as did most of his supporting cast, including Esperanza Diaz and Big Cyndi. But Win, Myron's best friend with the preppy good looks and good breeding and the psychopathic streak, seemed to me at least to only grow into more of a stereotype. Win helped Myron with the stuff Myron was not prepared to do. He killed people if they broke his odd and complex moral code. He had a lot of sex with prostitutes and filmed himself doing it, so he could watch the videos later while he meditated. He was a misanthrope, perhaps unable to care for anyone but himself, Esperanza, and especially Myron. In later books, he had a somewhat casual relationship with a woman named Mee, but that seemed more convenient than anything. From his name to his background to his wealth and privilege, Win was something of an antihero trope. You're maybe not supposed to GET him, but you are supposed to grudgingly like him. His awful qualities are what make the good-guy characters look better, and put him in a very appealing gray light.I was excited for a book just about him, but not necessarily because I thought the character could prop up a whole story. This pandemic has been just gross, and Harlan Coben had been with me at the start with The Boy in the Woods. All I wanted was another novel by him, and it didn't matter if it was ill-advised or not.Okay, so: or not. There's something that happens with charismatic lunatics in series, be they TV series or book series: in order to make them more broadly appealing, they get a little watered down. It happened a little with Spike on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's happening with Loki in the MCU. It sort of happened with Hawk in Robert Parker's Spenser series. But it didn't happen in Win, and that's sort of thrilling.Win, for all his issues, is not only capable of self-reflection; he's awash in it. One of the best things Coben does early on in this book is establish that Win is capable of realizing he's not perfect, that he can learn from past mistakes and misdeeds, and improve himself. A lot of his supporting cast is multicultural. He's given up the prostitutes for a hookup app that is still pretty skeezy but is more inclusive in its skeeziness. He has glimmers of affection for other characters.Oh, and Win still kills people. Oh, does he. And sometimes he tortures them. The mystery is a pretty thoroughly engaging one; Coben's favorite theme of the past coming back to haunt the present is very much in evidence here, but the circumstances are fresh enough so that the cozy feeling of coming home is offset by the political nature of the whole thing. There's a lot about stolen art and horrifying torture and endless revenge, and all of it's satisfying. I kept waiting to be disappointed that Myron was not at the center of things, but Win can absolutely hold his own here. Besides, Myron comes up enough that you're not really given the chance to miss him.Are there things I didn't like? Nah, not really. I could nitpick about Coben's literary tics, but if I'm gonna be distracted by every ""there you are,"" I'd have to roll my eyes at John Irving's semicolons or Stephen King describing someone crying ""lustily."" It's part and parcel. What Harlan Coben did here was deliver me a good story featuring a well-known and well-liked character and made it feel new and fresh. I want a second Win novel now. That'd make it a Win-Win. (Hey, Coben did it first.) ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 17, 2021","Mar 22, 2021","Mar 17, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53916157-win

I loved it, and woLast year, I picked up a hardcover copy of Pulp, a part-Western, part-noir bit of comic narrative by Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. I loved it, and wondered what else these two had done together. This is because I'm an idiot. I've long been familiar with the two names in comics. Brubaker (along with his partner Michael Lark) did a long run on my favorite comic, Daredevil, and also developed and co-wrote Gotham Central, a street-level look at cops in Batman's city. I loved this guy.But Brubaker/Phillips had really made their name in semi-independent crime and horror-noir (Fatale, Criminal, Incognito, The Fade Out), and despite this being directly in my wheelhouse, I avoided it all. Why? Well, I'd like to say it's because I wanted to preserve my favorite writers and artists for a rainy day or something. The truth is, even though I'm a sucker for noir, I hate smoking. I just hate it so much. And if a cover features a character smoking, I will not buy it. It's not that I've mellowed over the years, but The Scene of the Crime - an early 2000s neo-noir written by Brubaker, drawn by Lark, and inked by Phillips - caught me before I could change my mind. I've made a long habit out of rationalizing enjoying art when smoking is involved (being in love with Tarantino films has been a colossal effort), but in Scene of the Crime, my saving grace was that none of the three main characters did it, so I could be safe with them. It's absurd, I know. But it's how my brain has to work to help me like stuff like this. And I do like it. Quite a lot, actually. It's sort of a boilerplate mystery of missing persons, cults, unbelievable abuse, and a lone-wolf private eye with a Dark Backstory. What makes Scene of the Crime work so well is the characters, as is generally the case with crime fiction. Jack Harriman is a young detective trying to move past his demons; he kind of reminds me of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder, if he was a lot younger. I liked the color of San Francisco - kind of the prime locus of this kind of fiction (it makes me want to read more crime fiction from the 1940s) - and the fact that in this world, a crime-scene photographer can be famous enough to warrant a small museum dedicated to him. Lark's art reminds me a lot of David Aja's work in Hawkeye, a lot of heavy linework and a xerographic feel that makes everything a little grittier. I think I'm going to have to work through my phobia to read more work by these two, especially since The Fade Out is about old Hollywood, and oh my am I a sucker for that stuff. I'm really glad this story is back in print (with extras! a bonus story! behind the scenes stuff! a Bendis intro!) and I'm looking forward to a journey of exploration....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 16, 2021","Mar 17, 2021","Mar 16, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56220018-scene-of-the-crime

The main character, a kid named Samuel Hill, has been born with ocular albinism - red eyes. His mother, a devout Catholic, wants him to go to the Catholic middle school in town, but the headmistress thinks a child known as ""Devil Boy"" doesn't belong in place like that. Sam's mother's will is as strong as her faith, and she gets him into that school. But here Sam's troubles begin. I figured out halfway through that I was feeling a very distinct John Irving vibe in this book - the John Irving of A Prayer for Owen Meany and Avenue of Mysteries. It's a book about mothers and sons and faith. (Also, incidentally, I wrote a few books like this back in the day, so it made me feel connected to those mid-aughts novels of mine.) And it's a book about the hell people go through, and what rewards wait for them after all their trials.Did I like the book? Yes, quite a bit. I got more invested in the characters than I thought I would, especially Sam and his friend Mickey, a girl he may or may not be in love with. Occasionally, though, it felt as if the characters were becoming symbols. The plot machinations grew slightly more overt as we came closer to the end, where faith and the hidden, unknowable world of God sometimes became shortcuts in writing and character growth. I loved these characters very much, but sometimes I felt like their rewards didn't feel as earned as I wanted them to feel. But I'd recommend it, just the same. It's a literary novel written by a mystery and suspense writer, which means that it's got a lot of emotion but never bogs down in plot swamps. Smart, heartfelt, and very well written - despite my slight misgivings, I really enjoyed this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 11, 2021","Mar 16, 2021","Mar 11, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35995489-the-extraordinary-life-of-sam-hell

I was reading Slaughterhouse-Five when Vonnegut died and though I felt like a ghoul, I finished that book and then went into a Vonnegut mini-obsession. It's not as if I haven't read Larry McMurtry before, either. I loved The Last Picture Show and Lonesome Dove. I liked Loop Group, a weird one for me to pick up early (it was at the library and it looked approachable). His trilogy of creative memoirs - Books, Literary Life, and Hollywood - blew me away. I want to read all of those again.When I picked out Terms of Endearment, I didn't know McMurtry was about to die. It was on my to-read pile, near the top, when I found out he'd passed. So, what to do? Read this book as a tribute to his life or put it off in deference to his death? Does anyone else think of this stuff? Just me? You see, I remembered the movie version enough to remember the big stuff - particularly, the major death that colors the whole rest of the film. And I wasn't sure I wanted to read a book about death by an author who had died. I started it, then put it on a sort of indefinite hold. Eventually, I snuck around the other side and downloaded the audio version, and that's the one that I stuck with. Man, is it good writing. Now obviously I say this as a man reading a man's book about women (it didn't pass me by that for a time, I was reading TWO books by men about women, but that's kind of Grady Hendrix's thing so it almost didn't occur to me), but I found the characterizations of Aurora Greenway and her daughter Emma so well-drawn and fully realized that almost every other character felt a little like a cardboard cutout in comparison. I kept expecting to get annoyed with Aurora, who lives a loud, breezy, performative life ... and I didn't get annoyed, because these aren't exactly affectations. Or, if they are affectations, she believes in them completely. There's something so captivating about a person whose entire personality seems like a collection of clichés and idiosyncrasies, but whose real self is such a pure distillation of those very things that it's hard to separate what's overblown and what's at the core. To love Aurora - and people do love Aurora - is to understand that eccentricity is something you cope with and battle with, never quite winning, never entirely losing. The person who understands her the most, her daughter Emma, is an entirely different sort: practical, a little cynical, able to think in less grandiose terms and thus able to cope with a less fulfilling life. It's important that Emma understands Aurora, because it seems obvious that the understanding doesn't go the other way ... until it does, at the most crucial moments. Terms of Endearment is the story of two women whose lives intertwine, unravel, and come back together. Whose lives are radically different except in how very similar they are. The denouement of this one is as affecting as those in Last Picture Show or Lonesome Dove, maybe even more so. I loved this book. I just don't know as if I'll read it ever again.

This is one of those stories, and it's fascinating.Pacific Ocean Park had its beginnings way back at the turn of the 20th Century, and this book does a good job at crafting the prehistory of the park, the beach, and the pier before the actual park came online. And man, what an ambitious park! It's basically a Googie explosion, with a ""starfish"" entrance that reminds me the Theme Building at LAX. Lots of themed lands like Disneyland, including an undersea world (I got very, very enamored of the term dry-for-wet, a theme park phrase meaning that it's dry but it looks wet; I don't know how I've been in the theme park world this long and have never heard it), a space area, and a Polynesian Pop area with a working train at the far end of the pier. The skyway that took you from one end of the park to the other was made up of dangling plastic bubbles you sat in and saw the raging ocean below. There was a rollercoaster and an Enchanted Forest and so much else that made both my midcentury and theme park brains go bonkers.But the park - known as the P.O.P. (even when referenced in a Beach Boys song) - is no longer there. You know that going in, so this book has no choice but to become a tragedy. It starts with debt, of course, and the high cost of running an amusement venture. The salt air wreaking havoc on rides and facades. And, as things start getting a little seedier, in comes a new park runner named Jack Roberts, who's basically carny-from-carny. He brings in more pitch-til-u-win ventures, and off-the-rack rides. The more ambitious stuff falls into disrepair. By the end, even the shells of the old rides can't stand up against the powers of fire and water and decay. But along the way, there are a lot of bright sports. The outsized optimism in creating a themed environment like this in the first place should be applauded, and I loved how it coincided with the youth movement of the late 50s. All of it's captured in these awesome photographs and copies of old maps and souvenirs. So too, sadly, are the pictures of the park's eventual destruction - although even these are beautiful in their own weird way.

Back when we used to work at the bookstore(s) together (oh my god, we worked at three different bookstores together), we would compare notes about which kids' books we liked when we were young and impressionable. We'd both read the Judy Blume oeuvre, obviously. We were very sympatico on Taking Care of Terrific, which I was able to take out of the school library when they told me I was too young for That Was Then, This is Now. I don't know where Tracey stands on Beverly Cleary, except that she hates Dear Mr. Henshaw, because apparently she hates books about young boys whose parents are divorced and who develop an unhealthy attachment to a novelist; for some unknown reason, I kinda like that one.

I don't THINK I ever read this one. It's another of those books about weird kids, for weird kids ... so right up my alley. The kid here is Angeline, whose first word is ""octopus"" and who I was convinced was some kind of fish psychic, like Aquaman. Spoiler: she is not Aquaman. But she is kind of a genius, and she's kind of weird because of it, and she has a truly awful sixth-grade teacher who tries to convince her class that Cleveland is the capitol of Ohio. There's honestly a lot in here, from the aforementioned sadistic teacher, to lingering trauma, to the hardcore reality of high-pressure situations where there are no reasonable ways out. A lot of this book is silly (though there's an undercurrent of grief running through it you only grok when you're three-quarters of the way through), but it's honest. There are a few scenes where Angeline just straight-up loses her shit, and Sachar doesn't offer value judgments either way. It's freeing and draining at the same time.If you're a genius and you don't understand why your teacher doesn't want you to live up to your full intelligence, that can be a kick in the teeth. When your dad is your hero but he hates what he does that makes him a hero, that wears you down. Ditto being called a freak in school, and being in need of a friend who gets you.

I was familiar with Nichols & May due to a steady diet of Doctor Dimento as a youth. I was vaguely aware that he’d directed The Graduate, and that was because of Harris himself; I’d read his Pictures at a Revolution and was bowled over by it. Nowadays, I’m usually willing to trust an author I like, no matter what they’re writing about. That keeps working out for me.I wonder if knowing only a little bit about Mike Nichols worked in my favor, because the whole book was a continuing journey of discovery. We get the whole narrative, from his early days of working on two-person sketch comedy and improv with Elaine May, to his initial terror of directing plays and then movies, to his strings of hits and misses, to his uneasy time as an elder statesman. But it doesn't read like a novel, because Nichols's was idiosyncratic, and messy, and sometimes intense.I'm not sure if it's endemic to how Hollywood works (or used to work), but the way Nichols takes on huge projects seems almost accidental. Sometimes he stumbles into things. Sometimes he dares a studio to pay an outrageous salary, daring them to not hire him. Sometimes he basically begs to be convinced. It's as if, at least sometimes, he wants someone to drag him into something so that he'll have something to prove. Once he's inside a film or a play, Nichols usually seems to have a grasp on his talents. Before and after, he is a complete wreck. But that's not always, and that's a big part of the mystery of Mike Nichols. Anything can affect his confidence: drugs, weight gain, poor health, a misunderstanding of the project or the actors he's working with. Almost always, a project eventually clicks with him and that's satisfying. The few times when he seems completely at sea is so frustrating, but it makes you root for him more. That's one of the best things about this book: no matter what Nichols is doing or has done, you always root for him.And I have to applaud Harris for not taking the ""greatest hits"" way out of things. Often, when I read biographies about people, the focus is either on only their early career, with a gloss on the later stuff, or a ""they did THIS!!!! and then a bunch of stuff for years and THEN THEY DID THIS!!!"" Harris is just as fascinated as why The Graduate worked and why, in his opinion, Wolf didn't. (By the way, did you know Mike Nichols directed Wolf, with Jack Nicholson!? I didn't!

Except for the front cover, none of the work discussed in this volume was replicated or reproduced so that the story of the artist could compare to the art the artist made.It’s a valid criticism, and would hold more weight if we weren’t all reading books with tiny, extremely powerful computers in our pockets at all times. One of the joys I had reading this book, was coming across a title or description and scrambling for my phone so I could look up the art. One of the best things about having this sort of multimedia approach to this book is that if I liked a piece of art referenced, I could go down a rabbit hole of more art, looking up after twenty minutes had gone by, my head dancing from all the lowbrow.And the stories themselves are fascinating. Mostly what I’ve been interested in is tiki-centric, second wave Lowbrow art. I didn’t know it was second wave, and getting a little background on first wave was pretty interesting (lots of hot rods and pretty pinup girls). I also didn’t know we were currently in the third wave, much like we sort of are with tiki itself. Costa explains all of this with a deft touch, seemingly as enthralled with the subject as he hopes the reader is. And what’s not to be enthralled by? Hearing the backstories of Shag, Tim Buskup, Derek Yaniger, Brandi Milne, and Miles Thompson is illuminating, and grow even more so as the book progresses, when you see the influences and intertwinings of this underground world progress and unfold. I have some quibbles. Sometimes the book shifts into present tense for unknown reasons. It’s jarring and weird, but doesn’t shake your confidence in the fidelity of the storytelling. And of course, me being me, I came to this book as a tiki fan looking to read about art in the tiki milieu. That’s totally my fault, though; nothing on the cover ever said there’d be a Brad Parker retrospective in here.And maybe that’s OK: one, this book got me interested in more art than I had been prepared for with my preconceptions. Two, it does say “volume one” on the cover (!!!)

The closer and closer I come to turning my home office into a tiki paradise, the more I'm interested in stuff like this.The book is short. Not short; tiny. It's meant to fit in your pocket. Written by the lead designer of both Trader Sam's locations in Orlando and Anaheim, Brandon Kleyla, the book offers a crash course in design theory and some helpful practical tips. Kleyla lays out a few different genres of tiki bars, talks about inspiration, and lays out some of the basics. One of his guest writers, Typhoon Tommy, provides a wealth of how-tos for the home tiki aficionado, like how to create realistic looking ""bamboo"" out of PVC pipe, and how to realistically age artifacts like lanterns and wooden tikis. It's all pretty good stuff. I only wish it was a lot longer.

I couldn't have read this when I was just getting into Disney. In 2007, all I cared about was The Magic, and nothing was going to come between me and it. I was aware of this book but I steered clear of it, relying on rapturous Disney histories and blogs and, eventually, DisTwitter. OK, so it wasn't all rapturous.DisneyWar charts Michael Eisner's tenure as CEO of the Walt Disney Company. From the early days, when Roy Disney staged a near-coup to get Eisner on board, to the waning final days, when Roy did it again to strip Eisner of his power, Eisner's tenure was tumultuous. I've talked about Eisner's time at Disney plenty on both social media and in my podcast, The Thirty20Eight. But although I knew some of his highlights and lowlights, I knew nothing of the corporate intrigue, the paranoia, and the increasingly insular nature of the company and the man. I don't know how much of the book highlights the latter-era missed chances because it deals with successes we know about, or because they were just so egregious. How Disney gave up a bunch of the profits for The Sixth Sense, because Eisner didn't think it would do well. How he excoriated Finding Nemo as ""Pixar will finally have a wake-up call"" as to how their golden reign would end. How Eisner passed on CSI and Survivor, which became massive hits elsewhere. Is it all ""hindsight is 20/20"" or were Eisner's sins just that profound?It's actually kind of tragic after Eisner spearheaded the first Disney Renaissance, starting somewhere around The Great Mouse Detective and ending somewhere around Tarzan. What's most interesting is how Eisner kind of keeps trying to believe he's in Disney's salad days, long - LONG - past the time he is.My only issue with the book is that we didn't really get a lot of theme park stuff. I honestly thought we'd get a big breakdown of WestCot and an in-depth look at California Adventure's bizarre first years. Nothing much on that, or on the changes Eisner brought to the resort hotel concept (adding value resorts), theme park attractions (beyond Mission: Space), and more. There's a lot of ink on Disneyland Paris, but virtually nothing on the Asian parks, or even domestic. It's a ding for me but I get it. This book is more about boardroom malfeasance and mergers and acquisitions and big-screen entertainment rather than Splash Mountain and Barbie at Epcot. Still, even for someone who doesn't really care about corporate movers, shakers, and losers, I found author James B. Stewart's prose moving quickly and the huge moments and shocking reversals so outsized, this could have been fiction. The weirdest thing is that it's not.

Is it going to be light and breezy with a breadth of witticisms and a dearth of facts, or will it be so stuck in the mud of history that it doesn't let the concepts breathe? I've lived through both sorts of books and while I prefer the former, I'm always searching for the Bill Bryson medium. Alphabetical mostly hits that medium. He goes through every letter of the alphabet, talks about why the letter name is pronounced (this is the quirky fun etymological stuff I crave; why is A pronounced AYE, and why the heck is it called a W if it's obviously a double v?), and gives us a pretty thorough overview of how the letter has been used over the years and centuries. In each chapter, we also get a tangent that amounts to a sub-chapter, discussing an aspect of culture we wouldn't have without these letters (like the histories of the word ""okay,"" or why and how ZIP codes happened) that are sometimes only tangentially related to the letter history but are fascinating nonetheless. Along the way, Rosen takes us into his personal history of letters, a recurring motif that continually remains charming because he doesn't bog down. In fact, none of this book bogs down. If you're starting to worry if the chapter about codes and ciphers is getting too in the weeds, just wait; we're going to wipe the whole slate clean and get into D any second. This book, like many overviews, may inspire more than satisfy ... which I believe is its purpose. We get some tantalizing chunks of history - the whole section on the Voynich Manuscript, which might be a hoax springs to mind - and he leaves it up to the reader to go searching the topic further. If an overview of the history of the alphabet is all you want, this book will charm and delight (and the audiobook is read by the author, which is even more of a delight; if you're American, you just have to get used to hearing ""zed"" a lot).

Every time I start a new year of reading, I get worried that this year's crop of stuff won't be as good as the last. I scour the internet looking for new books by old favorites, buzzy stuff that fits in my wheelhouse, obscure nonfiction on topics that intrigue me just enough to get deeply into a single book and then stop. Of course, I can always re-read my favorites; Stephen King and John Irving and Ann Patchett and Lawrence Block are right there, waiting to be picked up again. But it's not the same. Re-reading has immense value, but you can't build the pillars of a great reading year on those. Then, after a month or so catching up with the stuff I started in the previous year, new possibilities open up. I sometimes take a stab at madness and think that THIS is the year I'll finally read Jane Eyre or Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and buy them and quietly shelve them and then donate them to used bookshops that cater to, I assume, Dickensian waifs in need of highbrow literature. And then, finally - FINALLY! - I stumble on something I effortlessly love. That book, this year, is The Midnight Library.At this point in American pop culture, we are absolutely familiar with the concept of a multiverse. Parallel (or perpendicular?) spacetimes that coexist at the same time as what we think of as our ""normal"" lives. In the parlance of The Midnight Library, the life you've always lived is called your ""root"" life. The other possibilities open up when you almost - but not quite - die. Our story concerns a woman named Nora, who has decided to die. Her life is in shambles: she's lost her regular job, her side gig, and her cat. Her brother won't talk to her. She has nothing and no one and in her pit of despair, she attempts to die by suicide. When she opens her eyes, she is in the Midnight Library, an in-between place in which Nora can shuttle between lives she might have lived if she'd made different decisions along the way. Her guide on this journey is an avatar of one of the few people Nora has trusted in the world, who explains that if Nora finds a happy life elsewhere, then she can remain there forever. The great fun of this novel is finding Nora choosing different lives to live - some tragic, some bland, some fantastic, some near-perfect. As we reach the ending, we have a feeling how things will turn out ... but don't always believe what you think is going to happen. Like Nora's regrets, things in the Midnight Library are not always what they seem. I honestly thought, when I started this book, that Nora was going to shuttle through famous fictional landscapes - she'd be in Alice in Wonderland, or in Moby-Dick, or something like that. I don't quite know where I got that idea. What I got was far richer, and more affirming, than whatever I'd been imagining.

The title sets you up for that, basically begging you to compare it with stuff like The History of the World in Six Glasses. It's not that, at all. It focuses on one museum - the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City - from rougly the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. Not particularly a HISTORY, so much, and all of it's from the point of view of security lead John Barelli, whose work in preventing and solving art crime is the real through-line here. So instead of a worldwide scope, it's basically the story of this one guy and this one museum and some thefts that happened there. A little one-note, right?Wrong! Weirdly, wonderfully wrong! Barelli lays out the different sorts of art theft and crime - outside opportunity, inside opportunity, and pro - and from those basic types lays out six (or more) crimes at the Met that have shaken up the museum during his tenure there. We're talking Roman heads. Tapestries. Baseball cards. And maybe - or maybe not - bronze sculptures. It's all really compelling stuff.Along the way, Barelli's career intersects with Princess Diana, 9/11, Scotland Yard, and a pair of shrunken heads. Barelli writes like a cop - precise, no-nonsense, occasional jokes - but the world of art and art crime is so bizarre that it makes for a good juxtaposition. I didn't think I was going to like this book at all and I liked it a lot.

So why did it take over half a month to read?Last year, I could have polished a book like Bone Canyon off in a long afternoon. I did that with Ann Patchett’s Run. 2020 was a big shut-in year. For a long time, I didn’t leave my house because we couldn’t. I dove into physical books in a way I hadn’t in awhile. I read out of necessity, as a way to shield myself from the ongoing trauma of the pandemic.That may have changed in this year. Things are more active. Getting back to normal. And my reading is of course suffering. The audiobooks are still moving on a regular clip, but the physical books are what they have been in the past: another thing that competes for my time. And my time is usually thin. When I’m reading, I can only just read. With audio, I can do everything else, but books are their own entity. I have to focus on them to the exclusion of all else. Put into that kind of context, it actually says a great deal about this novel. No matter how distracted I got, I still came back to it, because the story was so good. New detective Eve Ronin decides to solve a triple cold case when bones turn up in the desert following a wildfire. Her department resents her, Andy the only guy she can trust is her partner, who’s retiring soon. Oh, and the killers may be police officers.Aside From occasionally stilted conversation, this book is well written and compulsively readable.

That's not so bad.Nope. It is ... rampantly, needlessly horny. Not just in the second half. Like there's a weird undercurrent (ha! because oceans!) of perverse sexuality in this book that doesn't ever really seem to connect to anything else. Not in character or plot, not even subtextually.Look, we all have a vague idea of what Jaws is: a great white shark shows up in the shallows around Amity, NY, and kills a bunch of people. A police chief named Brody, an ichthyologist named Hooper, and a crusty old salt seaman named Quint all go out to try to kill the fish. Thrills ensue.Only: not as much here in the book. I'm not going to say Benchley wasn't great at writing scenes of suspense. The whole first shark attack is as gripping as that in the movie. Some of the subsequent ones were, as well, including that of a young boy on a raft. (Followed closely by an off-page murder that we only hear about, which is a ... bold choice.)But then there's stuff about the mayor's mob connections, and an awkward dinner party, and - most egregiously - an affair between Brody's wife and Hooper, who is NOT the nebbishy Richard Dreyfus you might expect, but a full on Robert Redford type. At one point, they're at this diner together and he's like, ""What are your fun and flirty fantasies"" and she's all like, ""well, rape of course, like all women."" And I'm like, UH BENCHLEY, A WORD?!The affair becomes this sort of stain on a pretty good book, because it doesn't lead anywhere and it doesn't seem to really mean anything. (Though, interesting: when Brody theorizes that Hooper slept with another woman in town, everyone's like, ""Nah, she's a lesbian."" And it's not really a big deal except to prove Hooper's a liar, which ... I don't know, feels like good sexual politics for the 70s? Weirdly?)A lot of the latter shark-centric scenes are also suspenseful and there are even a few genuine scares. But there's very little, I dunno, lyricism in the book. It feels a little plodding. I'm going to go back and watch the movie soon, but I remember that feeling not just well-crafted but at times poetic. Young Steven Spielberg removed all the chaff, added some more playful elements, turned Quint into Captain Ahab, and made Hooper a different kind of 1970s sex muffin. I can understand, if you'd never seen the film Jaws, that the book might be way more effective.

The main character is a woman named Rachel Marin, who has her own P A S T, a single mom with a side gig of a kickass vigilante woman. There's a plot, and it's a good one, involving a disgraced former mayor who may or may not have killed herself. I'm not saying the plot isn't important to the book, because it reveals layers of trauma and direction in Marin's character, especially her devotion to justice at any cost. What's fascinating about the book is what ""any cost"" eventually means. Marin isn't a superhero, and she makes a few boneheaded decisions because she's convinced she's making them for the right reasons. Some of the very few negative s focus on her bad decisions like it's a flaw, but it's one of the book's main strengths. Marin is kind of Batman, down to the enduring horror of a tragic event; but what a lot of people forget is how haunted Batman is, and how his sense of justice tends to cloud common sense.

When I was coming up as a reader, one of my favorite books about a subject I loved was The Stephen King Companion. It looked at highlights of King's career, offered some sidebars, made the whole phenomenon more accessible and approachable. That's pretty much what McNear does here. There's a sweeping overview of the show's history, how pop culture responded to it (current Jeopardy! might not exist without ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, WHAT), a little about Trebek, a lot about contestants - former, hopeful, and superstar alike. Because McNear is an endearing writer, this is a comfortable book about a comfortable show. And because it was completed before both the pandemic and Trebek's death, so it's also a time capsule.

I keep asking myself if I truly enjoy Michener, or if I like having read Michener. After all, he’s a popular writer, not a “literature” writer; if I’m working my way through a 1,000-page time, it’s not for any sort of cultural cachet. It’s just because I like him.So I’ve come to the conclusion with my fourth successful read of a Michener book (after Hawaii, Alaska, and The Novel; Tales of the South Pacific and Space were attempts I need to get back to) that I enjoy Michener novels, mostly. I admire the sweep of history, from prehistory to current day. I get wrapped up in the generational stories, watching young kids grow old become heads of companies and families. Sometimes, though, I get weary of exposition and proselytizing. Centennial is mostly terrific. Early on, we meet a living diplodocus and watch her habits and day. Several immense chapters later, a character finds her bones on his farm. That’s the stuff I love. In between, we meet various indigenous tribes, watch how white men move in and try to wipe them out, and learn all about Hereford cattle. There’s a lot. We also watch how farming, agriculture, and irrigation shape the small Colorado town of Centennial. This shouldn’t be as awesome as it is. I keep thinking it’s going to be dull and it’s not. There’s politics and dry farming and unrequited love and, bizarrely, a crass and shocking murder that could be its own short story. Watching the stuff that springs from that murder is thrilling. So what DON’T I like? Oh my word, the interminable final chapter. It’s all about how great Centennial used to be and how terrible it is now. It’s not just that it’s a downbeat ending; it’s that it takes so long to get there.

I'm glad I didn't, because the book turned out to be better than I thought. I just wish it had turned out a lot better. Westlake is interesting. Sometimes I love his stuff. His novel Memory is one of the best books I read this year. Sometimes I just kind of like it. He was a fast writer and maybe that's part of it. I guess I'm used to crime thrillers with levels of profundity - noirs like Mildred Pierce or In a Lonely Place or modern stuff like Dead Girl Blues - and Westlake's stuff tends to be lean and hard without a lot of fucking around. There's some fucking around in 361, and a good amount of profundity, if you're willing to look for it. As it was, I liked it. A book about fathers and sons, lies and deceptions. And it's about killing when you don't want to, and killing when you do, and why it's hard both ways. Westlake's mob stuff seems more germane to his Parker novels under the Stark name. I'm unsure I liked it here. Is it weird I want to know what these people's lives would have been like without murder in it? I'm interested in these characters, but maybe not this story as much.

Then in 2020, Bruce Springsteen: All the Songs – The Story Behind Every Track came out, and I wanted it more than anything else for Christmas. Apparently, books about Springsteen songs are like books about Beatles songs. I’m going to keep buying them and loving them and wanting more. This is my first book finished in 2021, which is a little alarming since we’re halfway through the month and I haven’t yet made a dent in my 70 Books of 2021 goal. In my defense, this book is almost as gargantuan as the other book I’m currently reading: Centennial, by James Michener. I have a YA novel picked out for my next read and I’m looking forward to the break. And how is this book? Quite good. Though I don’t really care about the tech specs – who played what guitar on which track doesn’t really interest me – I liked the actual stories behind all the songs profiled. Where authors Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin sometimes go wrong is in their interpretations of songs (how the heck is “Hello Sunshine” an ode to the joys of solitude?) … and, very occasionally, chart stats (sometimes they list songs as charting fairly high on the Billboard Hot 100, even if they were never singles; I have to guess that, because the authors are European, their default chart is different from our default chart). The book is packed with facts and pictures – all the stuff I love – and the dedication to ferreting out all those backstories is fruitful. I spent many nights absorbed in this book, wanting to sleep but wanting to know just one … more … thing. Plus, I’ve been re-listening to Springsteen records throughout the whole process and it’s been so good to connect with the music again after reading about it. The book felt kind of interactive in that way.I will question, though, why the authors decided to leave out the whole Ties That Bind box set, not to mention Disc 3 of Essential, all of which contain outtakes that never made it anywhere else. They got all the EPs (though didn’t mention that the American Beauty EP actually did chart on the Top 200 in the States), all the singles, all the core 19 records, but those seem like pretty big misses. (Also, and this is not their fault obviously, but Springsteen is always going to be just a little bit faster than print; Letter to You isn’t covered here, and that makes me just a little sad.)I feel like I’m ragging on the book when it’s done nothing but entertain me in the first weeks of 2021. I really enjoyed being inside these songs and this music, and now that the barrier is broken, I can jump into more books.

Googie stars and amoeba and Sputnik shapes, a high-end Shag store, tiki bars and breeze blocks and all the stuff that made the 50s great (and, at least to my tourist eyes, little that made it not). Currently it's a gay mecca, packed with folks who get lost in the kitsch of it all. Gay folk love our kitsch. And camp. And glitter.I don't know if Peter Moruzzi is gay (though he alludes to the populace at one point), but he's absolutely hit on why those drawn to vintage California aesthetics from an ironic distance love Palm Springs. After laying the groundwork about men taming the desert in the early 20th century, Moruzzi dazzles us with imagery and extremely short essays on the backgrounds of those images. After that skimming of ""Early History,"" we jump right into a chapter titled ""The Original Hotels."" Right there, you know what kind of book this is: one dedicated to entertainment, tourism, and the over-the-top indulgence of the jet set in the desert as the midcentury blooms before them.There's some tantalizingly dark stuff in Moruzzi's words - the accidental creation of the Salton Sea, the gentrification that pushed a lot of indigenous people out of the slums, maybe some mob stuff - but the author wisely knows that this isn't the book for that. We want to read about pools and Desert Modern architecture and why neon was too tacky for the city so they had to come up with something else on their road signs. Nighclubs and supper clubs and tiki clubs and gentlemen's clubs.

This one screamed out to me: instead of Googie wrapping paper, there'd be Googie WALLpaper. Atomic radar ranges! Avocado green! Harvest gold! Archer delivers all this and more. First, there's a crash course in kitchens in the distant ago, the ones to which aristocrats would summon butlers and maids to bring food on silver trays. The look and importance of the kitchen changed as the middle class emerged from World War II and women were expected to leave the factory and go back to work in the home. Archer argues that the elegance of the atomic kitchen might explain why the June Cleaver fifties housewife look - pearls and heels - might not be as sitcommy or farfetched as we might assume. Advertising worked hard to make kitchens seem like careers for women of the era. The word ""housewife"" gets elevated to the term ""hostess,"" making the everyday kitchen toiler seem more like the head of a neverending party ... even though that's not really what it was. It's a fascinating journey to watch. When I started reading, I didn't think I was going to like the 1970s stuff, but Archer surprised me. The late focus on the greens and gold and oranges of the 1970s was a perfect shift away from the space-age 50s and 60s. I'm just glad we're not moving into the Lisa Frank 80s. I love these midcentury books. They dovetail very nicely into the tiki craze books I've been into all year (and Archer touches on the tiki lore here, too).

It came out when I still worked in bookstores (and bookstores were a thing), and I remember finding the whole thing a little daunting. First off, even though I'd read Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, I still had a bit of a science inferiority complex. This was going to be a book about cell culture and biology, and honestly I was scared I wasn't going to understand it. Secondly, it seemed to be a book about institutional racism, and I'm always unsure if I'm qualified to read deeply about race - while at the same time, I know as a white guy, I should educate myself as much as possible. Lots of internal questions, and basically what it all boiled down to was: shouldn't I try to know more about science, and shouldn't I try to know more about pervading racism?The answer is yes, but it's not just yes. The real answer is that this book is definitely anchored in science - it's about cells taken from a woman named Henrietta Lacks (the cells are designated HeLa), and the fact that those cells are still alive and dividing and multiplying all these years since her death. Institutional racism? Sure, especially during a harrowing reveal about what happened to Henrietta's possibly autistic daughter. But more than anything, this book is about family, and what makes a family; is it just cells, or is it something more?Surprisingly, much of the book centers on Debra Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, who never got to know her mother and who was on her journey to understand, through the persistence of her cells. Like a lot of the best narrative nonfiction, the author, Rebecca Skloot, is a part of the story, becoming Debra's friend (and occasional adversary) as they seek the truth of Henrietta's legacy. It's a convoluted truth, and the fact that Henrietta's cells are out in the world helping to develop treatments for polio and AIDS (and, I found out, COVID-19) while her family had been struggling in poverty and anonymity is a little hard to take. Skloot presents all the information without much bias, understanding how violating it is to have your tissues used without your knowledge ... while also knowing that without those tissues, polio might never have been cured. It's heady waters.But it's not a heady read. Skloot, like Bryson, gives us just enough science to help us understand Henrietta's ongoing story, but doesn't bog us down. It's pop science, the stuff I can grasp, as well as a helix of biography and biology. I really enjoyed this book, even the parts that hurt to read. Science is about stuff you need to know, even if sometimes you don't want to know it.

Honestly, I was afraid the book would make me mad; I didn't have books like this when I was young. If there were gay characters in YA, they were sad and tortured and Very Brave. They weren't just messy teenagers who fucked up sometimes and won sometimes and otherwise had pretty regular lives. Instead of pissing me off, What If It's Us genuinely excited me. It's the story of Ben and Arthur, two boys who find each other in New York City during one offbeat summer. It's also about how they don't meet, and how they screw up, and how they sometimes win. I really loved it.What was most fun for me was how large their separate worlds were. Ben's Puerto Rican, and that is sometimes a big deal and sometimes not. He has an ex, and he's in summer school, and a best friend. Arthur's parents seem headed for a divorce, he's a summer intern, and his two best friends are back home in Georgia, and one of them is acting weird. It never feels like these other characters exist JUST to prop up Our Duo. These lives feel lived-in, and real, with a sense of weight and history.My friend said this book was the thing that convinced him to come out. I can believe it. It's a book rooted in the magic of love, but still realistic about how difficult love is. If you can, listen to the audiobook, where the characters of Ben and Arthur swap chapters from their own points of view. Just sweet and quietly revolutionary.

The closest I've come, I think, was Pictures at a Revolution, which is about the making of the five best picture nominees of 1968. I've read plenty of think pieces on stuff like Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver, the work of Tarantino - my favorite prestige films. But I have long, long had a soft spot for both the book and movie of Christine, and even though I didn't think I'd enjoy this sort of oral history approach, I liked it a lot.Author Gambin curates interviews with people from all over the production of the film, from the actors to the FX people, the editors and producers. I thought there might be, you know, DRAMA, because you hear about that stuff happening on movie sets all the time. The truth is that the shoot was mostly one big happy family. If you think that sounds boring, I assure you, it wasn't. There's a big cult following surrounding the film, but even if you're only a casual fan, getting this deep into it is satisfying and fun. I learned a few things about the special effects, a few things about the young actors (""I honestly could have died in that moment"" becomes a sort of recurring theme, especially with Alexandra Paul, Keith Gordon, and Malcolm Denare, one of my earliest crushes). For some reason, I've always thought director John Carpenter was curmudgeonly, but here he comes across as that cool, friendly uncle you can watch horror films with. I knew but maybe forgot that he was coming off The Thing when he made Christine, and my impression of The Thing was that it was always the revered film it is now. But it tanked and got terrible s when it came out, so Christine was sort of the rebound picture. The fact that Christine made double its budget back must have been a confidence booster.At the start of every chapter, Gambin analyzes and mythologizes segments of the movie. He brings in a lot of interesting perspective, from feminist theory and queer theory to film technique and the role Christine has in the pantheon of killer-vehicle pictures. I liked most of these introductions very much, aside from a lengthy plot synopsis of a different film in the canon called The Car. I found it interesting, but it might have been more so if there'd been a broader range of compare/contrast examples.But man, did I love this book. It's exactly the book I needed right now: a nerdy deep dive into the background of one of my favorite movies, based on one of my favorite books.

What I want to do now is get lost in Stephen King novels, and - apparently - look back with nostalgia at midcentury kitsch and design. That's what I can handle right now.Sarah Archer's tiny book (the stocking stuffer edition!) is cram-jam with imagery and reminiscences of the holiday season from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Broken up into easily digestible chapters like Aluminum Trees, Christmas Wrapping, and Christmas Cards, Midcentury Christmas is almost entirely a breezy, history-lite exploration of this fascinating era of American history. While Archer touches on some of the not-great aspects of the time period - the non-equal rights of women and people of color, the fear of nuclear war, the consumerism that came with the modern-since-the-1800s version of Christmas - that help to give a fuller picture of the time, this is largely a celebration.What is sort of interesting is that, near the end of the book, Archer begins to focus on the DIY movement of the time, and how both that and the interest in midcentury markers like Googie stars and atomic imagery are once again in vogue, especially during the holidays. She chooses this note to end the book on and doesn't really sum up the whole of the experience, but her late focus on Better Homes and Gardens magazine (and its Christmas issue) stands in for a punctuation on the era.

I remember sprawling out on my borrowed waterbed when I was 15 or 16, finishing ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" for the first time, just marveling at the power of it. And then in comes ""Apt Pupil"" to suckerpunch me. I read that one at my grandparents' house, which was even more terrifying because my grandfather was Jewish, and stories about Nazis always freaked me out.A part of me will always feel a little cheated, because I'd seen Stand By Me dozens of times before I ever read ""The Body."" In fact, it was one of the very few FORBIDDEN movies in my household. My Dad had taped it off HBO, and every time he and my stepmother were out of the house, I'd watch a little bit more, sometimes getting 20-30 minutes of movie in before I heard their car pull into the driveway and I had to eject and put the tape back in its place. Even watching it piecemeal was powerful. When I finally got to watch the whole thing at my Aunt Marg's house, it sank into me so deeply, like a wound that never stops bleeding. It's hard not to compare the novella and the movie. There are times in the story when one character says a line attributed to a different one in the film, and it's jarring. Still amazing, but jarring. Unfortunately, I fear the same thing is starting to happen with Shawshank ... although that movie is far more slavishly devoted to its source material. (One last thing about ""The Body"": the narrator casually references the phrase ""going faggot"" a few times, which kind of sucks; what's interesting about that is how Red in Shawshank talks about homosexual relationships that are actually beneficial and kind. I have to sort of remember Gordon LaChance is not Stephen King.)But truth be told, I read this now so I could experience ""The Breathing Method"" again. This was a novella I always considered the weak one of the bunch until something clicked on my fourth or fifth read. Now it's one of my favorites. I've been depressed a little lately - COVID depression, more isolation than normal, seasonal stuff - and I wanted some Stephen King to fall into. King's winter story, scary and unsettling, worked wonders on my mood. I think I might need to re-read some more King after this.

Usually it’s something with multiple facets: in 2007, when I learned about Disney, there were the movies, the parks, the man, and more. This year has been all about tiki, and from that locus I can move to architecture, exotic drinks, music, and the history of the South Pacific.I think I got into cheese in 2010 or 2011. The inflection point was when I was eating a cheese plate with a friend and he told me to stop gobbling it like it was Rice Krispies Treats. Slow down. Savor. This piqued my interest enough to read some books on cheese, and start going to cheese shops and listening to what the mongers recommended. The epiphany moment came in Los Angeles where, while at a quiet cheese shop on the edge of the city, I had my first taste of Challerhocker. And I fell in love.As it turns out, I’m not alone in my cheese epiphany moment. Joe Berkowitz describes his in American Cheese like a bright light in the night, a moment of revelation with Rogue River Blue. I love that this happens to other people, and that it affects them in profound ways.Berkowitz’s cheese journey is more ambitious than mine. I’ve found a tasty niche in putting together some pretty good cheese plates with delicious pairings. Berkowitz travels to cheese competitions, works in a cheese shop, crashes the world’s most sumptuous cheese party. It’s a rush to follow along, and if you’re at all interested in cheese making and production, it’ll be even more thrilling.One of my favorite sorts of books is one from the point of view of an outsider coming into a whole subculture (ha!), one with its own rules and language and history, and gets extremely involved. Berkowitz delivers on everything I want from this kind of book, and then some.Is it disappointing that when he finally tastes Challerhocker, he merely likes it? Kind of. But one of the best things about cheese is that it’s different for everyone, and that the world of it is nearly endless. Now it’s time for me to try some Rogue River Blue.

It’s about a young girl, who has to face the realities of life and death too young to really comprehend them. Only: Winnie, our hero, grows up during this compact story. Her rite of passage out of childhood is in how she grasps the horror of immortality, and comes to terms with it. She’s who Alice in Wonderland might have been, if we’d followed her adventures after the looking-glass.

I was making new friends in the Stephen King EMailERS club (SKEMERS, folks). I was turning into a writer myself. Stephen King had changed publishers and this was the first book from his new publisher. Everyone was on tenterhooks to see if the book would live up to all the hype.It did, of course. I remember a few ers talking about how this was ""standard King,"" with his ghosts and his writers. But some of us saw this as a seismic shift. Bag of Bones was a quieter, more nuanced sort of story from King; a full-on Gothic novel, his first since The Shining. Ghosts bring it out in him. What really struck the world, me included, was the ending. A lot of it talks about Mike Noonan, our protagonist, talking about quitting writing. That was terrifying. This was 1998. King had a new 3-book contract at Simon & Schuster, but the books had already been written. Was he really done writing? Done forever? Of course my fears were assuaged fairly quickly (The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon surprised everyone and we all remembered how compulsive King is when it comes to writing and publishing).

Whenever there’s a new season, I dive right in. In more recent seasons, it’s been all about talent aNo pun intended, but Top Chef is my comfort food. Whenever there’s a new season, I dive right in. In more recent seasons, it’s been all about talent and personality and performing at one’s peak. Not too much manufactured drama, which I think a lot of reality competitions think they need. I think the overwhelming success of The Great British Bake-Off/Baking Show has proven that high-adrenaline drama and crying and screaming don’t have to be a part of something like this. During the pandemic, my husband Shawn and I decided to go back and rewatch early seasons of the show. We started with season 2, because the dynamic of Padma/Tom/Gail was a big part of why we were there. And those early seasons DID have that drama. Screaming, posturing bullshit that was sometimes unpleasant to watch. We’re now in Season 8 and things have gotten mostly into the groove that seems the best tenor of the show. We’re closing in on the California season, which I watched when it was on. All the better to read Kwame Onwuache’s book, which touches on his time on the show and explains how he got there. Now, here’s the thing. I’ve read Padma’s and Gail’s books, and they do talk about Top Chef quite a bit. I thought that would be a major part of Kwame’s book, as well ... but I didn’t quite think about the fact that Gail and Padma have been part of the Top Chef world for a good portion of their lives. Kwame was only there for about four months. So the book dedicated some time to the show, but his relatively drama-free season was not what makes this book so compelling. Look: we’re dealing with systemic racism in American culture. We have been - and especially Black and brown people have been - for centuries. What’s insane is how prevalent it is in the current, how bold and out in the open. When Kwame wrote this book, it was a little less overt, but it was still definitely felt. His times in the kitchen where he’s asked to make “African” food, aware (unlike his bosses) that Africa is a continent, not a cuisine. Or when he makes chicken and waffles, and wonders if (1) he’s playing into the stereotype of Black Americans and (2) if he refuses to make it, is he ignoring a food he likes so it won’t be SEEN as a racial thing. This is stuff Kwame wrestles with over and over in his book and it’s heartbreaking and intense, every single time.We don’t start in kitchens, either, and unlike in most narratives about author-doing-thing you know them for, this pre-history is fascinating. Growing up poor, sleeping in a closet, watching his mother barely scrape by as first a caterer and then an executive chef. He deals with an abusive father, an exile in Nigeria, and a long stint at wrestling with his own demons. It’s all compelling, because Kwame knows how to frame his subjects and his own history well.But of course, the book comes alive when he’s talking about food. His explanations on how he works hard to make the best consumme, and how his fanciest and most story-focused food is plated are among the best in the book. Some of this is the drama we see on screen, but most of it is behind the scenes, and marking the topography of the life of a chef. The trauma that shapes him, the racism that does or doesn’t frame his experience, his cleverness and ingenuity ... all of it makes up the young Black chef I saw on one of my favorite shows, and the person behind the chef, as well....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 11, 2020","Nov 14, 2020","Nov 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40645634-notes-from-a-young-black-chef

Stephen King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote the first book, Gwendy's Button Box, and for Chizmar to be picking up the story and charting some new paths in Gwendy's spectacular tale made sense. But I kept going back to something King said about The Talisman, way back in the day. ""If someone pointed a gun at one of my kid's heads and said, write The Talisman yourself, I could have written a Talisman, but not the one that Peter Straub and I wrote together."" I was worried that this sequel would be something like that, lesser for not having King's words mixed in with Chizmar's.Of course I was wrong, and Gwendy's Magic Feather turned out pretty delightful. We're catching up on the little girl who learned about the consequences of magic; she's now a congresswoman, and when the button box that can decide the fate of nations returns to her care, things get weird. She's serving under a dolt of a president. She's back home and there's a serial killer (probably) back in Castle Rock for the first time since Frank Dodd strangled a bunch of women in The Dead Zone. There are so many reasons for Gwendy to use the button box destructively, no matter what good she thinks it might be doing.There's also the box's capacity for good, and while a lot of the resolutions in the book are a little telegraphed, that didn't make them any less satisfying. Also satisfying was finding myself back in Castle Rock. King's been going back to that well a lot lately, and I can't say as I blame him. Back in the pre-Needful Things days, I didn't know that I actually was on the whole Castle Rock tip. King seemed to identify with the town more than anything, but for me it was just another setting. But I've read and re-read his older books a lot in the intervening years, and now to have books like Gwendy's Button Box and Elevation, and now Gwendy's Magic Feather ... I just love being back among these people, these places. I love Chizmar's way of filling in some gaps while not CALLING ATTENTION TO THEM. Nods. Inferences. And moving on. There's been word that King and Chizmar are working on a third book in the series, and I couldn't be happier.

I read some books, played a couple of computer games. Made it my year's hobby. It didn't stick, not because I was bad at it (oh, but I was), but because it didn't engage me like I wanted it to. I didn't have that initial, visceral oomph that the interests that stick around can give me. What I discovered, though, was that I was interested in books about chess. More specifically, books about chess players. I love the sort of pop nonfiction genre about people obsessed with toys or games or puzzles, and the author gets super into their stories and lives. The Queen's Gambit is not that, not really. It's fiction, even though the chess games described within seem very plausible. And our hero, Beth, could be one of those people in the ""fans of"" books ... but we never really get beyond the object of obsession in those books. Here, Walter Tevis paints a whole life about Beth: how she became an orphan, how that shaped her, how she discovered chess and how it might have destroyed her. That it didn't is a testament to her character.And that this book is not only comprehensible but fun for non-players is a testament to Tevis' writing. In it, he describes in fairly intricate details Beth's chess games against increasingly skilled players. Now, here's the thing: when I read books about baseball or football, I am very much at a loss, because I don't care about most sports and I don't know the rules. I also don't know the nomenclature or intricacies of chess ... but, at least in this book, that doesn't matter. Tevis is a master of making every one of Beth's games seem suspenseful and riveting, even if you don't know what the Sicilian is, or why ""Rook to Queen Six"" is good or bad. The tension builds, and with it, our deeper connection with Beth. She's not always easy to like, but she's extremely easy to root for. When she's angry, we get why. When she's spiraling, we empathize. Most of the time, she behaves like a chess automaton ... until she doesn't. She's such a good character, I wish I could see what happens next.Quick note: in order to prepare for the TV show adaptation, my husband and I are reading the book at the same time. Well, he read, I listened to the fantastic audio edition. Now I wait for him to finish so we can both dive in to Beth's onscreen world. And I don't think this is going to be my last Tevis. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 07, 2020","Nov 10, 2020","Nov 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2065790.The_Queen_s_Gambit

TThe more tiki books I read, the more I discover how they fit neatly into categories: full histories, monofocus on a single location, mixology books. Then there’s a whole subset of books that function as local listings of past bars and restaurants in a given area. I don’t always find that super interesting, especially the books that I have to really scratch deep to find anything tiki in what they’re referencing. And often, even though the books are well researched, there’s not a whole lot to go on. Often, any Chinese takeout place that has the word “tiki” in its name gets included. That’s not entirely illuminating.This book is a little bit more expansive. Sure, it’s a chronological listing of tiki bars in San Diego from the late 20s to the late 2010s, but it’s also a little bit more. The time before tiki really took hold in California is referred to as pre-tiki, and the stories are sometimes fascinating. Especially in this book, there’s a lot of talk about gangsters and rum runners, and how they ran the San Diego bar scene back in the 20s and 30s and 40s. While that’s not my real area of focus, it’s interesting to get some of that backstory.But when author Martin Lindsay dives in to the tiki era proper, that’s when things get super interesting. For instance, I didn’t know that a lot of the San Diego bar scene existed on islands that were man-made off the coast. And that one of the most famous proto-tiki bars, Christians Hut, originated on one of those islands. We spend a little bit more time on these histories, and I love all the illustrations, and San Diego artifacts that Lindsay incorporates into the book. This also might be the most current book on tiki that I own. There’s a lot of stuff about the tiki revival, and it brings us current to 2018. This year has affected a lot of tiki bars, but my hope is, reading a book like this, that the revival can sustain itself through this weird year.

The title Angle of Repose intrigued me, so I read a little about it. Frontier woman who goes West? Her aging grandson writing her life story? Sounds right up my alley. I downloaded the audio and dove in right away.We get to know our narrator right off: Lyman Ward, recently missing half of one leg and somewhat paralyzed, in a motorized wheelchair he uses to get around. He's working on reading his grandmother Susan's letters, most of which are addressed to her closest friend Augusta back home in the east as Susan goes west, following her surveyor husband as he tries and fails to make it rich over and over. I thought that the book would turn out to be a love story between Susan and Augusta, and it is that, but not in the way I thought. Their bond isn't sexual or physical or even romantic; it's just needful and intense, and Susan needs it throughout all the failures of her life. I then thought the novel was going to be about Susan - an artist and writer - coming into her own in the west, growing famous as a brilliant capturer of the Spirit of Frontiersmanship. Nope. While the book never becomes a slog, it really is about constant hope dashed over and over, until hope can no longer grow. What's interesting - and something I didn't pick up on until near the end of the book - is how Lyman's story is mirrored in that of his grandmother's. And that, though we think he's identifying with her the entire novel, he's not. He's trying to understand her. Her motivations, her reasons for staying even when she should have left. He wants to know what motivated her to hold onto an unhappy life, especially after the monstrous thing that brings the whole novel to a head. There are reasons he wants to know. Because of who he is. And who he's really identifying with.I liked this book a lot. I had never read Stegner and I'm pretty sure I will again. I loved all the detail and nuance he allows Lyman to put into his grandmother's story - part truth, part fiction - and I love that he allows Lyman to understand himself, at least a little.

Tom Hanks was the narrator and I’d liked what he’d done with his own book about World’s Fairs and typewriters. I was fully entranced. In a literary landscape where I was constantly thirsty for writers who read like John Irving (and where William Goldman stopped writing novels years before he died), I had stumbled across the best and brightest ascendant to the throne. The Dutch House was my favorite novel of last year.When 2020 started 2020ing and everything went into lockdown, I – almost casually – picked up my next Ann Patchett book. Audiobook. That one was Bel Canto, a novel my friend Tracey had given me years ago that I had never bothered with for some reason. Most things come around. I remember, mid-March, trying out my new at-home gym and work and coffee routine, and standing at the sink and listening to Bel Canto. Just stopping everything for a moment and listening to this book unfurling in my ears. I knew The Dutch House wasn’t a fluke. I texted Tracey and asked her what I should read next. She recommended Truth & Beauty, a nonfiction novel about her friendship with her friend Lucy, who had written her own book about her medical condition called Autobiography of a Face. I put it on my list, but first I wanted to read Commonwealth, Ann Patchett’s only #1 novel and one of the two Tracey believed I wouldn’t like. I not only liked it, I loved it. That’s usually how things go with me and Tracey. She said the same thing about Donnie Darko awhile ago. I never forget ANYTHING.Truth & Beauty was so heartbreakingly good that I was forced to also read Autobiography of a Face, knowing Lucy’s fate even as she didn’t. But by then I wasn’t just an Ann Patchett fan, I was a fanatic. I owned Run in paperback – Tracey’s favorite – and I read it in a day. A DAY. I’ve done that maybe five times before: with The Ratman’s Notebooks, with Singularity, with The Colorado Kid, with The Time-Traveller’s Wife, with Elevation. And now Run. I could not bring myself to put it down. By this point, I realized I was going to end up finishing her entire canon too fast. I craved that. I wanted so much to dig into these words and her complicated families and her spare, stunning prose. But I had to put books between hers. I had to space them out. But man, did I ever finish that book on the Kahiki Supper Club as fast as humanly possible so I could read The Magician’s Assistant. Oh wow, did I love The Magician’s Assistant.More nonfiction: This is the Story of a Happy Marriage, which I liked but didn’t love. Or, to be fair, I loved some essays and only liked a few others. It wasn’t bad by any means, but it was the literary equivalent of a cold shower. I was able to put some distance between me and Ann Patchett. I could wait a little longer. But not forever. Tracey’s other “meh”  was State of Wonder, which I thought I would be completely in agreement with. The book jacket said it was about traveling into the Amazon and researching a drug, and it sounded almost … I don’t know, late-era Michael Crichton. But I was determined to make up my own mind and plunged in. HOLY SHIT was this book good. More patched-together families, more awkwardness, with a few action sequences I didn’t expect. Fantastic. Oh shit, I was back in. I went online and immediately purchased the only two Patchett books I hadn’t read – Taft and The Patron Saint of Liars – which just happened to be her first two novels. Oh man, this was going to have some symmetry to it. For me, it’s rarely just about the books themselves. It’s about the experience of reading. I had started with Patchett’s most recent novel. I was going to end with her first. Taft. I mean, did I have any idea how much I would love this one? Like Run, I couldn’t simply read it. I gulped it. My greed for this story was so total that I think it took two days to read it. Patchett does what John Irving does, what Stephen King does, what Lawrence Block often does: pulls me fully into an invented world and makes me forget everything on the outside. I’m sitting here, at my breakfast table. There’s an empty coffee cup and an empty oatmeal bowl. Tom Petty on the stereo. And my paperback copy of The Patron Saint of Liars, a little beat up from having been carried around, within reaching distance. I finished it moments ago. Did I love it? Of course I loved it. It’s Patchett’s origin story, where she first started exploring her fascinations, her tropes, her obsessions. Writing from different viewpoints. Invented families. Religion without being religious. The past returning on the present in unexpected ways. And people leaving. That’s where it always goes. Someone leaves, and sometimes that’s a good thing, and sometimes that’s a bad thing, and sometimes it’s just a thing. In Liars, we find a woman who can’t stop leaving and the place that ends up holding her. She’s a mystery even when we’re inside her life and becomes more and more mysterious as we move away from her. I’m stunned at how assured the writing is this early on, how perfectly the words march from one place to another, painting scenes and drawing people so perfectly imperfect that it almost makes you ache. It’s enough to make you jealous, if you weren’t so busy realizing what a gift it all was.Thank you, Ann Patchett, for all of your gifts this year. I eagerly await whatever your next book is. And now I think I might have to go back and re-read The Dutch House. On paper this time. I don’t want anything between me and the story, even if it is the melodious narration of Tom Hanks. I want Patchett pure and unfiltered. If nothing else, 2020 has been a year of Ann Patchett, and for that alone I am grateful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 17, 2020","Oct 31, 2020","Oct 17, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15957.The_Patron_Saint_of_Liars

There are a few outliers and interweaving of subjects, but that's mainly where we're at. Minimalist Tiki, by Matt Pietrek and Carrie Smith, is definitely in the drinks category ... but it's also hinting at a new category, touched on slightly by some of the other books. It's about where tiki is right now, since the tiki renaissance has really taken off. I crave this stuff. One of the best aspects of my obsessions is that they're not just one thing. Like, Stephen King is the books, sure, but also the uncollected short stories, the movies, the comics, the audio. I should know; I've written books about all those subjects. Ditto Disney and Star Trek and even Springsteen - there's the main aspect, and then there are tangents. And for most of my interests, a lot of those tangents include the present and the future. King is writing more books. Springsteen is releasing new albums. And tiki is discovering its past and reinventing itself for the now. The cool thing about Minimalist Tiki is that it has an absolute reverence for what came before. Pietrek and Smith highlight what they consider the thirty most important concoctions of the ""classic vanguard"" - stuff like the Zombie and the Navy Grog - based on common ingredients and provenance and other rules. And then we take kind of a deep dive into the world of rums (and rhums, and rons), stuff that Jeff Berry covered extensively in his Potions of the Caribbean book. While I'm into the history of rum, I find I don't care so much about its production. I know you're really supposed to care about that stuff if you're a tiki person, but honestly, I just want to know what's recommended and if the drinks are delicious. Still, I appreciate the book's focus, because it sets up my favorite part: bartenders, bars, and the direction in which tiki is headed. The section at the end, the new tiki vanguard, asks these bartenders and mixologists to remix those Classic Thirty drinks. A lot of them seem too complicated for me right now, but I'm sure they won't stay that way. In March, I had no idea what an allspice dram was. Now I have a bottle of it in my tiki cabinet.

Like tapa cloth, Hawaii is woven into the history of the ersatz culture of tiki bars, A-frames, and Chinese food masquerading as South Seas cuisine. The Hawaii craze took off in a big way in the 1930s with music and the first tiki bars, and exploded in the 1950s, when returning vets from WWII had newfound wealth, leisure, and a desire to return to the ""simple, relaxed way of life."" Hawaii was there to be everything to everyone. This book isn't one of the more probing looks into the culture of the 1950s that continues to fascinate me. It isn't really even about the tiki lifestyle of which I've grown so fond. It's about the USA's obsession with Hawaii itself in the 1950s - the high notes version. To say this book is breezy would be like saying Diamond Head volcano is a biggish hill. Co-author Charles Phoenix is known for his coffee table books featuring Americana's kitsch and culture, and that's pretty much what you get here ... albeit reigned in a little by, I assume, author Fred Basten's more reverent take. Each chapter opens with a short introduction to a facet of Hawaiian culture that excited the folk of the 1950s: food, flowers, entertainment, etc. This is followed by photographs, postcards, advertisements, matchbook covers and more, illustrating the opening thesis and driving mid-century modern nuts crazy. There are some menu covers I must have studied for a good 20 minutes, marveling at the confluence of 1950s graphic design and the culture of Hawaii. The pictures are the point here, and it's a credit to the authors that they totally understand that.I've been on this tiki journey all year, monofocused on this specific cultural obsession that occupied the United States from roughly the mid-1930s to the middle-late 1960s. It was SUCH a prevalent aspect of American life then and it's all but disappeared today. Back then, the lure of the Hawaiian islands was more exotic, more OTHER, because the white people who were busy discovering it kind of didn't know any better. The legacy of suburban America clinging to a tropical idyll that they partially overlaid with their own idea of what a tropical idyll should be ... well, it's not necessarily blameless. But I'd argue that the naive optimism and honest love of the real culture (mixed with rapture of the fake culture) makes this sort of reverence for a bygone era less squicky and more captivating.

My hatred for that book only grew, as I realized it eventually won the Pulitzer, presumably over better, more interesting books. I remember my  of the book at the time almost verbatim: ""So he talks about baseball for awhile, and then there's a shark, and then he talks about baseball some more."" FURIOUS.Which is why My Year of Hemingway has been so weirdly instructive. I liked A Farwell to Arms quite a lot, and loved The Sun Also Rises. I selected A Moveable Feast because I'd heard it was about writing, and I'm a sucker for books about writing. I had no idea as I embarked on this terrible year 2020 that I would discover an Ernest Hemingway book I loved as much as I loved A Moveable Feast.It shatters some assumptions I had about the man. For some reason, I always picture Hemingway as a Teddy Roosevelt type: a masculine ideal who likes bullfighting and big game hunting and eschews all silliness and sissiness. And he is very much the classic definition of a ""man's man"" ... but that's really not where the Hemingway story ends. The first section of the book details his friendship with out and proud lesbian Gertrude Stein. As he struggles to understand homosexuality, she gives him a lot of advice about it (a lot of it bad! Stein was very much about lesbians and very much not about gay dudes). To Hemingway's credit, he doesn't seem to trust her judgment on gay men very much. He alludes to an encounter with a guy who was apparently into him, and who now he can't really trust, but whom he still thinks of as a nice guy. It's interesting to think that Hemingway was more okay with gay guys than Gertrude Stein, but that seems to be what I'm getting. And then I'd always heard his relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald was antagonistic, and that Hemingway hated him, and hated The Great Gatsby, and kind of thought of him as kind of a sissy. (Yes, I'm using that word a lot. It came up in a book I'm reading now and I've fixated.) The truth is way more complicated, as he discovers only slowly in the early time of his friendship to Fitzgerald that the man is an alcoholic and a hypochondriac, and that his wife Zelda is maybe a sociopath. Near the end of the Fitzgerald section, there's a point where Fitzgerald confesses to Hemingway that he thinks he has a small penis, and Hemingway checks him out and spends all afternoon convincing him it's normal, and that he's also probably a grower not a shower. This is a thing that happened in real life, and in this book. I was NOT expecting this.None of that is really why I loved this book so much. Hemingway's love of Paris is so all-consuming that it's impossible not to fall in love with it, too ... but for me, it's the writing and reading. How he would write in cafes long before it was fashionable to make fun of people for writing in cafes. His sort of unconvincing argument that great hunger helps you appreciate art more. The books he reads, the shops he goes to, the writers he knows: this is all catnip for me. I get these weird tingles whenever I read about a writer writing or reading.

Caleb and Camilla Fang believe that the act of disrupting the lives of regular people is the most beautiful artistry you can create. Their children, Annie and Buster - or, to use their stage names, A and B - are at first reluctant participants in their parents' ""happenings""; then, as they discover their own personalities, they become rebels against Caleb and Camille.At the crux of the novel is the question of whether Annie and Buster are the Fangs' children, or their artistic props. What matters more to the elder Fangs? These are knotty, weighty questions, and what's most frustrating is that even though we get a definitive answer, I'm not sure how much to trust it. The Fangs' art is all about subverting expectations, about shifting the accepted truths of life into absurdity. Is the ending of the book really the ending? Maybe. Probably, even.

Feet. Shoulders. Something. It’s that slightly awkward, vaguely uncomfortable feeling that makes these books work, even as the rest of it is comforting and somewhat optimistic.Just Like You is another of Hornby’s British romances, but there are some disruptions to his norms before it even begins. Joseph is 22, Black, and works at a butcher’s shop, among other things. Lucy is white, 42, has two kids and is working through a semi-messy divorce. There are very, very many ways that this relationship could go wrong. Then it ... kind of doesn’t.I can’t pretend to be super objective about a book about cross-generational romance. When I was eighteen, I was dating a forty-eight-year-old, and it often felt weird and comforting and exciting and baffling, all at the same time. To his immense credit, Hornby understands all of that. The two decades between Joseph and Lucy are a wall. Whether it’s an impenetrable wall, or something that can be climbed, is part of the crux of the novel. There’s also a fascinating vagueness at the center of both Lucy and Joseph’s lives. The questions of whether they really like their own friends, how they get along with their own family, where, honestly, are they going, both individually and together - Hornby examines all this stuff, sometimes closely, but no one really has answers. The fact that that’s fine is a little refreshing, even if you still wonder how long something like their relationship can last. Mine lasted five years. How about theirs?There’s an intriguing moment in the middle of the book where Joseph decides he can’t make a massive decision cogently, so decides to have it both ways. That choice invalidates both outcomes, and it has repercussions ... but those repercussions are not immediate, and they’re not as personally detrimental as he thought they’d be. Only as we’re nearing the end of the novel do we get to see some consequences of making poor choices based on what you want in the moment. I’m not sure Hornby intended quite such a melancholy feeling at the end of a book that generally loves its characters, but you never know. The whole novel is set against the backdrop of the Brexit referendum, and near the end, we unfortunately get to Trump’s reign as president. The political stuff bounces into the lives of these characters but doesn’t really stick around. One gets the sense, however, that that’s not going to be a forever thing, either. I really liked this book. Maybe not as much as High Fidelity or About a Boy or Juliet, Naked, but it hit me in all the ways a good Nick Hornby book should.

Last year, I read and loved The Grammarians by Cathleen Schine, and I was determined this year to delve deeper into her backlist. I apparently let my determination falter for nine months, because here we are and I'm only at my second book in the Schine canon. But what a book! Most of the novel centers on Joy Bergman, and her life as a mother, wife, widow, grandmother, museum worker, and dog owner. Joy is in her mid-80s now, and her life is just beginning to unravel. Her role as a caretaker for her sick and dying husband is becoming too much for her. So, though she is loath to admit it, is her job at the museum; her department is managed by a scheming jerk named Miss Georgia, who believes the only old things that belong in the library are the exhibits. Joy is running out of ways to belong. What follows after a one-two punch of trauma is her searching for that answer. She no longer moves fast and she does get confused and dizzy, but she remains a viable human, despite how she sometimes feels. The safety nets that used to cheer her - family gatherings, the house Upstate - no longer seem to bring her the happiness she once found there. And her children, in attempting to fix her or cure her or make her feel better usually only end up making her feel worse. They may not mean to, but they do. I've read a few s where Caroline Schine is referred to as a ""great comic novelist,"" but I think that overlooks the very real drama here. Joy's ennui is so well captured and, oddly, vibrant, that it never gets frustrating or boring. What is occasionally frustrating is her children's insistence that they only want the best for their mother, not realizing that what they really want is the best for themselves. None of it's malicious. Everyone's trying to be a good person. It just doesn't always work out that way.Like The Grammarians, They May Not Mean To is a sharp, smart, fun melodrama about family dynamics I honestly didn't want to stop reading.

I liked it enough to want to read the sequel next. It's bizarre and audacious, edging toward camp by its nature but playing the whole thing (ironically) straight. The brash fellow at the center of the story is named Winslow Houndstooth, and within the first few pages, he's already getting it on with a federal agent man. Later, we learn that he's at least bisexual, then pansexual. Houndstooth is basically just your average horny bayou scoundrel, even though he's originally from the UK, and he's eager to shack up with anyone who catches his fancy.Things get more complicated when, in gathering his posse for a caper (""It's not a caper,"" he keeps trying to remind his crew, ""it's an operation""), he meets a retired genderqueer hippo wrangler named Hero. Just when you thought the names couldn't get more preposterous than ""Winslow Houndstooth."" The simmering romance between Hero and Houndstooth is one of this book's more satisfying elements, and the pronouns are only confusing initially if you're used to only him/her. You get used to them - no pun intended - pretty quickly. One thing I didn't expect is how quickly the book could brutal and bloody. Gailey is not afraid to kill off characters, even ones you think are important. The first time someone went into a hippo's jaws, I was caught so unawares, I thought I'd missed something. Then, remembering Crichton's Congo, I remembered how fast hippos could be. Especially the feral ones.I also really loved the double- and triple-crosses, all the stuff that you want to see in a caper (it's not a caper). The venal bad guy. The changes of heart. The rogue assassins. The rogue hippos. River of Teeth is packed with that stuff. I liked it, as I'd said.I stopped short of loving the book for a few reasons, the main one being that I wasn't actually all that invested in the plot. It's interesting, but author Gailey seems a lot more exuberant in the foreword and the AU timeline at the end; while the action is propulsive and interesting, I wonder if a more contemplative Western involving hippo ranchers would have been more involving. Maybe I'm just still reeling from Lonesome Dove. And while I loved all of the characters, I don't really know them all that well. This book is quite short (it might actually be more rightly classified as a novella), and maybe they get some fleshing out in Book 2 (and in the additional stories in the collected volume, American Hippo). It's such a weird concept and I loved the worldbuilding.

I know Death on the Nile has been a movie - and I think a pretty celebrated one? - for quite awhile, but it’s being remade now, and it’s the sequel to the Murder on the Orient Express that came out a few years ago that I enjoyed reading/seeing, so why not?My friend Tracey has been all about Agatha Christie for years and has been eager to get me to read her. When I was in middle school, I attempted to read Hallowe’en Party, to little avail. I’ve been more successful in the era of audiobooks, where charming British narrators can unfurl Christie’s stories of a cosmopolitan group of weirdos who get together in an enclosed conveyance and then murders happen. At least that’s what I get from the two books I’ve read.And they’re good books. So far, they’re not transcendent books, but maybe they don’t have to be. Agatha Christie helped define the detective genre, and what I’m used to reading are the reactions against the detective genre. 1940s crime noir through 2010s recurring characters in deeply conflicted and brutal cases, most of the stuff I like pushes against “detective compiles clues and gathers everyone in a room with a flourish.” Lawrence Block’s Bernie Rhodenbarr does it, but he’s a burglar, and that’s a different sort of subversion.Here’s what I expected from Death on the Nile: a somewhat cozy mystery solved ingeniously by the arrogant Hercule Poirot. I got the second part right. This is a murder mystery and it’s a little old-fashioned, but it’s nowhere near cozy. At one point, someone gets shot and there’s a lot of discussion of bone being shattered, and it’s pretty intense. And there are TWISTS. I didn’t expect the red herrings and the misdirections to take me in so completely. I had a vague idea of who the killer was (turns out, I was actually right about that), but I didn’t expect the last scene’s shocking denouement, or Christie’s super cynical final words, in which she encapsulates the senselessness and futility of murder-as-sensation in a few short sentences. It’s a grim and satisfying ending.One thing, though: I mean, I know it’s de rigeur to apply modern mores on classic works, but ... it’s sort of obvious that Agatha Christie is kind of racist. There’s some “local Egyptian” dialect that is way past cringe, and some other parts of the book where I kind of had to stop and be like, “No, I certainly don’t care for that.” I’ve been thinking a lot about JK Rowling lately, and how distasteful she is, and what a shame it is because I love the books so much. Same for Orion Scott Card. But does Christie get a pass for her racism because we love the books? Do we just ignore the racism? I don’t have an answer. We’ve been reckoning with Lovecraft’s racism lately and that’s been very good. Is there a statute of limitations, or at some point, do we have to put them aside? I don’t want to, but I have no idea. I liked this book a lot - more than Orient Express - and I think I have to like it with the caveat that the racism was distracting and slightly detrimental.

When I was a junior in high school, my English teacher Mrs. Cosgrove showed the beginning of the Hitchcock adaptation in class and I was hooked. I don't know when I finished watching it - gay movie night at Joe's house? - but man, what an impact. Maybe I want to rate the book less because the movie left such an impact on me. But that stinks. I'm not going to do that.I'm a little stunned I've never read this before. Stephen King cites it as a huge influence on his great novel Bag of Bones (and I'm considering re-reading that next because of it), and I usually like to go back to King's influences after I finish his books. Also, I'm fascinated by du Maurier, because for awhile she was one of the bestsellingest writers in history; something like nine of her novels went to #1, which may not sound like much today, but was a huge feat in the early years. It's the atmosphere of the book I keep going back to. The tone, like creeping fog. ""Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again"" is such a bold opening line. Immediate mystery. Immediate intrigue. We have to lock in to that first bit of story, because the our unnamed protagonist is a bit of a milksop at the start; she's clumsy and shy and basically Bella Swan for the first fifty pages. A handsome rich man named Max DeWinter swoops in on Monte Carlo and whisks her away from her paid companion job. Brings her to his rambling home in the countryside; this is Manderley, which the first Mrs. DeWinter - Rebecca - had once been in charge of. She drowned, though, and literally everyone is mourning her. Especially Mrs. Danvers, the creepy as fuck head housekeeper who likes to fondle Rebecca's underthings. You don't really want to route for the new Mrs. DeWinter at first. She works against herself. Her shyness and inability to stand up for herself are major liabilities. At parts, you want to be like, LADY, GET IT TOGETHER. But you can't blame her, really, because her paranoia isn't wrong. There IS a lot stacked against her. Mrs. Danvers actively hates her. Maxim is remote, seemingly still in love with his dead wife. Everyone has good words about Rebecca. The dead woman hangs over the novel like a human shroud, and it's both fascinating and tragic to watch her fight against Rebecca, then be consumed by her. It's all SUPER gothic. The tone lifts a little when we get to the murder mystery in the last quarter of the book. It's not that it drags, it's just that we know the truth and it's simply not as interesting to see a police procedural insert itself into this haunted love story. It all has a point, though, and by the time we get to the close of things, that creep factor is back. The final sequence (different from the movie, and I'm debating whether one element in the film was an improvement) (yes, it was) is nearly as chilling as a scene between Danvers and our heroine midway through the book, where there's a power struggle by a window. It's remarkably dark and hideously satisfying. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

I'll tell you, this whole adventure was pretty intense. At first I'm remembering having read half the series, then discovering I only read the first chapters of most of them, then forgetting large swaths of the ones I KNEW I'd read. Every novel is connected to every other, but because time moves oddly in Narnia, sometimes thousands of years pass between books. It's weird to see Prince Caspian as a boy in book 2, and then as a rugged middle-aged man in book 3, and then, whoa, a dying elderly guy in book 4. It's a head trip.Also a head trip? THIS WHOLE LAST BOOK. I recently read the memoir Bookworm, by Lucy Mangan, and in it, she talks all about slowly coming to the realization that this is a book about Christianity by the end of Last Battle. I think a child of four could have heard this story and been like WAIT A MINUTE, is this THE BIBLE?!I mean, kinda? It's the harshest book in the series. The subtitle is ""A Tale for Children,"" but it's KIND OF NOT. Within the first few pages, we've got false gods and slavery and bloooooood. Then there's a terrifying TOTALLY NOT MIDDLE-EASTERN god named Tash that also might be the devil, unless the White Witch is the devil, in which case Tash is just an older god than the one that gave us Jesus, I mean Aslan. Oh btw, CS Lewis makes so much use of the word ""darkies"" in this one it's almost like Tarantino directed it; the fact that it's only said by Dwarves who refuse to see paradise all around them only softens the blow a little.I mean, the racism? The Calormene are consistently referred to as evil and dark-skinned, almost as if those terms were interchangable (and they are!). There's one GOOD Calormen in the book at the end, but he's only good because he renounces his faith to Tash and pledges allegiance to Aslan in the end. So that's ... interesting. I've been reading Michener this year. I know how missionaries operate. The misogyny is tamped down a little in this one and Jill of all people is finally allowed into battle. And she KICKS ASS. She's basically the Eowyn of Narnia, and she almost balances off Susan, who pretends Narnia isn't real anymore because she's basically the Meg March of Narnia before Meg became a housewife and found it SUPER FULFILLING. Also (do I have this all hidden under spoilers, yes I do) THEY'RE ALL FUCKING DEAD. Come gather 'round children, and hear this tale of boys and girls just like you who dreamed of being kings and queens of a magical land that was so awesome THEY DIED IN A TRAIN ACCIDENT AND NOW THEY'RE IN LION HEAVEN. Oh by the way SO DID THEIR BLAMELESS PARENTS. What the absolute fuck, CS Lewis? It's not even couched in ""they passed from that land to this""; he straight up goes, ""So yeah, remember that little girl Lucy you loved from page one of the first book? Mangled to death in a train wreck. Oh but here comes Mr. Tumnus the faun! He has also died. Everyone you ever liked is dead. Super dead. Also you're going to watch Narnia die and btw Heaven is a Tardis. SWEET DREAMS.""I mean, I did like it. I liked it less than the others because a lot of it seemed less about story and character and more about DO YOU SEE WHY IT'S GOOD TO LOVE JESUS, CHILDREN? But 1. the audiobook was read by Sir Patrick Stewart, so right there A++, 2. I kind of loved everyone seeing characters from the past books (except, apparently, Aravis from Horse and His Boy, because maybe she made a grievous error and forgot to stop worshipping Tash when she saved Narnia from invasion, but whatever). It's probably the best ending a series like this could have, but it doesn't mean I have to love it like I love some of the other ones. In fact, now that we're at the end, let's do a list of my favorites in order.1. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader2. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe3. The Magician's Nephew4. The Silver Chair5. The Horse and His Boy6. Prince Caspian7. The Last BattleThe first 5 are fairly close, Prince Caspian is just sort of dull (and features The Worst Susan), and The Last Battle is what it is. Also, despite the fact that I've numbered these doesn't mean you should read the books in this order, despite the fact that we can just arbitrarily renumber Narnia however we choose and tell people it's the right way to read it.Anyway, thanks for coming on this journey with me!

Also that I was pretty sure I’d read Prince Caspian and Voyage of the Dawn Treader, but not The Silver Chair. And I for some reason opted out entirely of The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle.YET! For years I had OPINIONS about the Narnia books. Which order they should be read in (publication order, because I’m not a RUBE; more on this in a moment), what the Christian themes meant, that I was SO well versed in Lion, Witch that I didn’t have to reread it for my Alternate Worlds elective in school and I BOMBED THAT TEST. As we’ve seen, I’ve read almost none of the Narnia books. The Lion, the Witch, YES. And then, curiously, first chapters of a bunch of others. All the others? When I got to the part in this book about the rings, I knew - KNEW! - I had read it before. But then there’s a bunch of stuff in the middle about the wicked witch in our world, and this weirdly interminable “comic” sequence that goes on for like 20 pages about the animals not knowing whether Uncle Andrew is a plant or an animal. Reading it now, with fresh ears and eyes, that’s the book’s only real dead spot. This book is pretty damn magical.I LOVED the idea of the pools that take you to other worlds, and how they dry up when the worlds stop living. Digory and Polly are basically precursors to ... well, not Edmund and Lucy but Eustace and Jill. And they’re fun to know, too, and adventurous and exciting. It’s cool that Polly loves adventure as much as Digory, if not more-than. Plus, Aslan is a one-lion Genesis device and the whole scene where Narnia is being born is a wonder of storytelling. Lewis gives us just enough detail and moves on. Weirdly, we don’t know how the country of Calormen is created, except that Aslan didn’t seem to create that as he’d created Narnia and Arkenland ... so yay for retroactively damning those false gods!Two things before I finish this so I can hopefully read The Last Battle for the first time: one, the books are getting far more blatantly Christian as the series goes on. I mean, it hooks you with the little girl and the faun and the Turkish delight and then you’re six books in and it’s like wait did I just read Let There Be Light in my kid’s adventure novel? Apparently so. It doesn’t distract much because you can totally read these books as surface-level stuff, and except for a few turns of phrase here and there, Lewis doesn’t really soapbox. So that’s nice.Two: I am now firmly (and learnedly) on the side of publication order. Certainly much of the story of Magician’s Nephew happens before The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe ... but here, Aslan just sort of shows up, and he’s majestic and shit but there’s nothing of the slow-build nature of seeing him for the first time in that first novel, all mystery and shadow, and getting to know him over the course of the books, so that when he appears here, you know how important he is. Then there’s minor mysteries like the provenance of the lamppost in the forest that have way more impact as something solved here rather than just blurted out if this one is read first. Publication order, I’m convinced, offers a richer, more adventurous tapestry.

The bad guys are mostly darker-skinned people who are fantasy-story analogues of Middle Easterners. They kidnap and plot and call Aslan the Devil, so there’s just a lot going on there. Still, and maybe I’m grasping here, maybe the best character in the whole book is Aravis, a Calorman girl who’s running away so as not to be married off to a wizened vizier. So ... maybe.One of the more interesting things about this one is how women are slowly becoming more viable as characters. Aravis has a whole lot going on, and even her valid friend has some levels. And Lucy Pevensie shows up and people are like, oh yeah, she’s kind of like a man so she’s cool. Of course Susan’s here and it’s FINE. She’s not actively being a jerk to everyone, so that’s a plus. Of all the books in the series so far, this one reminded me most of Prince Caspian, if that book had been a lot more exciting. The escaped slave Shasta (who is FAIR SKINNED UNLIKE THE BAD GUYS *dogwhistle*) meets a talking horse and together they decide to journey out of Calormen and into Narnia and the North. Like Dawn Treader on sea and Silver Chair underground, this takes us across a huge desert and into bazaars and it’s all exciting and exotic and fun. All four of the main characters are fun, too: Shasta, Aravis, and the talking horses Bree and Hwin. I liked seeing Lucy and Edmund again (not Susan), and there’s even a cameo by Mr. Tumnus. I admit, it was pretty jazzy to see them all again.One note about the order: if I were to read these books in the new “chronological” order, I would severely be depriving myself of the slow, deliberate build of these books. Each one has a specific mood, and the books build on that mood as time goes on. Plus, books refer to other novels from the past all the time.

Except for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and The Magician's Nephew, I only read the first chapter of these early books. I very clearly remember getting into them, then either getting bored or distracted and putting them away. To the point where, based on my knowledge, the Narnia books read as follows: British kids keep getting sucked into this magic place and then no adventures happen. Do they get back? *SHRUG* The advantage of this is that I'm thrilling at discovering these books for the first time. And for the first time since the first book, The Silver Chair has a female protagonist - Jill Pole, the first person not related to the Pevensies to journey into Narnia. She goes in with Eustace (from Dawn Treader) and they're sort of bickering classmates who hate their school that lionizes bullying and hates individualism (and the Bible, btw). What's kind of fascinating about this one is that neither Eustace nor Jill are all the way likable. Eustace reformed a lot in the last book and apparently kept it up, and neither of these two are bad people. But they're kind of cranky and sometimes brutish and it's mostly awesome. Like, in the earlier books, you were either a saint or a sinner, and if you were a sinner, you MIGHT be able to change your ways (as both Edmund and Eustace did). Or you were Susan, who was irritating and never got to go to Narnia again and good riddance. But sometimes Peter's valiance and Lucy's precociousness kind of got ... I don't know, too broad? Both Jill and Eustace here behave mostly like real kids, which is a new change of pace. Plus, like Dawn Treader, this one is full of many adventures. It actually takes the same template as the last book, and just applies it over (and sometimes under) land. More than anything, this book reminded me of a video game, wherein you get some basic commands at the start, and maybe there are some side quests, and if you don't listen to the commands, bad stuff is going to happen to you. One sequence logically leads to another, and there's a whole air of creepiness in this one that only suffused parts of Dawn Treader (the island where dreams come true? the hag and the werewolf? Y I K E S). I would say I liked it almost as much as Dawn Treader, with a huge BUT:I mean, so girls just aren't allowed to fight in battle? They don't get swords? And at one point, Jill's all like, ""Well in MY world, the MEN don't let their WIVES boss them around."" Like it's a good thing? I also rolled my eyes at the end at the hard-as-nails headmaster - ""who was a WOMAN!!!"" - goes into hysterics over a glimpse of Narnia. Although that might be a long joke about British politics, which feels more Lewis Carroll than CS Lewis.Oh, and I went a little nutty about the title. Like, in the first few books, you're introduced to the title stuff immediately. Ah yes, there's a lion and a witch and a wardrobe, first ten pages. Ahhh yes, Prince Caspian, page 20. Well hey there, Dawn Treader, page like 3, are you on a VOYAGE?! And then this one, we're halfway through the book and there's NO mention of chairs, silver or otherwise. And then as soon as Lewis says it in the book, I went Avengers-live-audience bonkers. ""THE SILVER CHAIR! THERE IT IS! THAT'S THE TITLE OF THE BOOK INSIDE THE BOOK!!!"" I might be a little wrapped up in these stories right now.I really don't want these books to end. I'm about to delve into the first book I really know nothing about - The Horse and His Boy. I vaguely recall reading parts of this one when I was eight and lying in my bed, not sleeping, using a flashlight to see the pages.

Susan, who had made things so dreadful in the second book, was notably absent from this one ... only to be replaced by righteous creep Eustice, Edmund and Lucy's weird cousin who hates things. Then they get pulled into a picture of a Viking-type ship and all three of them are in Narnia, and Eustice is STILL a little shit. Until something awesome happens. You know how one of my favorite things is seeing a sea change in a nasty character and then they're on the side of the good guys? Of course that happens with Eustice, but the way it happens is really, fantastically amazing. I think I spoiled too much in my last , and I don't want to do the same here. Basically, I didn't expect it at all, and for someone to learn humility and grace after such a fiery trial was thrilling and satisfying.BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF SATISFACTION. This book is CRAMMED with adventure and intrigue and a LIIIIIIIIIIITTLE bit of misogyny. I mean, girls still aren't ready for battle, and one character is defined only as the daughter of one man and the wife of another (she's never given a name! Come on, CS Lewis!), and at a few points I wanted to throttle people and say, ""HASN'T LUCY EARNED YOUR TRUST BY THIS POINT,"" but beyond that ... just wow. The Dawn Treader visits all these islands that sort of lead toward the end of the world, and there is a NEW and EXCITING adventure on almost every island. Every one is enchanted in some way - good or bad, and in one case balls-out terrifying - and the way Lewis wraps us in the adventures is so refreshing and thrilling after the weird stasis of Book 2. I was so desperate for them to get to a new island, and when they did, I wanted them to solve the mystery and get to a new island right away. I was legit enrapt on every page.And look, I'm almost positive there are religious and Biblical parallels to this stuff. But I'm interested in that! It's like learning all about the whaleship Essex after you read Moby-Dick. I'm actually eager to dig into some fan sites and get a deeper understanding of what Lewis was going for, even though the story can totally be read as a secular fairy tale, without any super religious allegory or overtones (except Aslan is TOTALLY Jesus, but whatever). But this book - which I totally thought I'd read before but I hadn't - was so so so good (maybe better than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe?!) that I want to know everything about it.

I think I got to the island part at the beginning and stopped. This means that I never read “Dawn Treader” either. Meaning my entire primary knowledge of Narnia has been based on two novels not in order. Did I pick up names and other clues by osmosis? I know for a fact that I’ve heard the name Reepicheep, but I don’t know why. I liked this one ... but with reservations. For the first half of the book, Prince/King Caspian is a really interesting character. He’s interested in history and astronomy and wants to make something out of himself. Then he’s sort of sidelined in the second half. I think he screams sometimes. It’s so weird. Peter is a more interesting character here, and a more important one. A lot of the book is about him coming into his own. Maybe that’s the point. The name of the book is PRINCE Caspian, even though he’s technically a king. Only at the end does Aslan make him a legit king. That’s another thing: what’s the deal with Aslan? Is his whole disappearing act trying to trigger faith in the children from this world? Lucy believes, and Edmund kind of does, but Susan and Peter are like, “Yeah, okay Lucy, just because you’ve been right about literally everything, that’s no reason to start believing you now.” Oh and don’t get me started on Susan. In the first book, the White Witch is the on-top villain, and Edmund is the real enemy. In this one, the fake King Miraz is the Big Bad, but Susan is like WAY worse. She’s gone full Amy March, and seeing her chastened for sort of believing Lucy but not caring because she prefers to be lazy is not as satisfying as I want it to be. Look, I know a lot of this is parable stuff. Belief in your higher power, belief in yourself, belief in magic - it’s necessary in a book like this, especially if you’re taking the Christian parallels into it. But it doesn’t make Aslan less frustrating or Susan less insufferable. I was also a little taken aback by the huge major battle in the middle of the book, which takes like three paragraphs. It’s kind of funny that we spend like seventy pages on Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy and Trumpkin getting lost in the woods, and then when it comes to the big battle sequence, it’s like, “Wow, so a lot of people died and Miraz twirled his mustache. Anyway, let’s see what’s happening in those Blair Witch woods where the role of Mike will be played by Susan Pevensie.” Okay, so all this seems like I didn’t like it. I LIKED IT A LOT. There’s a lot of world building and deep fantasy history and I loved all that. And I think I liked Caspian as a character, and want to see him grow and change. Oh, and speaking of sulking obstacle Susan: one of my favorite tropes in books is when the bully character redeems themselves, and it was so good to see Susan wielding that bow and arrow like she’s Katniss Everdeen and saving Trumpkin from the marauders.Oh, and there’s one sequence that is OUTRIGHT TERRIFYING. One of the other dwarves brings a few friends into Caspian’s hiding place and one of them is all, “I am the personification of death and I will destroy my enemies from the inside out” and you’re like Y I K E S and the other one is like, “BTW I’m going to bite people and even if I get killed, you won’t be able to pry my jaws open with a crowbar, ps I’m totally a werewolf.” It’s AMAZING. The whole book feels a little transitional, and not really like a complete story in itself. I think I might have to get through the rest of the books to know where I’ll put this in context. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 03, 2020","Sep 04, 2020","Sep 03, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/317501.Prince_Caspian

Her name was also Michelle, and eventually I would go to her house when my mother went calling, and peruse her book collection all afternoon. Michelle was a big one for high fantasy and light science fiction. It was in her library that I first saw that book on gnomes, and where I first heard of Douglas Adams.She was especially keen on Narnia. I was a tiny bit too young to read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe on my own, but I distinctly recall her reading it TO me, a few pages at a time. Did she come over and read to me at bedtime? Why do I think she did? I can hear her pronunciations, her inflections. The way she said Narnia with a slight Boston accent, so that the R was a suggestion more than a rule.I remember falling deeply in love with this novel. I know I read it to myself at least once thereafter. Not twice, which was a mistake. In junior year of high school, I took a class called Alternate Worlds, in which we read classics of horror, fantasy, and science fiction. I believed I was SO versed in this book that I didn't need to re-read it, and got a lot of dodgy grades. It occurred to me only later that I was sixteen and I'd last read TLTW&TW when I was probably eight. A lifetime before! At some point in my erstwhile childhood, I either borrowed or received the next two books in the series - Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the ""Dawn Treader."" And ... I MIGHT have read them? I know I didn't read The Silver Chair, and I made a feint toward The Horse and His Boy but I didn't get very into it. I absolutely read The Magician's Nephew and somehow skipped The Last Battle. The vagaries of youth. For the first time, I'm reading them all. In publication order, which I believe to be the ""correct"" order. My plan this year was to re-read the Harry Potter books, but I'm going to give them space to form a protective crust around themselves, protecting themselves from their author.

I remembered a still of the movie - Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep looking like hobos - and got so het up to read it, I immediately put it onto the top of my list.I've read books about homelessness before. Heck, I've written at least one. But this one hit harder than most, and I'm unsure why. At the center of the book is Francis Phelan, a man who accidentally killed his infant son while drunk, the incident that causes him to run away from his family. We catch up with him when he returns to his home town of Albany during the Great Depression. There, we meet the alcoholic friends he hangs around with, the woman, Helen, he might love ... and the ghosts of the people he has killed. For awhile, we can try to comfort ourselves with the fact that, along with his son's death, his first murder might have been accidental. Slowly, as we come to realize Francis' nature, we begin to doubt. He's not any sort of serial killer or homicidal maniac, never think that. His brutal impulses only come out when he faces injustice, and as a homeless man in the Depression, that's more than a little.Maybe the most fascinating thing about Francis is his panicky stasis. Over the course of the novel, not very much happens. He drifts from place to place, earning money doing a day's worth of work, then either spending it frivolously or giving it away. He has little aim, little gumption. Everything is swallowed up in the whale of guilt inside of him. The same guilt that causes him to give away anything that will make him feel better - money, food, even Helen's love - is the same that causes the ghosts to follow him everywhere. He can't ever escape his past, especially in Albany, where the past is present. There's an edge to this novel that isn't on top, isn't obvious. It underlines every sentence, every character, every interaction. Everyone is desperate and pretending they're not. No one kids themselves that they aren't ""bums,"" but any time they get a moment to remember who they were in their previous lives, they grab at it. For Helen, it's a brief singing gig. For Francis, it's an old suit he used to wear when times were more prosperous. There's a great scene where he's about to give someone his new pants, and then reclaims his dignity, just for a moment, understanding that he deserves this new/old outfit, at least for a little while.I don't quite understand the ending. I don't know if Francis has really gotten free of his demons or not. Maybe that's intentional. Either way, I'm finding myself ruminating on this novel, feeling it scratching at my brain and heart. You want to cry for the dead, but you don't, because there's always going to be more dead. And there's going to be more living, too ... and that might not be much better....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 28, 2020",Sep 2020,"Sep 01, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/267243.Ironweed

The cover captured me: what looked like an airship cruising over some unknown jungle. I was convinced it was a steampunk novel, and while the aesthetic has always fascinated me, I've never read a book in the genre. It was with that intention that I downloaded and dove in.How differently I might have approached the book if I had seen the other cover, the one accompanying the hardback. Two dark figures in a blinding sea of white. How did these two images match up? What was this book about?Washington Black is a boy slave working on a plantation in Barbados in the late 1800s. The plantation's name is Faith, one of the book's cruel ironies. In charge of Faith is the Master, a deliberately brutal white man whose entire personality appears to be cruelty for cruelty's sake. Somehow, this doesn't make him a caricature, an important distinction given the revelations late in the novel. Opposing the Master is his brother, a kind, scientific man named Titch. Inadvertently, he rescues Washington - called Wash - by enlisting him for aid in his experiments with aeronautics. Just the right size, Titch thinks, to be used as ballast for his experimental new flying machine. And that is where Wash's adventures begin.As it turns out, Wash also has a scientific mind, proving more valuable to Titch than simple ballast. Before long, Wash starts to view Titch as his entire salvation - his entire WORLD - so that when he is forced to make his own way in larger society, he is for a time lost. That hardcover illustration shows two figures surrounded by all that white, but what we don't see is what happens almost immediately after: Wash, alone, in a world of white.Maybe an obvious metaphor, but that doesn't stop it from being true. Wash is a Black boy in a world that sees Black people as lesser beings by their natures. He is hunted by slave catchers, haunted by abandonment, and only gradually determined to make something grander out of his life than mere existence. Most of the resolutions in Washington Black aren't neat. Bad people die, but most of those deaths aren't as satisfying as they should be. Washington's brilliant scientific mind leads him to invent what amounts to a place of captivity for living, free creatures - an irony lost on Black himself, but not author Edugyan. We make the acquaintance of an octopus who is captured to be displayed. For a time, the octopus doesn't seem to know it's in captivity. Its experience mirrors and somewhat parallels Wash's, as it grows sicker in its close quarters, and Wash lets obsession with finding the truth about his past overtake him.So: it's not a steampunk novel, though there is briefly an airship. And it's not an adventure novel, either, despite the fact that we travel to the Arctic, to Canada, to Amsterdam, to London, to Morocco. It's not entirely about white cruelty, but that's a big part of it, especially that cruelty that comes from allyship that comes bundled with barriers. In final measure, it's the story of discovering one's self despite (and because of) the hell of one's past, and how mysteries might be best left unsolved ... and how, when someone tells you they think of you as family, you should ask yourself if that's really a good thing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 18, 2020","Aug 25, 2020","Aug 18, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44101093-washington-black

I don't know how I arrived at Sarah Weinman's blog post about Dorothy Hughes, hardcore crime Occasionally, I'll stumble upon Book Twitter and spiral. I don't know how I arrived at Sarah Weinman's blog post about Dorothy Hughes, hardcore crime fiction writer from the 1940s, but once I got there, I was hooked. Weinman's post talked up Hughes so effusively - but not in a fannish way - that I started to believe Hughes COULDN'T be as good as all that. Often when we talk about classics, even forgotten classics of misbegotten genres like crime thrillers, we put a healthy spin of borrowed nostalgia on them. This book is good because it's supposed to be good; therefore, if I read it and hate it, it's my fault. But sweet goddamn is In a Lonely Place a good book. After finishing it, I started poking around on the internet for s and background info, and I was astounded that Big Jim Thompson wrote The Killer Inside Me AFTER this. In fact, there's evidence that Hughes, with this book, actually invented the serial killer story - or at least popularized it. All the tropes are there: the wildly shifting internal monologue, the mood swings, the sense of male power and persecution. Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver calls himself ""God's lonely man""; a version of that type of madman originated here. One of the most fascinating confluences of my reading is that this book, set in the noir world of Los Angeles after World War 2, dovetails into my deep dive into tiki history and culture. One of the tenets of the tiki thing is the concept of escape into a fantasy world of artifice masquerading as otherness. A lot of men came home from the war to a country fundamentally changed; with newfound prosperity, they were expected to become ""the man in the gray flannel suit"" - upwardly mobile and slotted easily into the suburban concept of domesticity. Tiki was a release valve for the many men who came back broken or haunted by war and couldn't handle ""normal.""In A Lonely Place offers a different take on a returning serviceman who can't handle normal. His name is Dix Steele, and the male porn star nomenclature is not accidental. In her keen afterword, Megan Abbott puts forth the idea that instead of a femme fatale, this novel has an homme fatale; Dix Steele kills because it makes him feel as powerful as flying planes in the war did. Also because he's a psychopath. But man, what a fascinating psychopath. His motivations are so random, and his wild stream-of-consciousness thought comes up with impossible situations that Dix immediately conceives solutions for, and then congratulates himself on job well done. The problem is that he's not particularly smart, and not half as clever as he thinks he is. His attempts at misdirection are almost laughable, and while his paranoia is eventually justified, it also comes across as childish. He wants things: money, status, a beautiful girl who loves him. He just doesn't want to put in the work. All he wants to do, really, is kill, and then reap the benefits he believes he deserves.Much has been made about the feminist finale of the book, and while I won't go into details, I will say that it's one of the most satisfying endings of any crime novel I've read. This novel proves that women in noir can be smart, interesting, and sexy without necessarily being also manipulative and evil. If that makes it a feminist book, sure.

Taft is the story of a man named John Nickel, who runs a bar in Memphis Tennessee. When we first meet him, he is first meeting a girl named Fay, and hiring her to be a waitress. That this is a mistake is some thing that Nickel knows almost immediately, but why it’s a mistake makes for a very interesting story.Here we have another of Ann Patchett’s ad hoc families. Two, in fact. John’s bar family, and his former partner’s family. Marion was never his wife, but she is the mother to his only son, Franklin. Franklin, it seems, is the only person Nickel loves in the whole world.When Fay reveals that she has a brother named Carl, and Carl starts coming around to the bar, Nickel finds himself in the odd position of surrogate father - first to Carl, then to Fay. There are so many complications in this arrangement; not the least of which is that Carl and Fay Taft’s father is dead. In trying to make some sense if his own messy relationship with Marion, and his need to connect more with his son, Nickel weaves a story about Taft, his own surrogate, in the days before Taft’s death. This is a novel about fatherhood, and how being a good father is sometimes knowing when to get help. The front story of Nickel and Marion and Cyndi from the bar is fantastic, but so is the invented story of Taft, and what happens when you ignore the warning signs of some catastrophic event. Pstchett’s love of created families, false histories, and strange parents seems to begin here, though I do have one novel left.

Lots of local tiki bars were open or getting new recognition. New bands were making exotica and tiki lounge music. Tiki conventions and shirts and mugs were all making comebacks. And most of it can be traced back to this book.Now, it’s absurd to suggest that a single 20-year-old book started a revolution whose entire ethos is built around leisure, escapism, and fun. But I’ve been reading books about the tiki experience for about three years now, and every single book agrees that The Book of Tiki started it all. It’s easy to see why. Sven Kirsten assumes you know very little about the world of tiki culture, and treats this book as a primer. Here’s what you need to know - the basics - to step into this weird, enthralling world. You get the capsule history that begins, roughly, with Donn Beach and ends when fern bars take over from tiki bars. (There’s even a chart that shows the motifs of pre-tiki exotic bars and how they became tiki.) There are chapters on tiki architecture, tiki “power places” (major bars and restaurants), and a special chapter on libations by master mixologist Jeff “Beachbum” Berry. It’s a fantastic place for anyone to start, and if I were alive in the year 2000 and new I was going to develop this fascination, I would have bought it. The problem is that it’s been out of print for over a decade, and it sells on the secondary market for over $100. I bought it for my birthday and I am thrilled, but I’ve already spent so much on rum it’s hard to justify that kind of expense in the interest of study/worship.

I devoured that novel, and ranged out to find more. Loop Group, for some reason (it was good!) I read his three memoirs: Books, A Literary Life, and Hollywood. And still Lonesome Dove eluded me. If there's one thing this pandemic has taught me, it's that taking chances with literature usually leads to reward. On a whim, I downloaded the audiobook of Lonesome Dove when I was just finishing up another epic James Michener book. I didn't necessarily want to get into another enormous audio, but to my way of thinking: why not?And of course, the book starts slowly. I vaguely recalled that this was a novel about a cattle drive from Texas to somewhere, but I was the equivalent of a hundred pages in and no cattle were being driven anywhere. As the main thrust of the book got underway, though, I was glad for those first hours in relative stasis in the town of Lonesome Dove. I got to know the people, get a feel for how they worked together and lived together. And because it's a Western, we have two mythical figures at the forefront - the stolid, silent captain Woodrow Call, and the laughing, talkative Augustus McRae, former Texas Rangers who helped tame the west. But because it's this Western, the tropes of the mythic Rangers and cowboys come a little down to earth. In another book, McRae might be relegated to a sidekick character. In this, he's the bright and shining center of the novel. He's in love with a Whore With a Heart of Gold, but he's not the one to take her out of town. He's also one of these types that wistfully think of the girl he left behind. But when he catches up to her, there is such an unexpected turn of events that I don't know if anything else could have pleased me more. McMurtry does this throughout the book, challenging expectations and making good on why his challenges were necessary - so necessary that you can't conceive of another outcome. Call is the sort of ur-cowboy: strong, silent, unable to come to terms with his emotions so he comes across as hard. These are the romantic qualities we seek in our Western heroes, but near the end of the book, he's given to wonder if this nature of his might not be for the best. I liked that a lot, the idea that even if people can't change, they can at least be cognizant that not changing has ruined them. I approached Lonesome Dove cautiously and only gradually fell into its rhythms. Then, sometime around the first shocking death, the book caught me and didn't let go. For the first time, I realized that these were people attempting something new and rampantly dangerous, and completely unpredictable. That gave the rest of the novel an edgy, high-wire quality while also staying emotionally resonant. I came to the downbeat end of this novel wishing that it didn't have to end, and glad it was ending so that I could let my emotions recover. I loved this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 30, 2020","Aug 17, 2020","Jul 30, 2020",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/19146797-lonesome-dove

I was in.PULP asks the question: what would happen if Jesse James survived into 1930s America and had to contend with Nazism? Max Winter, once known as the Red River Kid, has long since hung up his gunslinging ways, and now writes vaguely autobiographical pulp stories about his glory days for pulp magazines. But a mugging and a heart attack make him realize that he might have some of that old fight left in him, if only he can summon it.This book revels in twists and reveals, but even the shocking moments follow a logical progression. Winter goes from the pulp fiction of the Western to a sort of crime noir in the space of a lifetime, and it’s satisfying to see a man whose personality was so suited for one line of work can be so easily transferred. Times change, but people? They retain what’s important.The art is stunning. Scenes set in the present day are as flat and 1930s New York City as you’d expect. But the flashbacks and internal fiction are set apart by Phillips’ choice to render everything in outline (aside from the Red River Kid’s signature red shirt), and paint the backgrounds in muted watercolors and gouche, giving the past a mythic feeling that would be impossible to attain in mere words.I picked this book up on a whim and immediately fell in love with it.

It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body.”But there's no dead body, and there's no indication anywhere that there has been a murder. But this does not stop Vesta from supposing what might have happened. Indeed, her entire novel is like the comment section coalescing around a rumor: first she makes a blind, grasping guess as to what might have happened, then she decides the guess is real, then she proceeds as if her wild, untethered imaginings are the only real truth. Is Vesta unhinged? Maybe. It's that maybe that keeps this book moving, despite (because of?) Vesta's constant side-tracks and imaginative peregrinations. We don't entirely know if she's an unreliable narrator. It's obvious that her flights of fancy are covering up real pain, shock, and grief. We get glimpses of those wracking emotions from time to time, mostly in conjunction with her deceased husband, Walter. There are indications that he treated her very badly; Vesta tries to shrug off her emotional abuse and gaslighting, but the revelations of her marriage keep unraveling her, long after Walter has been cremated. Maybe this is why she's given to flights of fancy. And those flights might be whimsical, charming even, if not for the fact that they are causing Vesta to pull herself apart. She imagines herself as a sort of Jessica Fletcher of the woods: there's a mystery here, and she's going to solve it. She can't trust the police, because they obviously hate and resent her. If someone is going to find Magda's killer, it will be her. But she does have to interact with other people, and if they don't meld to the random character profiles she's been inventing around Magda's life, she dismisses them, or wraps them into her persecution complex. And along the way, she grows careless.I've read some s that are S H O C K E D by the messy ending. All I can say is that we're dealing with a narrator who is unhinged and somewhat dangerous. The ending fits, even as it's horrifying. And as it comes right after we think we've discovered the ultimate truth of Vesta's state of mind, and right before the end. I liked this book a lot. Moshfegh's characters in Eileen and My Year of Rest and Relaxation are big fans of creating fantasy worlds to help them cope with the world outside.

Mainly because of the structure of a sentence like that: I didn't READ, precisely, I LISTENED. But I'm of the opinion that audio reading is still reading, so long as it's not abridged. And in the case of Alex Trebek's new autobiography, the audio makes a few fairly significant changes that colored and nuanced my love of the book.First off, Alex doesn't read most of the book. Often when I see two readers on the front cover, the non-author has written a foreword and is now going to read it aloud; the author takes on the narrative duties for the rest. In this case, Alex has asked Jeopardy! mega-winner Ken Jennings to narrate his life, with small narrative insertions by Alex throughout the book. This is initially jarring in a couple of ways. Alex has a very recognizable voice, so to hear someone else say things like, ""When I started hosting Jeopardy!..."" Most people will get over that faster than me. My bigger stumbling block is the fact that I'm a Ken Jennings fan. I've listened to audio recordings of his other books, and I like his reading voice a lot. So going in knowing this author I like is reading in the persona of this media figure I like, and the fact that both of them have recognizable voices ... well, it was a bit of a mindscrambler for me. I got over it.It was sort of easy to get over it, because this is not a demanding book. Each chapter is broken up into little vignettes of Alex's life, with each chapter title taking on the form of a question: ""What is Life?,"" ""What Is a Soulmate?,"" ""What is Humility?"" It's charming. Anyone expecting an in-depth look at the seedy underbelly of America's Uncle Alex isn't going to get it. But for a nice-guy, late-Boomer white heterosexual Canadian who had to invent a (remarkably charming) vice to fit in with ""the guys,"" it's still pretty compelling. I mean, it's Alex Trebek. You want him to have had a pretty good life. One last thing about the audio: Alex does pop in from time to time. He does the foreword and afterword. He takes over from Ken when the book starts talking ABOUT Ken. And when The Answer Is... gets into more intimate details of Alex's marriage to his soulmate, Trebek takes over with so much feeling that it made my eyes water. Some might dismiss this ""greatest hits"" version of a biography as slight. I wouldn't agree. For a quiz show host who has spent his life giving us the answers in rapid succession, leaving us to ask the questions, Alex stays true to his character here.

The first I read, Sippin' Safari, was one of those standard - yet immensely exciting - delves into the tiki culture in America, starting with Donn Beach and through Trader Vic and the Mai-Kai and Kahiki Supper Clubs and so on and on. I picked up Remixed, which is straight-up mixology, a refined combo of his Grog Log and Intoxica! books, and the one I use most weekends in conjunction with his Total Tiki app to make my exotic cocktails.I thought Potions of the Caribbean would be a little more of the same. Another look at tiki history, with drink recipes interspersed. And that's part of it. But most of it is the history of the exotic cocktail itself, and how it's not really a Polynesian thing at all. In fact, I don't know why it took me so long to figure this out, but while the look and feel of tiki bars and restaurants is an intoxicating swirl of idealized South Seas living, the food and especially the drinks come from elsewhere. This is such a simple concept, and I never got it until this book.Vic Bergeron, aka Trader Vic, gets a spotlight here as someone who thought actual Polynesian food was garbage, and instead went for the generically ""exotic"" of Chinese, Hunan, and Indian foods. The drinks? Almost all of them came from the Caribbean, in the Atlantic. IN THE ATLANTIC! Berry dives deep into what amounts to an alternate - and very much true - history of tiki drinks as they made their marks earlier, somewhere other than the continental US. I was unprepared for - and delighted by - the history of Sloppy Joe's and the other bars in Cuba. How Hemingway and Noël Coward were a big part of what made the Caribbean popular to mainlanders. How piracy, slavery, and imperialism threatened these islands, and how tourism both saved and condemned them. And how very atrociously the Piña Colada nearly ruined everything. This book was a deeper (and sometimes darker) look at the past of exotic cocktails, where they came from and why they survive.

Maybe that's good.This is my third Hemingway, after my disastrous first delve in junior year of high school with The Old Man and the Sea, to my far more interesting journey into The Sun Also Rises earlier this year. I've read none of the very extensive critiques of his work, and I'm interested in getting some insight into these novels I ended up, despite myself, liking very much. A Farewell to Arms is set during World War I, a fact that I apparently forgot about, even though I knew the book was published in the 1920s. (""Why,"" I asked myself, ""would this Frederic Henry guy be an American in the Italian army if Italy was one of the Axis powers?"" I'm absurd.) Henry's experiences in the war, especially an all-encompassing love affair with a Scottish nurse named Catherine, are all pretty fraught. Henry gets badly wounded, convalesces, then goes back to the front. He watches Italians kill people on their side either through paranoia or accident. His only salvation is Catherine herself, and there's every indication that he's going to lose her forever midway through the book. It's all pretty damn sad.What's odd to me coming to Hemingway from this late date is that I have an idea of the man built up in my head. My facts are these: he was a larger-than-life figure, had a lot wrapped up in his idea of masculinity, and he was a big game hunter who eventually killed himself. (Also, through the book on Caribbean rum I'm reading now, I discovered he was a pretty intense alcoholic, too.) So here we have this pretty definitive anti-war novel, with our main character a deserter whose entire world becomes about the love he has for a woman. A lot of these actions and opinions seem to run counter to the image I've long had of Hemingway, and I wonder why that is. Was F. Scott Fitzgerald not a swell cynical of his own class? Was Betty Smith in fact like an heiress who wore mink stoles and wrote her books on verandas in France? Everything I thought I knew about classic writers is a lie now.A Farewell to Arms kind of suckerpunched me in the end, even though I had a fairly good idea what was going to happen. I don't know if it's devastating me, because 2020 has already done a fair job of that by itself ... but I think it's going to linger a while, and I think I'm going to read more Hemingway before too long.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 20, 2020","Jul 24, 2020","Jul 24, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6249091-a-farewell-to-arms

The first and second sections are written in a limited third-person perspective focused entirely on Parker as he plans and undertakes a robbery or heist with colleagues. The second section ends on a cliffhanger, as Parker is betrayed -- often injured and left for dead. Section three shifts to the perspective of Parker's opponents, usually in flashback as they plan and execute their double-cross. Section four returns to Parker's perspective as he survives the plot against him and sets out for revenge.I've only read three of these books so far, and that's been the setup each time ... but, for ruthless crime novels involving lots of dead people, there's something oddly comforting in what Stark does. It's like a Harlan Coben character stumbling upon an aspect of their past that they thought was long buried, or an Ann Patchett character railroaded into initially inhospitable circumstances into a makeshift family she comes to rely on. I like seeing Parker steal things, I like his plans being fucked up, I like discovering his antagonists' motivations, and I like seeing Parker win. He's a sociopath. He doesn't think deep thoughts. He doesn't worry about the toll on his emotional health. He just plans scores and follows through with them, and sometimes he kills people. That's it. One of the ongoing issues I wondered about in the first couple of books is how Parker was ever going to get away from the syndicate that hates him and wants him dead. For me, it seemed like a narrative hamstring that Stark was going to have to resolve someday, maybe off page. Or maybe Stark would keep them around as shadowy heavies. As it turned out, there was another option: make solving the problem of the Syndicate its own novel. And it was great.Look, I'll say this: these Parker books are popcorn. They're not trash, but they're easy and fun to devour and don't take a whole lot of thought. A good antidote to the Michener I finally finished. There's enough of these books that I can use them as bright little desserts whenever I finish something long or dense. I'm looking forward to exploring this important side of noir I'd never even dabbled in before. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 17, 2020","Jul 20, 2020","Jul 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/447212.The_Outfit

I’ll tell you, I was pretty surprised I got back into Michener so soon after the 52 hours I spent with Hawaii (and the relatively compact 14 hours with The Novel). Why was I suddenly into these hyper-long books? Did I even like them, or was I just happy to have a long, singleminded narrative to somewhat soothe me during Our Time of COVID?I literally don’t know.

Did some tiki books. Closed the gap on my Big Ann Patchett Read. And then I started an audiobook of the third Richard Stark novel, The Outfit, and it was too quick and brutal for me for my state of mind at the time. So I said, OK, Kev. You've been to Alaska. Let's get into this.So I got into it. And, like: it's Michener, so first I had to find out how plate tectonics created the landscape. Then there are native people who walked over a land bridge from Siberia and became the first settlers. On and on, and from small things big things come. A makeshift family on the run become two of the most important players in Alaskan politics. A Black sea captain becomes a hero, mostly. A thousand-year-old mummy woman tells the future, sort of. There's a whole macro chapter on salmon fishery that I thought was going to be super dull but wasn't. Michener has us follow a sockeye salmon from birth to death and names it and everything, and it's not absurd. It's all gripping. For fifty-five hours I was mostly compelled.I'm still not sure why, though. It's a greatest hits of history: the first animals in Alaska, the first people, the first white people; the Yukon gold rush, statehood, climbing Denali. The characters all have pretty interesting internal lives, but they still feel a little stock. And yet I cared about them.

How much of who we are is dependent what we look like? What sort of person can we be when our appearance never stays the same?These were questions I first wrangled with when reading Ann Patchett's book Truth & Beauty about her best friend Lucy Grealy. My friend Tracey suggested I read Patchett's book before delving into Grealy's own account of her life, as it would make Lucy easier to approach. Patchett's take on Grealy isn't especially sympathetic; sentimental, sure, because these were friends who loved each other. But Patchett's memory of Lucy is often spiky, always unflinching. Lucy Grealy had flaws that would haunt her for the rest of her life, and to what degree that had to do with the state of her face is a matter of perspective.If anything, Grealy's own memories - which intersect only briefly with Patchett's - let us see the constant turmoil behind the self-destruction. And it's dire, sure, but it's also not off-putting, not in the way you'd think it would be. One of the most fascinating things about this book is Lucy's long, arduous decision to not see herself as others see her. For a long while, it's not a conscious decision. Because of the cancer that necessitated removing her jaw, Lucy has to suffer through chemotherapy; during the moments she's not in the hospital, she thinks people only gawk at her because she's bald. That's a malady that makes sense, something she can control easily with a hat. She either refuses to acknowledge or honestly can't acknowledge the face below the bald head.There are all these way stations in Lucy's life that force her to see herself for who she is. Once, trying on a dress in store, she looks at the mirror and really sees herself - asymmetrical, and in her opinion, ugly. A wig that's been gifted to her by a well-meaning friend becomes something of a family joke, right until the moment it isn't. Closer to the end, her face constructed as well as it ever will be, Lucy has to reckon with the idea that her face can't be a crutch anymore; that she, as a whole person, is responsible for being loved and loving in return. That being loved thing is really at the heart of this book. Having the foreknowledge of Ann Patchett's thoughts on this, we know Lucy was probably a sex addict, using it to make herself feel wanted and loved and lusted after. Consistently, she required not only the love of friends and family, but of men who would make her feel desired, if not attractive. Knowing her later issues with drugs puts an early sequence involving pain pills in a starker light; a foreshadowing for a future this book doesn't know about yet. But: BUT. I have to assert that this book feels optimistic. Throughout her surgeries and self-re-assessments, Lucy sees herself as honestly as she can. She doesn't always like herself, but she wants to like herself, and that's the crucial bit that stops this book from feeling like a slog of body horror. Even knowing what happens later, one can't help but come to the end of this book hoping that Lucy will find peace within herself, and within the world. She certainly earned it....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 13, 2020","Jun 15, 2020","Jun 13, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/534255.Autobiography_of_a_Face

I didn't think that was where my interests were necessarily headed when I was young. The only author I readI have loved crime novels most of my life. I didn't think that was where my interests were necessarily headed when I was young. The only author I read with any regularity during my school years was Stephen King, and when I got a little older, it was natural that I would gravitate toward horror more. Some SF, too. I was a speculative fiction fellow. Then my friend Tracey introduced me to Robert B. Parker and it was all over. From Parker, I spun out in all directions of crime writing. Harlan Coben, Dennis Lehane, Donald E. Westlake. More recently, Jacqueline Winspear and Ann Cleves. And especially Lawrence Block, whose Scudder and Keller novels are among the best things I've read in crime fiction, and that's not even touching his Bernie Rhodenbarr comic capers and his one-off novels like Dead Girl Blues and Defender of the Innocent. Eventually it became clear that I needed to dig into the past. I read some Jim Thompson. I read James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice and Mildred Pierce and The Cocktail Waitress. The Hard Case Crime imprint has been especially helpful in getting me into classic crime novels (and new ones in the classic style) that I might not otherwise have uncovered. But there were still some major gaps in my crime-fiction history, and none so vast as the lacuna composed of the absence of Raymond Chandler, and his creation, Philip Marlowe.I bought The Big Sleep at The Last Bookstore when I was in Los Angeles last year. I try to purchase books about the place I'm in when I'm in a new place, and having recently seen Chinatown for the first time, I was ripe for some 1930s detective noir. But at first, I didn't think I was going to have any luck. The Big Sleep is a short book - little more than a novella - but initially I found the words impenetrable. I wondered if it was that the language read so oddly that it was hard to take seriously. Cliches and pastiches all have a locus, and this was ground zero for crime fiction. What felt like the timeworn fictional tics, like over-the-top slang and moody violence out of almost nowhere, were fresh and new when The Big Sleep was published. Somewhere the book turned a corner for me, and this is kind of a personal thing. As a gay reader navigating the world of largely straight (and white, and cis, and male) fiction, I've learned to look nuggets of gay acceptance and progressivism. Before gay characters and writers were more open about, we queer readers had to scavenge, and feast on scraps. It's no coincidence that Stephen King started becoming my favorite writer when I read his depiction of gay guys in It; what some took for homophobia, I took for a pretty thoughtful look at a gay couple in the 1980s. The good guys are horrified at one of the gay men's murder, the local gay bar is discussed respectfully, and the couple themselves have some real moments of tenderness. Well, in The Big Sleep, a bisexual guy is murdered, and his boyfriend kills the guy he thinks is responsible. Marlowe throws around words like ""fag"" and ""queen,"" but I saw those as descriptors rather than derogatory remarks. He goes out of his way to protect the boyfriend from harm or capture, knowing he was devastated by the death of his ""friend."" I don't know why, but that sort of made me see Marlowe in a new light.Of course I hate the smoking - it's the thing I cringed the most from, and the reason it's hard for me to watch noir film. But the book ended up really working for me. The language became its own rhythm, and eventually I just stopped worrying about who was doublecrossing whom, and the motives as to why people got killed. It all gripped me, just the same. The end is pretty genius, and those last paragraphs I read as if they were a monologue in my ears, over a long shot of cars racing down a wet street in Hollywood in 1935. Now it's time for some more Marlowe. And Dashiell Hammett. Oh, those gaps. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 12, 2020","Jun 18, 2020","Jun 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6051160-the-big-sleep

This isn't the first time this happened this year. I had no idea who Lucy Mangan was (further research after the fact has determined she's a writer and journalist and that she wrote a book on the writing of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which I must now read). I didn't even know she was British. But after the somewhat harrowing, somewhat melancholy experience of Washington Black (not to mention my ongoing re-read of The Stand), I wanted some comfort. The subtitle - A Memoir of Childhood Reading - promised a literary grilled cheese and tomato soup ... and boy, did it deliver.Mangan makes it clear very early on that, while she's going to give some publication and background history of the books she's discussion, the memoir part was going to be first and foremost. This stuff is candy to me. There's always that paradoxical truth of stories, real and fiction, that the more personal and idiosyncratic they are, the more universal they are. Therefore, I had no worries that this British writer would discuss only European children's books and would thus leave me lost in a sea of references I didn't understand. The books might be different. The experiences aren't.Understanding that is crucial, because sitting here, basking in the afterglow of this wonderful book, most of my memories are of how the stories affected Mangan, rather than what the stories were about ... or even, in a lot of cases, what the stories were. She makes the act of devouring books as a child feel both like the most thrilling adventure and the laziest indulgence, and that's because both things are true. It doesn't matter that she was reading Little Women at 11 and I was obsessed with Judith St. George and Daniel Cohen's books about ghosts - the feelings of discovery, of immersion, of escape were all the same. (I felt the same way about Gabrielle Moss' Paperback Crush from last year. In fact, both books have lengthy sections on the whole horse book genre which entirely passed me by, but which are immensely pleasurable to read about from an outsiders' point of view.)Of course, there are going to be some obvious touchstones, direct memories that most people who were bookworms as kids remember: Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar, the collective works of Roald Dahl and Judy Blume, the book Dicey's Song, which was the last and most grown-up book I had to read in 7th grade English in order to win my class an ice cream party. See the thing was that when you finished the book, you had to write a little book  on it to prove you read it before you could get a reward and I just figured out why I interact with GoodReads this way. I was a little disappointed that Mangan's section on the school book genre didn't touch on Bruno and Boots, a Canadian boys' school series that taught me the different spelling of pyjamas, and that no one seems to remember William Sleator as well as I do, but there's a LOT here to love. Mangan has convinced me to re-read the entire Narnia series, which ... I don't think I finished as a child. And it's been long enough; time to delve back into Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I got the new annotated edition and those always make me feel smart. I love this book because it reminded me that being bookish in school did not make me the social outcast my mother's friends seemed to think it would (my personality did that well enough), and that I was not alone in my deep love and continued reverence for the books that guided me through childhood, and that are still around, just waiting to be loved again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 25, 2020","Aug 27, 2020","Jun 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28501495-bookworm

Mostly what I've focused on is the history of the Polynesian Pop My fascination with tiki culture this year has led to so many estuaries of interest. Mostly what I've focused on is the history of the Polynesian Pop movement - pre-tiki and tiki-era bars, restaurants, and architecture from the 1930s through the 1970s. This book, by tiki revivalist Sven Kirsten and tiki expert Otto Von Stroheim, brought me deeper into the world of art, primitive, fine, lowbrow, and everything in between.The whole concept of tiki didn't become an American thing until the 1950s, when American versions of Polynesian carvings started making their way into beachcomber/trader bars and the concepts merged together. One element I always find funny is that ""Tiki"" is basically the embodiment of the ""first man"" - essentially the tiki version of the Biblical Adam. I wonder what it would be like to go to Tahiti or Bora Bora and see them drinking out of wacky versions of Adam and Eve. That's a tangent.What I didn't know about this book before going in was how rigidly the authors would stick to the idea of ""tiki"" - meaning carved statuary, mugs, poles, and the like. The other ephemera I associate with the movement - lighted floats, bamboo, puffer fish, palm trees - only matter inasmuch as they support the literal art of tiki. I learned a lot more about the history of this specific art form than I had in any of the books about supper clubs and beachbum bars. I also learned about some of the subcategories of tiki/pre-tiki from mid-century, which ... I mean, we're already skating on the thin ice of cultural appropriation with tiki itself, but some of the more salacious stuff in the tiki subcultures are pretty horrific. Cannibals and ""African savages"" had to have been suspect even back in the day, right? By the end of the book, Kirsten touches on the tiki revival, which started in the late 90s as a strange and fascinating outgrowth of punk purveyors shifting their sensibilities to ""lounge"" culture. Artists like Shag came up in this revival and are still active today. One thing I particularly found interesting is something that happens with a lot of ""low"" culture that sticks around long enough to become respectable: the lowbrow and tiki art movements tried so hard to be recognized as the fine art that it is, it could no longer be considered for the lowbrow art galleries in which it made its name. I love all eras of the tiki movement: pre-tiki, tiki, and tiki revival. As I read this book, however, it became clearer and clearer to me that my love of tiki, somewhat ironically, is only secondarily related to the tiki itself. I'm so fond of the architecture of a-frames and wooden bridges over indoor rivers, the glowing floats and the bamboo. I love the tikis themselves, but they're not necessarily my primary focus. I will say, however, that I find them most pleasing in the revival movement, which probably says more about my love of lowbrow art than anything else.All in all, I appreciate the culture and the history of tiki, more now than when I started. More and more, I'm growing to respect and stand in awe of this strange American underground movement and culture that I wasn't even aware of, really, until a few years ago.

Within the craft of her words, quirky situations don’t feel “quirky,” and her characters don’t feel like pieces moving around on a chessboard of plot and situation. These lives feel lived-in, sometimes haunted, often trapped. And the books feel like markers of real life, normal life. A life before a virus fundamentally changed how we live. No matter how tragic her characters’ circumstances, they are out in the air, breathing and living and suffering in a life before covid. State of Wonder takes Patchett’s basic plot structure - a group of people trapped in a situation, and a complicated woman (alive or dead) as the fulcrum on which the novel turns - and explodes it. Marina Singh is a pharmacologist who used to be a medical doctor. The circumstances that changed her course of study and career are tragic indeed, and we get the feeling that her whole life is being lived in penance for a single moment of error. When her coworker and friend dies deep in the Amazon trying to ascertain how far along a Dr. Annick Swenson is in developing a fertility drug, Marina almost jumps at the chance to go find him. This might also be penance. But maybe not. Dr. Swenson was once Marina's mentor, whether Swenson knows it or not, and the overarching grief of Marina's life is tied inextricably to the guilt and shame of letting Swenson down. The idea that her read on Swenson might be false never enters Marina's head; Swenson is, after all, the central mother figure in her life, one she cannot bear to disappoint.It is this dynamic that State of Wonder hinges on: mothers and children, and the puzzling, contradictory relationship between the two. The fact that the drug Swenson is developing comes in the midst of a secretive tribe who never stop birthing babies only lays the groundwork. Swenson herself is the symbolic mother of three children who abandon her in different ways, while Marina, who never considered pregnancy, now becomes a surrogate to a child who may not have come to Swenson's base camp honestly. This child's name is Easter, and we are more than happy to indulge Patchett her symbolic names here, especially because while birth is common, rebirth is still rare. State of Wonder isn't necessarily a story of resurrection, but we find it here anyway. My friend Jeff recently said that Ann Patchett is easy to read, and that's true, but it's not because these novels are simple things. It's that they are crafted so well, with an eye toward complicated people and situations told in accessible ways. I have only two Patchett novels left before I've read through her entire fictional (and most of her nonfictional) canon, and when I dive into those, I know I'll be looking for a good story, well told, just like all the rest.

She doesn’t believe in writer’s block and she hates the notion that “characters start to behave on their own.” (I disagree on both counts, but she’s had a number one novel and one of my short story collections did reasonably well by the standards of a niche publisher, so.)Love of reading is also in here, sometimes a vehement, fiery love of reading, as when she’s defending her last nonfiction book, Truth and Beauty, against bizarre charges of pornography and lasciviousness. One of my favorite aspects of this book is how one essay will be about writing something, and the next will be that something. It’s like she’s her own opening act. Other types of love proliferate: love of her family, of her dog, of her (eventual) husband, of her favorite teacher. In each essay, Patchett talks about the bitter, turbulent road toward that love, how it can wound and bite and tear and still be absolutely wonderful, absolutely necessary. “Every relationship ends,” Patchett’s mother proclaims in the title essay, and Patchett proves it over and over.If I didn’t like this one as much as Truth and Beauty, it may simply be its fragmentary nature. Also, it might be my own selfish desire to want only a collection of essays about Patchett’s own writing. I am a sucker for stories about writers and writing, and maybe I wanted a memoir of the internal life of an author.

Head to work: audiobook. The gym: audiobook. Repetitive tasks at work, doing the dishes, making dinner - they're all chances for me to read by ear.

If one good thing has come out of the pandemic/lockdown, it's that I've found plenty of time to curl up with a good book. And after finishing my latest Ann Patchett novel, it was time to duck back into the King well. I had tried the audio of 11/22/63 a few times before, but the reader's take on several characters grated on me. You don't get that with physical books. It was, um, time. You know what's funny? When this book came out, there was a collective sigh by the literati. ""Finally,"" a lot of the ers seemed to be saying. ""Stephen King wrote the book we always knew he had in him. A political thriller with a supernatural twist and a tragic love story at its center. A few gory sequences but no outright horror. We're so glad Stephen King finally did something of this caliber."" As if he hadn't published The Dead Zone in 1979.What's interesting is that I read The Dead Zone earlier this year and the comparisons are somewhat superficial. Yes, they're both political and yes there is an extremely well-formed love story in both (those who used to say King couldn't write believable female characters over eight or under sixty conveniently passed by Sarah Bracknell), but there things diverge. Jake Epping, our time-traveling everyman, knows his goal at the start. Not to stop a presumptive president but to stop an assassin trying to kill a past president. But along the way, he finds himself living in the past, and falling in love there. On my first read, nine years ago, I found the ostensible A story a little draggy; I knew Epping's main objective was spying on Lee Harvey Oswald and stopping him from killing JFK. But it got in the way of his life in Jodie, TX, where he meets a woman he loves, makes some friends, and has a major impact on the lives of the students he teaches. That was the story that sang. This time around, I was a lot more invested in the Oswald plot, because I knew how both stories converged together. I didn't have to race to find out what happened, so I could savor the language, the tone, the feel of everything. King gets batted around for not knowing how to write endings a lot ... and I agree, sometimes, that the whole ""everything blows up"" can get a little familiar. Even in my favorite novel of all time, It, the ending is a little extra. But he has some amazing finales in his canon: The Dead Zone, The Dark Half, Bag of Bones, Finders Keepers, Misery, and more. But rarely is an ending so poetic as 11/22/63's, when the novel's underlying theme - dancing is life - comes to the fore, one last time.

The eponymous Magician’s Assistant is a woman nAnn Patchett is a relentless novelist, and one whose stories never seem to go in the way you’d expect. The eponymous Magician’s Assistant is a woman named Sabine who was married to a gay man whose longtime companion died of AIDS. That’s a lot of information up front, so here’s more: the magician in question dies on page one, but not in the way you’d expect. Misdirection. Illusion. Tricks.When I got into the book, I settled in expecting the story of a tragic life lived in the shadows of a famous person who’d died. It was a Los Angeles story, and I’m a sucker for stories set in Los Angeles, especially if at any point, someone drives into the Hollywood Hills at night and looks down on the lights of LA. That’s it’s own magic.But the book isn’t about living in the shadow of tragedy. It’s about second acts. By the time Sabine met Parsifal, the man she loved who loved men, he was already on his second act. His past was a misdirection entire; his best trick as a magician was in conjuring himself whole as Sabine knew him. But everyone has a past, and no matter how much patter you throw at your audience, sometimes the brilliant disguise of your former self falls away. Truth is the opposite of illusion, but this book dares to look at the truth inside the illusion. It’s a hell of a magic trick. Every time I thought I had a character’s motivations pegged, my expectations were upended. By the end, you start looking for the tricks, the illusions, and are sometimes confronted by the idea that some things are exactly as they present themselves. And truth becomes the misdirection. Everyone finds a way to surprise you, and none more so than the woman at the center of the story, who - for the first time - learns how to perform her own magic. This book was quietly and effortlessly thrilling. One night I stayed up until 3AM because I needed to know what happened next.

It’s funny; I didn’t become a tiki adherent until about a year ago. I’d been to backyard luaus. I’d been to both Trader Sam’s on Disney property. But the whole tiki “thing” didn’t hit until last year when my buddy Jeff and I started visiting famous tiki bars in far-off California cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Palm Springs. I could feel the interest growing before then, though. On a trip to visit my friend Josh in Los Angeles, I found myself in a bookstore at The Grove, and there I bought a book on California Tiki. Slender, factual book. But it gave me the tools I needed to go further and deeper, if I wanted to. It didn’t hurt that I’d recently come back from my honeymoon in Hawai’i, where the libations were strong and the moon over the South Pacific was high. I brought these experiences with me, and in 2020, I decided to go full bore.That book on California tiki had a sequel: a book, fascinatingly, on Ohio tiki. Ohio? What the? And yet I read it, and from that I began to sense the scope of how all-encompassing the tiki trend really was in America at the mid-century. Ohio wasn’t a place like California, with it’s Don the Beachcombers and Trader Vic’s. It wasn’t like Florida, with its warm climate to attract visitors to the Mai-Kai. But Ohio has something no other place had: the Kahiki Supper Club.Can I just say how tickled the term “supper club” makes me. It seems so square, but it’s also kind of pleasant and homey. And it fits the Kahiki, which I’d read a little about in that Ohio tiki book ... but I had no idea how deeply attached people were to this place. Man, how I would have liked to have visited in the 1960s.We get the whole story here: a repeat of tiki’s American origins, how the Kahiki was proposed and built, who made the pottery and who served the food. All to the good. However, some chapters deal with some controversial elements in the restaurant’s history that felt out of place; racial tensions and terrible crimes that seem ... not sensationalized, but maybe too “real” in this book that wants to show you escapism and how it was attained.You know, maybe I wouldn’t have gotten this into Polynesian pop if not for this quarantine thing we’re all going through. It’s given me a unique perspective on the concept of escape to a faraway place that’s only real in the imagination. That’s what a place like the Kahiki Supper Club does - offers an ersatz escape from the Midwestern humdrum that nevertheless feels real and vital and important. I never saw the Kahiki when it was around. I wish I had. But at least now, I have a deeper understanding why it succeeded for a little while, and why some people wish they could journey back to it even now....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 19, 2020","May 21, 2020","May 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22542092-kahiki-supper-club

I didn't know I needed more than one, but now I have her. It's not that she apes Irving's style or plot structures necessarily, but that her books move with the same fluid cadence of Irving's complicated family tales. When I was reading Commonwealth, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Hotel New Hampshire. And for anyone needing the kind of jolt you got from A Prayer for Owen Meany, may I direct you to Patchett's marvelous Run.I always think I'm going to sip Patchett's pages slowly; by the time I realize I've been gulping, it's two AM and I'm nearly finished with the book. That's the first definition of the title word, and not the most important. The story - concerning a small Boston family over the course of two days - is propulsive. Even in its moments of respite, the words race on their own momentum, and all the reader can do is keep up. Like most great novels, it's not the plot but the people who keep things moving. And the people of Run are fascinating. I can only tell you so much without spoiling the whole book, and I desperately do not want to spoil this for anyone reading it the first time. Here are some facts: Bernard and Bernadette Doyle are white, wealthy-ish people with a young biological son named Sullivan and two adopted sons, Tip and Teddy. There's also a religious statue, passed down from generation to generation, that bears a striking resemblance to Bernadette, who dies before the book starts. (Eventually the statue business reminded me of the mannequin form in Owen Meany, but most of the parallels of the book aren't that specific.) There's also an accident, one that jumpstarts the fascinating course of events over the following two nights.But I won't tell you what the accident is, who it involves, or what happens next. What I will say is that Run is a family novel, about people we lose and gain and how they are tied to the trajectories of our lives. The things you run toward, run away from, run for. In its own way, it's a mirror image to Commonwealth which explores why families bust apart. Run is why they don't. It's as brilliantly written, but it's a lot warmer, a lot more inviting.

And how does someone who's supposed to live with guilt live without it?These are the central questions of Dead Girl Blues, the unexpected short new novel from Lawrence Block. The lead-up to the publication of this book has revolved around a warning, which may or may act as a fractured come-on: there's a scene of such queasy, unrelenting violence right up there at the start that regular readers of Block, especially those who know him primarily from his Bernie Rhodenbarr books, may find wholly unpleasant. For those of us willing to stick it out past this extraordinarily dark scene (hint: there's a murder, and that's far, far from the worst part) are rewarded with a contemplative novel about the nature of guilt. It's also, I suppose, about the nature of people: do they change? Can they change? More pointedly, is a sociopath always a sociopath, or can they reform?It's interesting, that word reform. Because the man who committed that especially heinous act does a lot of reforming over the course of this long, ruminating confessional. Starting out as a lonesome, aimless drifter, the crime he commits gives him a sudden sense of purpose. Immediately, he needs to hide out inside a life where no one can find him. Discovering that he likes that life is unexpected - and unexpectedly rewarding - and while he doesn't seem to make a conscious effort to change, slowly he becomes the person he pretends to be. So we come to the heart of this book, and the questions it doesn't answer. What makes a man a sociopath? A single, brutal act? Fantasies about that act, casting different people in violent sexual scenarios? Play-acting with your wife, during which you get to recreate some echo of the crime you committed, and got away with? I don't know. I don't think Block knows. That's to this novel's credit. Asking the questions is the important part. Well, no: the important part is how absorbing this book is, how deftly written, how bizarrely exciting. I don't know what I was expecting when I first heard about that hardcore early scene. Was the whole book going to be like this? When the novel turned out to be a weirdly quiet, weirdly gentle story of a man who may have gotten away with worse than murder, and how he lives with it ... well, it surprised me. I didn't know how compelling such a contemplation would be, and how tense and thrilling. Block lampshades a Chekov's gun midway through the novel, and one of the cleverest things about Dead Girl Blues is that it doesn't matter whether it goes off. It's that throttling sense of not knowing that makes this bizarre book so fantastic. Come for the violence.

I started with the introduction by Steve Berry, and he talked about reading the book Hawaii for the first time, and why it made him a Michener fan. As I started getting into that book, I was finding it dragging just a little. Then I cast my mind back to the intro and I was like, ""That book sounds more interesting. Maybe I'll try that!""So on a warm day in early May, I launched into the longest book I'd ever attempted that didn't have the name Stephen King on the front. The jacket copy promised that the book would tell the lightly fictionalized history of Hawaii ... and history is right. The audacious first chapter is all about how the islands formed geologically, then biologically. Some millions of years later, chapter two focuses on the first settlers of Hawaii, those seeking religious freedom from Bora Bora. And it's all fascinating. At the beginning of almost every chapter, I would think, ""I will never be able to remember this name,"" and then it appears so often and you get wrapped up in all these stories that they become eventual friends and enemies. A book that includes such people as Jerusha Hale, Char Nyuk Tsin, Kamejiro Sakagawa, Keoki Kanakoa, Malama, and Wild Whip Hoxworth seems like you'd get easily lost in the names; instead, you find yourself lost in the people.In Michener's book, no one is all good or all bad (except for Abner Hale, who might be mostly bad). Not the missionaries who come to the island and assert their ways of life in the islands, against the will of many native Hawaiians. Not the gambler who is charged with taking a kidnapped woman to the islands to work in a brothel. Not the labor leader whose heritage is Japanese but whose nationality is American, who fought as an American in World War II. There are shades of gray everywhere, and because Michener is such a gifted storyteller, I was drawn into all of those shades. But it's not just people.And if you think Hawaii is only about mapping the course of family histories from the 1700s through the mid-20th century ... okay, well that's most of it. But it's also freakin exciting! This book has explosions! Human sacrifice! A leper colony! Fireworks! Sex work! Tsunamis! It's amazing!

It's nonfiction, and while it's about Patchett's life, the main character is her best friend Lucy Grealy, the writer of Autobiography of a Face. Lucy had beaten childhood cancer, but had been left with a somewhat misshapen jaw and teeth. This aspect of Lucy had, somewhat counterintuitively, made her very popular in high school. Ann, an invisible student, has only one encounter with her before they become roommates in college, and it's an inauspicious one: Lucy has no idea who she is.For the remainder of the book, that moment seems to hang over this friendship, through the highest highs and lowest lows (which are, ironically, sometimes the same). Both friends become writers, and while Ann's books are published, they are not immediately popular. Lucy, on the other hand, writes her biography, and is thrust hardcore into the limelight. Again, Lucy is tremendously popular. Her book affects millions. Ann quietly writes more books, and supports her friend, who needs it.It's not mere attention that Lucy craves. It's love, and for a good portion of this book and her life, she struggles with the concept. Early on, she constantly wonders when she'll have sex again, lamenting that it might not happen. But it's not really sex that she needs to survive, it's romantic love, which keeps eluding her. She can have all the sex she wants, and be on television, and be adored by a reading public ... but none of it is enough. ""Do you love me?"" she asks Ann, so frequently it can be seen as pathological. She needs to be reassured, because as the outside of her, especially the topography of her phase, changes so often; she needs to know that the inside is stable. This addiction to love and to being loved eventually (inevitably?) leads to other addictions. One wonders if she undergoes elective surgeries so that doctors, who she reveres, will pay attention to her. She drinks and eventually takes drugs. There's a moment in which Ann gazes on a gigantic bottle of Oxycontin in Lucy's apartment, terrified of its presence. We're terrified, too. Lucy's neediness can sometimes make her unlikable, which is fine. One of the worst things you can do in both fiction and nonfiction is to turn those you love into saints. Lucy is human, and flawed, and broken in ways that have nothing to do with her face. Sometimes you can't save a person like that, and maybe that's the terrible truth of the title. The terrible lie is beauty. I listened to the audiobook of this, which was read by Ann Patchett herself. It's kind of a devastating listen, even more so than Commonwealth, which I finished right before this. Tracey suggested I tackle this and Lucy's book, Autobiography of a Face, back to back. I think I need a buffer. There's a lot of pain at the heart of Truth and Beauty, and a lot of love, too.

Of course, everyone who has read this already knows this about the book.

Since I was young, I was into discovering a writer I liked and then devouring everything about that writer. I did it with Dr. Seuss, then Roald Dahl, then Judy Blume, then Stephen King. That was my childhood to adolescence. I've continued with Robert B. Parker and Lawrence Block and Harlan Coben. I'm doing it now with Ann Patchett and Susan Orlean. So these amazing young adult books I'm discovering years after I probably should have, books like Hatchet and Because of Winn-Dixie, are stunning me with their depth of character and feeling. I would have LOVED these books when I was younger. It's a good thing they still work.Because of Winn-Dixie is a deceptively simple story about a new girl in a quiet Florida town. Her name is India Opal, but her father, a preacher, just calls her Opal. Opal is lonely because she has no friends and because her mother ran off long before Opal really got to know her. The book is about how Opal befriends a stray dog she names Winn-Dixie, and how she goes about gathering all the other strays in town, and finding her place among them. It's a gentle story about found family, and about how sorrow and sweetness are intertwined. It's about finding friends, and about realizing that good people aren't always good, and bad people aren't always bad. And it has one of my favorite storytelling tropes: a young person reading novels to an old person. I can't get enough of that.Apparently the author, Kate DiCamillo, has other books.

And what catastrophe could be as bogged down as The Tommyknockers or as stultifying as A Son of the Circus, two books by my two favorite writers that were kind of sloggy? Because of the age and time and place in which I first discovered and fell in love with Stephen King, it's unlikely that anyone will ever top that kind of first experience with an author. But John Irving came close, when I read Cider House Rules, The World According to Garp, The Hotel New Hampshire, and A Prayer for Owen Meany in rapid succession, absolutely blown away by how magnificent each one was.That's the feeling I'm having now. Will The Dutch House ever be topped for me? Probably not, but Bel Canto and now Commonwealth are these rare, beautiful books I know I will want to get lost inside again, to revisit all the characters, knowing ahead of time what future tragedies are coming, and how they find redemption in the end.I've read a few differing opinions on Commonwealth. A friend on Twitter said it was the definition of a perfect book. My friend Tracey disagreed, loving the writing but finding all the characters too unpleasant to root for, or live with. I'm leaning more toward perfect, though I see Tracey's point. A lot of these people - and there are a lot of these people - are selfish, and angry, and listless ... sometimes. See, I think the main takeaway from Commonwealth is that everyone deserves a new chance at life. Maybe more than one new chance. Now, what they do what that chance is up to them, and some may choose to squander it. Our ostensible main character, Frannie - it's her christening at the start of the book, and it's her we close on when we finish - spends so much of the novel aimless that you almost want to shake her and tell her to stand up for herself, to make something of herself. But for a long time, she's stuck inside herself, at first because she isn't cut out for the life she's been steered toward and later, more disastrously, because she falls in love with an author who listens to her childhood stories and weaves them into a bestselling novel. You don't get to be yourself when your only job is being someone else's muse.One of the fascinating things about this book is how easily and frequently Patchett slides back and forth through time. In one scene, our characters are children, and in the next scene, that's a memory of the adult versions of them. Some readers have complained that the structure is too chaotic, and it is ... but that's part of the appeal. Keeping up with every member of this family - even the ones who don't seem all that important - is a joy on every page, even if they disappoint, especially when they don't. And maybe for large swaths of this book, there were characters I didn't like. Patchett would introduce them through the lens of other people, so we only saw their terrible aspects. Then we met them, and found ourselves in their heads and looking at the world through their eyes. I ended up liking almost every one of our main characters, and if I didn't like them, I got to understand them. I think that's what you want most from fiction: to achieve a level of understanding. It's the writing, the language, the style and tone, the crackling mood of it all: this is a writer working at the peak of her craft.

She showed up again in The Outsider, again as a side character, this time to Ralph Anderson’s skeptical police officer. In the title story of this four-novella collection (itself part of a once-a-decade tradition starting with 1982’s Different Seasons and continuing through 1990’s Four Past Midnight and 2010’s Full Dark, No Stars), Holly is for the first time our main character, and by now attuned to the habits and tics of supernatural creatures. When she believes she sees one on the news following a devastating terrorist attack on a school, she reluctantly – but thoroughly – jumps into action. This time, she’s ready to believe.	When the third book of the Bill Hodges trilogy – End of Watch – skewed supernatural, it initially felt like King falling back on familiar ground because he didn’t trust himself to play it straight. Mr. Mercedes had been a very good procedural novel, a new sort of endeavor for him, and its sequel, Finders Keepers, became one of King’s best books of the 2010s. Developing antagonist Brady Hartfield’s psychic “push” powers a la Firestarter’s Andy McGee seemed unnecessary at best, and undercutting at worst. Why did this supernatural/psi power concept have to intrude on a fun new style of writing? 	By now, though, even if it wasn’t King’s original objective, the slow shift from private-eye procedural to supernatural tale now seems intentional. Ditto the character development of Holly Gibney, who goes from barely functional in Mr. Mercedes to a strong, charismatic character at the center of “If It Bleeds.” We needed those books to witness Holly coming into herself, and she needed those books to at first believe, then to trust her own instincts when it comes to the supernatural. So what we’re witnessing here is the birth of a hybrid sort of story for King – the supernatural procedural with a recurring character. It’s as if Robert B. Parker’s Spenser became a vampire slayer, or Lawrence Block’s Scudder discovered literal demons living in New York City. “If It Bleeds” couldn’t have existed without the slow burn of the preceding four books. As a bonus, we get what amounts to an origin story for Holly herself: a look at her past, and why she was the way she was at the start of Mr. Mercedes, and how she’s grown in the time since. The longest novella in here (King actually referred to it as a short novel in a promo clip for the book), it might be the book’s strongest.	But that’s not to say there isn’t a lot to love about the other tales here. “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone” takes the creepy classic story trope of being buried alive and turns it on its head. King relates the probable origins of this story to the eerie concept of a phone ringing in a place of the dead. That’s the part that gives this novella its scare factor, and it’s good at the scare factor. What gives it its resonance is the relationship between young Craig and the eponymous Mr. Harrigan, an old, rich man who pays Craig to read to him and do light chores around the house. We’re immediately reminded of Bobby Garfield and Ted Brautigan in Hearts in Atlantis (and to a lesser degree, Jerome Wireman and Elizabeth Eastlake in Duma Key), and while Craig and Harrigan’s friendship doesn’t necessarily go as deep, it’s strong enough to withstand death. Craig is an extremely likable kid and a good character on which to hang a novella; you identify with him at once, which is important when makes a few decisions that are a little bit horrifying. What slowly comes clear in all four of these stories is that regular people, when faced with the inexplicable, have choices to make. And they have to live with those choices, for good or for ill. 	“The Life of Chuck” tells its tale backwards, in an almost picaresque fashion. At the start, we’re thrust into the middle of our world falling apart, bit by bit. The internet only works occasionally. California is sliding into the ocean like the mystics and statistics said it would. No explanation is given for the destruction, but we keep seeing signs lauding a man named Chuck Krantz for “thirty-nine great years.” In part two, we actually see Chuck, and watch him dance. One of King’s underrated gifts is his capacity to bring us into a character’s transcendent moment of joy. Witness Rosie McLendon’s first moment in her new apartment in Rose Madder or Devin Jones’s first time “wearing the fur” in Joyland. Watching Chuck Krantz start dancing on the street in Boston is like that, and he brings two other characters into his joy as well. We get hints as to how this straight-laced accountant-type fellow learned how to dance, but we only delve deep when we get to the final story. “Act I: I Contain Multitudes” explains both of the other stories without diminishing the impact of either – the calm terror of Act III, the excitement and happiness of Act II – while giving us another look at a good kid who contends with the supernatural and still has to go on living. 	These first three stories are fantastic modern King, working with more recent tropes and character types and experimenting with new storytelling styles. “Rat,” our closing tale, is straight-up classic King – a story about how writers write, and what they’re willing to give up to do it. In that manner, “Rat” belongs in the same canon as Misery, The Dark Half, “Secret Window, Secret Garden,” Lisey’s Story and more. It’s also kind of a fable, the sort of tale where someone gets their greatest wish granted, but doesn’t consider the ramifications. Plus, we’ve got a real awesome groaner as the last line, which I wouldn’t dream of spoiling here. It’s phenomenal. 	In full measure, If It Bleeds is a worthy addition to King’s Novella Books series. I think there’s something for every King fan here: the gentle horror of “Mr. Harrigan’s Phone,” the experimental but involving “Life of Chuck,” the writer-at-the-hands-of-his-creation “Rat.” There’s a faction of fans who don’t like Holly Gibney, but I hope that this newest iteration will win them over. It’s the best take on Holly yet, and hopefully a harbinger of more stories to come. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 21, 2020","Apr 26, 2020","Apr 22, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52218732-if-it-bleeds

So: maybe I read it wrong.You know, something similar happened to me when I read that Ohio Tiki book: at some point, I the book became what amounted to a list of all the open and closed tiki bars Ohio has it had to offer. Tiki Road Trip did that in the macro. Author James Teitelbaum takes us first on an alphabetical state-by-state look at the best (and worst) open tiki bars, and then, against a gray sidebar backdrop, all the ones that have gone away. The problem with reading a book this way is that it becomes, eventually, an exercise in repetition. What tiki bars make great Zombies and have a fantastic TiPSY (Tikis Per Square Yard) factor. Which so-called tiki bars are really just Chinese restaurants, sports bars, or strip clubs with an exotic name and cool sign. And which long-lost, lovingly-described bar I desperately want to visit was burned down in 1971. That last made some of these chapters a little sad.Plus, and this is not the book’s fault, but it was published in 2007. The tiki revival was just getting started then. This is before Smuggler’s Cove and Latitude 29. Heck, this is before Shore Leave in my hometown. Many of these bars are likely closed, and many new ones have opened up. Then again, Teitelbaum LOVES what he’s talking about here. His passion for this amazingly odd moment of our past is clear on every page. He champions the revival bars that “get it,” decries tiki fakery, and really wants others to grok his obsession and join in. So maybe I read it wrong, but it was written right. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 20, 2020","Apr 29, 2020","Apr 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/697100.Tiki_Road_Trip

When I was a teenager, on Saturdays I'd take the crosstown bus from Braintree to Quincy Center. This was in 1990, when bookstores still existed and even independent ones could do fairly well. Infinity Books was my bookstore, the one that boosted my early Stephen King collection (and obsession) and which was part of my Saturday ritual. I'd buy a King paperback I didn't own yet, then head to the movie theater and buy a ticket for whatever looked good. This particular Saturday - was it during the school year? It had to have been - I remember buying my movie ticket for a film not showing for an hour or so. I grabbed something small to eat somewhere and parked myself on a set of stairs under the movie theater and I launched into this novel, this wonderful, quiet novel. I blasted through it, because while most Stephen King books are compulsively readable, this one feels even more so. It flows so easily, and every new plot point and character moment seems vital, seems thrilling, even if it's reluctant psychic Johnny Smith just talking with his Dad in their living room. Right now, the tactics Greg Stillson uses to become a politician - jokey, clowny stuff that many people simply laugh off until he actually becomes a member of the House - feels so resonant to the political climate today. It was a little hard to read, to get into the mind of Stillson, knowing there's a maniac pretending to be president right now. But the grim fascination was there, too. King's bad guys usually have charisma, and Stillson is no exception. All in all, though, I'm glad for the actions Johnny takes, and how satisfying it is when he blunders so spectacularly. I can only imagine what would happen if the exact same scenario happened today. Or maybe I don't want to imagine.How I first finished The Dead Zone, and why I know it was a school night: I was up late, reading. My Mom came into my room and told me it was time to go to sleep. I think she thought I had the TV on. And I told her, ""I only have two chapters to go! I really want to finish this book!""I remembered the bewildered look that came on her face, how odd it was for me to be so captivated by a novel that I couldn't put it down. I don't think she'd encountered that type of request before. Reading was about to be the dominant force of entertainment in my life, and I think that night was the start of it. I just polished off The Dead Zone in three days - my seventh time reading it - and I love it just as much as I did that first time, on that long-ago day, when I was fifteen. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 17, 2020","Apr 20, 2020","Apr 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1210787.The_Dead_Zone

It happened with Stamper's Word by Word awhile back, and of course with Stephen King's On Writing. I'm happy to report that I have added Dreyer's English exuberantly to the list.You wouldn't necessarily think so. Dreyer, as the cover of the book spells out, is the Copy Chief of Random House. He lays his book out in a few sections: proper punctuation, proper use of numbers in prose, proper grammar in fiction writing, and misspelled or misapplied words in a variety of categories. That's it. This thing could have been a fusty, dry, lugubrious piece of work and still managed to get to all the cogent points. Instead it was thoroughly engaging - accessible to the usage-curious, but robust enough to hook in writers like me who think they know everything. (We don't.)When I got to the lists of misspelled words midway through the book, I thought, Well, I'll just breeze past this. Let my eyes glaze over a little. I know all this. Nope. Specifically calling out one of my personal trip-ups (Alanis Morissette) and confirming something I'd long suspected but could never prove (things jibe together, they don't jive together. I thought I was going nuts.), Dreyer kept my interest; more, he ramped up my interest, making this smallish grammar book a full-on page-turner. Of course I'm writing this  on the lookout for grammar and punctuation mishaps. I nearly put an en dash for the semicolon in the previous paragraph, but GoodReads doesn't do en dashes. I'm taking my chances here. But that's all right. I just want everyone who loves the English language and how Americans use it to read this book ... even if Dreyer's dismissal of the delightful interrobang is unforgivable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 12, 2020","Apr 16, 2020","Apr 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40063024-dreyer-s-english

It’s King’s first Florida novel, and I think the change in location got him revved up for something deep and involved and scary and resonant. The second time I read this, I was in a low place. It was the recession of 2009, and I’d been laid off. I took my severance money and went to Disney World, trying to cheer myself up. I brought along this book to read in queues. I have a very vivid memory of waiting in the atrociously dull line for Soarin’, sitting down on the ground and trying to get lost in this book.It wasn’t working. Being in my favorite place and reading a book by my favorite writer didn’t make me not depressed. It helped, but I was alone and sad and angry. My predicament somewhat mirrored the plot of the book, where the protagonist Edgar Freemantle heads to Florida to put together the pieces of his shattered life. Painting brings him joy, then sorrow. I somehow skipped over the joy.And so what did I do? While the country is going through lockdown and there’s a lot of fear and uncertainty and I’ve been dealing with my anxiety by doubling my daily dose of Zoloft, I started Duma Key again. Isn’t the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results?Well call me insane, then. This time, it worked. I loved Edgar’s relationship with his wife, his reaction to his emerging talent, his friendship with Jerome Wireman, his complicated relationship with his daughters. Edgar is a complete person leading an incomplete life, and when the supernatural comes in, it feels like an outgrowth of that life. Everything works.I listened to the audio version this time, read by the fantastic John Slattery. His voice made it easy to escape into other worlds and lives while I worked out or did the dishes, while I brushed my teeth or showered.

What struck me at first was how adult it was, and how intense. Are middle-grade books like this now? Within the first few pages, a boy of 16 or so has to choose between going to jail or going to a sort of labor camp. Stanley Yelnats chooses the camp, because he doesn’t know what awaits him.What awaits him is basically torture. The camp leaders make him and all the other incarcerated boys dig holes - five foot wide by five foot deep. Every day. In the hot sun. With little food and not much water. It reminded me of the Sunlight Gardner Home in The Talisman.The holes seem purposeless until we get some of the far-flung backstory. These moments take on the tone of legends - ancient seers and hapless young men who break promises they were meant to keep, and send a curse of bad luck reverberating throughout future generations. Stanley, of course, is the cursed great-great grandson of the original Stanley Yelnats. Will he break the curse? Will he find out what’s at the heart of it? And how are the little tin gods in charge of the camp so cavalierly evil? All these questions are answered, mostly. This book was so compelling, I literally couldn’t put it down.

Until then, there’s Tiki Pop.This book was written (or republished?) in conjunction with an exhibition on Poly pop for the Musée du Quai Branley in Paris, and it’s trilingual - English, German, and French. This edition seems to be still in print, and hallelujah.

Tiki Pop is packed with full-color photos of the entire tiki movement from its earliest beginnings through to the current revival.And that’s interesting. Most books I’ve read on tiki start at Donn Beach and go from there. Some discuss pre-tiki, but not deeply. Tiki Pop delves a little deeper into the actual indigenous South Seas origins of the movement, and then - and this is crucial because I had never really understood the whole picture before - the Poly pop trend BEFORE tiki was even a thing. Before there were tiki bars, there were Hurricane bars and bamboo bars, all building the groundwork for what would come next. Each point in the evolution of tiki and Poly pop connects seamlessly with the next. And Kirsten gets out of the bars and restaurants, too, taking a look at the culture as a whole, from tiki apartments to bowling alleys to amusement parks and more. He also discusses the demise of the movement in the 80s and 90s, a painful time other authors had merely alluded to. Warning: the pictures in this chapter are rough.But we come back around to the revival, and that’s where we’re at now.

Except for The Sisters Brothers, I have never read a book that cold be described as accurately as picaresque. Characters and the bare bones of Norwood's journey carry through from chapter to chapter, but each chapter also feels like an entire situation with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It's like binge-watching a dark-humor sitcom. And so much of it is patently absurd, from the girl Norwood picks up on a bus to the little person he meets in a rooming house to the ""college-educated"" chicken named Joanne he liberates from her life of servitude. None of these characters and situations should go together. The fact that they all seem perfectly normal in the course of the book is Portis' genius.I think I'm going to be thinking about this book for awhile.

I'd read tales of Southern California tiki culture, where it all started. Hawai'i, where it came (back, sort of) to. Florida, which was tropical. And then this book, which struck me as completely incongruous to everything I knew: Ohio? A tiki Mecca? What this book proves first and foremost is how pervasive the tiki and Polynesian pop movement was in mid-century America. Evolving alongside mid-century modern's elegant lines and Googie stars was this whole aesthetic of escape and exoticism. And it struck me: of COURSE Ohio. You're in the middle of America, your greatest body of water is Lake Erie, why NOT have the sort of escape afforded to ocean coasters?What surprised me is that one of the nation's biggest and best Polynesian hotspots was located in Columbus, Ohio - the Kahiki Supper Club. (I don't know why, but the term ""supper club"" makes me giddy.) It had a fountain called George. It had a Mystery Girl and a Mystery Drink, like the Mai-Kai in Ft. Lauderdale. And at least two generations of fans grew up with this place, which was razed to make a Walgreen's in 2000. Author Jeff Chenault is very good at making you understand his love for the place, and for the robust history of tiki in Ohio. It's very difficult to convey emotions surrounding a place most of us have never been, but Chenault does a very good job of making us see the place - and all the tiki haunts and history in Ohio. I had worried that a listing of all the exotic restaurants and bars Ohio had to offer would be dull (a few years ago, I read a book on the history of LEGO that decided in its second half to meticulously discuss every single playset the company had ever put out. It was mind-numbing.) On the contrary, these pocket histories - hinting occasionally at not only the past exotic but also at the involvement of the criminal underworld of the 30s and 40s - were each fascinating in their own way.Not many drink or food recipes as in most books on tiki, but that's all right - it's not what this book is for. It's sort of easy to imagine the early days of the tiki movement in warm places that have their own exoticism to them. Hollywood. Ft. Lauderdale. Waikiki. Sure, of course. But to really understand the extent of tiki's mass appeal, get yourself to Cleveland, Columbus, Euclid.

Last year, Patchett's The Dutch House immediately became one of my favorite books. Do that once and it's a wonderful fluke. Do it twice and it's a pattern. I am now a major Ann Patchett fan.It's so hard to know how to describe this book. It begins with a botched terrorist takeover of a birthday party held in vice president's home of a host country that remains unnamed. Somewhere, it seems, in South America. The birthday party is for Mr. Hosokowa, opera fan, and the guest of honor is Roxane Coss, beloved opera singer. The other guests are luminaries from a clutch of nations: Russia, Spain, France, America, Japan, more, and s the situation settles and this disparate group of people remain together for longer and longer, an unexpected camaraderie develops. Not just amongst the hostages against their captors, but often between hostage and captor. To say this feels trite. You could say Stockholm Syndrome, and I'm not entirely sure you're wrong. But the care and love that develops out of this bizarre and unexpected situation feels so natural, so right, that it resists simple analysis. At the center of this whole story is Gen Watanabe, the translator who works for Mr. Hosokowa, and his elevation from side character to the beating emotional center of the book. For the time spent in the vice-president's mansion, life becomes something of a dream. Sometimes a bad one. More often not. Every character changes, and almost every one for the better. They discover new compassion, new talents, sometimes so unexpectedly that it takes us a moment to catch our breath before we accept it. But we do accept it.Which is out mistake, even though we cannot help it. We're told at the very start of the book how, in general, it's going to end. But near the end of the book, Patchett discusses the type of forgetting those in extreme circumstances sometimes retreat into. One character forces themselves to forget the person they're in love with is a terrorist. Multiple characters forget that the people they're thinking of as schoolchildren are their captors. Music, which is at the center of this book, does not stop this situation; it only changes it. We forget all of this because we fall in love with everyone in this book. And that's why it's a tragedy. Because we know what's going to happen and we care anyway. And that's also why it's a brilliant novel.

Smuggler's Cove gave a pretty comprehensive overview of the big names and deep history of the movement. Sippin' Safari got a little more granular, giving stories of the lives of the bartenders and the folks behind the scenes that made classic tiki so inviting. Glazner's Mai-Kai gets even more specific, honing on the history of one tiki restaurant: the Mai-Kai in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, a continent away from the South California epicenter of the original trend. The way Mai-Kai, the book, works is only vaguely linear. Glazner says at the start that he wants to focus on stories, vignettes of the early days of the restaurant. This leads to a little discombobulation and, at least in one case, of a contradictory fact (exactly WHO was fired for lying about her age? There are a couple answers.) But in measure, none of that matters. Histories of tiki are rife with tall tales, exaggerations, and myths. It doesn't all have to be 100% truthful to be compelling.And this book is extremely compelling. Glazner's way of discussing the Mai-Kai's owners and operators pulls no punches; it's obvious that he reveres them, but does not shy away from their thornier sides, either. There's a lot in the way of famous people who'd eaten here, particularly Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon. I was particularly gratified to read some stories about the women behind the enchantment: Pua, who, in her research of the ancient and almost forgotten Hawaiian art of kapa, brought the fabric art almost singlehandedly back to prominence. Ann Campbell, who was the first woman to explore the underwater Sacred Well in Chichen Itza. Marielle Palmer, who was almost fired for not being able to dance, eventually became lifetime choreographer at the Mai-Kai. These are the stories I love in tiki history, and couldn't get enough of.Unlike those other two books, this one is short on cocktail recipes. That doesn't really matter, either. One of tiki's main components is its exotic cocktails - and there are chapters on the Mystery Drink and the Mystery Girl who proffers it - but that's not the end-all, be-all.

She went on and on aboutMan, was I not into Hemingway.Here's why: when I was 15, a teacher of mine proselytized on why Hemingway was The Best Writer. She went on and on about it. Compact sentences. Gruff exterior, soft interior. A man's man and a writer's writer. She then got us to read The Old Man and the Sea, which I detested. I summed it up in my school journal as ""it's a guy who's like 'I'm gonna go fishing' and then he loses the fish and then there's stuff about baseball."" HATED it.And for nearly thirty years, I held onto that hate, thinking that if this was all Hemingway was about, I wasn't missing much. But of course two factors colored this grudge: 1. the time of my life during which I read The Old Man and the Sea, a time when I was into reading Stephen King and nothing else, and 2. I had very little experience. In reading, in the world around me. One of the reasons I glommed onto King is because I understood his New England milieu, and the people who lived there. That's not an excuse for being less open-minded about a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel most people love; that's just me saying that I was fifteen, and maybe I didn't get it in the way I should have gotten it. (Or hell, I might still find it terrible.)I was in a bookstore at Christmas and I randomly picked up The Sun Also Rises, wondering if I should give this Hemingway fellow another chance. The first paragraphs hooked me, and I put it on my to-read list. A week or so ago, I downloaded the audio read by mumbling drudge William Hurt, cranked the speed up to 1 1/4 so that Hurt sounded normal, and got into it.At several points, I thought, Wait. Have I read this? The answer is no. The answer is that I've read The Great Gatsby, and I'm a little surprised as to how close in tone and circumstance these two books are. Both books involve Jazz Age Americans, and both involve a woman so desirable that every man wants her and most are driven to ruin because they can't have her. But Brett, the woman here, isn't Daisy Buchanan, isn't really willfully using anyone. She, like all the men obsessed with her, is just bored and frustrated and unfulfilled and doesn't really know why. It's a travel novel. A hangout novel. In short, Jacob - our main character, also very much in love with Brett - loves Paris but agrees to go to Spain with Brett and his ostensible best friend Robert Cohen. A bunch of other guys tag along. There are bull fights and restaurants and cafes and one particularly, uh, gory scene. Everyone's drunk and in vague lust and no one's all that happy. Then why did I love it?I think these books set in the 20s are just on the edge of my understanding. Like, I can read something like Little Women or Moby-Dick and get involved with the characters and plots, but they're always a little removed from my personal experience. But the 20s, just before Steinbeck, are a little less elusive. I know people who lived in the 1920s. And these ex-pats trying to escape themselves in Paris and Spain and each other seem almost real to me, almost vibrant and knowable. I understand their frustration, because it's a frustration that never goes away. I could write a book about it now. Hell, I have. I think I was sold a lemon on Hemingway's reputation. This book is about men, sure, but not about Men. Not about Men who aren't in touch with their feelings, or who hate or use women, or who beat their chest all day to appear more masculine. The guys in this book pine but don't force. Loving women doesn't make them weak; loving this woman might, but that's Brett's doing, not Women's doing. Dudes cry. They don't know how to say good-bye to each other in a way that shows they care for one another ... even though it's obvious they want to. It's men (and women) drowning in their fiestas, wanting to stay above water but not knowing that it's up to themselves to do it.I like it. I liked it a lot and I want to read more now.

But I read damn slowly. I always have. With the possible exception of Stephen King novels - those generally seem to go quickly for me - books move more slowly when I'm reading them than when I'm writing them. I get so jealous of those people who can pick up a paperback in an airport store and finish it by the time they get off their six-hour flight. So finishing a book in three days might not sound fast, but trust me, it is.Part of that is circumstance: I'm indoors all the time, without outside distraction. So I'm reading way more. But part of that is simply Harlan Coben. Man, this book is good.I've been reading Coben since 1997. I saw his name on a Yoo-Hoo fan site (his recurring character, Myron Bolitar, is a Yoo-Hoo fanatic) and I picked up one of his books. Sports mystery! Why would I care about a sports mystery? But of course I loved it, and for a tiny while, Coben and I actually talked on AIM, before the internet got way bigger and Coben got justifiably famous. I love the Bolitar series so much - it's one of my favorite book series - so it took me awhile to get into the rhythm of his standalone titles. The plots follow mostly the same pattern: flawed people are confronted with the worst part of their past and it fucks up their now. Nothing really different about The Boy From the Woods ... except it does feel different, somehow. Fresher. Brighter. We get re-involved with perennial side character Hester Crimstein, who has this whole backstory I'm sure I was once aware of. There's stuff about Wilde, the titular boy from the woods, whose entrance and exposition are short enough that I'm positive he was in another Coben book, too, but I'm not sure of which one. It doesn't really matter. The characters all come to life in this book, immediately demanding your attention and sympathy and interest. Are the bad guys quickly drawn? A little. Is the quadruple-twist at the end maybe one twist too many? Hard to say. But Coben's like King - the good guys are always more interesting, no matter how much we say we love to read about bad guys. And hell, if I'm grinning THIS much at that final twist, something worked. Did I mention the plot? No? It's great, it's fun, and it gets the job done.

Maybe. I picked up that California Tiki book last year without any idea of the effect it would have on me. Then my buddy Jeff and I started going to tiki bars, and Palm Springs came into my life, and we went to Smuggler's Cove and THEN I read the book by the owner of Smuggler's Cove. Guys, it's been a whirlwind.If California Tiki was a broad overview of the tiki movement in the 1950s and 60s and Smuggler's Cove gave a more specific look at the big names who pioneered the trend, Sippin' Safari goes a little deeper into the people who kept it going. Unsung Filipino bartenders and restauranteurs who mixed the drinks in the back rooms finally get their due here, with deep histories before, during, and after the tiki craze. At first, I wondered if these guys would have as fascinating a history as Donn Beach and Trader Vic Bergeron; boy, did I underestimate these lives. And as Berry's roughly chronological guide follows the biographies of these amazing folks, it also charts the course of the entire tiki ""thing"" as it moved from Hollywood back to Hawaii. Discovering that Hawaii wasn't ""tropical"" enough for tiki aficionados was a major revelation for me. From Hawaii and California, tiki and Polynesian pop moved all over the country, landing especially in Chicago and Florida, and eventually New Orleans. All the famous bars - the Tiki-Ti, the Mai-Kai, the Luau - are profiled with tons of period pictures, along with drink recipes if you want to replicate the feel at home. Now, I actually don't want to do that. I love exotic cocktails, but I love them in context of tiki bars. But the history of these drinks remains fascinating. It's almost art, the construction and execution of tiki drinks, and learning about the ways the drink mixes were kept hidden using unbreakable codes and how they were stolen and approximated elsewhere ... a lot of this is pop archeology. It's pretty awesome.This is the 10th anniversary of Sippin' Safari, and I had no idea how major the impact of this book was. There were a lot of factors that went into the tiki resurgence, but this book was one of the major catalysts. I loved the long afterword that discusses the worldwide impact of the original book, and what's happening right now in the world of Polynesian pop. It also has a huge index of books in the back that I now must also read, because when I'm into something new, I don't stop until I get enough. And I haven't had nearly enough.

Complications arise from all sides, from the possible double- and triple-crosses involved with the heist, to the lingering aftereffects from the doctor who changed his face, to the people he can't trust but has to.

For that reason, I'm giving a couple pretty big thumbs-up to The Woman in the Window.The reason I'm asking these questions, though, is because the mysteries at the heart of the book - and there's a few - aren't all that hard to figure out. I understood one plot device about a hundred pages before our main character got there there, and the whodunit of it all came to me way before the end. Does this stuff matter? Maybe. A little. But what matters more is the woman at the center of the book. Anna Fox, Child Psychologist. She's an agoraphobic, and has been stuck in her house for nearly a year following a major trauma we learn about in increments. She's got a fairly active life in her home: she watches old Hitchcock movies (some of which seem to comment directly on the plot), she plays online chess, and she gives out free therapy to users on a message board called The Agora - a meeting place for shut-ins. She's in stasis, but stasis doesn't seem as bad as all that. Oh, sure, she drinks way too much, and medicates inefficiently, but that seems par for the course for titles with females inside prepositional phrases (I very much thought about The Girl on the Train during this). But Anna's life gets turned upside-down - again - when she sees her neighbor get stabbed from her window. The only problem is: DID she, though? No one else believes this woman exists. And for all Dr. Fox knows, she doesn't. Because don't some of her pills give her powerful hallucinations? Especially when taking them with alcohol?What I liked most about this book is Finn's take on those with mental disabilities and disorders, and how they should be taken seriously. I liked Anna Fox a lot, even when she was drinking and acting dumb, because it's balanced with a hell of a lot of being smart. Weirdly, the book was fun.

The whole tiki bar culture has been new to me, and kind of overwhelming. Those who know me know that I rarely relax, and the whole point of tiki is relaxation and escape. Also, I don’t really drink that much.Except ... maybe now I do. Because tiki bar crawls are not really unusual for me anymore. I’ve developed a taste for rum along with my interest in the mystery and wonder of the wholly imagined and absolutely real culture of tiki.Martin and Rebecca Cate’s book is partially about the history of their bar - which is astounding - but it’s also the history of everything in the exotic world of tiki. It touches on all the mainstays: Donn Beach and Trader Vic, the origins and evolution of tiki bars, the history of a movement that was largely invented by frustrated mid-century men who needed a release valve. But the Cates go deeper, and we get into the history and manufacture of rum (and rhum), a chapter I thought I would find dull but was actually fun and informative.

Stephen King, known for horror, and John Irving, known for ... I don't know, quirk? ... are the only authors above him. Unlike with those other two, there are quite a few Block books that don't really interest me. I tried to get into the Tanner series and gave up after the first book. He has a whole passel of early erotic fiction, often written under pseudonyms, that I simply don't want to delve into. But a lot of his one-off books (Getting Off, Resume Speed, Defender of the Innocent, to name a few) are killer. Of course, I'm not original. The books that grabbed me the most were the Matt Scudder books, the Keller books, and the comic mysteries of gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. We got what might be a final Keller book last year. Now it's Bernie's turn. To be fair, most of The Burglar in Short order isn't exactly new stuff. There's a long introduction in which Block details where the selections all came from - catnip to a publishing nerd like me - and most of them are short stories, selections from Bernie novels, and weird ephemera in which we see Block interacting with Bernie inside his bookstore. Most of the short stories have been collected before - I specifically recently read ""A Thief in the Night"" in the older Block collection Enough Rope. But a lot of it was new to me, and I loved all of it. Especially the locked-room mystery ""The Burglar Who Smelled Smoke,"" which made me so happy I literally giggled reading it. The last bit is brand-new, a meta-take on how some series characters never age. I won't spoil it, but it reminded me very much of the Pinocchio character in the comic book Fables, who had been granted the wish to become a real boy ... only the Blue Fairy had been frustratingly literal. Man, I loved this book. Like all fans who've had their hearts stolen by the gentleman burglar, I want the adventures of Bernie Rhodenbarr (and Scudder, and Keller) to continue forever, even though that's not possible. As it stands, The Burglar in Short Order is a good way to go out ... unless, lurking somewhere in Lawrence Block, another novella just HAS to come out.

After seeing the more recent film with Jeff Bridges and Hailee Stanfield (I've never - shock! - seen the John Wayne version), I immediately searched for an audiobook. I think I found one at once, but it was in some weird format, because the internet was wild back then. I found reasons to put off getting a good copy. And then it faded from the immediacy of my need.That changed last week, when I learned that its author Charles Portis had died. I don't mean to be ghoulish. When I got into Vonegut, I was always bizarrely proud of the fact that I'd begun Slaughterhouse-5 BEFORE he died, so I wasn't being awful. I've mellowed on stuff like that, and I'm glad I have. True Grit is a fantastic novel.The exceedingly simple plot for those not in the know: Mattie Ross's father has been killed by the drunk and cowardly Tom Chaney. She lights off on a quest to see him brought to justice. Along the way, she enlists the service of equally drunk federal marshall Rooster Cogburn (and, secondarily, a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf) to aid her on her quest. That's it. That's the whole plot. But it's not the whole story. Mattie, you see, is a preternaturally serious 14-year-old girl with a single-minded mission that will take her through the wilds of the wild West. Murder doesn't faze her. She's not scared off easily. She feels things like exhaustion and soreness and - eventually - life-threatening pain, but she refuses to be deterred by it. There's comedy in her singlemindedness, but there's also nobility. She seeks Cogburn because she needs someone with true grit beside her on her quest. It says something about Portis's considerable skill that he never has to point out that Mattie is the one with REAL grit. You know it from page one, and that knowledge only deepens and resonates as the novel continues. I don't know why I took so long with this book. I listened to the version read by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Donna Tartt, and her essay following the text about why she loves this book so much was enlightening. I wish I'd read this as a kid so that I could go back and love it with fresh eyes as a grownup.

She gave me a copy for my birthday and was all, ""You're going to like this,"" and I said ""scoff,"" because what has Tracey ever done for my reading except introduce me to the genre of modern crime and detective fiction in 1993 with Robert B. Parker? (To be fair, I introduced her to Dennis Lehane and Harlan Coben before they were big, and when she still liked Harlan Coben.)Anyway, what broke the ice was Ann Cleeves' new series, The Long Call which was not, I discovered, about someone chatting on the phone cross country. I liked that a lot and decided to finally give Raven Black a go. I'm so glad I did. The only real British mysteries I've been able to get into until recently have been the Maisie Dobbs books, and they're period pieces; there's a lot about World Wars and trauma and stuff to scratch the Dad gene I apparently have inside me that's fascinated with this stuff. With this book, I just had to care about people and a small island community. Cleeves doesn't rush that caring, either. Slowly but efficiently, we're introduced to the Shetland folk, measure by measure, and the language and tone are so well-captured that by the time we find the body, we already have a ready list of suspects in our head. The spiral of tension doesn't radiate out from the body, but in from the community. Maybe everyone has a motive. Maybe no one does. Only then are we introduced to Detective Jimmy Perez, the ostensible lead character, and again I was impressed by Cleeves' deftness and economy of words. As readers, our minds have been trained to view the ""cop from away"" with suspicion, especially once we've gotten to know the community. But we get inside Perez's mind, backstory, and motivations almost immediately, and he's woven into the fabric of this place so quickly that we don't have time for all those awkward ""you're not from here, you don't know us!"" scenes that can get tiring. The book just zooms along. Part of that could be that I'd borrowed a library audiobook that was due today and I listened to eight hours of it yesterday on 1 1/4 speed to make sure I got through it. But part of it was that, although Cleeves definitely takes time to let us know the characters and why they're doing the things they're doing, she doesn't WASTE time. We know exactly what we need to know, plus some character moments and shading, and then we move on. Well ... I mean, there are the red herrings. Like SO many. And I'd get annoyed but ... look, when I read mystery or crime fiction, it's not that I shut my mind off. I'm just normally along for the ride. But with this book and a handful of others, I was actively trying to figure out the mystery, and going down rabbit holes with Perez made it all the more fun. (Also fun? Thinking that ""Up Helly Aa"" was like a French word spelled ""Apelier"" until I gave in and looked it up. The pitfalls of audio reading.)So far, two Cleeves books this year. They will not be the last. I've got a few more books in queue before the next Jimmy Perez, but I'm hoping to blast through the whole series this year, if possible. So, Tracey, if you're reading? You were right, once again.

That's the story. It's a good one.I've been reading Donald E. Westlake a lot this year. They're complicated books, these long-ago Westlake titles. Memory is heartbreaking and sentimental, but tough when it needs to be. The Comedy is Finished is a dark semi-political thriller, but the jokes in it are pretty smart and actually funny.Westlake wrote the Parker novels under the Richard Stark name, and as far as I can tell, they're nothing like his own books. They're nasty. They don't seem to follow any kind of moral code. Parker is a bastard, but so is everyone. One of the bad guys beats a prostitute and steps on her head without any moral compunction. Parker accidentally kills someone and we spend little time worrying about them. Some. Not a lot. The Hunter is a streamlined, exhilarating novel (I finished in a day) in which crime and murder and death are all part of the score. Parker isn't like John Keller, from the books by Lawrence Block. Parker doesn't wrestle with his conscience much. He doesn't like killing, but he does it when people are between him and the things he believes should be his. He's not a psychopath. At least in The Hunter, we never get deep enough inside him to really understand what he is.My only experience with Parker so far has been the graphic novel for Slayground, which I picked up because I liked the mid-century art. I think I'm going to get the graphic novel based on this one, as well. And then I'm going to read the second book in the series. Wikipedia explains that most Stark novels follow the same format:Each book is divided into four sections of roughly equal length, subdivided into shorter chapters. The first and second sections are written in a limited third-person perspective focused entirely on Parker as he plans and undertakes a robbery or heist with colleagues. The second section ends on a cliffhanger, as Parker is betrayed -- often injured and left for dead. Section three shifts to the perspective of Parker's opponents, usually in flashback as they plan and execute their double-cross. Section four returns to Parker's perspective as he survives the plot against him and sets out for revenge.I'm into that. VERY into that.

It's the story of that man's twin children, who lived with their mother until their mother died. It's about how those two twins spontaneously combust sometimes. And it's the story of Lillian, this book's main character, and how she came to be the twins' governess for the summer. The premise is what drew me to the book, but what kept me and held me immediately was Lillian's voice. Based on initial s, I thought she was going to be this hard-bitten woman who hated life and now had to clean up her act to be nanny to fire children. But it's not like that at all. From page one, Lillian proves herself to be smart and sure and amazing ... and fucked over by life at every turn. There's a huge betrayal in the first third of the book that had me screaming, because Lillian is awesome and I didn't want her to get this ruined this quickly. But then she does become the governess of the fire children, Bessie and Roland. I didn't know that this would be the core emotional component of the book, Lillian and these two firestarter kids who have also been fucked over by life. Their initial meeting is fraught, to say the least, but their slow and deliberate understanding of one another is one of the best and most compelling situations I've read all year. Midway through the book, there's a revelation as shocking and sudden as the one I mentioned above - maybe more so. It makes you understand the kids more, and it makes Lillian's deepening connection to them make sense. Eventually things go right, and then they go wrong, and then there's another late-novel twist I totally should have seen coming. All of it makes sense, especially Lillian's complicated connection with Madison, the twins' stepmother and her lifelong best friend and first love, who'd taken part in that massive betrayal I keep coming back to. Like most people in this book, sometimes I hate Madison and sometimes I love Madison, and I think that's how we're supposed to feel because that's how Lillian feels.And oh my god this book is funny. There were several moments where I legitimately laughed out loud, so much so that I had to pause the audiobook and rewind it. Couple that with a full-novel sweep of compassion and earnest, earned goodness, and you come away with a novel that feels good but that makes you work for that feeling.

He's supposed to be funny! I bought the book and returned home and put it in my to-read pile and it's been a year and a half.In the meantime, I happened to read Hodgman's Medallion Status, a second book of essays that serves as sort of a sequel to Vacationland. I've done it backwards before with humorists' books of essays. I read Slone Crosley's Look Alive Out There years before her big breakthrough book, I Was Told There'd Be Cake. The difference is that Crosley's books seem to exist in a bubble; sure, they make more and better sense if you read them in order - you get a writer's progression, which I value highly. But Look Alive wasn't a sequel, per se. In Hodgman's Medallion Status, he references specific and very intricate details that follow up on chance asides and hints in Vacationland. That whole story about revisiting his alma mater's secret society, years after he remembers none of it because of an alcoholic fall down some stairs and the concurrent blackout? Vacationland has its origin story. I can only imagine how much more I would have liked that whole tale if I'd read this and thought, ""Oh, there must be more to it. I hope I find out someday.""A lot of Vacationland is origin stories. How Hodgman came to own two vacation homes, even though, despite his self-shamed white privilege, he's not really all that wealthy or connected. The whole mystery of the famous author who once lived and died in his town emerges first here, and Hodgman's discussion about how the locals never discuss it so delightfully reaffirms my concept of Mainers I was giddy throughout. And he talks about his mother, who died of lung cancer, and how, achingly, you can want a person to be alive and still be positively transformed by their passing. It's fantastic writing. Hodgman allows himself discoveries and doesn't undercut the wonder of them. He's self-deprecating, but not in a way that feels false or showy. He talks about Stephen King a lot, and with some reverence, so I'm all about that. (He also references Bruce Springsteen as a singer he doesn't like - boo - but whom he acknowledges is great - fine.) Most of all, Hodgman finds himself in the midst of impossible situations, occasionally of his own design, and he has the talent and gumption to make us laugh at them. It's a skill a lot of people think they're good at and aren't. The reason people think they're good at it is because of folks like John Hodgman, who make it seem so damn easy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 05, 2020","Feb 07, 2020","Feb 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34347433-vacationland

The previous book I finished, Westlake's Memory, was very good, very involved, and absolutely not a crime novel. This one is, and I'm going to go ahead and agree with the copy on the front of the book: this is Westlake's great final novel.The premise is this: what if, in the early 1970s, the Symbionese Liberation Army kidnapped Bob Hope in exchange for the release of political prisoners? Now, I don't know all that much about the left-wing rebel factions that cropped up during the sixties. I know they felt that their voice needed to be heard, and I know they were passionate about revolution at any cost. Any cost sometimes meant killing. Any cost sometimes meant dying. And it's no mistake that the Bob Hope analogue is named Koo. But what this particular group of militants discover, like so many characters in so many novels I read written by Baby Boomers, is that the sixties eventually ended. Revolution stopped being popular. And what they have done is kidnap a beloved American comedy institution - something of a symbol of the previous generation's hopes and dreams - and attempt to pit his life against an apathetic new era they don't understand. Honestly, though, it's not as political as all that. The premise is political, but the story is very human. We learn all about Koo Davis's checkered past. We meet his sort-of ex-wife, the sons he can't connect with, his worried agent. We live in the world of the FBI agent in charge of bringing Koo back alive. And we dig into the internal lives of the revolutionaries ... especially Mark, the deranged psychopath who has a pretty obvious secret that shoots off in astoundingly un-obvious ways. Westlake moves his plot quickly, forcing it to slow down by introducing multiple viewpoints (and cleverly putting Koo Davis' point of view in present tense, heightening the sense of immediacy). You end up understanding almost everyone this way, if not always liking them (especially Peter, who seems like a minor character at the start of the book and becomes a major pain in the ass). And like Davis, you kind of understand the terrorists' rhetoric, but you can't like that, either, because none of it justifies their actions. What we come away with, I think, is that some characters discover only too late that their worldview isn't a worldview after all, and that they really only care about themselves. And some characters kind of come to the opposite conclusion. I liked it a lot.

Westlake, one of the great crime writers of our time, is known mainly for two series characters: Dortmunder, whose novels appear under Westlake's own name, and Parker, whose novels appear under the Richard Stark name. Both series showcase Westlake's breadth of styles, from comic to noir, and his flexibility of genre. Or so I've heard. I've read neither.This is both my confession and my absolution. I have read Westlake, and loved Westlake. Just not in the ways you'd suspect. Back when I was still working in bookstores, I picked up the 1997 novel The Ax, a crime thriller about downsizing. I couldn't put it down. Three years later, in 2000, his dark novel about the publishing industry, The Hook came out. I felt the books were spiritually related. I loved them. I loved Westlake. And then I promptly stopped reading Westlake. What can I say? Robert B. Parker's Spenser was forefront in my mind then, whenever Stephen King wasn't releasing anything. Then I discovered Harlan Coben, and Dennis Lehane, and when I wanted to dip back into classic crime, I picked up a Jim Thompson novel, a good way to love writing and hate the world. The confluence of two outside influences brought me back to Westlake: I found Lawrence Block, he of the Scudder and Keller and Rhodenbarr novels, and I decided to explore the Hard Case Crime publishing house beyond the Stephen King stuff.Hard Case Crime publishes terrific vintage crime novels that have gone out of print, plus current crime novels written in that style. It republished a classic Westlake book, Somebody Owes Me Money, which I read and enjoyed ... though it didn't stick with me. Then, halfway through Lawrence Block's fantastic collection of essays, Hunting Buffalo with Bent Nails, I came across a recommendation: Westlake's long-lost, never-published Memory, which Hard Case Crime put into print for the first time in 2010. Memory: I remembered buying the book when it first came out, but as it sometimes happens with me and novels, I get distracted and put them aside. I'd liked the first few pages I read and chastised myself for not reading more. Then I remembered I'd also purchased the audiobook. I had two copies of this book just lying around, a book I intended to read, a book I wanted to read, and yet I hadn't hunkered down and actually read it. Must have slipped my mind.Well, as you can see, that's no longer the case. I queued up Memory three days ago on my Audible app. And then could not stop listening. Here's the premise: a man is caught in bed with a beautiful woman by the woman's husband. The husband picks up a chair and bashes the man over the head. He wakes up in a hospital with a concussion ... and a form of amnesia that works on both his short-term and long-term memory. He can't quite remember how he got to the hospital. He doesn't remember his parents. He knows he has a sister but can't remember her married name. And that's just the beginning of Paul Cole's story.I almost want to stop it there, because Memory is a book that rewards the reader who doesn't know much going in. And it's funny that I'm using the word ""rewards,"" because there's so much unsatisfying about the book ... but it's in a funny sort of satisfied way. It's not a crime novel, despite the opening gambit. It's a novel, really, about identity: who we are when we don't remember who we were.It's this friction that drives so much of this fantastic novel. Paul's drive to get back to the version of himself he was before he lost his memory takes up a significant chunk of the book's middle section, set in New York City. He knows he used to be an actor, so he's determined to be that again. He knows who his friends were, so he forces himself back into their world. And it's frustrating at times, because the Paul who came away with the memory loss wasn't that person anymore. ""I'm an actor because I'm supposed to be an actor,"" he tells himself a few times, before realizing over and over again that the only real acting he's doing is pretending he's something he's not.It's a ruminative novel. It's not like Memento, the movie whose protagonist suffers from short-term memory loss. That is a crime story, and maybe my hesitation was that it would be too similar to that. They're nothing alike. You root for Cole because he's lost, and you feel for him because he's going out of his way to not be found. The novel ends on a declarative note, but it's not the note you might think. Paul's entire story is about creating a whole self based on who he is in the moment, and there's something grand in that ... but also something tragic. I'm going to jump into some more Westlake now. Maybe through his famous characters' series. Maybe I'll dig into more Hard Case Crime books. One thing I know for sure: Memory is a terrific novel. If you'll pardon the pun, it's one I won't soon forget. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 28, 2020","Jan 31, 2020","Jan 28, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6632284-memory

There’s a children’s fantasy book? Yes! A novel about a woman who may have killed her husband and her employer, with virtually no supernatural elements? Please! It was the voice I came back for, time after time. It didn’t matter what Stephen King wrote, as long as it was him writing it. People who didn’t think this way baffled me. When I first became extremely online, I would find Stephen King nuts who would say, “Eh, that new one doesn’t look interesting to me. I’ll skip it.” My paroxysms at such insouciance were legendary.As I got into the larger world, though, my viewpoint began changing. Not on King - god, never - but on other authors. I would attempt to approach them as I’d done King, and that would work for awhile ... but a great deal of authors write in a variety of styles and I’m not always interested in them. More, I’m not as into the completionist mindset. If I don’t read every sentence an author wrote, it doesn’t mean I’m not a fan. Even my beloved John Irving wrote a book of essays that were, to my weary brain, interminable.That’s why Lawrence Block has been such a treat. I got in through the Scudder novels, moved into his comic Rhodenbarr thief books, and became a Blockovore with the Keller books. Last year, he came out with two books of collected nonfiction: one about stamp collecting, and this one - a clutch of essays from his long writing life that don’t center around a particular theme.Hunting Buffalo With Bent Nails is, then, a rococo clutch of dispatches from the world and mind of one of America’s best and most entertaining writers. In here, there’s a short essay about traveling the world and a long essay about traveling the USA - in search of towns with Buffalo in the name. Essays on audiobook abridgment, on Raymond Chandler’s connection with one of Block’s occasional passions, coin collecting. And the best essay, a long and incisive pocket history of the life of his mother, at once beautiful and engaging.I loved this collection. I think I’d have loved it even if I wasn’t a Block nut, but there’s something thrilling about finding a writer through their fiction and then diving deeper. It’s like getting a peek behind the curtain. Or, in this case, many peeks. Now I have to finish that stamp collecting one. I don’t care a whit about stamps, and yet I already know I’ll love it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 27, 2020","Feb 09, 2020","Jan 27, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/49239701-hunting-buffalo-with-bent-nails

Gone are the scary/nostalgic days of drugs and booze and endless sex on the road, chasing the high that rock music once gave you, terrified that the ride would end, praying that it never would. It was a fantastic book, and apparently I liked it so much that I wanted to read it again, from a different point of view. That's where Uncommon People came in.Despite its title, the book never mentions Pulp (not even in the tossed-off half-page discussion of Britpop near the end). But it seems to mention everyone else: Elvis, the Beatles, Dylan, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Bowie, Ozzy, Duran Duran, Nirvana, more. By using the gimmick of singling out one day in every year from 1955-1994 - the era of the rock star - Uncommon People manages to differentiate itself from Twilight of the Gods by providing what seems to be a narrative history with interlocking chains. Mostly, though, what it does is remind the reader that those days are gone, and they ain't never coming back. I read a book in my teens on rock deaths, because I was morbid for awhile. It was pretty salacious. Kurt Cobain had just died and it was all anyone could talk about. The rock deaths book seemed to acknowledge his suicide was part of an ongoing thing in rock; not a pattern, per se, but some sort of established rhythm. John Lennon was shot. Skynyrd died in a plane crash. Freddie Mercury died of AIDS. Janis and Jimi found drugs. Without coming out and saying it, the book seemed to be telling me that death was a part of the whole legacy, part of the deal with the devil rock stars made. You lived rough, partied hard, lived your fullest life and made undeniably fantastic music, and you paid for it all by dying young. What this book and Hyden's book do is challenge that concept, try to rewrite the narrative a little. While both books occasionally linger excitedly on the bad stuff, the thrust of these exegeses is that none of what happened was normal. None of it was predestined. None of it had to happen. We accepted it because that was the whole rock star thing. But it's been a long time since Cobain died, and living like a rock star - or dying like one - no longer feels a prerequisite for fame and idolatry. I think that's good, and both of these book also think that's good ... even as we listen to and tell the stories about the rock god lives over and over again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 25, 2020","Jan 27, 2020","Jan 27, 2020",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/36862130-uncommon-people

Plus she’s a writer, which is catnip to me. That was my in with Little Women, and in fact there are some echoes of Little Women in this book. There comes a time when Francie is told to destroy her “bad” writing - her truthful stuff - and go on writing the anodyne rubbish that got her As in school. She goes home and does the opposite. I cheered.The best thing about Francie and her family is that they’re not saints. All of them try their best, but slip up and do bad things or make messes that are hard to get out of. There’s the aunt who doesn’t quite understand that she’s committing bigamy ... or her husband who only kind of understands that his child is actually his, biologically. An alcoholic father who keeps trying not to be. A long-suffering mother who almost - but not quite - makes a fetish out of hardship.It’s a full book that envelops and embraces. It doesn’t beg you to love it, but you love it because it’s all real and true and weird and normal. I certainly didn’t have a childhood at the start of the 20th century, but childhoods are childhoods, and Smith brings them to vivid life here. I wanted to reread the book because of a book I read last year, about the Armed Services Editions books that went overseas to soldiers in WWII. A lot of them praised A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which I initially found odd. Hardened soldiers falling for a book with a young girl protagonist? But as I kept reading, the truth, as always, wins out.

Midway through the first season, we learned Garnet was a fusion of Ruby and Sapphire, borne out of love. Fusion became a weapon against Jasper, when - in her guilt - Lapis decided to drag her to the bottom of the ocean. Steven and Connie become Stevonnie, a way of being closer than friends and still not quite lovers. It's a fascinating process that has all sorts of connotations. Fusion for Beginners and Experts, a young-ages book, defines the indefinable in ways that even young children can understand. Fusion can be seen as a love allegory, or a sex allegory, or just a closeness allegory. The book discusses all of those avenues, explaining that sometimes people use fusion to be bigger, or better, or stronger. In true Steven Universe fashion, though, it also explains that sometimes people don't want to fuse, and that's okay (there's a picture of a very relieved Peridot in boxer shorts accompanying this bit, making the subtext of her asexuality pretty text ... which is kind of mindblowing for a young readers book).Look: I know this is a kids' book.

Ken Jennings' Maphead made me realize that I never took geography in school, and that I literally had no idea about places and the things that shaped them. It had never seemed important to me as a suburban kid who was never going to go anywhere. And now, here I am at 44, a world traveler who goes places but still doesn't know places.

I think it helps you digest this stuff more easily.My friend Marty got me this National Geographic Student World Atlas for Christmas, and I've spent the last few weeks poring over its facts and figures before sleepytime. And man, was it worth it: the maps taught me topography, political borders, weird stuff like how some countries have two capitals - one cultural and one administrative. There was a really neat illustration of where all the manned stations on Antarctica are. I learned a lot about Oceania, which is SORT OF part of Australia, but not really? And that, though politically Hawai'i is part of the US, geographically it's part of Oceania. Who knew?I honestly don't know how much I retained.

When we met, I literally only read Stephen King books. That was all I read for about three years. Slowly, Tracey introduced me to new writers; the one that sticks out the most is Robert B. Parker, he of the Spenser novels. In turn, I eventually introduced her to Dennis Lehane and Harlan Coben, whose later books are no longer in her wheelhouse, but we had a good go of it. For years, we've tried to find new books and new authors for each other to try, always hoping that something will spark. We're rarely successful (a Bowlaway here, a Tana French there), but sometimes it works like gangbusters. It worked this time. Tracey has been trying to get me into Ann Cleeves for at least six months, and for Christmas she gifted me with The Long Call, the first book in the Matthew Venn series. ""He's a gay detective!"" she exclaimed during the holiday party. And I thought, sure, I need a new crime detective and gay could be good. Let's give it a whirl.At first, I was worried that I wasn't latching onto anything. A dead body. A thousand suspects. The abduction of a woman with Down's syndrome. All of it was sort of interesting, but none of it was clicking. And then suddenly, it did. I don't know if it was Detective Venn's inner life that did it, or the fact that we were seeing things from multiple points of view. Maybe it was that no one really had an issue with a gay man in authority (except maybe Matthew himself), and that the rivalry between Jen and Ross - two junior detectives who had to be partners - didn't feel as if it was rooted in misogyny, or, on the other hand, any too-pat buffoonery on Ross's part. Everyone has shades of characterization and deep histories that have led them to this point, and that's the main of it, and that's the main of any mystery or crime novel I fall in love with: the case is great. The people are better.So: this is the first book in this series and currently, there isn't another one. With the case wrapped up well and a lot of personal stuff still up in the air, I'm eager to start a new book. Last year, Tracey gave me another Ann Cleeves book called Raven Black, which I barely attempted because I was distracted or maybe I needed to read Firestarter again or something.

It's not a horror novel by any sense of the imagination, even though Stephen King's name is on the cover. It's only kind of a crime novel, despite the awesome Hard Case Crime logo also on the cover. It's also sort of a romance and sort of a psychic-kid book and sort of a ghost story. Joyland flirts with genres in the same way that the Dark Tower novels do - honestly, like most Stephen King books do. But this one's sweeter than most. That's the word I keep coming back to, and it's and odd word to apply to a Stephen King novel. King has written kind stories before - ""The Reach"" comes to mind immediately - but rarely have those stories been this moving. And here's the thing: it's not profound. It's not revelatory. It's the story of a kid named Devin Jones who got his heart broken by a girl, and who decides to get over it by working at an amusement park. His crazy summer is a coming-of-age tale, and even when the guns come out and the blood starts flowing, there's a gentleness to this story that's hard to describe. It's in the white spaces between the words, I think, the quiet pauses after periods and question marks; it's a story everyone's experienced, even if you haven't.I think Joyland represents an entirely different kind of writing for King, even though the style sort of hearkens back to his early novels. If this book had come out after The Stand and before The Dead Zone, I don't think it would have shocked anyone. It feels like the work of a young man, which seems ironic. The only other King book I feel I can compare this to is Elevation, another gentle story about a sad man who finds he has more to give of himself than he thought. And look: I love horror. Maybe not as much as some might think, given my lifelong love of King, but I do love it. I love gore and unease and fear and loathing. But horror's not why I come to Stephen King. His books make me feel something that nothing else makes me feel (except maybe the work of Bruce Springsteen), this ineffable quality of well-being and righteousness. Jack Torrance can be chasing his son down a corridor with a roque mallet and I still feel that. The good guys don't always win and the bad guys aren't always punished, but these books seem to establish a balance in things. When I close the cover of a Stephen King novel, I know I can pick it up again and always get that feeling. It's not chasing the dragon if the dragon's always there, ready to greet you. What I'm saying here is that Stephen King novels make me happy, and Joyland makes me happier than most of them. This is my fourth time reading it and I'm excited to read it again. I was going to write that I wish all books made me feel this way, but that would take away from what these books make me feel. I just finished Joyland, and I am joyous. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 09, 2020","Jan 10, 2020","Jan 09, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13596166-joyland

The problem I had with the book was my problem not the book’s problem. First off, I didn’t always know the countries that were singled out (although a map of the world in Mercator projection is included at the front of the book. This was helpful, but not as helpful as I wanted it to be.) The biggest issue, of course, was the fact that I couldn’t always match the key up with the map itself. If the colors were too close together, I couldn’t always tell which countries have the highest speed limits, say, or which countries had the most gold. There is one maddening map included about the winners of the Miss World pageant, and they are all shades of pink, and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out which shade was which.A lot of really interesting facts did come from the book, like how to differentiate between England, the UK, and Great Britain.

These warrior women seem opposed by tradition rather than ideology, and that’s part of why, when one spots the other in a battlefield, she is moved to write her a letter to find somewhere in time. The letters are some of the cooler SF touches: they can be written into seeds, plants, a cup of tea, only to be unraveled and read later. The world-building itself is pretty awesome, too - a lot of neat butterfly effect causes set into motion across time, plus the fascinating way we discover Blue is ... well, born? I don’t know if I quite grasp the mechanics of time travel, but I don’t really have to. I grasped the love story, which is far more important.At first, Red and Blue fall in love with each other’s way of thinking. Only gradually do we see how they fall in love with each other. It is a fascinating journey whose title belies the actual point of the book.

I only kind of did.A lot of How to Hide an Empire is harsh, and it should be. The first half of this book tells about the USA's obsession with Manifest Destiny, how our lust to conquer and own got us the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. It also delves deep into the confusing histories of the Philippines and Puerto Rico, and how they were once (or still are) American territories owned by the US. Trigger warning: there's a LOT of war stuff, and a lot of it isn't the ""draped in glory"" war stuff. It's dark. We were a conquering people - of both the natives in this country, and throughout the Pacific and beyond. This book sheds a light on a lot of history I didn't know about, especially on the start of WWII, in which the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor ... and then went on to keep bombing US territories, fully overtaking Guam and more. What? This HAPPENED?!The second part of the book is less thrilling but just as fascinating, because a lot of it focuses on what's happening now. Are we an empire still? Kind of. Just in a much quieter way. We might not be going out and claiming islands as our own anymore ... but we have all these military bases all over the world, collectively stringing our superpower together globally. Immerwahr also sheds a lot of light on how 9/11 came to be, and how it's connected to our power grabs and our belief that we are generally right about everything. It's not a book that's down on the US. It's a book that makes you think about the US in ways you may not have before.

Not trouble, necessarily, but roadblocks in language and style that couldn’t be helped. A friend of mine once told me that translated literature from the past was always easier than books written in English, because the translations are updated for modern readers, but the books in English always stay the same. How glad I am to be wrong!I picked up Little Women for the first time in my life because the new Grega Gerwig film is almost out and I’m eager to see it. I thought I was going to have a real issue with the language - a barrier between me and these beloved characters - as the book was written in the 1860s and that seems so impossibly ancient to me now. But far from creating a problem for me, the language and the writing WELCOMED me. Not once did I struggle with a sentence or get mired in a paragraph. This clarity and accessibility of writing helped me to like that characters at once - not JUST like, but get into their lives as if they were the lives of real people.I went on social media and chastised Meg for going to a fancy party she wasn’t prepared for. I bitched out Amy for burning one of Jo’s manuscripts. I was so disappointed in Jo for being such - curmudgeon around Aunt March that she never got to go to France. And Beth ... well, I was afraid Beth was going to be all too saintly to take seriously. I knew she died and I was afraid the melodrama would be too much to bear. But she wanted a piano. And the fact that she wanted something made her a lot more human. The fact that her actual death takes place off-page is another smart turn: we don’t need to watch her die to feel the sadness of it.And there’s so much more! Jo’s struggles to be the writer she can be, not just the one she thinks she should be. Meg’s transformation into kind of a boring mother and Amy’s change from spoiled and conceited brat to someone you really like and admire. The love stories all make sense, the quiet ambitions that change and mutate, the depth to which Alcott plunges with each of these people to make them real and contradictory and compelling: all these elements make this one of the best books I’ve read this year.

I bought it when I was in full Jennings fever after the whole hat trick of his Jeopardy! appearance, his memoir, and his book of trivia. I was eager for more Ken Jennings, whose name - like some other authors like Ruth Reichl - need not include a surname in my house. I said Ken, and my husband understood who I was talking about. He was a celebrity to us.Then ... I don’t know if my interest in Ken waned, or if this new book - about geography, rather than trivia or Ken himself - was simply less interesting to me. I’ve never been big on the subject; as Ken so astutely puts it in the book, it stopped being taught as a discrete subject in schools before I was born. Maybe I never really had a chance to get into maps the way I got into novels and trivia and video games. The most involved my life ever got was when a huge wall map and its metal hanging structure fell on my algebra teacher’s head and we had a substitute for three weeks.But I do love my accessible, poppy books on subjects I’m not familiar with, so when I was casting around for something to get me out of the sad novels about dead girls rut I seemed to be in, I hit on Maphead.The book worked in exactly the way I wanted it to. Thesis statement about why maps are important and why they’re important to Ken. The broad history of maps and geography, mostly American-centric but taking the context of the world into much consideration. Eventually we move into the futuristic now: chapters on GPS and geocaching and there’s a complicated math/geography chapter I didn’t quite understand. A really neat discussion of Google Earth. Thoughts about whether the future of maps will eliminate paper altogether. Closing, cautiously optimistic statement about the next generation of mapheads. And fin.But that’s just the structure. It’s the structure pop writers take when writing books about difficult subjects for a mass audience. And I like the structure. It’s comforting, and only a little samey. What matters is how it’s tackled. Who’s writing it. How much of themselves they put into it. I read a history of salt earlier this year that was popular and I found it dull. Ken Jennings isn’t dull.What comes across most in Maphead is how very, very much Ken likes maps and geography. And because he’s passionate about the subject - at times, you kind of think the book should be called Mapstan - YOU become passionate about it. I’m suddenly fascinated with geocaching, and also with fixing my geography blind spots and finally knowing all the state capitals, and not just the big ones like Boston or Orlando or Los Angeles. If you have an interest in subjects you should have learned in school - or learned better - and want an in, this is that sort of book for you. Or if you just like nerds being nerds, and perhaps are a nerd. You might come away with a sudden craving for a National Geographic atlas.

It's one of the sanest momentAt one point in this book, a duchess rides a horse into a safe house where men are playing strip baccarat, or something. It's one of the sanest moments of the book. But let's back up. Belinda Blinked is the atrociously-written, biologically-suspect, family-shaming book of erotica written by the pseudonymous Rocky Flintstone (which: delightful). Flintstone gave the manuscripts of the first few books to his son Jamie, who was horrified. So he did what any sane child of a budding porn novelist would do: started a podcast with his two best friends - James and Alice - to read the book and react accordingly. In the first book alone, one man fucks a woman and enters her cervix, breasts hang like pomegranates, and an older woman's nipples are described as looking like the ""three-inch bolts that were used on the fateful Titanic."" What IS this thing? WHY is this thing?My buddy Joe introduced me to the podcast, My Dad Wrote a Porno, a few years ago on a road trip from Athens, GA to Orlando, FL. I got hooked immediately. Jamie reads the books; his friends Alice and James react. Sometimes Jamie reacts, because the sheer weight of the fact that it's his Dad who took time out of his life to pen this lunacy. Plus, the fact that they're all British - and that Jamie has taken to doing accents for the most colorful characters - just makes the whole thing kind of charming. I mean it's crass and it's baffling, but it's not MEAN. Book 5 took a weird turn away from the world of cookware, where our hero Belinda Blumenthal is some sort of executive, and became a spy novel. It makes no sense. There are long chapters involving trading sex for a cookware spot on Australian television. Someone fucks a book, maybe. There's a horse named Toffee Apple Chew. It's all ridiculous. I can't recommend it enough. Why four stars instead of 5. Well, I'm pondering that myself. Like, how does Belinda Blinked 5 stack up against Where the Crawdads Sing, or Little Fires Everywhere? Who can say? Is it as good a novel as The Shining, which I re-read this year? Your mileage may vary. I may have TRIED to give it five stars, but the small critic inside me who read Mildred Pierce and The Dutch House and The Goldfinch this year threatened to cut my hand off, so I guess we're stuck with 4.

Cain, one of the big-name hard-boiled writers for whom the term noir fiction was named. And I think it'sI keep thinking that I've never read James M. Cain, one of the big-name hard-boiled writers for whom the term noir fiction was named. And I think it's because I haven't dabbled nearly enough in this genre, the prehistory of the detective novels I love now. To know James M. Cain is to understand Robert B. Parker and Lawrence Block and Dennis Lehane. Modern noir, maybe. I think this because I've long carried a worry that I'm not nearly well-read enough; not in the canon, not in genre classics, not in the stuff I ought to have read in school but never did. But of course I have read Cain (and Westlake, and Jim Thompson; my inferiority complex when it comes to reading conveniently ignores the facts). The Postman Always Rings Twice was as raunchy and thrilling as the film version with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, and The Cocktail Waitress, a lost novel finally published by Hard Case Crime a few years back, was far more gripping than I thought it would be, hinging on, of all things, thalidomide. Could I read more in this genre I clearly love? Sure. But to keep pretending I'm ignorant of it is silly. So let's move past silly. I saw the film version of Mildred Pierce over a decade ago for Gay Movie Night. I'd heard it was some sort of camp classic, but I didn't really see it that way. It surprised me in its depth and its gothic affectations, and stunned me with its characterization of Veda, one of the more loathsome characters ever on screen. It didn't occur to me then to follow up with the book, but when I was in a huge used bookstore in Los Angeles this year, and given my predilection for buying books about the places I'm visiting, I couldn't resist. If I thought the movie was shocking, man, this novel. It's a tragedy, in its own way, and it almost doesn't have to be. The most exciting aspect of the book is watching Mildred recover from the aftereffects of a shaky marriage to build a small empire for herself. The dogged way she goes about it, the way she forces herself to use the talents she has and acquire new ones to not only survive, but thrive. Cain's insistence on giving us a lot of the nitty-gritty of this reminds me of Arthur Hailey's aphorism that people like reading about other people's work. If it's not their line, it's fascinating; if it is, it's comforting. The big albatross around Mildred's neck is her daughter, Veda, who she loves with an almost unreasonable grandness. It's fascinating to watch the dynamic, because as Mildred is building herself and her reputation up, incrementally making something impressive of herself in the midst of the Great Depression, Veda keeps trying to tear her down. When Mildred takes a job as a waitress, hating herself for it but knowing she has to support her children, Veda basically tells her she's a no-class hobo she's embarrassed of. Veda's not the last person who will use Mildred for her money while degrading her for making it, but she's the most insistent. She's also darkly brilliant, able to think around corners Mildred can't, because Mildred is essentially a good person who made the mistake of loving the wrong person too much. Veda reminds me of Cathy in Steinbeck's East of Eden, an irredeemable human without a sense of morality that the better people in her life can't help but masochistically love. One of the most interesting aspects of Mildred Pierce is that I had long thought of Cain as one of these tough-guy writers: guys are guys and dames are dames, etc. But this book is a novel about a strong, independent woman who doesn't have to ""act like a man"" in order to be taken seriously by men. It's surprisingly feminist, even as its most horrible character is also a woman, the manipulative and borderline evil yin to Mildred's goodhearted and ambitious yang. It's such a good book, and I'm so happy it actually completes my 2019 reading challenge - 60 books in a year. Everything after this is gravy, so I couldn't be happier that I got this juicy hunk of meat to finish off the main course. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 28, 2019","Dec 02, 2019","Dec 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12876676-mildred-pierce

For someone who claims to be a fan of detective novels, especially the noirish ones with a lot of brutality and a sliding scale of morality, I recognize this is a failing.Stark is the pseudonym of Donald Westlake, an author I HAVE read. He wrote two fantastic books about the publishing industry - The Ax and The Hook - neither of which are available on audio, which in itself is a crime. Westlake is known more for somewhat lighthearted mystery and crime fare; his famous quote is that when it was sunny out, he wrote as Westlake. He wrote as Stark when it rained.Darwyn Cooke is the person responsible for the DC Comics New Frontier graphic novel, one of my favorite DC title ever. He’s a whiz at mid century grit and wonder, and the cover of his adaptation of Parker’s Slayground hooked me at once. It’s like a Googie explosion. The art inside just keeps getting cooler, marrying the murder noir and the atomic age sensibility so well that I was legitimately giddy reading it. The book focuses on a heist gone bad and Parker - our brutal thief - hiding out in a Disneyland-like park until he can get away. That’s it. That’s the whole story. But what a story!

Maybe I never was, but books like Hatchet make me think I might have been.Is the ending abrupt? Maybe. But maybe it has to be because after so much hard endurance, Brian’s story is about to fundamentally change. Gary Paulson, the writer, might not want to have followed that change. I’m glad he didn’t.

I’m giving it four stars because apparently Goodreads doesn’t allow 3.5, which is more accurate. I’ll explain.Simon Winchester’s Krakatoa is about the 1883 volcanic explosion that decimated cities, killed thousands, and made an island disappear. Winchester comes at this central point the way I like my pop nonfiction to do so: from all angles. He sets us firmly in the time and place (in this case, an East Indies island under Dutch colonial rule) so that we’re seeing through his eyes. Then he dives deeper.How volcanoes work. What plate tectonics are. How Krakatoa came to be under Dutch rule. Winchester delves into science, history, even philosophy. It’s all great, if sometimes dry, like Bill Bryson decided to collaborate with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Hashtag Tryson.But the back half of the book drags just a little too much for me to give full endorsement of Krakatoa. It’s a shame, too, because the fallout (literal and figurative) is pretty fascinating. But Winchester frontloaded the book with so much interesting stuff about the aftermath - how sunsets changed, how art and writing were impacted, how the explosion was the first major event the whole world knew about at roughly the same time - that he has only a few avenues to turn to after the eruption itself. What he focuses on are the political and religious aftercurrents of Krakatoa, and how the people of the East Indies ended up revolting against Dutch rule. It sounds great. It reads a little dull.Winchester saves himself a little near the end, talking about the new, volatile islands that have cropped up and erupted in irregular intervals over the grave of Krakatoa. How new life comes to new places. It’s fantastic stuff. The epilogue, in which Winchester visits this new island and is terrorized, kind of, by a prehistoric beast from the jungle, is excellent.

He had read her first book, this one, and he couldn't stop talking about it. We were in an independent San Francisco bookshop when I first picked up the novel and read that gutpunch of a first sentence, which I won't repeat here because it's so good in context. I hoped the rest of the book would live up to that promise. A few months later, I can say with confidence it has. One great book is a great book. Two great books is a great writer.The story follows the Lee family at the tail end of the 1970s. James, who is Chinese-American, and Marilyn - who is not - marry in an era when such mixed marriages are still illegal in some states. Marriage gains them so much but it costs them, too. The individual shames of their upbringing - James to be a traditional Chinese boy, Marilyn to be a traditional American girl - propel them to become their own people. Then they have their own kids, and without realizing they're doing it, behave the exact same way.We open on the death of their middle child, Lydia, and she becomes the center of the book, both metaphorically and literally. Through extensive flashbacks, we understand Lydia's life better than either parent, or her brother, or even her clever little sister, so used to being unnoticed that she knows more secrets than anyone. Eventually, as the book winds to its close, we know why and how Lydia died. Her family never quite gets that luxury, and it's mostly that tension that propels this novel.I loved this book.

In World War II, American soldiers not only faced the horrors of war in the European and Pacific Theaters, but also the very real enemies of homesickness, boredom, anxiety, and depression. To help combat these latter ills, the US military worked with a number of American publishers to create the ASE, the Armed Services Editions: books small enough to fit in a back pocket that GIs could take anywhere. To say they were a hit would be understating things. To say they helped win the war would not be overstating.I came into When Books Went To War expecting something different. I thought Manning was going to delve deep into how WWII established certain books - like Smith’s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, or Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby - as new entries into the American canon. Manning gets there, but this book is a far deeper and more nuanced work. We start at Kristallnacht, at which dozens of German students burn hundreds of books - anything that disproves or argues against the notion of Aryan superiority. Beginning here underscores Manning’s intent in explaining why we went to war, and why these small paperbacks were such an important weapon against Hitler’s policing of free thought and free speech.Of course, because America is full of ironies, we also get to learn a bit about the censorship threats that befell the ASE program, and some interesting stuff about Republican vote tampering decades ahead of its time. And because this is World War II, Manning can’t quite skirt the blatant horrors of war, nor the deep American malaise following its aftermath. At all measures, however, Manning presents a compelling and truly enlightening slice of American history, something I knew nothing about but am so glad I now do. And Manning does not truck with dry history. Her incisive and accessible prose, her ability to move from the personal to the global, and her obvious love of the concept and practice of reading make this a thoroughly entertaining read, as well.

Or maybe they were Narwhals.I remember once, back in the mid aughts, I happened to read Breakfast at Tiffany's and Breakfast of Champions back to back. Entirely coincidentally. This year, I've finished three ""how"" books in a row. That has no bearing on this book, but I do think it's kind of funny to consider How to Hide an Empire, This is How You Lose the Time War, and How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming as a sort of loose trilogy about geography and astronomy and time travel. Anyway, the whole idea of Pluto - which I'd learned about as a planet since my first days of school - no longer being a planet has always fascinated me. My husband remains furious. I take a more measured approach. Why did it happen? How did it happen? And what's a dwarf planet?I was worried that the approach would be a little dry, despite the kicky, adversarial title. But Mike Brown has a way with putting the science of the Solar System in everyone's grasp. Late in the game, there's a reluctantly-given physics lesson, but even I understood that. Did you know I failed science once in school? It was chemistry, but mostly I failed because I couldn't wrap my mind around the precision of it, the math and specificity. There's a ton of math involved in astronomy (I saw Hidden Figures!) but Brown seems to know that the general public wants fun, not fusty. He delivers on that fun. The joy of discovery as Brown and his team discover orbital objects in the sky - are they planets? planetoids? asteroids? - not once but several times never stops being thrilling. I also love that they give them fun temporary names like Easter Bunny and Xena; they might be nerds, but they're cool nerds. We get astronomical history: how the planets were discovered, and by whom, and how the designation of Pluto as a planet was always a little controversial. I love the history stuff interwoven through the narrative - it's like a Bill Bryson book with a current timeline throughline. By the time we got to the whole controversy, and the legislative body of astronomers deciding what Pluto's (and Xena's, and others) designation was going to be, I was hesitant. I had loved Brown's whole story up to this point (including and especially the stuff about him becoming a husband and father during the whole planet discovery stuff), so I worried that this part would drag on and become less personal. I was wrong about that. Brown manages to keep his story about his team and his discovery, and even inject a whole level of intrigue I wasn't expecting. There are a lot of people, like my husband, who wanted Pluto to stay a planet just because it had always been one. There's a cultural connection, an emotional bond to this thing far, far off in the cold vastness of space. Quite a few people wanted science to let Pluto stay a planet of our solar system, simply because they loved Pluto. But that's not how science works.

The Dutch House is the story of a brother and sister, Danny and Maeve, and the house they grew up in. The Dutch House remains the center of their lives, both physically and metaphorically, even when they no longer live there, and even when the house isn’t technically theirs. It’s also the story of parents: Danny and Maeve’s father, their mother, and their stepmother ... and Maeve herself as she becomes Danny’s caretaker.

When I travel, I always look for local fiction that will get me more involved in the place around me. I wasn’t finding what I was looking for in SF, but this book, with its hint of a YA love story involving crosswords, spoke to me from out of a dump-bin. I scanned the first page and saw it was set in Washington, DC. All the way back on the coast of just left.But I bought it anyway and let it simmer for awhile before I finally picked it up. I’m glad I did. As it turned out, it wasn’t a love story really, and it wasn’t super about crosswords either. It was about people growing up, and doing only an ok job of it. I think this might have been my first New Adult novel, a category that didn’t exist when I was a new adult - somewhere in the nebulous region between YA and adult fiction. Basically, everyone’s still pretty young and figuring stuff out, but you can say fuck and describe a breast.

The author actually lampshades the trope, which can sometimes be an excuse to double down on the whole thing, but author Ahmadi is smarter than that.I liked the messiness if the story; coincidences happen, but they don’t define the book. And I liked how Ahmadi avoids pat, easy endings.

I glanced at the back copy flap - two girls, Laurel and Daphne, and their deep sisterly bond which breaks over word usage, something like that - and I knew I had to read it. I am so glad I did.I'm a sucker for books about full lives, and Daphne's and Laurel's lives are packed. We see them as babies first, their parents unsure of what to make of their baby-talk conversation that the girls instinctually understand. This is only the beginning of their lifelong obsessions with words, culminating in the arrival of a massive, totemic dictionary that becomes almost a third sister. Laurel and Daphne are easy people to like, even when they're prickly and even when they work against their better natures. Maybe because of that, because the reader can see where they might be stepping wrong ... and then discover, occasionally, that they stepped right, after all. It is in these small twists that the book works the best, watching as things that shouldn't work out absolutely work out, and sometimes vice versa.Plus, the whole book is populated with fascinating supporting characters, especially Daphne and Laurel's eventual husbands, Larry and Michael, and in their cousin Brian, who we watch grow up on the periphery of the twins' lives. Everyone is interesting, with multifaceted lives that honestly feel lived-in. I especially liked the flash-forward ending, which could be cliche but doesn't really feel like it. The somewhat harmonious coupling of various tertiary characters could seem pat, but instead feels like an outgrowth of the deep-rooted bond of The Grammarians' two main characters. Their lives aren't always easy, but The Grammarians is - thrillingly so. I read it in massive gulps, only wanting to know more, to uncover more, as the words spooled out and revealed themselves.

The Great American Novel actually kind of was ... though so are Stephen King’s It, Steinbeck’s East of Eden, John Irving’s The World According to Garp, and dozens of others. The thing that set Moby-Dick apart was that it was a classic, part of the canon of Great Works ... and it had been difficult to read. Sometimes crazy difficult, like those thousand or so pages explaining why whales are fish. I finished it, and part of the reason I think I’m so enraptured with it is the fact that it WAS difficult. I don’t know if I quite understood all of it, even though certain passages really moved me. Melville was adamant that his white whale not be thought of as a metaphor, but of course it’s become one of THE metaphors. For me, the book about the white whale was MY white whale. So after I read it, I read books about it. I read a book about The Essex, the whaling ship The Pequod was based on. I even watched the movie In the Heart of the Sea. I got very involved.I bring this up now because of something Andy Miller says near the beginning of The Year of Reading Dangerously: shouldn’t some books, he asks, BE difficult? Shouldn’t they challenge you, throw up roadblocks you have to barrel through in order to get to the magic of the book. Miller argues yes. I’m still on the fence.That accomplishment I felt finishing Moby-Dick of course was due to the fact that I did have to fight my way through part of it. Miller actually includes Melville’s book on his List of Betterment, his chronological book mountain that also includes The Master and Margarita, Anna Kerenina, War and Peace, and more. While careful to avoid sounding snobbish (though he can’t help himself occasionally), Miller determines that reading books the old-fashioned way - on paper, with eyes and hands - is the best way to do things. And that if you train yourself away from the screen distractions like Twitter and Facebook and blogs about cheese or whatever, you can become the type of reader you probably tell people you already are.And it’s good. A lot of this is good. I do most of my book “reading” via audio, though I’ve read a clutch of physical books this year and at least one ebook. But I remember loving physical books, and sometimes I wish there was more time in my life to simply sit and dedicate myself to the pursuit. Miller also has a hugely busy life and he has done it, which of course makes me think I can, if I only apply myself. More, I’m suddenly interested in reading War and Peace, which might be my next white whale. Sorry, Herman.The Year of Reading Dangerously is, in measure, a pretty entertaining book about a man who got into a bunch of classic novels that engaged him and transformed him. Maybe that journey will happen for you. Maybe it’ll happen for me! But I’m still not sure I necessarily need to read, say, Bleak House to make my bones in the world of reading literature. It might help, but maybe it’s not necessary. And I wonder what it says that when I went looking for War and Peace tonight, I went looking for it on Audible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 29, 2019","Nov 03, 2019","Nov 02, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20910034-the-year-of-reading-dangerously

I’ve been a huge Stephen King fan all my life so I didn’t think books could scare me. This one scared me so much I threw it across the room. Only two other books have scared me that badly: Jack Ketchum’s The Girl Next Door and William Goldman’s Marathon Man.I digress. I was a little afraid to reread this, because I knew I wouldn’t have the same perspective or feeling I did when I was 21. But it holds up pretty darn well. Bradbury’s occasionally flowery prose often works against him in short stories, but I generally like it in his novels. He just FEELS so HARD. And he wants you to feel just as hard.You know, I’d forgotten most of the stuff about growing up and growing old in this book, which is odd since it’s the entire backbone of the story. I just remembered Mr. Dark and being afraid. This time around, the themes of aging out of childhood and accepting adulthood were far more trenchant and vital. It’s not a horror story, but a story of childhood and adulthood where the real horror is being ashamed of the age you’re in. It could seem a little hokey. The fact that optimism and laughter is the best weapon against the dark seems a little trite on the surface. But Bradbury sells it, just like he sells every other aspect of this book. Stuff that absolutely shouldn’t work - a midnight fight with a balloon, for instance - works very well. Everything is so well intentioned, and so well meant, that sometimes it almost feels like a put-on. But Bradbury, for all his haunts and spooks and scares, is simply a nice person who populates his books with nice people who deserve nice things. Well, at least here. Fahrenheit 451 is a lot darker.

I was understandably hesitant.But while Odd Adventures has elements of horror, at its heart it’s a love story. Two men against the world, facing horrors that can occasionally be read as metaphors but that work equally well as fiction. The fact that these men are gay isn’t incidental and isn’t one of those “just happens to be gay” type stories. This basic fact of their identity follows them and haunts them across their trip through America, finding them in small towns and big cities that always seem to be testing their resolve. (Other stories are hinted at, and my only real complaint here is that I wanted to read those other stories, too.)But theirs is an uncommonly strong bond, one that trips irrevocably into the supernatural, and is made even stronger for it. That bond continues beyond even death, leaving us with a brilliant, satisfying ending I could never have predicted. Scary, sweet, and ultimately wonderful.

It's a good puzzled, to be sure, but because I want to discuss this in depth, I'm hiding the  due to pretty massive spoilers. The book is magnificently written, and our narrator, Merricat Blackwood, is just barely this side of unreliable. She, her sister Constance, her disabled Uncle Julian, and her cat Jonas all live in the stately Blackwood house, which used to be more populous until the rest of the family was poisoned to death at dinner one night. We get this information slowly, the book sneaking up on it as the tension ratchets tighter and tighter. Constance, who had made dinner the night most of her family died, was tried and acquitted of the murders. There was arsenic in the sugar, you see; Catherine doesn't eat sugar, Merricat was sent to bed without dinner that night, and Uncle Julian had only taken a very little bit - leaving him paralyzed but alive. It's at this point that we begin suspecting our childlike narrator, Merricat, was actually the murderer ... but there are roadblocks in our way. There's the boorish intrusion of a cousin, Charles, who comes into the house and tries to take over. We kind of hope he gets poisoned, too. Three quarters of the way through, Uncle Julius drops the bomb that Merricat isn't actually alive - that she'd died in the orphanage of neglect while Constance was on trial. This doesn't seem to actually be the case - it goes against the book's internal logic - but it throws off any sense of surety of who these characters are and what, exactly, is happening in that house. Late in the book, the house is nearly destroyed in a fire, devastating Catherine but seeming to free Merricat. It's only here that we get confirmation that yes, young Merricat was the one who killed the rest of the family. By this point, the revelation isn't shocking ... but knowing the truth forces the reader to consider Merricat's narration and state of mind. I don't know if we ever get a sense of how old she is, but she consistently has a childlike concept of the world. Some people are mean and should die. Some people are nice and shouldn't. The way she'd murdered is clumsy and obvious, the way a child would do it. Merricat isn't cruel and she isn't precisely evil; her understanding of right and wrong is simply too skewed to make rational sense. This comes across most strikingly in the things she ""isn't allowed"" to do. She doesn't much mind that she'd murdered her whole family ... but she isn't allowed in Uncle Julius' room, so she never goes in there. Speaking of Uncle Julius, Merricat is constantly reminding herself to be nicer to him. Only after we get concrete proof that she tried to murder him and failed do these repetitions become more starkly horrifying. We end on a real downbeat note that pretends to be, in Merricat's view, the happiest moment ever. Catherine, who was deliberately spared from poisoning, is now locked in a crumbling house with a - psychopath? is that right? - and seems to think that much of it is her fault. We have to wonder at the mundanity of evil, and how it's allowed to perpetuate. While the horror at the heart of We Have Always Lived in the Castle may not be supernatural, we still end the book with virtual ghosts; we are forced to wonder if the true horror comes not from the actions of a person with a sick mind, or from those that enable that mind, and allow it to prosper....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 07, 2019","Oct 09, 2019","Oct 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26852229-we-have-always-lived-in-the-castle

I couldn’t quite get into At Home, but I think I might want to retry that one, because I loved this book.

It is so much more interesting than those pithy articles from the Internet.We get to almost all of it: birth and death, sight and taste, emotion and sex.

And indeed it compels, giving us history of communicable diseases, the dividing line between when a zygote becomes a baby, and how, exactly, my color blind eyes work.There should be a tendency to get grim. There are so many statistics, so many I don’t knows, that it might be simpler for Bryson to simply shrug and say science doesn’t know much. But one of Bryson’s strengths is that he loves to follow footnotes to sources. The Body is thorough; but that doesn’t mean it’s dry. I listened to the audiobook read by Bryson himself. I love his orating voice, and the way he emphasizes certain words in his half-British/half-American accent. He is very good at what he does here, in both delivery and content. If you really like Brysons earlier work, I highly recommend trying this one out.

This isn’t a humblebrag or starfuckery or a way to inflate my own stature in the world because I happen to know an Emmy-winning comedian/writer.I say it because most of this book exudes niceness, a quality too many of us conflate with being wishy-washy or bland. I told a friend of mine he was nice once and he took it as an insult. I don’t think Josh would take it as an insult. He actually addresses his niceness right up front, setting the stage for a whirlwind collection of personal essays that are at once exciting, fun, touching, and kind. He talks about why being nice is both important and sometimes a liability. Why “Nice Guy” can actually be code for a bro dude doing the bare minimum of performative good. And how balancing nice without losing yourself is difficult and worthwhile.I read a lot of books of essays by funny people, and some of them are acerbic and some are cutting, and there’s definitely a place for those. I like those qualities in other books. I’m just glad they aren’t part of this book.The essays are all compelling: he talks about the three origin stories of his relationship with his wife, and who gets to know which version. There’s one on the mysterious past of their adopted dog, Bizzy. Or the time he may or may not have tried MDMA. Gondelman, unlike one of my favorite essayists, Chuck Klosterman, made me care about sports in a moving, elegiacal tribute to his grandmother. And, unlike most every other book of essays by New Yorkers I’ve read in the past few years, there isn’t one on 9/11, which might be a bit of a relief.I listened to the audiobook version of this collection; Josh himself reads it, and it’s comforting to hear it all in his voice and inflection. It reminds me of his standup and storytelling from when he was laying his comedic foundations in the Boston comedy scene. One of the best things about the book is that you come away happy, because whether Josh is making you think or cry or laugh, it’s a joy to get insight into his life and his way of thinking.

Maybe that's true all the way through, but especially on book 4, when you go beyond the boundaries of a trilogy and start settling in for the long haul. It's a good thing Jacqueline Winspear gave us a clutch of memorable characters right from the start. Maisie Dobbs - and to a slightly greater extent, her assistant Billy Beale - come to emotional crossroads in Messenger of Truth, and all their decisions make sense, given what we already know of them.The interesting thing is, the plot of Messenger of Truth actually does impact, and hard. We're still dealing with shockwaves from World War I, and the horrors of that war keep revealing themselves to Maisie and the assembled crew. The whodunit aspect is interesting and the denoument is satisfying, but nowhere near as interesting or as morbidly exciting as the ""what"" of the thing - the missing art at the center of the book, and what its subject is, and what it means.One of the best aspects of the Maisie Dobbs series is how it captures a very specific time and place - England in the years after The Great War - a time and place I rarely thought of before now. WWII is the one that fascinates people, because of the obvious good vs evil conflict and the very real horrors of human suffering. But there was plenty of suffering in the first World War, and plenty of horror, and to find that here in the midst of a story about art theft and family politics should be jarring. But it's not, because the horror of war touches every part of this series, yet somehow manages to not drown in it. As always, I'm going to wait awhile before diving into the next book - not because I'm not interested, but because I want a little time to think about Maisie and Billy and the stuff they're dealing with, as we wend our way closer and closer to the madness of the next war, and how they'll react to that....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 18, 2019","Sep 20, 2019","Sep 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7433.Messenger_of_Truth

My Dad took me and my brother to see Pet Sematary, and my brother freaked out and Dad took him to see another movie instead, leaving me there with Church and Jud and the Creeds. I was awestruck. Later that summer, Dad bought me the paperback. Since then, I’ve read every novel, every short story. Most books about him. Hell, I’ve written a bunch of books about him. So it’s an emotional connection. That said, I can be critical of the man. I re-read The Tommyknockers for the fifth time this year and it’s a solid three out of five star novel. It should have been edited better, but there’s such a solid tale underneath. So I can be critical. Then again, I have read The Tommyknockers five times.I said all that so I could say this: The Institute is the best book I’ve read so far this year.The plot is pretty simple: a brilliant kid named Luke is snatched from his home and brought to a facility in the middle of the night. There, he discovers he’s caged in with a bunch of other kids, all with one commonality: mild psychic abilities. Luke has TK - a very quiet form of Carrie White’s telekinetic power. Others are TP, kids with a smidge of telepathy. What the doctors of The Institute are using these kids for is a pretty damn good secret that we come to in due course. HOW they’re using these kids is another story. In short, they’re torturing them.There are obvious political parallels to draw here: these are kids in cages, after all, and those in authority have no compunction about whether they live or die. They’re not quite human to them. Of course, the kids use this to their advantage; if you’re beneath contempt, you’re beneath scrutiny. And sometimes that’s how revolutions start.I haven’t even talked about the novel’s parallel storyline, involving an ex-cop named Tim who winds up drifting into a small South Carolina town and becoming the town’s “night knocker,” an evocative term for an overnight beat cop. Tim’s a great Stu Redman/Dale Barbara character: a good guy with a rough past who’s trying to do well in his new circumstances. Eventually Luke and Tim’s paths cross, and wheels, King reminds us, turn inside wheels.Quite a few of Stephen King’s novels end almost happy, with the price our heroes have to pay too much and too hard for true optimism.

I love books of personal essays - give me Klosterman, give me Irby, give me Sheffield (seriously, more Sheffield, all the time). The book was funny, sardonic, a little cutting and a lot compelling. At once, I began looking at her other books. Everyone - literally everyone who recognized Crosley's name - told me I had to read I Was Told There'd Be Cake. HAD to. It was a moral imperative. How dare I NOT have read it; me, a supposed reader! Further, how dare I read a DIFFERENT book by Crosley before picking up her seminal masterpiece? This is like owning Human Touch before buying Born to Run (GUILTY!)So I finally read it, and I really liked it. But I'm very fearful that I fell for the hype machine here. In my opinion, Crosley's become a better writer. I Was Told There'd Be Cake was quite good, and I was especially drawn to the final essay, in which she talks about the possibility of having a rare-ish blood disease. (Without spoilers, I will say that a very similar thing happened to me, with regards to a potential heart attack.) I also loved her take on being the maid of honor for a bride she didn't know very well anymore; it takes on the whole ""Bridezilla"" thing from a fresh perspective, looking at friendships between women and how they morph and change. I had to skip much of the essay on Crosley working in a butterfly exhibit in a museum; my overwhelming motteophobia actually forced me to pull over to the side of the road and, shuddering with revulsion, skip to the next chapter.Liking it wasn't the problem. It's that I'm comparing it to her later work, which I came into first, and which I liked more. While the essays in this one are very well-written and smart and funny, they feel like they were written at a bit of a remove; stories relayed from a close observer, rather than an active participant. There's nothing at all wrong with writing that way; I just missed the more intense internal focus of her later book.Of course, she has a second book of essays, How Did You Get This Number, that I want to now read immediately, bridging the gap between the old and new (plus a novel! It's called The Clasp! I'll read a novel!) If you've never read Crosley, I'd recommend starting here and then branching out. I'm worried this  sounds negative, and it absolutely shouldn't.

Is it art, or is it just popular?The book itself makes the same argument, in part about the titular painting at its center. Tartt, through her troubled main character Theo Decker, asks a lot of intense, deep questions and doesn't really try to answer them. Does art matter? Does life matter? If everything is awful, what's the point of living? If everything is wonderful, what's the point of dying? Theo, and The Goldfinch, live uncomfortably with contradictions; everything is painful, but everything is beautiful, too.This is a book that absolutely should not compel. Theo is almost entirely unlikable, but it's not really his fault. Three of the most important catalysts of his life happen in the same violent instant: his mother dies, he is forged together with a girl named Pippa who will be his great absent love ... and he acquires the painting against which his entire life will be compared and contrasted. Like his mother and Pippa (the only two people he loves without complication) the painting is both itself and a symbol of the person Theo might be if he wasn't so busy being his own mostly ragged self.We follow Theo through his life. There are moments when it seems as if he will be drawn out of his terrible circumstances and move into something better, only to watch the rug be snatched out from under him. Only later do we sense that the awful things happen so that even more awful things do not; life, it appears, has a sense of humor, and Theo is often the butt of the joke. It's not that he plays Job, because when he's finally old enough to choose his own path, he chooses badly. It's that despite being a full-on fuckup for most of his existence, we still like Theo and want him to succeed, to do better, to be better. And maybe that happens. And even if it doesn't, it's one hell of a journey.The Goldfinch won the Pulitzer Prize, and the controversy seems to stem from the fact that it is a readable page-turner with pop-culture touchstones like Harry Potter and Lady Gaga. Real literature should be timeless, the naysayers seem to argue. But the best art, as Tartt and The Goldfinch argue, reaches up through time no matter when it's created, and dazzles us if we are receptive to being dazzled. The Goldfinch is a dazzling book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 22, 2019","Aug 31, 2019","Aug 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

And I got that. And then it got way deeper than I expected.The book starts fun and breezy, talking about how Tiki culture emerged in California following WW2, when returning G.I.s were keen to bring back a slice of Polynesia with them. There’s talk of Thor Heyerdahl’s Kon-Tiki and James Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific. Standard touchstones.And then the book takes a bit of a deeper look into the world the returning G.I. was thrust into following the Second World War. The life of the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, expected to return from the horrors of war and come home to an upwardly-mobile family and business life. We tend to think of PTSD as something more modern, but an entire generation felt it after the war, and had no means of coping with it. The institutions just weren’t there. So they invented escape in the concepts of half-remembered “exotic” refuges they found in the Pacific theater. This is tiki culture, along with tropical drinks and rattan, and it’s part of why I want to read more deeply on the subject. The authors bring up the specter of cultural appropriation - of the fact that tiki in America is mainly the invention of cis-straight white guys, and the fact that by utilizing the “exotic,” they other cultures that aren’t their own. But they also, rightly I believe, point out that tiki isn’t taking from a monoculture. It has some resemblance to actual Polynesia and Hawaii, but it really is a place made of imagination, as fantastical as Disneyland. “Tiki,” they argue, “is for everyone.”If I’ve made this book seem sloggy, it’s not. I learned a lot about exotica and surf music, about beach party movies and how to make the perfect Blue Hawaiian. There’s a lot of history packed into this small book, most of it oriented to pop culture, and most of it breezy. But an understanding of tiki isn’t complete without understanding its roots, and why it was so important to a generation who was still struggling to find its own identity, and so made one up....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 20, 2019","Aug 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38619684-california-tiki

It *seemed* like the kind of book I'd like, and I'd read the first few pages and they were compelling enough. But for some reason, it didn't seem to insist on being read.That changed real quick the second I got past those first few pages. So, one of my favorite tropes in fiction is a person alone, finding a way to survive. When I was young, My Side of the Mountain (George) and Singularity (Sleator) were among my favorite books. (Singularity holds up; My Side is a little burdened by the weight of its status.) When I got older, it was Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. So to find that this book was about a little girl named Kya who is abandoned in a shack in the marsh by a family too scared (or angry) to stay ... well, it was a revelation. Much of the fun and excitement of the book is in watching Kya figure out how to live in the marsh, and bring herself up. With the help of her friend Tate, she learns how to read, and develop a scientific mind. She never goes to school but she becomes brilliant. Most importantly, she never feels hemmed in by the marsh or her circumstances; her dedication to resilience is one of the more powerful aspects of this book. Interwoven through this narrative is the story of an investigation, set about a decade from Kya's introduction, of the possible murder of a local man named Chase Andrews. At first, I simply didn't care about the investigation. It just distracted from the awesome story of survival in the marsh. As the two timelines and storylines converged, though, they began to inform each other, illuminate one another. It's a stunning feat by author Delia Owens to intertwine these narratives together in a way that makes sense and that continues to deepen our knowledge and empathy for Kya, while still leaving room for mysteries.Revelations abound by the end of this book, and not just the ones you think you want to know. In the last couple pages, I was blindsided by the answer to a question I didn't know I had. Owens could have ended this book satisfactorily in a number of ways (even an unsatisfactory ending would have been satisfactory, he said in a cagey way you'll understand when you read it). But I'm so happy with the ending we got, and I'm so happy this book exists. Rich without being dense, filling without being heavy.

The books Stephen King wrote under his Bachman pseudonymThis has to be the fifth or sixth time I've read Thinner, and I always find new shades in it. The books Stephen King wrote under his Bachman pseudonym are all marked by a hearty cynicism, and a deep indictment of modern society. The Bachman books generally focus on a single man, an outcast from society who refuses to play by society's rules and is punished for it. That doesn't hold for all seven of the Bachman books, but it's close enough. In Thinner, Billy Halleck is part of the society that makes the rules. He's a lawyer, he lives a comfortable - too comfortable - life, with a wife and daughter he loves. Then he accidentally kills a gypsy woman and gets away with it. The leader of the gypsy band finds Billy and whispers that titular word. And soon Billy Halleck is, in fact, getting thinner. King approaches gypsy curses in 1985 suburban America as he approached the concept of vampires in mid-70s rural America in 'Salem's Lot: as realistically as possible, while holding onto the tropes of myths and legends that came before. As with that earlier novel, King here uses the supernatural to examine the ills of society in a stunningly frank way. How quickly and effectively can a person go from being a have to a have-not? Is it as simple as going from too fat to too thin, or is there more at play? And what lessons, if any, can be learned on the fringes of the society you thought you knew so well.I love this book. I've always loved it, even though there's some squickiness in the premise. Is it racist to even write a book about gypsy curses? I'd argue no, given the way King fleshes out the Romany characters and makes them people, and given the fact that most of the book is an indictment of ""polite Connecticut society."" What I find most interesting is how Billy Halleck, who is put through the ringer here, SHOULD, in the course of his trials, learn real lessons he can then apply to the rest of his life. He learns the wrong lessons, and that's part of what makes Thinner one of King's bleakest novels.The other reason is that King, able to speak the worst truths as Bachman, argues that there IS no right lesson. Blame, guilt, rage - all those things always exist, and have to go somewhere. And if you're too cowardly to take it on, you have to pass it on. These are hard truths from an exciting and sort of fun book; they're also what elevate it, and make Thinner a book worth reading over and over again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Aug 03, 2019not set","Aug 05, 2019not set","Aug 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/899053.Thinner

From Mallory O'Meara's The Lady from the Black Lagoon to Grady Hendrix's Paperbacks From Hell to the spooky chapter of Gabrielle Moss' Paperback Crush, I've been kind of reflecting on the whole world of horror fiction and film. Most people think I'm this balls-to-the-wall horror nut because I love Stephen King, but the weird fact is, I mostly just like Stephen King. I like horror quite a bit (and I've read horror beyond King this year, and plan to read more), but I prefer crime fiction and ""literary fiction"" (or whatever you call what John Irving and Donna Tartt write). But horror as a thing excites me, and the history of pop culture stuff also excites me. So I was immediately drawn into Monster, She Wrote, a book delving into the deep and varied history of women writers of horror and dark fiction. Kröger and Anderson dive into the wayback, before even Mary Shelley and Frankenstein to lay down the lineage of the women who crawled so Anne Rice could run. One of the things about history that scares me is how completely stuff can be utterly lost. Because a lot of history has been written from a white male point of view, entire huge writing careers of women writers from the past - massively popular women writers from the past - can simply disappear. Look at someone as recent as Daphne DuMaurier, whose Rebecca and ""The Birds"" are bedrock fiction of the gothic and horror genres (in part because of two great Hitchcock films based on the work). For awhile, DuMaurier was also one of America's bestselling writers, hitting the #1 spot over and over and over. Nowadays, most readers have no idea who she is. And we're talking a twentieth century writer here! To say nothing of the lost careers of women in centuries past. This book is a step toward rectifying all that.I liked how the authors also delved into ""lit"" writers like Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, who still write horror even when they're being nominated for Pulitzers, and I was surprised how up-to-the-second the book is (included is a discussion of Oyinkan Braithwaite's My Sister, the Serial Killer, which I just read like THIS YEAR). I honestly thought this book would stop somewhere in the 70s, probably because that's where Stephen King's Dance Macabre - another great history of horror - stopped, and I'm conflating the time before I was born with what ""history"" is. So, welcome to my self-absorbed point of view.If you're interested in horror fiction, women's fiction, women's horror fiction, fiction, writing, or history, I can recommend this book. It's punchy and fun to read, while also delving deep enough into every author so that you come away wanting to read pretty much everything mentioned. Even if you like horror less than everyone thinks you do. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Oct 2019,"Oct 07, 2019","Jul 30, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44326161-monster-she-wrote

An odd sentiment in a book tAt one point late in Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend, Susan Orlean laments the sad truth that ""we outlive our dogs."" An odd sentiment in a book that spends over three hundred pages proving the opposite.I am a little loath to admit that I never really cared about Rin Tin Tin in my life. He didn't make an impression on my childhood, as he had Orlean's. My childhood was more about cartoon pups: Scooby-Doo and Snoopy, and Copper from The Fox and the Hound. If I wanted to take a trip in the Wayback Machine, Nick at Nite was more than happy to provide Lassie reruns for me. So why did I pick this one up? I read Orlean's The Library Book late last year and fell in love with the writing. Jeopardy! had a clue on this book and my immediate thought was, ""Huh. I should read more from her."" So, despite me not caring about the subject of her book, I bought this and dove in.Boy, am I glad I did! The book is very much about Rin Tin Tin, both the real dog rescued from the battlefields of World War I by caretaker (and Rinty's best friend) Lee Duncan, as well as the dog as a concept. It's this second idea that Orlean seems to find most fascinating as the book marches on, the idea of what makes a name, what makes a legacy, and who can lay claim to it. What matters most: the dog or the idea of the dog? How much is dependent on bloodlines, on perception, on how deeply embedded in our collective consciousness this dog is? Orlean doesn't truck with easy answers. She asks questions, and then ponders whether answers are necessary. It's also the story of a hundred years in America, starting before World War I and ending somewhere in the early 2000s. One of the most exciting throughlines is in how stars are made and perpetuated: from silent films through talkies, radio and television, merchandising and traveling nostalgia shows, Orlean tackles the ins and outs of pop culture stardom through the history of modern entertainment. Sometimes you forget you're reading about a dog (or dogs) and simply think - as early newspapers did - as Rin Tin Tin as an actor whose legacy has left a lasting mark. Along the way, Orlean gets to something even meatier: what drives people on the path of singular interests and obsessions? What makes a person so focused on a single interest that all else pales in comparison? The caretakers of Rin Tin Tin, those people who want the dog to live forever, are examined closely, but it's really a question for anyone whose hobby becomes more than a hobby. Orlean turns that question around on herself a few times, and wonders if her own interest in this long-ago dog is all that different from Lee Duncan's.I didn't care about Rin Tin Tin before picking up this fascinating, perfect book. Now I do. So the legacy, at least a tiny little corner of it, lives on....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 30, 2019","Aug 04, 2019","Jul 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11238914-rin-tin-tin

You tend to have this image of them, hunched over typewriters or keyboards, pounding away at whatever novel comes next. When they're not writing, they're reading, absorbing the work of so many others so that it recombines and reconfigures and adds and subtracts and becomes something brand new. When Stephen King releases On Writing, it makes sense. I wasn't prepared for a book on race-walking by Lawrence Block.I love Block. His three recurring-character series focusing on Keller (the hit man), Scudder (the PI), and Bernie Rhodenbarr (the gentleman burglar) have managed to fill the Spenser-sized void in my life for the past few years. I've enjoyed a lot of his one-offs, especially Getting Off and Defender of the Innocent and The Girl With the Deep Blue Eyes. More, I've liked Block's books about writing - his approach to the craft and how he's worked to perfect it. When, in his latest newsletter, Block entreated fans to take a listen to the new audio version of his memoir about footraces and let him know what we thought, well, I was game but skeptical. I don't care about running races. I live in Boston and the Marathon is interesting, but I don't really pay that much attention. How was I going to care about a long book, whose audio version wasn't even read by Block himself, about a subject I care nothing about?Here's why: because it's not a book about race-walking (a sort of hybrid type of racing that's not running but not quite the power-walking, either), not really. It's a book about experience, and determination, and self-will. It's also a book about an old writer who considers himself, questions his origins as he explicates them, but, almost paradoxically, refuses to ponder deeply the reasons why he races, and why he walks.Block's brilliance in this book is in not bogging the work down with detailed descriptions of the same sorts of races over and over. Once we understand what race-walking is, and what a standard race (or half-marathon, or marathon) is, we move along; subsequent similar races are summed up. We're here for the surmounting achievements, the way that Block, in his upper 60s, pushes past his own barriers and wins on his own terms. There's also a lengthy, alternately serious and hilarious segment focusing on Block and his wife Lynn's walk across Spain via the Camino de Santiago. Block brings his trademark wit and casually nonstop storytelling to this section; one of my favorite parts was in how Block and Lynn maintained their sobriety by holding impromptu meetings daily, and during stressful moments along their journey. If you're a fan of Matt Scudder, you know how important the meetings can be; for some reason, I never quite connected Scudder's sobriety with Block's; here, it makes perfect sense.The meetings become an integral part of Block's denoument, as well. Near the end of Step By Step, Block finds himself losing touch and verve with the things that brought him the most pleasure, especially the three Rs: writing, reading, and racing. I won't say what the outcome is, or exactly how the meetings play a part, because Block is better at telling it than I am at summing it up. That's another thing: Block's writing - always accessible and exciting and often plain-spoken - is simply magnificent here. Despite me saying that this book isn't really about racing or race-walking, there are quite a few moments in which Block offers stats on his run/walk times. The fact that he can make that interesting and not feel bogged down in numbers is a testament to the quality of the man's prose.One thing about the audio: it's always a little weird listening to the audiobook of a memoir not read by the author. You can get bogged down in the ""wait, YOU didn't do this in your childhood; you weren't even BORN yet."" It can be especially odd if you've heard the author read any of their other books, and like what you've heard (as I have with Block, whose craggy, New York inflections give some of his audiobooks a flavor and verisimilitude I love). That said, narrator Michael Bonner gets you past those preconceptions very quickly. He has his own take on Block's pauses and asides that are almost immediately charming, and by the time you're on the Camino, the tenor of Bonner's voice has woven into Block's recollection so well that you forget it's not Block speaking to you.You don't have to like racing, or walking as a sport, to like this book, though it may help. You don't have to like Lawrence Block's novels to like this book, though it will give you some flavor and a sense of his greater struggle with writer's block. All you have to like is a tale well told, and on that measure, Step By Step is anything but pedestrian. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 24, 2019","Jul 30, 2019","Jul 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6090803-step-by-step

What finally spurred me into reading it was the realization that it was about spelling bees. Dur!Only ... it’s not really about that, either. It’s about a family of four and the very, very different ways they uncover their spirituality. If that sounds dull or off-putting, trust me that it’s not. Goldberg has an exciting and energetic way of allowing readers into these characters’ spiritual and religious journeys without ever feeling like she’s pandering or proselytizing. Even the character whose entire religion is based on theft and mental illness seems sound enough when you’re in their head. But Goldberg doesn’t condemn, only reveals; what, she occasionally seems to ask, is a person’s relationship to their spiritual self if not a sort of mental aberration from the norm? All four of these characters - married couple Saul and Miriam, their teenage son Aaron, and tween Eliza - find God (or a reasonable facsimile) in radically different ways ... but all, in the end, in selfish ways that end up hurting others.What’s fascinating is that all four of these people could seem terrible - and often do seem terrible from others’ perspective - but Goldberg compels you into their stories and their actions and you can’t hate any of them. The ordering of letters into words - the backbone of modern communication - is where this book starts. As Bee Season attests, once you start breaking words down into components, start hoarding your communication and keeping it secret, it gets harder and harder to put it all back together again.I loved this book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 21, 2019","Jul 21, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/251762.Bee_Season

Some of these excursions have paid off excitingly: Getting Off, about a serial killer who chooses her victims based on her past sexual experience, was thrilling. Grifter's Game - a Hard Case Crime book - was similarly exciting, as was Deadly Honeymoon. There's a lot more Block I love than Block I don't love.But I didn't love this one.It's based loosely on the Starkwether/Fugate spree killings of the 1950s, with a couple of kooky kids named Jimmy John and Betty standing in for the real-life folks. That's sort of the problem. It doesn't seem to get beyond that, most of the time. This is a ""ripped from the 20-year-ago headlines"" story, based on real events and then sprinkled with fiction dust ... but you rarely get the sense that these people are real and not just playing parts. Some moments elevate the story: a sex scene at the site of a multiple homicide is grisly and horrifying; Jimmy John's reluctance to kill animals as he's killing people almost arbitrarily; a quiet domestic scene where we can see who these kids might be if they weren't criminals. Good scenes that hint at Block's future mastery of the form. But for me, the best part of the book was the afterword, where Block talks about Terence Malick's Badlands, which came out as his screenplay adaptation of Not Comin' Home to You was being shopped around. I'm a sucker for writers talking about the history of their fiction, and I was a sucker for this revealing afterword.

I was immediately drawn to Meyerson's Bookshop of Yesterdays with the promise of a woman with a past she didn't know was shrouded in doubt, a bookshop in trouble, and a dead uncle who left behind a series of clues and riddles for his favorite niece to puzzle together and unveil a major secret. All these elements are elements that set my brain tingling. But there's one problem with the novel, and it's a pretty big one:The main character.Miranda should be compelling. Her parents are keeping secrets from her about her uncle. She loves reading. She has an interestingly complicated relationship with her boyfriend. They're both history teachers. When she's handed this mystery in the wake of her uncle's death, she springs to solving it. But she's ... she's not really likable. Worse, she's not all that compelling. Okay, so full disclosure. I'm a white gay dude writing this . There's a whole thorny issue of someone like me saying that a female main character isn't likable. But it's that compelling thing that I keep coming back to. She's at the center of the novel, so we're supposed to believe her when she tells us that everyone thinks she's just great. But her behavior is kind of appalling. She furiously snaps at anyone who doesn't fall in line. She's understandably upset at her slacker boyfriend, but she seems to get mad at the wrong stuff. She treats the people in the bookshop badly, and while some react accordingly, it's only temporary. Within pages, everyone loves her again. I didn't really get why.Look, here's the thing: Miranda is grieving. I know she's grieving. And grief makes people lash out. But when you lash out constantly at every person, it gets dull. Especially when they immediately forgive you. Near the end, Miranda makes two life-altering choices that made me want to cheer for her; they're be choices that might shade an enjoyable character with an edge, even as we recognize they're the right decisions. But for Miranda, they just seem like par for the course. What's most frustrating is that every single other character is more interesting. I would love to see this book told from the point of view of Miranda's rising-star best friend. Or her mother. Or the famous author she befriends. Or Malcolm, the gruff dude who was Uncle Billy's best friend. Either of the baristas. Anyone. In measure, I liked the book in spite of Miranda instead of because of her, which is faint praise but praise nonetheless.

But we were both rabid for The Baby-Sitter's Club, and we had both read the tragic Ghosts of Departure Point individually and talked about it obsessively in our early friendship.She read broader in YA lit than I did, so this book was definitely more geared to her than me. (My favorite YA novels of all time - Haunted, by Judith St. George and Singularity, by William Sleator, weren't mentioned in here. It's not the fault of the author. The YA horror chapter had a lot to cover and just because my seminal works aren't discussed doesn't mean the book is really missing something.) But what I didn't know, I loved hearing about. I knew nothing about Sweet Valley High books except that one of them was the good girl and one was a psychopath, so hearing a little more about their exploits was fun. Ditto the whole subsection of Lurlene McDaniel and her sick-lit books. I'd heard of Lurlene due to listicles and Buzzfeed nostalgia, but this one offered a deeper understanding of the genre and McDaniel's place in it. And even that was fun. That's the whole book: fun, through and through.This was like a YA lit version of Grady Hendrix's Paperbacks From Hell, talking about a subgenre of 70s-90s paperback fiction and delving deeper than I did. Moss's chatty prose and semi-frequent asides are the best way to present this material, but she can also turn serious and scholarly when the material demands it (especially when discussing the lack of diversity in these books).

His On Bowie, written in the wake of David Bowie's sad passing, firmly set the tropes in place: some scant pre-career biographical information, a glancing look at the rise to fame, and then a deep dive into the big moments. These books are short and punchy and Sheffield knows what we came here to read about. Or, because this is an Audible original, hear about.Stevie Nicks just got inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, the first woman to be inducted twice, so it's with a sense of ceremony that Sheffield launches into this engaging tale of Nicks' life in and out of Fleetwood Mac. We get it all: recording Rumours, the Rolling Stone album cover that led to one of Stevie's clandestine affairs, the making up, the breaking up, the cocaine, the shawls. All of it is relentlessly positive, even when discussing Nicks' long, dark, Benzo-induced haze; Sheffield allows these books to be tributes rather than takedowns, and he never met a lyric he couldn't spin into a profound paragraph closer. It takes a special and specific talent to glide over a full career in such a short span of words, capturing the grandeur and sweep of a life lived in rock, and dipping down only when it's most important and relevant. I've long loved Sheffield's music-focused memoirs (Love is a Mixtape; Talking to Girls About Duran Duran; Turn Around, Bright Eyes), but these small bios (and I could even include his very good Dreaming the Beatles in this) really pop. Now I'm just holding out for a Springsteen one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 15, 2019","May 16, 2019","May 15, 2019",,Audible Audio,view (with text),/book/show/45426710-the-wild-heart-of-stevie-nicks

Coming off my year of learning how to cook French food (I did okay, sticking mainly to peasant stuff that's been elevated in recent years in the US), I was hungry for some more thoughtful discussion about food. On a whim in the aughts, I picked up Reichl's memoir Tender at the Bone and fell in love with the words she used for cooking, eating, and savoring food. I was shocked at how forthright she was about the stuff I was ignorant about, especially stuff about butchering that I'd very carefully avoided thinking about in order to remain an omnivore. She made me think about it. I'm still an omnivore.Ruth's following books narrowed in focus - Comfort Me with Apples was just as good, but more inward-looking, and Garlic and Sapphires was all about the lengths she went through to disguise herself when she was ing for the New York Times. Great writing and fascinating, but slightly less accessible. I can't remember if I read her memoir about her mother, but it seems I must have.Save Me the Plums seemed at first like it might be Reichl's least accessible book yet. It was all about her running Gourmet, a high-class magazine for gourmands. I knew it wasn't going to be pretentious or anything because that's not how Reichl operates, but I worried that I wouldn't be as interested on the day-to-day of running a fancy-food magazine aimed at people who were a lot richer than me. I bought it anyway because I liked Reichl's writing, and she was reading her own audiobook. It's pretty damn fabulous, and it reminded me of a few things: 1. Most people, no matter how fancy they seem, are concerned about the same stuff. Is my kid eating right? Am I going to get this job I really want? What if I fuck up on the job? Is my new boss going to be a jerk? Am I being true to myself? Reichl tackles all these things and more, being up front about her anxieties and insecurities, but also about those moments when she took big risks to make her creative endeavor more exciting and relevant. And 2. Why was I so concerned about accessibility? I've read Michael Crichton novels. I've read hard SF. If a story - fiction or not - is well-written, ANYTHING can be accessible. Save Me the Plums absolutely is.

Mark Harris' Pictures at a Revolution is the gold standard, tackling the five 1967 Oscar nominees for best picture - the hows and whys. Raftery's book does the same thing with 1999, a year I remember thinking was kind of a big deal at the time. The author doesn't generally focus on the Oscar nominees for Best Picture (and in fact calls one - The Cider House Rules, basic fake-highbrow Oscar bait. What's interesting about that is that I just read an entire book on the making of The Cider House Rules, and it was pretty damn controversial itself, with its pro-abortion stance).

All movies that signaled all these mini-revolutions in Hollywood in beyond. The found-footage genre began. Major directors who changed everything in the previous generation were met with confusion and derision (Kubrick and Lucas). Black movies that weren't about violence and drugs began making inroads (The Best Man, The Wood). Completely new types of filmmaking entered the conversation - The Matrix - and with them, new voices and directions making their mark. I loved almost all of what Raftery had to say here; some of these films in 1999 are my favorite movies ever (Magnolia and Blair Witch and maybe Fight Club). Everything is reported with enthusiasm, but not fanboy churlishness.

Usually these were city-destroying monster movies like Godzilla or King Kong, but I know the Gill-Man showed up a few times. Later on, the Creature from the Black Lagoon showed up in an awesome cheesy movie called The Monster Squad, and that’s when I fell in love with him. As a teenager into horror, I got this whole collection of glow in the dark monsters, and the Gill-Man was my favorite. He was even in It, my favorite novel of all time.Specific behind-the-scenes names of horror and monster movies never really stuck (despite me being a longtime Fangoria reader), but artists and designers who did - like Bernie Wrighton, Tom Savini, and Rick Baker - were all men. This didn’t really strike me as strange; for the longest time, I was under the impression that those jobs were just ones men did. I’ve grown up a little since then, but that didn’t change the reality that the most celebrated names were men.So it stunned me that the person who created the Gill-Man was a woman named Millicent Patrick (at least sometimes). It was similarly stunning when I discovered that Linda Fennimore created the cover for Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, or when I found out that Joann Daley was the artist behind the Creepshow movie poster. I want to get to a point where I’m not stunned by this stuff.Mallory O’Meara’s book is a great guidebook for that. She details the story of Millicent Patrick’s life in and out of monster movies, and shines a light on the rampant misogyny and privilege enjoyed by the industry. How Patrick’s career was derailed by one man’s bruised ego, how she was disowned by her family for daring to be an artist in Hollywood, and how her legacy was obscured for decades. This book brings that legacy to light, along with - almost incidentally - showcasing a number of other talented and forgotten women of Patrick’s time who also forged their own path and made themselves successes.I also loved the way that O’Meara brought herself into the narrative, as well as sharing how difficult and fun the research was. For a book all about the hard work of creation that people don’t acknowledge, it makes sure you know what went into its own creation.

He told me I could pick out anything in the store, so I picked out this book and Art Speigleman's Maus. It was a raucous trip to the bookstore.One of the last audiobooks on cassette I ever bought was this book, right before cassettes were no longer a thing. I've owned my audiobook of The Talisman since Frank Muller recorded it; it was one of the last things he did before his motorcycle accident. And yet I only just listened to it now. One of the things that an audiobook can do is stretch out the time of a book. Sometimes, when you're in a repetitive or dull section, you can skim a little bit until your eye catches on something good. Nothing in The Talisman was quite like that, but it's one of Stephen King's and Peter Straub's longest novels, and by the end, I was definitely feeling the weight of all those pages. There are about three or four climaxes of the book, and while that's not necessarily bad - all of them are earned, and all of them feel necessary - I eventually grew a tiny bit fatigued. It's funny; when I remember the book, it's usually as a fantasy adventure novel with some scary stuff. That it is! But it's also kind of a brutal book, intent on testing our hero Jack Sawyer along a road of trials that only ends with the last lines of the book. I loved his spunk and tenacity, and Straub and King do give him a few breaks, but MAN is this kid put through the ringer. Which, I suppose, is the point.I do love this book.

He might not HAVE much available nonfiction, but I always enjoy his forewords and afterwords to his novels. I like novelists with introspection. I had passed this slim book by more than once, and even now I don't know why. My journey with John Irving began with The Cider House Rules. The film was coming out in fewer than two weeks, and my friend Tracey and I challenged each other to finish the book before we went out to see it. I had never read a book like Cider House Rules (likely because I'd never read any Dickens), but I immediately fell for the author's way with words, his dialogue, his semicomic situations. I plowed through Cider House ... and then was hugely underwhelmed by the movie.I was mad about every change, especially the wholesale elimination of Melony (a hugely important character) from the whole thing. I didn't think Michael Caine deserved the award for Best Supporting Actor (I was holding out for Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense, Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile, or Tom Cruise in Magnolia). Now, looking back, I may have unfairly maligned the film. Reading My Movie Business, that seems all but assured.I loved hearing the behind-the-scenes stuff about movies based on Irving's books, even the stuff that kind of makes him seem like a jerk (one insight: Rob Lowe was a hot teen actor; Jodie Foster was not). My biggest wish is that the book didn't end with the wrapping of the film. I wanted to see how Irving reacted to the popularity of it, winning an Oscar, etc. etc. You always try to rate art on what's there rather than what isn't, but this seems like a missed opportunity. (Caveat: there is some fictionalized discussion of this in Until I Find You, but it's not the same). All in all, I liked this book a lot, and it's always good to ""discover"" a work by a writer you love that you haven't yet dug into. Which reminds me, I've never read Setting Free the Bears.

I got into him during the lull between Human Touch/Lucky Town and The Ghost of Tom Joad. This gave me ample time to scour Springsteen's back catalog, starting with Nebraska, then Tunnel of Love, then everything else, all at once.A lot of that back catalog has been covered; books like Glory Days and Springsteen's own Born to Run tend to focus on the years between Springsteen's origin story and the Brucemania of the 80s. Coverage drops off precipitously after that, despite Springsteen's return to massive popularity with The Rising and beyond. This book rectifies that, giving ample time to Springsteen's well-trod history and shining some light on newer work and recordings that have gotten lost in the shuffle of an epic career.Hiatt digs deep into what makes the early songs so significant, offering backstory and the occasional technical note. Through an impressive array of interviews with band members, engineers, and more, he's able to shade these stories with information and expertise from all sides ... even if some memories don't always match up to others. Casual fans will be impressed by the full sweep of Bruce Springsteen's career; hardcore aficionados will find so much unearthed history to pore over and discuss, it's like discovering these songs anew.For someone who came into the Springsteen ""thing"" later in the game, a book like this is necessary.

I'm okay with that.Spignesi is one of the best writers on Stephen King. His Shape Under the Sheet: The Stephen King Encyclopedia offered a vast-ranging and semi-academic look at King's work up to 1991, around the time that George Beahm's Stephen King Companion was giving new fans an accessible overview of the writer's oeuvre. Spignesi has continued the trend, giving us a King ""best-of"" list (The Essential SK) and a book about King's then unpublished work (The Lost Work of SK). All are presented in fan-accessible style that supposes fan interest but not obsession. That's the perfect thing for this book, and also the reason I might have liked it a lot more if I was just getting into King now.My problem is that I'm a Stephen King expert. I've read everything King has published and a lot he hasn't. I've written my own books on King. So SK: American Master wasn't really a book meant for me. Still, as a fan, I do get excited about King's newer work being represented in companion books like this. I remember reading a newer version of Beahm's Companion and seeing a listing for Desperation and The Regulators as upcoming books, and I got so pumped. Also, the more time that goes by, and the more books King writes, the more we get to see King's work as an entire body of work, stretching back farther and farther in time. This allows us to have contemporary essays (like mine in here, ""The Stephen King Immersion Phenomenon"") that tackle themes of King's newer work, and compare and contrast with his more vintage stuff. Basically, if you're new to the world of King, get this book. Even if you're not that new, get this book. The only King fans who don't need a book like this are ones with essays in the book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 13, 2019","Mar 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40539789-stephen-king-american-master

(And kinda hot.)‬ Like Spenser before him, Matt Scudder has gotten older (though his origin story hasn’t changed). That’s not to say that his story isn’t vital, or isn’t interesting; in some ways it actually is more so. There’s a good, sexual mystery/crime at the center of this book, exciting enough for long time crime readers ... but every Scudder book is more than just the crimes he’s involved with. The Scudder series has almost always been the story of a man struggling to understand himself and better himself. That’s no different in this book.I think the main reason why I liked A Time to Scatter Stones so much is because none of it seems perfunctory, or out of place. It all seems like a logical continuation of Matt’s - and Elaine’s - story. While a number of characters I really like never got the chance to show up, I almost respect the book more for that. You don’t have to throw in fan service if the story is compelling enough, and the main characters are still interesting, and fun to read about.Now I want more....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 02, 2019","Mar 03, 2019","Mar 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40821710-a-time-to-scatter-stones

They're so dense, packed with detail and character, that you often feel like you're living the lives of the characters along with them. They are often full stories of lives - of witnessing the youth of a child or children and then following them until at least their old age. There's always something satisfying about that.Last Night in Twisted River is no exception, and has the added layer of John Irving remarking on his own career and writing style through the lens of fiction. The novel is ostensibly about two men - a young cook named Dominic Baciagalupo and an older logger named Ketchum - and the woman they love, Rosie, who dies. It's also about the son of Dominic and Rosie, Danny, and something terrible - and accidental - he did when he was twelve.It starts there, sort of, in the New Hampshire logging town of Twisted River. There's also a young runaway named Angel, who also dies early on, and how his and Rosie's deaths reverberate through the remainder of the novel. Irving is fond of unusual families, and Dominic and Ketchum become something of platonic co-parents to Danny, trying always to keep him safe. That doesn't always work out, because it's an Irving novel. Also because it's an Irving novel, we get: farting dogs, moving outside the US to live, photographs of dead children hanging up on walls, missing hands, and, of course, bears. Like Until I Find You, the book goes on a LITTLE long, even though I can't really figure out a way to trim it that would seem satisfying. Every scene feels necessary, it just sometimes feels slowish. But it's not a bad kind of slowish. This maybe shouldn't be anyone's first Irving (Cider House Rules, Garp, A Widow for One Year, or The Hotel New Hampshire would be better suited for that role), but once you understand his style, this is a perfect novel for long winter nights....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 28, 2019","Mar 07, 2019","Feb 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6323821-last-night-in-twisted-river

Most of his books are about taking on some sort of absurd challenge - reading the entire Oxford English Dictionary, spending a year following Biblical scripture literally, following every diet trend and fad for a year - and writing about his journey. He always manages to be insanely involving, insightful without becoming preachy or heady.Thanks a Thousand is all about gratitude; Jacobs' quest now is to thank one thousand people who went into making his morning cup of coffee. That includes everyone from the barista who serves him to the farmers who pick the coffee to the graphic designer that created the coffee shop's logo, and much, much more. It's a relatively short book, and Jacobs is a little breezier here than in other books, but it's to Thanks a Thousand's benefit. And it's odd: you'd think a book about having more gratitude would feel treacly or mawkish, but it never does; there are even feints toward acknowledging that there are often bad people along the path to making a good thing. The whole thing is refreshing, and it continues to reiterate what seems to be Jacobs' macro-thesis: the more we know about the world around us, the better people we'll be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 27, 2019","Feb 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39860114-thanks-a-thousand

It was - as far as I can tell - the last Stephen King hardcover another person bought for me before I could buy it for myself. Dolores Claiborne was my prize for making the honor roll in my first semester at senior year at Braintree High. I didn’t distinguish myself academically as much as I probably should have, but I’ll hold onto that as an achievement to be proud of.I remember loving the book, but it taking me a little while to understand the structure as a monologue. I was a dumb 17-year-old; I initially thought there were pages missing from the beginning. But it carried me away soon enough, like most of Stephen King carries me away. One of my fondest memories is sitting in my grandparents’ warm dinner nook, lost in this hardcover and waiting on Charlie’s Hot Dogs to boil so we could have supper.Was I alienated by the narrator, by the fact that until the pretty frisky murder at the center of the book, it wasn’t really a horror story? That much of the opening was about the hell two older women put each other through? No. I don’t think I was. By 17, I’d been so deep into the King thing that I was willing to accept almost any writing and at least give it a fair shake. Because of that, I opened myself up to a lot of style and experimentation over the years, stuff that primed me for other writers. I’ve gone back to this book a lot over the years, mainly because the audiobook read by Frances Sternhagen is so good. But in this impossible year, I’ve rediscovered the joys of reading these novels as I had the first time, after buying them from a shop and cracking them open to feast my eyes on that first page for the first time. The magic in these books still exists, and rarely if ever fails to make me happy....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 03, 2020","Jul 06, 2020","Feb 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1082102.Dolores_Claiborne

Maybe I did it because I wanted to try to make sense of everything, or try to put human faces on the numbers that scroll up and up on the CNN chyron. Or maybe I was just trying to reconnect with a happy time in my life.It's probably strange, looking in from the outside, how many joyful, happy, rescued moments are connected with Stephen King novels. He writes fearsomes, after all, and doesn't skimp on the gore or dark thoughts or the unsavory sectors of the human condition. But they always make me feel, to believe in something beyond myself. And I have a history with these books. A history stretching back to when I was just entering puberty. I was fifteen when my mother bought me The Stand for Christmas in 1990, and it was the first hardcover bought specifically for me. (Along with Four Past Midnight, at the same Christmas. That was the year I also got The Gunslinger, Danse Macabre, and Christine in paperback. It was a very good Christmas.)Things aren't great with Mom and me now, which is a shame as much as it's an inevitability. But I re-read this edition of The Stand, the big one, the complete and uncut one I've owned for thirty years, to connect with the feeling of that Christmas morning. How plainly happy I was to get the brand-new Stephen King novel, and it was in hardcover, and it was MINE. My mother wrote a little note inside the front cover, and it's sweet and kind and comes from a time less fraught. I love this book very much - I love Stu and Frannie, Nick and Larry, and even Harold Lauder, who made all my darker impulses manifest and made me understand them a little better. I love this book for the story in this book, so much. So very much.But I love the book itself just a little bit more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 18, 2020","Oct 08, 2020","Feb 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/149267.The_Stand

At first our unnamed narrator just drifts in a prescription-drug-induced haze, as we uncover details about her past and present she is too exhausted to care about. Eventually this aimlessness coalesces into a plan, an actual decision to cure herself of both her ennui and addictions.That all this takes place in New York a few months before 9/11 isn’t coincidental, nor is it gimmicky. A few jolting moments in the text remind us where and when this is all happening. Unlike in Steve Martin’s An Object of Beauty, the attacks on the Twin Towers do not sneak up on us. They’re a Chekhov’s Gun, subtly peeking out through the story before hiding again. This isn’t to make light of the tragedy - the book’s entire thrust is learning how to survive in the face of tragedy, and to be happy, even when your world falls apart.This is Ottessa Moshfegh’s second novel, and the second book of hers I read this year. Tonally, it’s similar to Eileen - the claustrophobia, the slippery sense of self - but it’s otherwise very different. Despite being set in New York, this book feels a lot more intimate.

It’s almost a thriller, a dark story of lineage and evil and free will. I can read it over and over and never get sick of it.The Grapes of Wrath is probably a better novel. It’s a more important novel. To go further, it’s probably Steinbeck’s masterpiece. It details the plight of the starving, the poor, the untethered during the Great Depression. It is a devastating book, because there’s no way out of the ongoing misery. What little light in the book is found in human kindness. But that kindness comes with a price. Those are the reasons it's never going to be my FAVORITE Steinbeck. Wonderfully written, deserving of the Pulitzer, but simply not as fun or exciting as East of Eden (and it never intends to be). But it’s never a slog to read. It’s always compelling, and the Joads are fantastic, spellbinding characters. But I kept finding myself having to put it aside for a bit before continuing on. It’s a hard read. Fantastic, but hard....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 30, 2019","Feb 21, 2019","Jan 30, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath

It's a spiritual novel, and a religious novel, but it doesn't ever become a PREACHY novel, something that struck me even more this time around. Another thing that struck me is the fact that our narrator - why it's Johnny Wheelwright! - might be a little bit more in love with Owen than on a strictly friendship basis. There's an interview with John Irving at the end of this audiobook in which Irving confirms my suspicions. Characters speculate whether Johnny is a ""nonpracticing homosexual,"" and Irving basically says, ""yeah, he is."" I wonder if that's why I've always related so much to this book. But it's more than that. It's the specificity. It's the small-town New Hampshire life. It's Irving's tropes - theaters, lost fathers, sexually aggressive older women, writers. No Amsterdam here and, as far as I can tell, no bears. But the language is Irving. The FLAVOR is Irving. And the ending, as always, is so, so sad. I've described this book as densely plotted, and it is, but I don't mean that to sound like the book itself is dense. It's almost airy in parts, even though we're dealing with intense subjects like faith and belief and the horrors of war and the hypocrisy of government. Despite those things, the book feels so hopeful. It's not as cynical as I remember it being. And of course this tickles my love of superhero narratives. I'm going to put this aside for a little while again. Maybe I'll do another whole John Irving jag this year, but this book is too important to me to read too often. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,2,"Jul 02, 2021not set","Jul 15, 2021not set","Sep 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2506432.A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany

It's one of my favorite books of all time.Every time I come back to Misery, I'm reminded of all the amazing stuff Stephen King has to say about art, popular and otherwise, and its power to move you and involve you. The novel has a lot of gruesome things to say about the nature of fandom, stuff that seems even truer today. What we ask of creators, what we demand of them, and how we react when they do stuff they don't like. I remember people being furious at King for daring to write Gerald's Game and Dolores Claiborne, because they weren't what fans wanted. (Specifically, I remember someone at the bookstore telling me confidently that they were written by his wife.) Or the end of the Dark Tower series. Or any number of things Stephen King did that his fans didn't like.But it's not just fandom that Annie Wilkes represents. She is also the driving force behind creativity. Paul Sheldon's realization that he's playing Scheherazade to himself, in addition to Annie, is the key to the whole novel. Later on, in On Writing, King says that life isn't a support system for writing; it's the other way around. It's not that I disagree with that. It's that sometimes it has to be. Sometimes all you've got to live for is the work you're making real, and sometimes that's enough. What I know is this: I first read Misery in 1990, and I've read it maybe a dozen times since. Its power has never diminished. I'll pick this up in a couple years and love it all over again.

Of course this both discounts 1994’s A Son of the Circus (an ambitious misfire) and his stellar latter-day work (Until I Find You, Last Night in Twisted River, and In One Person). In between those run of great novels is the short The Fourth Hand, a book that’s very good, but stops short of great.Irving works in layered tragicomedy. Good people often die in his books, or are horribly maimed, but there’s often enough good humor to buoy some of the darkness. The Fourth Hand is trying to be fully comic - despite the dismemberment hinted at by the title - as sort of a commentary on rubbernecking culture and 24-hour news disaster porn. It’s actually written into the text: our main character, Patrick Wallingford, is an anchor on a disaster porn network. He’s not particularly smart and his best asset is that he’s handsome. He’s also kind of a philanderer in part because of his handsomeness. This gets him both into and out of trouble, but because this is trying to be a comedy, those outcomes seem more random than anything.2/3 into the book, the characters seem to wake up to the fact that they’re in a John Irving novel and the tone shifts. This could have been intentional on Irving’s part. The newfound pathos in the shallow characters, especially Wallingford ... well, it’s not exactly unearned but it’s not exactly earned, either.But if course, most lesser Irving is still good Irving. In the book’s best moments - and there are fantastic moments - The Fourth Hand can stand with Irving’s greats. As a whole, though, like with Irving’s semi-sympathetic main character, there’s just something missing....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 03, 2019","May 11, 2019","Jul 05, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4656.The_Fourth_Hand

It’s my third-favorite Stephen King novel (after It and Misery), which means it’s among my favorite novels of I can’t be objective about The Shining. It’s my third-favorite Stephen King novel (after It and Misery), which means it’s among my favorite novels of all time. It’s at once grand and claustrophobic, terrifying and affirming, an utterly perfect example of the gothic novel while also restructuring the tropes and creating something wholly new. It’s an American masterpiece.I’ve been ing and discussing this book since I was 15 years old. I bought my first copy at Infinity Books in Quincy. I remember sitting out on our tiny second-floor porch. It was autumn. And I devoured this novel. I couldn’t seem to read it fast enough. It was set in the 70s, which seemed old to me then in 1990, but now feels oddly contemporary, despite the lack of cell phones and the internet (and the wildly outdated smoking section on airplanes). What’s interesting is how King is cutting through the morass of toxic masculinity this early in his writing. In the 90s, he did a quadrilogy of sorts of novels highlighting female strength and resourcefulness: Gerald’s Game, Dolores Claiborne, Rose Madder, and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. Those books were seen as a departure for him, but The Shining presaged all that. Our main adult character, Jack Torrance, is a weak man whose concerns about his self-worth and self-image are constantly undercut by his twin addictions of alcohol and temper. King is very clear to show that there’s a cycle of abuse here (which carries through to Doctor Sleep), but also that Jack refuses to take responsibility for himself, thus signaling his own destruction. Wendy Torrance isn’t necessarily the powerhouse that, say, Dolores Claiborne is, but she has plenty of strength if her own. This situation defines her as a wife and mother, but her character has these deep pools of strength within her that she can call on when necessary. I do wish we knew more of her internal life - she reacts more than acts - but she’s not the milksop some make her out to be. Similar stuff can be said about Dick Hallorann, who some have slotted into the “magical negro” trope. He’s anything but that. He’s a real person with a real life, who feels a connection to Danny because of the psychic gift they share. There’s some jive patios but that’s not the whole of his character. Oddly enough, I liken him to Sue Snell in Carrie. She had a connection of Carrie White, and felt White die at the end of the book. I think Hallorann has a similar, deeper connection to Danny. He’s not a black man saving a white family; he’s a psychic whose connection to another psychic MAKES him family.King has dipped into the well of esper powers so often at this point (including in this year’s The Institute) that you might be forgiven for being a little blasé about Danny Torrence’s powers here. But there’s such a sense of discovery about the shining itself, a newness and freshness that a career of exploring psi phenomena can’t dilute. Plus, it’s all mixed in with ghosts, and those ghosts are scary as hell.And that’s partially what it all comes down to: this book is scary. The tension just keeps ratcheting up tighter and tighter until it almost can’t support it ... then it ratchets up some more. Because the book CAN support it. Because here King is writing at the peak of his storytelling powers and he is doing it with the confidence of someone who knows it.
