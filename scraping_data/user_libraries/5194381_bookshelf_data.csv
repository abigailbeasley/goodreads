The agony is compounded by the particulars of her father’s death, a heroic giving of his own life to rescue Mae’s closest friend, Heidi.Written with a pitch perfect sense of how a child moves from grief to healing, the novel takes the reader through the months of sorrow, hate and rage that any Daddy’s Girl would feel after such a loss. But the book is so much more, a celebration of loving families and how they find the courage to rebuild shattered lives. The scenes depicting Mae’s mother and grandparents as they help her to heal are heartwarming; the final closing scenes, which I won’t reveal for fear of spoiling the read, provide a true celebration of the father-love that should be every child’s birthright.Buy this book for your sons and daughters.
