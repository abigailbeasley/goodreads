I liked it. The basic premise of the book is that the life of the American woman has changed dramatically over the past half-century, so much that most people born during the period do not comprehend what life was like in the 1950s and before. Yes, not everything is perfect these days, and women still fight discrimination. But the basic acceptance of women as equals, and their abilities in all fields, has pretty much cancelled out the idea of ""men's work,"" and ""women's work.""Collins, a columnist for The New York Times, is know for her witty observations, and this book has no shartage of them. It drags, however, when she moves into historian mode, blandly reciting facts and anecdotes on various historical events. In her defense, however, some of those times were pretty bloody and sad, as when she relates the roles of women in the civil rights movements, and the deaths that occurred during that period.But her book is full of actual women who caused and lived through many of the changes, and the effect it had on them. However. some of these women jump in and out of the narrative, making it hard to keep track of them as individuals. Collins does, however, brings us up to date on many of the women portrayed.Beware, however.

But I only gave it three stars because, quite frankly, it was kinda boring.The writing was subpar. The author really, really likes himself, and insisted on quoting himself in every damn chapter.

He told us this in every other chapter.I kid. He told us in just about every chapter.As for this book, the author insists he did not want to do a ""where are they now"" book, but that's exactly what he wrote. He does write about their players' lives since the '86 season, which is good, but it's still very much a ""how are they doing now"" book.Oh, and he's sexist.

Well told, with excellent details and narrative writing. And it's all true, which means the reporting is top notch. Heck, even the tales about how she went about gathering the story, and her interactions with the family and community in doing so, are fascinating.Henrietta Lacks was a black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1941. Cells were taken from her, and, for the first time ever, those cells survived and thrived. These cells -- named HeLa --helped make modern medicine, and were invaluable in research aimed at curing diseases and testing drugs, among thousand of other things. Trading in the cells became a multi-million dollar industry.But there was a problem: The cells were taken from Lacks without her consent. They were used without her family's consent or knowledge. Indeed, hardly anyone knew or cared who Lacks was -- she grew up poor and unschooled in the segregated south, and she and her family were treated as you would imagine a poor, uneducated black family would be.So Skloot tells hers and the family's story.

The n I first picked up this book because I saw on Facebook that it was set in my old neighborhood in NYC, and it was the tale of an Irish immigrant. The neighborhood did not turn out to be a major player in the novel, although it was interesting to see the streets I grew up on and the parks I played in have a role in such a wonderful book. And this short book -- less than 150 pages -- was wonderful. But it was sad. Tess’s life in the city starts around the time of the Kennedy assassination, and the book climaxes with the World Trade Center collapse. In between, her life is full of melancholy and heartbreak. Tess Lohan was born in rural Catholic Ireland, and we meet her as a young girl at her mother’s death and funeral. We follow her through her growing up in Ireland, her training as a nurse, and her eventual emigration to New York. We met her family, and learn how they cope with the hardships of farm life during and after the Second World War. We watch her life as a lost soul as she grows into an adult. In some ways, her story is my story. My parents emigrated from Ireland in the 1950s. My mother died when I was a young boy. Part of Tess’s story is describing how her father dealt with the death of his young wife, leaving him with a brood of children. It made me realize how I have never thought about how the death of my mother in her early 40s affected my father. She left him two young children to raise, and while he remarried a few years later, I’m not sure how, or if, he ever got over the death of his beloved wife. Like his time in the Royal Air Force, my British-born father never spoke of my mother’s death from cancer. The book had other impacts on me: Tess’s walking the streets of Inwood -- my neighborhood in uptown Manhattan -- brought back memories of my own childhood. Her strolls through Inwood Park had me recall my own days playing stickball and hockey in and around it. Her days in her apartment building -- a few blocks from my own -- was similar to my memories. But this book is far more than a remembrance of things past for Inwoodites. It’s the story of a young woman trying to find her way in a strange city with strange customs, while trying to hold on to her own good, gentle nature.  It’s not a happy, feel-good story. It’s a story of loneliness and searching for one’s place in the world. It’s a beautifully written, compelling story of one woman, and the people who surround her. It tells of Ireland and immigration and New York. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 13, 2015","Sep 15, 2015","Sep 13, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22841065-academy-street

I find it difficult to understand why all the plaudits for this book and this writer, when he's decent, but not a superstar, and really not an author I plan on reading again. I bought this book because I liked his latest novel, Canada, and wanted to read soemthing else he wrote. That desire is out of my system now.In The Sportswrite, the protagonist, Frank Bascombe, is a short-short writer who put out one good book, then turned into a failed novelist who moved on to sportswriting. He just went through a divorce and is trying to come to terms with the death of his young son. The novel is about how Bascombe deals with these crises -- the truth is, he doesn't -- and its tends to meanader into philosophic moralizing about what it means to play within yourself. It's followed by two sequels, including Independence Day, which won a Pulitizer Prize. For my money, though, The Sportswriter is not a good start.First off, there's a lot more pontificating than plotting in this book. I wish he'd get along with actually telling the story, instead of spending so much time just telling us (over and over and over) his theories on life. There actually is a good story in there (although one that's quite egotistical on his part) but he covers it up with so much nonsense that you lose its essence.And what's with the ethnic slurs, racism, and sexism? For instance, he simply calls his ex-wife ""X,"" never giving her a name. Is this to diminish her, to make her less of a person? He never says. It's simply done. This despite the fact that he claims to continue to love her, and that she is a major character in the book.Then there's his tendency to describe every character in terms of nationality. But he doesn't describe them as Polish or Italian. Nope, it's polack or guinea. Now, his main character (himself by another name) does stereotype a lot with religions and nationalities, and sometimes he's proven wrong. Yet the impact of the slurs stays with the reader.And why, oh why does he insist on using the tern ""Negro""? Yes, this is an old book, but it is coprighted in the 1980s, when Negro was not a preferred term. It's not just a one time thing, it's done throughout the book. Often, I wondered what difference it makes when he insists on describing a person's race....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 14, 2014","Sep 28, 2014","Sep 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40722.The_Sportswriter

Indeed, I was always curious about when and what it was written as, thinking it seemed like an old story to be a modern creation. But it's a book that was published in France in 1911.It's billed as being an early detective novel, and for helping to introduce the concept of a reporter-detective. It's written as history, with the author's theme that he has researched the story of the Phantom, interviwed survivors, and is now telling the true, unvarnished facts. Heck, he even includes footnotes.I really liked this book -- it's sad but compelling. It's a bit fanciful in parts, calling for you to let go of your sense of disbelief, but it all comes together in the end.

Indeed, humans are so dominant in this epoch of natural history that geologists have named it after us -- it's the Anthropocene Epoch.And Kolbert does a great job of telling this story. She's a great reporter and writer and weaves a tale out of numerous visits all over the world to explain the impact of what we have done.Each chapter is a tale about a visit to a remote area -- an island off the Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon rain forest, bat caves in the northestern United States -- with a tale about how human activity is changing the land and leading to extinctions. And it's not just climate change that's at fault, it's what humans have done to the earth since they evolved -- moved around and killed off native species, brought in invasive species (whether deliberately or mistakenly) on their travels, and built dams and islands and roadblocks that limited the movement of animals.She tells the tales well, with interviews, wonderful descriptions, and compelling facts and analysis. She writes in a conversational, almost folksy tone, as if you are sharing a cup of tea and biscuits with her. And for a difficult and complicated subjct, she manages to make it understandable, without simplifying it to the point of innaccuracy. She notes that the idea of extinction wasn't known until the French explored the area around Big Bone Lick in Kentucky, and found mammoth fossils that simple did not match any known animal. But it wasn't an easy concept to accept. Scientists attempted to fit the bones into animals they knew about, or explained that these animals must have moved to areas that had not been explored yet. Evenutally, they had to acknowledge that animals and plants have evolved and died out throughout history -- indeed, five times in the past great extinctions have almost killed off all life on the planet.But life has survived, and it has come back....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 19, 2014","Jul 28, 2014","Jul 19, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17910054-the-sixth-extinction

A bizarre mystery novel set in the Nursery Crimes division of the Reading police force. I've read a few other books by Jasper Fforde, a Welshman whose writing mind is as warped as the spelling of his last name.Here's the plot: Detective Inspector Jack Spratt is called upon to investigate the death of one Humperdink Jehoshaphat Aloyius Stuyvesant von Dumpty -- known to one and all as Humpty -- who fell from his perch on top of his wall. In this case, Spratt -- who is known as the Giant Killer -- is ably assisted by Sgt. Mary Mary, who as a child grew pretty damn tired of the ""quite contrary"" chants. His nemesis is Friedland Chymes, an ace detective who is trying to steal the case out from under Spratt.Dumpty is a strange egg -- see how I got into the swing of things here? -- a womanizer and heavy drinker who is involved in lots of shady deals and spent time in prison. Lots of people are suspects in his death, including billionaire financier Soloman Grundy, and Humpty's wife, Laura Dumpty. But Humpty also may have been depressed, because he gets that way, especially around Easter. Among the witnesses are Humpty's neighbor on Grimm's Road, William Winkle, who may have been awake at the time of the early morning fall of Humpty because of a sleeping problem.And Spratt is far from an great detective. He's just off losing the case of the Three Little Pigs, who were acquitted on murder charges in the death of Mr. Wolff. Also making an appearance is Prometheus, who escaped the shackles that chained him to a rock in the Caucasus and fled to England, where he is seeking asylum. Prometheus is romancing Spratt's daughter, aptly named Pandora. And one thing that I really loved about this book is that when Prometheus tells Pandora the story of her namesake, he gets it right! It was a jar that Pandora opened, not a box.Anyway, the plot gets quite convoluted, involving gold thefts, business fraud, and a number of other plots devices. (But I can say the butler did not do it, as that plot device is banned in Spratt's world.) Still, it's a fine book that will keep you smiling -- if not outright giggling and laughing -- right up to the end....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 13, 2014","Jul 18, 2014","Jul 13, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6628.The_Big_Over_Easy

One is that a good one will give an overview of the historical period. A second is that it has a distinctive point of view. A third is it gives insight – especially the author’s – into both the events and the people responsible for those events.Edward M. Kennedy’s memoir, “True Compass,” fits all those ideals and more. For one thing, the Kennedys were instrumental in much of the history made in the latter half of the 20th Century. And Ted Kennedy, the sole surviving brother of the family, may have been the most influential senator of his time.So “True Compass” gives a broad look at the history of the 20th Century. And it gives specific details about Kennedy and his brothers and other family members, who helped make that history. He covers much of the period – his brother John’s presidency and assassination; his brother Robert’s role as attorney general and presidential candidate who also was assassinated; Lyndon Johnson’s presidency and the civil rights movement; the Vietnam War, Nixon’s presidency and resignation; Jimmy Carter in the White House and Kennedy’s unprecedented efforts to unseat him; and Reagan and Clinton and Bush.Yes, Kennedy does gloss over some of the more unsavory aspects of the family and its financial and political dealings. For instance, Kennedy writes about an idyllic childhood, and never mentions some of the accusations of abusive parents and shady methods behind the family’s wealth. His father isn’t controlling, but instilling disciplined behavior in his children, Kennedy writes. He does write about Chappaquiddick and his own bad behavior, but not extensively. He apologizes for and explores some of the better known incidents, but on his terms alone. Perhaps that is why, throughout the book, I had to keep reminding myself that this is a memoir, one written by a man with an obvious bias. Still, it’s an interesting and important book. It reads like Kennedy is sitting in a chair telling you a story – in fact, telling you many stories. And he does delve into the personal just enough to give you a strong insight into the man who was the liberal icon in a Senate career that spanned nearly 50 years....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 25, 2014","Jul 06, 2014","Jun 25, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6452806-true-compass

This story is told in diary form. Eventually, NASA figures out that he's still alive, and that story is told in the more traditional narrative.The writing is not the best, although the story makes the action move quickly -- and Watney is a funny, likeable guy.

Once you get into the writing and the tales, you'll delight in each new discovery of hidden meanings and smart characters drawn and expanded from their original real-life books....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 22, 2014","Feb 14, 2014","Jan 22, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27002.First_Among_Sequels

It’s a nice story, well-written for the most part, with a strong main character. But it has a few flaws – some typos and sloppy editing, some long, drawn out anecdotes that could be considerably shortened or eliminated, and a lack of strong secondary characters.But all that is loose criticism. Most importantly, the story is good.It tells of Brad Williams, a high school senior in Birmingham, Ala., in 1969. It’s a year that presents Brad with a variety of choices: Whom should he date? Should he join a protest against the Vietnam War? Just how friendly should he become with that black kid on his school’s baseball team? About that: The black guy took away his shortstop position, forcing Brad to move to second base. That could hurt his chance of getting a baseball scholarship to college, and because his family is too poor to send him to college, it means a lifetime of suffering by having a job in the dreaded steel mills. Wait, there’s more: Should Brad seek conscientious objector status to avoid the draft? Should he become friends with that new hippie kid from up north? Should his family sell his grandmother’s house – possibly to a black family, thus destroying the neighborhood?And that’s not all. Brad has other problems involving school, his baseball team, his friends, and society in general. That’s the major problem with the book – it just tries to do too much, and solve too many problems, over its 460 pages. It gives us too much information, and asks too much of us.For instance, we really don’t need a play-by-play of every baseball game Brad plays. We don’t need a minute-by-minute account of his dates. We don’t need a breakdown of everything that happens at school, when he visits church, or on the night his dad takes him out to the neighborhood bar to meet his union buddies.It also would be nice to have some minor characters who are more than sketchily drawn archetypes. The bad guys are really bad. The friends are good. Fewer characters delved into more deeply, would be preferable.All that said though, I still liked the book. After all, it is a good story, well told. And that’s what counts.NOTE: The author sent me a copy of this book, asking me to  it. I tried not to allow that to influence me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2014,Jan 2014,"Jan 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16226247-fielder-s-choice

It turns out the designer is a non-practicing Muslim.And thus begins Amy Waldman's novel about prejudice, suspicion, fear-mongering, and events spiraling out-of-control.The book starts slowly, and struggles to find its way as it introduces a plethora of characters. And for a book that tries to show the dangers of prejudice, it has an amazing number of stereotypes and beyond wealthy characters. For instance, the family member on the jury, the character whom the book revolves around, is described as being set for life after marrying a wealthy man, who leaves her everything after he dies in the terrorist act. The novel is chock-a-block with investment bankers and other scions of industry. But other characters -- the Irish-Catholic family with a fireman-son who died, a cold-hearted mother, and a second son who has, you guessed it, a drinking problem; the tabloid reporter who cares about nothing but getting a sensationalist story; and the governor whose political ambitions weigh above all else -- never come to life.

It's difficult because of its subject matter, which follows a young girl in 18th Century Britain, tossed out of her house, who turns to prostitution. Mary Saunders -- a real person from the past -- is written as neither a hero nor a victim, although she could be both. The book is unsentimental about her, although sympathetic to her plight.Nonetheless, it's wonderfully written, and exposes the class battles of the time -- many which continue today.
