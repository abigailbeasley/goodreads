Emeric and Vanja's messy relationship is a good demonstration of communication issues and how to resolve them. Vanja's overall insecurities, around loving and being loved, are very valid and highlight the way lots of young women feel (especially those who have experienced similar traumas). However, the way these struggles were highlighted, while appropriate for the target audience, didn't feel compelling to me personally.I also just wasn't invested at all in the plot?

Also in this  I will pretty much only be rambling about spoilery drama so I guess this whole  is a spoiler. (view spoiler)[Where do I even BEGIN with Percy's love life omg. First of all: the immediate thing to address is his age. He is FOURTEEEN AHAHHAHHA and this adds so much important context. As a smol 10 year old, Mathilde did not pick up of the absurdity of some of the things that happen in this book. (For example, I do not buy for AN INSTANT that Calypso, a gorgeous immortal goddess is falling for Percy. Nuh-uh. It was actually so funny to me, until I remembered that she comes back as an actual feasible love interest in HoO.)So I guess let's start with Percy's whole attitude. After coming from more YA/Romance/Fanfiction type of narratives, it is So Funny to read from Percy's POV because he is absolutely clueless in the romance department. He doesn't even know what he wants, which makes him an incredibly unreliable narrator. Instead of descriptions of yearning, we get lines like ""for some reason, my face was really red"". This is hilarious to me, and a good example of show-not-tell. But also it's like wow! children will really take absolute crumbs of dialogue and RUN with them. Percabeth was pretty much my OTP back in those years (aside from HP couples) and I read and re-read every single interaction that even mildly suggested something of romance in these books and ate them all up. But in actuality, it's also a little strange to read back on. Because while young Mathilde was all ""la-la-la Percabeth 4eva it's meant to be!!! True love!!!"", older Mathilde is like ""damn, this 14-year-old boy actually did  not  know what he wanted at ALL.""To use ~official~ language, there is evidence in the text to suggest that Percy was nearly just as romantically interested in Rachel and Calypso as he was in Annabeth. Now, this is perfectly alright and realistic for a 14-year-old, but my current self feels just a touch betrayed? Like I wanted more indulgent proof that Percabeth was actually was the only valid ship. I think I just have high standards for my young self's champion couple. To build on this, the end of the book is also SAD! He spent ALL the rest summer ""skirting"" around Annabeth, and now I'm thinking this is 1 of of 3 summers of friendship when they just aren't hanging out  (hide spoiler)]...more",Notes are private!,0,0,0,not set,not set,"Oct 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8130423-the-battle-of-the-labyrinth

She and her found family deserve the world.

Also, Tamsyn Muir remains a storytelling genius. *I like how my  rate makes it look like I read this series at a reasonable pace and not in a 1.5 week fever.---- SPOILERS -----(view spoiler)[- Cam, Pal, Pyrrha and Nona make the most beautiful, bittersweet family. I'm so grateful to have had Cam and Pal for a whole book looking after Nona. - I missed Harrow and Gideon a lot, but to be fair Nona is completely delightful. She says the funniest things. Also, I theorize that everyone's names are so weird because she's just auto-translating it in her head. That's why Corona is Crown.- “Well I don’t think redheads are sexy.” / “That’s a VERY interesting thing you just said, Nona.” BWAHAHA. The moment we all knew it couldn't be Harrow or Gideon bc Gideon knows she's hot shit, and Harrow has a big fat crush on Gideon sooooo. - Kiriona made me really upset, because She's SO sad. And she's also mean to everyone, even Cam and Pal :( - Still love her though and her complete dedication to Harrow despite still thinking Harrow ruthlessly cut her out. ""GET IN LINE THOU BIG SLUT"" iconique. Every time Gideon pettily calls Alecto a slut, (which is about 5 times), I gain a year of life in pure entertainment. As someone on tumblr pointed out, it's even funnier when you think about how Nona was extremely unimpressed by Gideon's looks when she met her. - Planet Earth is Barbie, we love to see it. - I'm so looking forward to book 4 but also not, because I know it will wreck me. Both Shayna and Sophia (who has now just finished them) are like ""yeah Tamsyn could definitely just have no resolution for Gideon and Harrow"" OOF. - Some quotes from these discussions are: Sophia: ""I'd be happy with a conversation."" and Me: ""is it too much to ask for a hug??""

Cheers to Harrow (she would hate that). [edit 8/26: 4.5 (and the more i'm thinking about it... the more i'm like.. should this be a 5?)]Yay, time to  book 2! This book is very different than the first, tone-wise. If Gideon's book gives mystery comedy action vibes (the kind where upbeat vintage pop songs play in the background during the battle scenes), Harrow's book is more... mystery psychological thriller? It's dark, it's honestly quite miserable. No One is Having A Good Day (soundtrack by Phoebe Bridgers).But the misery aspect is small in comparison to the mystery aspect. Oh my goodness, from page one onwards, it's ALL QUESTIONS NO ANSWERS. When people say this series is confusing, they are mainly referring to this book and the perpetual ????what!!?? sensation you get while reading it.This may sound like a bad thing, but I honestly loved it. I drove me completely insane... in a fun way? The promise of answers kept me reading (they do come, I promise... mostly), and in the meantime, I loved trying to keep track of all the clues and come up with theories. I've never read a book that felt so much like an escape room. Also, despite it being Sad Hours O'Clock at all times of day, Muir adds enough comedy and interesting characters to keep things fun. Harrow is an icon (even though she probably doesn't mean to be), and most of my favorite moments from the series are in this book. There are so many scenes that I just adored. There are 77 highlights on my kindle edition of the book. I go crazy thinking about them, even a whole two weeks later, and I'll talk more about it below the spoilers cut. So to conclude, even though this book is probably less likeable than Book 1, I think it's a fantastic expansion of the series, and one that cemented the series' place as obsession-worthy in my heart.------- SPOILERS (Sooo many spoilers ooop)--------For some reason, everything in the spoilers tag loses its formatting for the feed posts. To not have this next part be a completely giant messy paragraph, I recommend going to the 's page.(view spoiler)[Ok let's start with these two moments 1) ""If I forget you, let my right hand be forgotten,"" her mouth was saying. ""Add more also, if aught but but death part me and thee.""And unsteadily: ""Griddle.""[...] Harrow was too amazed by her body's expanding capacity for despair. It was as though her feeling had doubled even as she looked at it, unfolding, like falling down an endless flight of stairs. She dug her hands into the mattress and she cried for Gideon Nav.""This description of grief was powerful to me. I can so clearly picture Harrow's sobbed out ""Griddle"". It was also incredibly cathartic after hundreds of pages of Harrow's mind gaslighting Gideon out of existence. For most of the book, I'd hoped and hoped that Gideon would come back, but when this took place, I was like ""wow... harrow (and I) might have to accept gideon's death"" Then shortly after we have 2)  And you'd gone and left me behind. [...] The noise that resulted - I’m not doing it justice when I say it went SCHHHLIIIIICK WOW!!! The THRILL!! The narratorial change my beloved!!! I missed gideon SO MUCH.Both of these moments have haunted me so I wanted to give them individual attention. Still there are so many other moments so i'm going to try to do quick list of things I loved. - ""Hi, Not Fucking Dead,"" he said. ""I'm Dad.” ASKLDJKLAJDLKJ Jod noooo - The SOUP explosion - Ianthe and Gideon's whole conversation. 10/10. Hilarious. “She’s not even into you, okay? It’s just the bones. She’s into bones.” - Meanwhile, the dramatic irony of how at this exact moment, Harrow is off writing literal COFFEE SHOP AUs - Overall lots of things pointing towards Gideon and Harrow being romantically intertwined. The whole plotline with the Body is confusing in terms of how Harrow feels, but.... come on. See above.Finally, i'll wrap up this lengthy ramble with something that completely went over my head when I was reading. Someone on tumblr pointed out that one of the earliest hints that Gideon is the narrator is the way that every single time Harrow thinks about the end of a sword, the narrator interjects to correct her and explain it's a pommel. I think that's just swell. (hide spoiler)]*Fun fact: I joke about Sophia never giving 5 stars, but I just looked at my own numbers, and in the last 4 years before 2023, only 4 new books (as in, never read before) received 5 stars from me. One of them was a not even technically a book (it was a fictional podcast), and one of them was Anne of Green Gables which I'd technically listened to as a child. So really only 2 books.

Dragons! Romance! A main character who makes it through tough training on pure grit 2.5?This book had a lot going for it that I would expect to love. Dragons! Romance! A main character who makes it through tough training on pure grit alone! And there were certainly fun moments. Magical training academies will always appeal to me, and I liked how refreshing it was to have a fantasy military system where all genders are treated equally (and people can date whatever gender they want!). However, at the end of the day, I just couldn't get invested in Violet's story.To be clear, I am all for Not-That-Deep-But-Fun (NTDBF) reads. The Cruel Prince has very little substance and is filled with fairy balls, court intrigue, and a lot of tropes (most notably all the enemies to lovers ""I hate them but I'm obsessed with them"" stuff). I also have read hundreds of thousands of words of fanfiction, which is the very definition of an NTDBF read. But whereas I loved The Cruel Prince, and I devour fanfic, I just didn't have that much fun reading this book. I think the main thing that bothered me, aside from the plot feeling very predictable (and the Divergent parallels), was that I didn't care about any of the characters. Violet felt a little too perfect to me; something in her training progress was missing. She also had subtle ""i'm not like other girls energy"" with her silver hair and her [redacted-spoiler*]. I'd be curious to hear how disabled readers feel about the disability rep because, to me, it seems like it could have been expanded on and handled in a much more interesting way. When I don't like the main character of a book, it then makes it hard for me to get invested in the romance. I didn't buy the whole enemies part of Xaden and Violet's relationship since it was so clear he never actually hated her. And I am usually a fan of the forced proximity trope, but this book said ""forced proximity every day all day for the REST OF YOUR LIFE"" and that's kinda icky. In a world in which I cared about the characters, all my complaints about the romance would go away and i'd be like ""yesssss forced proximity! yesss he was obsessed with her the whole time!! love love love""**. But I did not care, and so the questionable aspects of the story and relationships stood out to me instead. I'm glad that people had fun reading this book, and I'm thrilled if it got anyone back into reading. But, as someone who reads a lot of fantasy, I don't know if it merits all the hype it's getting.Also random, but if you loved the training and military academy aspect, consider reading the Protector the Small quartet by Tamora Pierce (starting with First Test). Aimed a much younger audience and there is virtually no romance, but Kel is an absolutely amazing MC.*[SPOILER: her two dragons]**The amount of questionable behavior I tolerate from The Locked Tomb characters is crazy.

This book of course reminded me of my beloved The Goose Girl - it's based on the same fairytale, but the twist is the shift in perspective. I generally love a good trickster main character, and while Vanja didn't impress me much at first (I kept sighing and thinking ""she's no Gen""), she won me over by the end. Her Percy Jackson-esque style of modern and sassy narration does make the book feel a bit less timeless and all-ages than the Bayern books, but I still thought it was fun. (Fair warning: if you don't like anachronistic-sounding dialogue in fairytales, this book may seriously annoy you)This book deals with some heavy topics (the lasting trauma of abuse and sexual assault is prominent in the narrative), and I thought it was handled pretty well given that the target age seems to be pretty young. I also loved the queer representation casually dropped into the narrative. Definitely something more middle-grade book series are in need of. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 13, 2023","Oct 19, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54340983-little-thieves

To me this is an example of a perfect non-addictive book. I wasn't thinking about it 24/7. I wasn't putting off social engagements to read it. I didn't feel empty or devastated when it ended.* But thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent reading it (which was both while working, and while on vacation)So let's talk about why it delighted me so much. Sanderson mentions the Princess Bride as a reference, and I definitely see the similarities (win #1). I also saw a lot of Diana Wynne Jones' whimsy (win #2), Terry Pratchett's world-building (you know, the Discworld kind where the world is a little silly and absurd) (win #3), and both of these authors' witty and charming narratorial tones (win #4). Plus, Sanderson is a master at creating cool magic systems, and the spores in this book were no exception to this. (win #5). So many wins!! And that's just talking about the style and tone of the writing.As for the actual plot and characters, this is an Adventure book. It's a road trip (or sea trip) story, with a lot of pirates (!), a couple side quests, and an exciting final destination. Tress is so so smart, in a way that also feels very realistic, and I love her for it. I was also a big fan of the rest of the crew but I shan't say much on them to not spoil anything. Overall, it was just an excellent reading experience. Not once did I get stressed out while reading, because I could always trust that whatever happened next, it would be a fun time. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes children's lit, any of the authors I mentioned above, and/or pirate adventure stories.*There are all things I experienced as I subsequently read the Locked Tomb Series.

When I started reading this book, I'd already forgotten the synopsis, meaning that every subtle genre shift surprised me. This book ties a couple of genres together and I loved the blend of YA/coming of age/family vibes with Nancy Drew mystery vibes.At first, I thought Perry might be a little too grumpy for me, but once I realized she meant well, she grew on me quickly. I love a standoffish/mean narrator who secretly has a heart of gold. (Thinking of El from The Scholomance).I also enjoyed getting to read about NAGPRA through this novel. I was familiar with the law via my art historian friends, but this provided a more personal perspective on how unsuccessful and frustrating the whole execution of NAGPRA really is.Finally, a ramblemusing about justice: Books like these shine a light on how a person's ability to seek and achieve justice is highly dependent on their race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, and socioeconomic status (to name just a few factors). The term MMIW (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women) exists because violence against Indigenous women is so painfully common. And, as described in this book, perpetrators of this violence often go unconvicted. It begs the question of what justice means in a world where the lives of some victims are deemed less worthy than others. This is not a new question, but it has been at the forefront of my mind recently, and reading this book only brought up more frustrations with our current national and international systems of law enforcement....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 17, 2023","Dec 29, 2023","Mar 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61675933-warrior-girl-unearthed

The tone was both timeless and cozy, and it had a good mix of old and new fairytale thematic elements, with some meta nods to the reader:“So you built yourself a dog and found yourself a wolf. If a fox shows up looking for you, we’ll have a proper fairy tale and I’ll start to worry.”“Why?” asked Marra. “If I’m in a fairy tale, I might actually have a chance.”“Fairy tales,” said the dust-wife heavily, “are very hard on bystanders. Particularly old women. I’d rather not dance myself to death in iron shoes, if it’s all the same to you.” I also liked that Mara was thirty years old and had no idea what she was doing. It made me realize that in some ways I (a 23-year-old) am still like a kid in that I look up to people only a few years older than me and assume they'll have all the answers. (Like how I used to think 6th graders were the epitome of maturity. Then I got to 6th grade and realized my error)Sidenote: I chose this book as my first read to move on from my Locked Tomb obsession, and then on the first page Mara is building a construct out of bones!

I loved getting to return to the world of the Cruel Prince, and I enjoyed the character dynamics (including the old-fashioned slow-burn failing-to-see-the-obvious romance).The Folk of the Air trilogy is one that, for me, is perfectly set up for expansions: I really enjoyed the original series, but I'm not so unreasonably attached to the old main characters that I need them to be constantly present, or for them to have perfect happy endings and uncomplicated lives. I actually loved that the old MCs were barely in this book at all, and instead perceived only vaguely but the current MC. (Love reading from a new POV's character about how awed and impressed they are by the old MC because as the reader you're just like ""haha no I know them and they're a mess""). Also, while all the characters in Cruel Prince were very ruthless and ambitious, Wren and Oak both have surprisingly strong moral compasses, which made this book less gruesome and stressful. Also Oak reminds me of Gen from the Queen’s thief series in a lot of ways (and wren of Irene in a few ways) I only wish I hadn't guessed something so early on because it made the ending less dramatic!Looking forward to the next book (over a year from now) and in the meantime... i may reread The Folk of the Air.. since I've never read it through without a years gap in between books....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 29, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61198133-the-stolen-heir

I bought this book primarily to support MWT, and I absolutely did NOT expect the emotional journey it would take me on.

Some of the stories confused me, some left me intrigued, and the last two made me very Sad. (One of the details in the last story is devastating to me, but after talking it over with others, it appears I may be just overdramatic and overprotective of these characters). Before reading, I'd seen a meme about how this book leaves you with more questions than when you started, and I agree! It also does answer (or vaguely answer) some questions I now realize I didn't actually want to know the answer to, so... oops. Be careful what you wish for. I think I prefer to treat it as canon adjacent but we'll see how the stories age in my mind.

For the last month, I've been sad about a myriad of different things, (including some big changes in my personal life), and I found that the first 2/3 of this book added extra sadness to my plate in a way that frustrated me. I simply didn't have the bandwidth to carry Sam and Sadie's hurt feelings and insecurities, when so many of their struggles seemed to stem from a lack of communication and an abundance of pride.

Stop foreshadowing the pain!*Oh and I wanted Dov out of everyone's life so bad! Get him out of there!However, I was still compelled enough by the characters and plot to keep reading. The game concepts and metaphors were especially fascinating. And when I finally got to the NPC chapter, everything changed. The book was still sad (in fact - more so than before), but it was not sad in a frustrating way. I thought the story from that chapter onwards was beautifully written and I cried pretty much until the very end.Even a couple of weeks after finishing the book, I still feel a pang in my heart thinking about the ""Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow"" monologue.

I read this book slowly at first, and then my friend Shayna started zooming through the series so I simply had to speed up! Fortunately, my flight home provided the perfect wifi-less opportunity to do so. I really spent the whole 6-hour plane ride reading, and I went from 40% in, to the end of the book. Even though planes don't have wifi or cellular data, I still think this reading marathon is a testament to the captivating quality of this book. I could have watched a movie, but I just wanted to keep reading and find out what happened next!Overall it's a really strong conclusion to such a sweeping series, and the ending was appropriately dramatic and emotional. Mainly, the things I docked points on pertain to my own particular taste. For example, I am just not a huge fan of apocalypse narratives. They are so bleak. For most of this book, both the reader and the characters had to watch as the world crumbled away, without a single clue about how to save it, or destroy the force that was its cause. This made it hard for me to want to pick up the book since I just felt so directionless and hopeless. Of course, once the answers started to be hinted at, my investment came back, but that didn't change the doomedness of the overall ambiance. There was also a lot of world-explaining. This book took on the challenge of explaining  everything , from the plants, to allomancy, to the Lord Ruler, etc. Normally, I'm not a fan of my fantasy magic being explained. It dims the wonder and novelty of it, and it's often poorly done- the ""logical"" explanations end up creating more plot holes (see La Tempête Des Échos in the Mirror Visitor Series). However, I'm very impressed with Sanderson's world-explaining. He masterfully unraveled every single mystery of the series with both clarity and suspense. It's incredibly cool. So even though I'm still not fond of world-explanations, I'm satisfied with how it was done here.Minorly spoilery things below(view spoiler)[The ending ending was also not necessarily my personal favorite, but I can see why it made sense, and it was very cathartic. One small gripe I had that was a consequence of the apocalyptic setting was that in the face of the end of the world, the entire slavery narrative was completely dropped. Which I kind of get, but felt wrong to me. Especially since book 3's explanation of the Lord Ruler's decisions were very much like ""eh he did his best"" completely ignoring the millennia of united-states-style-worst-of-the-worst-sell-children-and-beat-people-to-death-for-fun slavery that he supervised.Also I want to give a HUGE shout-out to Vin and Elend and their relationship. I love that they trust each other so much, and I love love love that they can be trusted not to do stupid things in the name of love. I am so frustrated in books when people make objectively dumb decisions in books just to try to save their lover, but Vin and Elend cannot be accused of that. here here! how far they have come!

Like sure the love interests and romance aspects of the story don't always feel realistic. But her descriptions of family and friendships and places certainly do. The sensory descriptions of places are amazing, and hearing about good vacations makes me remember my own.This was probably. my least favorite Emily Henry because I wasn't super invested in the romance. Not sure if it was the second-chance premise, or the characters, or if I was just in the wrong headspace but I felt eh about the relationship.

Lots of slow politics and things going wrong and characters making mistakes and suffering the consequences. But still enjoyable and, as I will explain below, there were lots of highlights.The rest of this  is not hugley spoilery but it's not also not meant for anyone who hasn't read the book, so it's probably best to not ignore it unless you've read it.Some things I liked: - My concerns about Elend being king being addressed! yes he DOES need to learn to be better at leading! - Vin and OreSeur's relationship. Love OreSeur and his snarky comments.- The expansion of knowledge around keepers and feruchemy. Feruchemy is so cool!- Kandra lore!!!- Tindwyl single-handedly intercepting and fixing all the silly communication issues between Vin and Elend- How every single plan they made going wrong (i mean it's annoying but also very realistic)- in general how the politics felt realistic- Vin going through her ""I can be girly AND fight"" journey. Oh Vin. My goodness.- The twist with the impostor! Did not see it coming!Some things I didn't like - Everything around Zane and Vin's trust of him STRESSED me out (but I get why it had to be there, like for plot) - Even with Tindwyl doing the lord's work with Vin and Elend's relationship issues, they stayed pretty melodramatic about it. - Ultimately I think Allriane was not that significant. Over trusted by the characters, and under utilized in the plot.- The ending: ok this is a spoiler for real. (view spoiler)[ I get that the twist at the end was surprising and unexpected. But I think a good plot twist should be the kind that is subtly hinted at. Where you can go back and read a second time and say ""There! How was I so blind"". This twist, by definition of the evil force being able to change all writing, meant that there was no WAY anyone could have possibly guessed it. So narratively, I feel like it's not as a strong twist. And I felt really bad for the characters because there was no way they could have known.

So I'm really glad I started 2024 with a book that, despite having a GR average rating below 4 stars, delighted me! Shout out to Shayna for the recommendation. Given my appreciation for the ""I am your grandparent and I know more than you and I will tell you this fun whimsical story but also eat your vegetables!"" style of narration found in works by DWJ/Terry Pratchett/others (is there a term for this kind of tone?), it's no surprise that I got right on board with this book's narration. The story felt like it was being told by an old History professor. ""Factual"" but also imbibed with the professor's bias and various hot takes on history. Much like any professor, there were times when the narration dragged on a bit too long, but overall I quite enjoyed it. I also liked that the narrator seemed to have a solid understanding of the complexities of politics and the economy of war - which I feel like a lot of modern fantasy authors don't consider or incorporate well enough. One should be warned that the story is only very loosely inspired by Sleeping Beauty, and I daresay the title is perhaps a bit misleading as well (I'll be honest, I still don't understand it after finishing the book). Nonetheless, I thought the plot was compelling and the characters were excellent. In particular, the flaws and character development of one male character (love interest?) were so refreshing! I'm tired of perfect love interests at the moment.Looking forward to the sequel!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 04, 2024","Jan 11, 2024","Apr 25, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/45154546-how-rory-thorne-destroyed-the-multiverse

I've always admired Oxbridge from afar* so I was bound to love the setting, and I found the historical tone in the writing to be very charming. Furthermore, I was impressed by how successfully Kuang paints early 19th-century England as a dystopia. It felt like I was reading a modern book about some hypothetical dysfunctional society, except the society wasn't hypothetical at all, and was instead just... history. It's certainly not an uplifting book, and there's a layer of bleakness to everything in it, but it works really well for the story.Kuang repeatedly discusses the horrors of imperialism and its side effects, and while I kind of agree with other s that she overstates the point, I wasn't bothered by it. Also, when it's a topic that's so often overshadowed in eurocentric history classes, I think there's some value in over-emphasis. This next part isn't really a spoiler but it talks about the end overall so I'll hide it: (view spoiler)[I wasn't sure how to feel about the very end. Everything Robin did felt right within the context of his own journey, but there was a weird layer of forced objectivity to the whole process - as if the author had come into the narrative to inform the readers that these actions weren't just the right choice for Robin, but in fact the objective ""Right"" choice for everyone. Maybe I'm just reading it wrong, but much of my confusion stems from the ""Necessity of Violence"" portion of the title. It inserts this opinion so blatantly and objectively that it undermines the reader's ability to interpret the text. To quote Emma's  ""it's a spoiler and feels even a bit condescending"". So, even though the Kuang does provide characters (like Victoire) with viewpoints differing from Robin's, she doesn't give them much credibility, and the reader feels forced to agree with Robin.  (hide spoiler)]Character-wise, I found Robin to be a very compelling narrator with his uncertainty and survivalist perspective.

The plot was less structured and none of the settings were as interesting as the Scholomance. Also, something that happens near the end is a little fudgy (especially going against the talks of Balance). That being said, I honestly just didn't care that much? I personally had a lot of fun reading this book, and I zoomed through it in 3 days. I have a lot of thoughts about it, so let's see how well I can wrap them up.One of my favorite parts of the series is El's narration style. There is A LOT of info dumping in this book (as I think there was in its predecessors), but I wasn't bothered by it because something in her narrative style makes it feel more like a conversation and less like a textbook (If that makes sense). (Wait I have a side ramble about the narration. One thing I found funny (? weird?) is that frequently El would come to these giant realizations in the middle of a really tense moment/conversation, but she'd make sure to talk through  this entire realization. So I'd be reading what felt like 3 pages of ""Oh goodness if A then B, and C and oh! so this is who X is and what it all means"" and the whole time my brain would be fascinated by the revelation but also like ""EL! How do you have time to think all these thoughts! someone scary just asked you a question and is waiting for you to respond!!"" The visual of El freezing to have these thoughts in the middle of a dangerous situation, was both hilarious and stressful. But maybe 3 pages of outlined thoughts equals 3 seconds of thinking time? I'm not sure why I noticed it so much in this book - I think in other books they do revelation->action->explanation-later, in that order. It just goes to show how readers' minds work and how there is so much situational context you hold at the back of your mind as you read through scenes.)Back to El herself. I understand that some people find her constant snarkiness grating, but I just love it. To me, she is the epitome of ""kind, not nice"" where she's just really mean to everyone while helping them, and it's hilarious. I also like that she is so (rightfully) angry at the carelessly privileged people around her, while simultaneously understanding that she can't blame them for wanting safe and comfortable lives for their families. On that note, I think there is a strong narrative around how people will do horrible exploitative things to protect themselves and their children and will continue to do so, so long as they see it as the easiest option (and they can ignore it). What impresses me though is that the book takes this cynically realistic view on humanity and spins it in a cautiously optimistic way: the idea that being good is a constant choice made again and again, but sometimes people will make that choice. El was definitely overpowered (and the balance argument does not really hold up IMO), however, I too sometimes wish some all-powerful being could freeze all the world and give everyone a good angry talking to, and shake some sense into us as a society. So I found it VERY satisfying when El could use her power to just yell at people. Overall, really enjoyed it. Wished there were more of all our favorite side characters (very little Orion, Aadhya, Liu etc.), but It was still a fun speedy read....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 20, 2022","Dec 22, 2022","Jan 26, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/55858638-the-golden-enclaves

It definitely took inspiration from both Knives Out, and Rebecca, two works I very much respect, and it was fun to see the mash-up. That being said, I absolutely could not stand the romance(s). On a general level, I find love triangles super annoying and I prefer for authors to make it clear who to root for. But particularly for this book, Avery's attraction to not one but two edgy, dark, overprotecting, rude, completely out-of-touch boys felt so ridiculous that at no point could I even begin to start shipping her with them. More importantly, her arrival - mandated by an old man she never met, with zero explanation - created such shock and distaste in everyone in the vicinity that the whole situation felt very  unsafe  for someone so young (she's max seventeen!) I understand that suspense was the point, but personally, if I was fearing for  my  life while I live in a creepy mansion with a family that despises me, I can't possibly imagine having the bandwidth to obsess over the abs of some member of said family.

It was a lot of fun and very addicting, and I read it one day. I also thought the magic system was much more interesting and developed than in HP or PJO. I can see Galadriel being hard to like as a reader, but I enjoyed her offhand jokes about being destined for chaos and destruction, and I appreciated how hard she is trying to not fulfill her evil destiny. Also, she's not perfect, quite egotistical in fact, but in a way I found funny. I loved her dynamic with Orion, and I always love some good team-building stories. I've seen some comments about stereotype problems in this book, and while perusing the internet, I crossed paths with the concerning paragraph about dreadlocks (that has since been removed from ebook copies and will be from future print editions - Novik has apparently also apologized for it). I'm not sure how aware I would have been if I hadn't seen those comments before reading, but I certainly notice the unfortunate international naming system. The French was also bad, which to me indicates that Novik generally just didn't really try very hard with this book when it came to other cultures.

This series is sweeping, mysterious, and painful, and I am a big fan at the moment, so let's talk about it. This book definitely has the most classic storytelling of the three. If I had to describe the overall vibes, I'd say ""murder mystery"" meets ""haunted house"" meets ""hunger games"" meets ""academia"" meets ""swords!""(the swords are the most important thing to Gideon, and therefore must be mentioned). Oh, and of course, can't forget the main theme of necromancy! I saw someone online say that this book is like ""Dark Academia on an athlete scholarship"" which I think is hilarious and completely true. Gideon has no idea what the hell is going on. What are the necromantic theorems? She doesn't know. She's here for swords, bad jokes, and the opportunity to get out of the Ninth house forever*. As a narrator she reminds me of Costis from the King of Attolia, meaning that she is Very Lost, and Deeply Frustrated when the Smart people go off and pull crazy stunts without explaining themselves. I absolutely love her and her snarky, confused, hilarious narratorial tone.Of course, I also love Harrow, as well as the way Harrow and Gideon's relationship evolves throughout the book (how does it evolve? hmm that's for you to read and find out). There's quite a few other characters to love here, but to avoid spoilers, I'll once again say: that's for you to read and find out.As for the plot, it definitely kept me on my toes, and there were quite a few ""aha!"" and ""whoa!"" moments. The ending... oh man... the ending. I don't want to say too much on it here (I'll talk about it below the spoilers cut), but it was definitely a ""whoa"" moment.It's clear that my obsession with this series is very current, so it's hard to say what its staying power will be, but I suspect I'll look back on it with at least as much fondness as I have for the Six of Crows duology, and perhaps more. We shall see how I feel when the 4th book comes out (I'm not ready).*she's also here for Hot Women, something I would resent at a male narrator for, but for Gideon Nav, I easily pardon. yes queen. Be gay in space.---- SPOILERS BELOW (but only for book 1) -----(view spoiler)[ Ok the ending absolutely WRECKED ME. WHAT THE HELL. I was simultaneously screaming into a chat with my friend Shayna (who has read the series), and screaming out loud next another friend Sophia (who has not). This was at Sophia's house, and at one point, her mom said ""It seems like this book is really torturing you"" and Sophia said ""no no. this is just how Mathilde is about media"". Which. RUDE. but also fair. That said, the pain here was particularly acute. I never ever expected Gideon to die! I'd accepted that everyone else might die, but not Gideon or Harrow. Ugh!!!Also, I felt like a complete fool for shipping Gideon and Harrow the whole time - they can't get together if SHE'S DEAD. I spent the next two hours in agony and denial, and then I wrote a list titled ""here's why gideon might come back"" which included the argument: ""she's too cool of a character to be dead"". Then I wrote a list titled ""here's why gideon might actually be dead"" which included the argument: ""she died. on the page. in front of us""  (hide spoiler)]...more",Notes are private!,1,3,1,"Aug 05, 2023","Aug 09, 2023","Jan 17, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55710230-gideon-the-ninth

And while it definitely was entertaining for the first half (the fake dating trope is a superb trope after all), the second half sort of went off the rails a bit.

In the first half of the book they keep talking about how having brothers makes her ""knowledgeable""???? She literally wants children so bad and doesn't know how they are created?????

That is uh, not romantic Sir. Nope, just abusive. Thank goodness he didn't actually force himself on her. Also lying by omission about his inability to conceive was just not ok (hide spoiler)]3. more upsetting? (view spoiler)[ Just anything to do with nonconsensual conception is truly truly unsettling.

The general romance tropes that I sometimes find overly cheesy were more enjoyable for me because the story acknowledged them for what they were. That's what's great about having a narrator who is a romance novelist herself: she points out when her life is like a romance (and when she's being a poor communicator!) Also, the conflict felt more or less believable, even though a lot of it stemmed from insecurity.

I probably should have expected this from a story about a young man destined to become an evil dictator, but even so, I was unsettled. The mastery here is that Coriolanus's transition from a boy just trying to make it through the days, to a chillingly calculated young man was  so subtle . It's unnerving. You always want to be able to see a cause and effect in villain backstories, like ""oh if that hadn't happened, then clearly he wouldn't have gone bad.""Instead, hints of his extreme pride, ambition, entitlement, and fear* are peppered throughout the book. And when paired with a series of independent occurrences, these traits come together to reveal his nature in a way that makes sense in hindsight, but is nonetheless still shocking**That being said, this subtlety is the main strong point of the book. The first third is kind of tonally off - very poor-boy-in-prep-school vibes juxtaposed with post-war depression vibes juxtaposed with the Hunger Games. The middle third picks up speed but makes you feel morally confused (and sometimes horrified) in lots of ways, and last third is just more moral confusion in a different setting. The plot is pretty slow overall. I'd recommend it if you like psychological studies of how someone is driven to commit awful acts and justify them, or if you are hankering to know what the post-war Capitol was like (this also made me realize that 75 years for the capitol to be in complete power is actually not that long - kind of a fail for the Capitol lol). Otherwise, not really worth it. *Looking back, I think the most significant of those traits is fear. It's never outright discussed, but I believe that fear (of weakness, of powerlessness, of chaos) was a major driving force for Coriolanus, and a major justifier for his future actions, which I think is true of many dictators in real life. Many people have told me in life that fear itself is something to be feared (literally an FDR quote), but I've always thought of it in the sense of a mob mentality, whereas fear can also have an effect in a very private way as well. All this to say, bravery in the face of fear is just as important as people say it is! **Spoiler below(view spoiler)[ In the woods in the cabin when he starts to wonder where Lucy Gray went and realizes she's the only one left as a witness to his crime, and you can watch in real-time as any love he had for her dissipates in place of survival mode I was :O.

Winterkeep was also a beautiful place to read about, and the whole world was very interesting. Overall, I had a fun time reading it.That being said, I really felt like character-wise (and plot-wise), this book really fell short of the masterpiece that is the original trilogy. By the end, I still didn't feel like I understood Lovisa as a character, or what her motivations were. Honestly, I think it would have been much better to have the whole thing from Lovisa and the animals' point of view. Bitterblue and Giddon's chapters were fun at first, but overall, their characters felt off and more one-dimensional than they used to be (especially Bitterblue). Also Giddon's chapters were very angsty and I do love some angst, but this really reached a new level. I think cutting these character's perspectives would have given more time to flesh out Lovisa's character and understand Winterkeep better. Having all Winterkeep-native perspectives would also have helped adjust to the  complete  change in the style of dialogue. The OG trilogy is mostly YA High Fantasy language with some modern humor, but this book had very modern dialogue. I kept being thrown by phrases like ""instant boyfriend"", ""He was a nice guy"" and ""Hey, are you okay?""Also, I'm just an escapist nostalgic reader who loves my high fantasy and the idea of an industrial revolution in Monsea is not my favorite. All in all, I'm glad this book came out years later - I was not pinning all my hopes and dreams on it, and I saw it as a bonus adventure rather than a continuation of the series. This meant I wasn't disappointed by it. But I think I would caution people reading the series for the first time to maybe hold off on this one.

I get why people don't like this book very much.

Nevertheless,There's always going to be high emotional stakes when it comes to the final book in a series you really loved, and I knew that going in. Nevertheless, even that knowledge couldn't protect me from being very sad at the end. I have so many thoughts (and feelings!). First off, I definitely understand why people did not like this book as much (the lower average rating on Goodreads had mentally prepared me a little- though ofc it's still above 4 stars). In any instance where you build your world around fantasy, ancient libraries court intrigue, and all, it's going to feel like a huge shift when you set your last book in a mysterious medical facility with a clandestine purpose and strange protocols that mess up the patients' psyches. I myself was often creeped out. Additionally, this book seeks to answer every question that's come up in the series with very tangible metaphysical/sci-fi explanations. It was really fascinating to see how the author envisioned her world being created, (I have so much respect for her creativity), but there were frequent info dumps that left me more confused than I started. One twist, in particular, felt like it was added a little late for my taste. Plus, sometimes it's nice for fantasy to stay unexplained, y'know?And while the last third was indeed dramatic and action-filled, I'd hoped for more involvement from the cast of important side characters that had been slowly growing throughout the series.The ending also wrecked me a little. When you love a series so much, short, bittersweet/ambiguous epilogues are never going to cut it. *Cries forever* these characters deserve happiness.All that being said, I still found things to love about this book, and I don't think I would say the author let me down. Every single interaction between Ophélie and Thorn was truly beautifully written. Dabos wrote the transition from dislike, to respect, to fondness, to love between them in this series  so well , without sacrificing/changing any of the characters' true natures. And with characters so complex, that's not easy to do. And of course, there's the world. I've said this before, but Christelle Dabos' world-building is unparalleled. I have never read anything like this series. The blend of imagery between old fantasy (magic, illusions, nobles, balls), classic steampunk (dirigibles, telegrams, trains, mad inventors), and sci-fi (psych wards, robots, utopian metropolises with totalitarian governments) is a bold choice, but Dabos executes the balance perfectly, and create a mesmerizing world like no other. I have infinite respect for her, and love for this series (her début!), and I hope she continues on to write more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,112,1,"Feb 06, 2020","Feb 15, 2020","Feb 11, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32903085-la-temp-te-des-chos

There were less clearcut mini-adventures than the others, but I straight up cackled at the story with Rollings Baking Powder and I appreciated finally having more interactions with Gilbert. Speaking of which, I've heard a lot of fawning over Gilbert Blythe as the ideal literary romance interest, but what I've come to understand is that a great part of that is due to the adaptations.

While TRC had had charming, whimsical, (at times) creepy, quiet, small-town, and overall timeless vibes, this book was more in the vein of action/secret government organizations/sci-fi style superpowers/mysterious syndicates/big cities/magical night markets/spies. Certainly more modern feeling and a little more glamourous. I can't say I like this style as much as TRC, but it was still very fun to read. And I'm happy the shift in style occurred; it means this new trilogy's place won't be as a weird attachment to TRC, but rather as its own thing entirely.

So I was thoroughly annoyed that this moment was stolen from me by them casually referring to each other as husband and wife in their narrations from the very beginning. Like, in my mind, there's no version of that title that doesn't hold some degree of affection. *cue John Mulaney voice* ""That's my wife!!""2) The French. Omg as a French person this was very very annoying. The author did her research on insults sure, but not on names because I frankly don't even know how you would pronounce ""Reid"" or ""Diggory"" in French - and since there's no mention of any other country, it just makes no sense. Also ""Lou"" is not at all a male name??3) The casual swearing. Like get that fantasy must have swearing, but it was done in a very modern feeling way? Idk the tone was weird.

That seems like a bad foundation for government - especially coming from 500-year-old wisemen.

Which meant only one female warrior, a whole lot of harassment, and a dash of unfortunate love triangle rivalry between girls. I felt like the author couldn't commit to making Helene a good person, having her be pro-slavery, thus keeping Elias as the only decent soul. It would have been much more interesting to see her  want  to help change things, but disagree about how to do it - and be willing to commit terrible actions as a means to achieve a larger purpose.

But this book was.... ok fine, a  little bit  of a hot mess too. But it's also so much more! It's been a while since I finished it, but here are a couple things that I appreciated:1) The world expanding. As I just said, the expansion of this world into multiple parallel universes was kind of a lot. But it was also really interesting and captivating to read about these other worlds and how they fit together. 2) Tying up all the plot holes and questions. Taylor really committed to taking every question we had leftover from the first book, and answering them! This usually doesn't happen, or at least not so seriously, and I liked how the answers were more or less threaded throughout the story. 3) And FINALLY, perhaps the most important: the treatment of trauma, revenge, redemption, and forgiveness. What I love about Lazlo, and this book, is that he was never willing to give up on a person and resort to violence. Despite everything he and the people he cares about have been through, he doesn't carry anger and bitterness, and instead fights so hard for peace (without making any rash love-based decisions!) This idea, that anyone can be forgiven, may sound cheesy or overly optimistic, but I think it's so well done in this book where so much messed up stuff has happened. Every side carries so much anger and guilt and self-hatred, which are very real emotions, for very real things that happen in life. It's so important to me that this young adult book displays how recovery from this kind of pain is possible without  needing  to have any casualties.

Of course part of the point was to display how Autism doesn't define someone as ""different"" and people can live functional lives, not even aware themselves about this aspect of them.

I was never emotionally invested in their quests. Thinking back, it was probably because most of the characters, including the MCs are pretty one-dimensional (loyal, headstrong, brave, and determined are all top qualifiers for Ead, Loth, and Tané) and their motivations weren't interesting enough to compel me to care. Overall, the story just felt very plot-driven as opposed to character-driven. And I don't think a plot-driven story is fundamentally bad. But for every action sequence and mystery solved, there were 10 more pages of downtime in which nothing was happening. Some of that was an exposition on the various countries, cultures, history, and legends, and some of that was just random scenes that felt unnecessary and boring.

I think the first book was paced better and the plot arc and twists impressed me more, but that doesn't mean I'm not super excited for book 3!

I absolutely loved how well this book blends elements of a traditional fairytale into a complex and developed plotline. Everything from the three questions to the three tasks, to hopping through mirrors, to ""good"" people disguised as monsters, made me feel like I was reading a real fairytale, and still, it was so much more than that. I LOVED all three of the main characters; Miryem, Wanda, and Irina. They were all just so  smart . It is sooo refreshing to have brave and clever young women who don't make rash decisions and jump into dangerous situations out of misguided heroism. They aren't just defiant for the sake for being contrary. (unlike what I remember from Uprooted's Agnieszka). Everything they do is to protect themselves and their loved ones. The balance was just a little wonky: I felt like Wanda deserved more of her own plot, and I wanted Irina to have a section in the epilogue  so badly , but overall the story felt well put together. I know some people were bothered by the multiple perspectives, but I thought it was well done. And the winter! Reading this book up in a cottage Mount Shasta after a day's hiking in the snowy woods made me feel utterly transported. Near the middle, I was a little concerned that the book was following the same path as Uprooted, in terms of romance, which bothered me. A lot. BUT, somehow, as the story progressed and things made more and more sense, the characters in question won my heart over. I honestly don't know how Novik did it! Granted, Miryem's ending could have gone in another direction and I would've been fine, but Irina's was so beautiful *cries,* I really wanted that epilogue.

The drama is there, but it’s not unwarranted or unnecessary. There’s romance, but it doesn’t feel like utter wish fulfillment. There are REAL and nice friendships that develop. Also the description of school is very on point - not only the adults, but also the interaction between students. I like that there is less of an “us vs them” mentality than other teen books. Many of those books tend to portray popular kids as evil and dumb, whereas in my experience, people are way more complicated and interesting than that. I think Emma Mills captures this.

And there are some adaptations I love  because  of how cleverly they put the all original plot points and characters in a different context (like the Lizzie Bennet Diaries). But this book somehow tried to do both at once, and it didn't really work for me. It is equal part ""girl in Bushwick Brooklyn who loves her family and neighborhood is trying to get into college"" and ""let's try to recreate the entire plot of Pride and Prejudice.""The combination of these two stories, while it seems like it should work, really didn't for me. Both pulled attention and detail away from the other. I did like seeing how all the P&P characters fit into this scenario. But, because the author set the story up to be  exactly  like P&P, it meant that when the plot started to go in a very different direction, it felt very wrong. And many of the most important themes of Pride and Prejudice (about pride!! and prejudice!!) felt over lightly brushed over. Meanwhile, the whole discussion of the ""hood"" felt somewhat heavy-handed. The MC's poetry was amazing, and there were some great themes about community and identity and familial love, but because so much time was dedicated to the romance, these parts felt brief and lacked subtlety.In the end, the romance felt underdeveloped, and I honestly think it could have been tossed (along with the P&P adaptation element).

Also, I know romance in movies is unrealistic, but for some reason, it annoys me more in book form. ""The Hating Game"" had a lot of this, hence my love-hate relationship with it.

There is still a whole lot of cuteness, and it definitely produced the warm-fuzzy feelings that I was looking for. So yay!

I mean, other than the fact that literally every hot boy is in love with the MC, her life seems normal, and domestic in a nostalgic sort of way. She bakes cookies, and watched movies with family, and makes references to the Sound of Music (I loved that). She's just a girl living her life, and it's relaxing to read about. Also, personally I find her relationship with romance to be high key relatable so there's that.But the boy drama is a little much for me. In both books, but especially this one. I'm not a fan of love triangles where any outcome is possible and there is the drama of ""choice."" It's just boring and mildly stressful. Also, I don't think the author did a good job of making it clear how much Peter was number one for her. I mean, I knew it in my head because of the third book synopsis, but I didn't feel it in the pages. She seemed a lot more into John Ambrose. Also, I do have a complaint here: (view spoiler)[ The idea is that Lara Jean needed to accept that she hurt Gen and that Peter was just friends with Gen, and Gen needed him to support her. Now in principle, I understand that one should be able to support their emotionally unstable ex if they are needed. HOWEVER, Gen is toxic AF. She did so much shit, to Lara Jean, and to plenty of other girls. She severely damaged Lara Jean's reputation, even perhaps her future, and honestly, it's a miracle LJ didn't suffer long-term emotional health problems. If Peter feels the need to support Gen emotionally, fine! But it was super messed up of him to continuously defend her and lie when he knew she posted the video. Super messed up, and I really have a hard time forgiving him for that. I'm particularly annoyed about this since the TV show I recently binged featured an ex-friend/girlfriend of the main dude, and people kept excusing her utterly toxic actions on account of her heartbreak sadness. LIKE NO! Emotional problems do not excuse being a terrible person to others, and there are ways of supporting those kinds of people without forgiving them for everything.

(even though technically I don't think things moved any faster?)Many ers accurately call this book ""atmospheric."" You really feel transported to a chilly winter night in the Northern Russian Forests, where all sorts of magical events might take place in the context of everyday life. It also has the feel of a timeless Fairytale, something I love to see in modern literature. It simultaneously reminded me of Wildwood Dancing (which I love), Uprooted (which, unlike the rest of the world, I did not love) and The Raven Cycle (both have dark and eerie magic brewing in the forest).I really like Vasya, the MC. She's headstrong and ""wild"" but she doesn't make annoyingly dumb decisions in the name of bravery like many other YA protagonists who are considered fierce and rebellious. She's smart and resourceful and only puts herself in danger when it's absolutely necessary to protect her family. I'm curious to see where the series goes next. I have a feeling Morozko will become a love interest, which makes me very irritated (insert rant about young girls ending up with dudes who look young and hot, but are actually thousands of years old), but we'll just have to see.

I get that it's wartime and he could easily have died at any moment for the most random reasons, but this book gives fate such an  obvious  presence. I mean the number of random events that led Von Rumpel, Marie Laure and Werner to the same house that night was undoubtedly fateful. Destiny feels like a huge part of Werner's plotline, and his random ending so felt wrong to me. Also, I found his behavior after the war very frustrating and honestly difficult to believe. We spend about around 200+ pages watching Werner grow -- eventually leading to his meeting Marie Laure. That final night, he discovers what it means to live, to fight for what he believes in. We are so proud of him. But then we are expected to believe that Werner gives up on life after that night? That nothing else matters and there is no hope?? All that development, pages and pages of description, accumulated to  one night  and was then chucked out the window??? Idk it bothered me. I understand that it was necessary to bring Jutta in at the end, but her inclusion felt awkward to me. If she was going to be that important at the end, I feel like we should have seen more of her throughout the book.

There were a few things in the ending that bothered me, but we'll have to see if the sequel changes my mind about them. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 05, 2019","Jul 08, 2019","Jul 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28145767-strange-the-dreamer

It is emotional and long and joyous and heartbreaking all at once and I have not been let down. When I say it is about Life, I don't necessarily mean ""everyone lives, hooray!"" - I mean that it follows the lives of characters - and they are not necessarily perfectly plotted lives. It's hard to pinpoint a classic story arc in this book, and I know some would criticize it for this (including me at times), but ultimately, real life doesn't follow a story arc either, and so I can forgive this book for that. What it does give us is Character. And since the characters are arguably the best part of this series (although there is so much to love), this book absolutely shines. The interactions are incredible - every single one of them either hilarious, or ridiculously Dramatic, or painful, or terrifying (and sometimes all of those things once). I laughed and cried and really that's all I could hope for in this book. (Also the writing is just beautiful)I've been in this fandom since 2016 and I know many have been in it for the last 25 years. I can't believe that after years of waiting and theorizing and analyzing making art and memes, the series is finally over, but I know the fandom will continue to thrive for long after this date.

I read it all day on Sunday and until late at night, and in freaking Chem Lecture today (how do you find the most probable speed of a gas???IDK). And now I'm done, and I have so many thoughts: hmmmm.....First of all, everything is messy. The relationships between the various tribes is messy. Nahri and Ali's personal relationships are messy. The end is MESSY. And this is good and bad. It's good because it adds so much nuance to everything. For the reader, there is no comfortable side/tribe/person to root for. Everyone is flawed, every side has its horrible truths as well as its valid grievances. It really makes you look at everything from every single side. I would stop at saying the messiness was good, after all, it accurately represents the real, cutthroat dangerous world of court politics. However, as a reader it was exhausting! And the end is such a cliffhanger ugh. And so many secrets that are still hidden, so many miscommunications that have yet to be resolved. No me gusta. This is why I should only read standalones, or series that are already completed. Plot-wise, I was definitely not a fan of the desert road trip. I was mostly here for the court intrigue - which I luckily got a good dose of through Ali's chapters, and when Nahri finally gets herself to the city. Court intrigue, action-driven or not, turns out to be the thing that kept me reading so avidly this whole time (also waiting for Dara to be dumped, but I'll get to that later). Fair warning: there isn't a whole lot of action or even maybe plot, especially in the middle. I personally don't mind so much, but it could objectively be considered a flaw of the story. Let's talk characters:Nahri is a standard YA heroine. Spunky, and self-preserving, and independent and whatnot. I liked her as much as I like all the others, which is to say: fine. As I write this, I'm realizing that I wish we got to see more of her con/thief skills. They kind of just.... disappeared? Ali, on the other hand, fascinated me. I'm not sure I liked him better, he had so many problems with saying dumb things out of righteousness, and at times I wanted to roll my eyes, but it was that righteousness that made him so interesting. He's so conservative, so ""this is the right thing, this is the wrong thing,"" black and white, but with such good intentions. I feel like this kind of exceedingly moral, religious, and uptight personality is not one I usually see in YA. Other s mention that Ali's faith was supposed to represent the Muslim faith, but I didn't read into that metaphor. He just seemed very religious, and I understand why people are upset that this book is advertised as having Muslim representation. Especially since every other character makes fun of his religiousness. Now Dara. Dara, Dara, Dara. I was predisposed against him from the moment we found out that he was both handsome, and 1500 years old. If there is one romantic trope I cannot stand, it is ""young woman falls for old dude who looks young."" It's CREEEPY. (cough cough Uprooted cough The Hero and the Crown cough). I complained to multiple people about it (who indulged me despite never having the intention of reading this book). It turns out my instinct was right. I predicted something would happen, and it did (no spoilers). He is such an Archer (from Fire). He's volatile, overprotective, arrogant, and, like, won't let go of his prejudices against shafit????? Basically I don't want to see him again, but I doubt I'll get that wish. Note: I get it, people in the real world are flawed, but why does everyone in this book have to have some form of intolerance or straight up racism? I want to scream at people at their blindness for the neverending hatred and animosity they cause. ( This ties back to my personal dislike of messiness, can you tell I'm an escapist reader yet?)In my typical fashion, I've gone and given mostly complaints about a book I mostly liked. I'm mainly just annoyed at the unresolved ending right now. It makes me uncomfortable. But if anything, it successfully shows how attached I am to this book and these characters, that I'm so bothered by this ending to a fictional story. We shall have to see what the next book has in store.P.S.

A broad range of moral questions arises throughout the story and the reader is forced to consider everything from the responsibility of a creator towards their creation, to whether discrimination is inherently human. I appreciate how the novel makes us reflect on our views of society and scientific progress. Unfortunately, for all the time I spent considering these moral dilemmas, I spend an equal amount of time lamenting over how senseless Victor Frankenstein is. On many occasions, he shows great carelessness and lack of foresight regarding situations that he himself caused. And each time, instead of taking serious action, he only spends more time in tormented contemplation. Yes, yes, he supposed to a dark and dramatic hero, isolating himself from the world, tormented by regret and guilt. But would a little communication kill him? 	This could just be my modern perspective, but I feel as if many of the tragedies within this novel could have been avoided if Frankenstein had either been better at taking real action, or at communicating with his family and the creature....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Mar 04, 2018not set","Mar 25, 2018not set","Mar 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18490.Frankenstein

This was interesting in its own way, but I still found myself longing for a more traditional, captivating, plot arc.

Also the action. However, there's a reason it took me over two weeks to finish this book, and it's not just finals.1) The characters and relationships. Zelie was a strong, beautiful, and overall, well-developed character in my opinion. Her pain and anger at the world felt realistic and justifiable. Amari was a decent character as well (if not as intense and complex as Zelie) and the relationship between the two of them was cute. My problem is more with the guys. Tzain, in my opinion, was very one-dimensional: kind, strong, and protective boy who loves his sister. Maybe it's just because we didn't get his point of view, who knows. But Amari's relationship with him was boring to me.Inan just confused me so much. He goes through so many changes in this book, and I feel like the things that were supposed to make him complex actually just made him inconsistent. He just didn't feel real to me. I think he needed more and more careful development. (view spoiler)[ Also I would like to point out that doing something good out of love for ONE person doesn't make you automatically a good person (cough cough Snape). Maybe at the festival, he had admirable motivations, but later, all he cares about is saving Zelie, and that's not a good enough reason for me to like him.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ Saran's character felt pretty one dimensional as well. He completely trusts his son for most of the book, and they straight up tries to kill him with no hesitation??? Side note: did people really not sleep before a battle on purpose? That seems dumb to me.  (hide spoiler)]Inan's character brings me to point 2) the attempt at complexity in the novel. The whole discussion around magic and power and oppression is very relevant and very interesting. It's entirely true that if you bring back  immense power to an oppressed people, the bloodshed will be intense. Even without years of oppression, giving magic to some people and not others is a recipe for inequality and abuse of power. I appreciate that they brought this issue up in the novel, but each time a character had doubts about bringing magic back, someone else would address the concern as either relatively insignificant or flat out wrong. In the end: the only right opinion was to bring magic up. In general, while the book did in some ways address the complexity of the characters, humanity, and magic, it fell a little short each time, and the result felt a little messy and rushed. Which leads me to point 3) pacing. I just felt like the plot went a little too fast. The characters needed more time to grow and learn. If anything, they needed a more realistic amount of time to process or recover from the intense trauma they go through. (view spoiler)[ I'm talking Amari losing her best friend and Zelie being tortured -- damn they turned it around fast  (hide spoiler)]. Despite all this, I did have a fun time reading this book, and I still have hope for future installments in the series.

Overall it was a fun read, and I intend to read the next in the series. However, nearly everything I liked about it can be attributed to its glaring similarities to The Thief by Meghan Whalen Turner. The MC, Sage, is basically Gen, so of course I liked him. We also have our Magus, our Sophos and Ambiades, and even a Pol. The plot is different, but the twist is the same (and quite predictable after having read The Thief).Perhaps as standalone novel, I would prefer this novel to the The Thief. But the writing does not hold a candle to that of the Queen's Thief series in its entirety. In fact, I'm a little annoyed that this book it better known than The Queen's Thief series, which deserves far more recognition than it currently has.I guess I have to see if the next books rise to the occasion....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 26, 2017","Dec 26, 2017","Dec 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12432220-the-false-prince

Everything, from temperamental cheeses to dangerously quirky cartographers, was delightfully introduced and never failed to surprise me. Throughout, Hardinge does an amazing job at at balancing the hilarity of the world with the deeper aspects of the story. The richly built world was my favorite part, but everything else was wonderful too. Though Neverfell's initial crazy decisions irked me, I could understood why she took them, and I grew to love her quality of being ""just a bit mad."" Also, unlike other books, I rarely felt like I knew more than the main character did (which can often be frustrating).The plot is very well paced, taking the reader on many turns while Neverfell discovers the different parts of Caverna and unravels its many mysteries. I wouldn't call this book a page turner (except at the end), but I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent reading it.

Exactly the kind of court drama/intrigue I was looking for at the moment. The romance was cute and very fun to read, with unsurprising similarities to P&P. However, I remain ever so slightly bothered by the fact that the MC’s love interest lacked serious flaws. As with many Darcy-inspired characters, I liked him a lot, but he wasn’t very real.

I love it when the charming narrator uses the second person to speak to the reader. I love seeing how creative authors can get with their made-up worlds, especially in the context of a ""nonsense"" setting, where not everything needs to make perfect sense. Also, children's books are just comforting to me. What made this book unique, however, is Mafi's beautiful writing. She uses such detailed and rich imagery, and even though the genre is clearly a Middle-Grade Fantasy, some lines felt very mature and reminiscent of magical realism, such as one of my favorites:  Alice and Mother did their best in the wake of Father's absence, but some evenings all the unspoken hurts piled high on their plates and they ate sorrow with their syrup without saying a word about it.  I would definitely recommend this book to any child. My only complaint is that the ending was resolved much too quickly, and the climax didn't feel nearly as climactic as I had hoped it would.

This series still features all the great things I talk about below, but in the bigger picture, I'm able to see that all three books have slightly messy plots and somewhat funky pacing. It's also... just not that deep. BUT. depth is certainly NOT a requirement for FUN! and this series is still very fun. I love Jude and her beautiful messed-up faerie world, and while I wouldn't necessarily give any of the individual books 5 stars, the series as a WHOLE gets 5 stars for making me super excited while reading it even 5 years later. ---4.5 Reading this book while sick, I realized I was starting to drift further and further away from any care about the plot or characters. This is why I decided to put it down for a while and come back to the last 30 pages with a clear mind. So it is with a clear mind that I can say I REALLY enjoyed this book. It had basically everything I want from a book: multifaceted female characters, an interesting world, Court Intrigue (!), magic (!!), sword fights (!!!), fancy parties with fancy dresses and ballroom dancing(!!!!), and of course, a non-cringeworthy dash of romance.  The detailed world of faerie revels and enchanted forests reminded me of Wildwood Dancing, which is to say it was wonderfully beautiful and creepy at the same time. Jude, the main character, is admirably determined, and as we discover, rather ruthless. In fact, all the characters have a pretty significant dark side. This is no innocent fairytale, where the heroes escape bruised but with clean consciences. This is story about staying alive in a treacherous court, and that comes with moral sacrifice. Usually the fairytale books I read are more of the former type, and I was shocked to stumble upon such brutal actions in a fairyland, but by the end I thought it created some deeply interesting characters and motives. As for the plot, it goes in several directions. I never quite knew what was going to happen next, and the end certainly managed to surprise me! My one complaint is about a certain character who just… you think she’s cool and then she just turns out to be just plain…. annoying. She makes one decision and instantly loses so much credibility. It was frustrating and felt unrealistic. I’m not sure exactly how I originally found about this book, (I think Megan Whalen Turner read and recommended it) but I’ve been waiting for it for months. I’m glad it was worth the hype, and I’m excited to see where Holly Black goes with the next installment....more",Notes are private!,0,4,2,"Feb 2023Jan 21, 2018","Feb 02, 2023Jan 29, 2018","Jun 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26032825-the-cruel-prince

The same classic Penderwick humor was featured in this book, and I often found myself smiling or laughing while reading. It's hard for me to give a Penderwicks novel anything less than four stars. Still, there's a reason I didn't like this book as much as the first three, and even fourth. Firstly, maybe it's just because I'm older now, but I didn't find Lydia or her entourage to be particularly interesting. There were humorous moments sure, but nothing came close to being as wild and entertaining as the dynamics between Skye, Jane, Jeffrey, Rosalind or even Tommy. In addition, there wasn't much of a plotline. Like at all. No conflict. I don't expect Penderwick books to have serious drama, but the other books still did a good job of slowly unraveling little mysteries and having a growing story arc, as well as character development. This book was mostly Lydia just hanging out. Plus, the whole build up is to the wedding (which I have to say, after witnessing the planning involved in a real wedding, was waaaay too relaxed), we don't even get to see the wedding!It was supposed to be, in my mind, a big shabang ending, except there was no big shabang. And we didn't get closure with most of the old characters. The other thing that drove me crazy is way more personal to me, but I still feel the need to rant. (view spoiler)[ The first three books seriously hinted at a future relationship between Skye and Jeffrey. So much so that I, as well as many other fans of the book, were very very frustrated to see it diminished in the fourth book, and totally dropped in the last book. I know this is supposed to be a modern retelling of Little Women, and Laurie doesn't end up with Jo, and instead marries her sister, but that doesn't make it any less weird! why would a girl want to be with someone who was in love with her sister????? Even though I haven't read it, I know many people are upset about that in Little Women too. I wanted to be happy for Skye and Batty but the whole situation just felt very strange. Especially since we never even got to meet Skye's boyfriend for real. We know absolutely nothing about him other than the fact he's Czech. Skye has always been my favorite sister, and instead of getting to see her relationship with Jeffrey develop, I have to watch her marry some rando. We don't even get to see her talk to Jeffrey as a friend. One could argue: Rosalind is already marrying Tommy (speaking of which we didn't get see him at all!) to and two childhood romances is too unrealistic. Except, the same could be said for Batty and Jeffrey! Apparently Batty is supposed to be perfect for Jeffrey because they both share a passion for music, but since when does that automatically make people perfect for each other? Maybe if you started with this book, you would be fine with the new ""chemistry"" between Jeffrey and Batty, but in the context of the other four books, it's just plain weird.

I had remembered disliking the end of this book in particular (hence the original three stars) but I found that I wasn't so upset anymore this time round. Rating this series is tricky because while I would probably consider one of my favorites of YA fantasy, I didn't feel a strong 5-star level emotional connection to any individual of the books this time reading. If I had to pick a favorite it'd be a tie between 2 & 3, maybe 4?? (idk I do like them a lot) Overall, I give this series a 4.5 Some of my favorite things:- the beautiful imagery of the forest and the south - I want to spend time in Virginia now- Book 2 chapters about the Gray Man- Book 3 chapters about Colin and Piper Greenmantle- The Barns- Henry Cheng (and the specific scene in Book 4 where Henry pulls up in front of Blue's school, and she has to pretend to yell at him to save face, and then right after Gansey drives up... just cinematic gold)- The slow progression of romance through the books (like it's barely there in 1 & 2 - and in those books, the foreshadowing for Ronan is done very very well)- 300 Fox way.- Blue's character skating the line between sassy-girl-with-only-male-friends-stereotype and a realistically flawed teenage girl and ending up on the right side.And in fact, there's not much to dislike. The whole series is very well written.

The plot is slow, we stay in the same place for a while, and there is none of the glamor associated with the games (oh and of course it's just plain sad). That being said, I think it's still a really strong ending to the series. All that time spent not on the action is focused on Katniss's traumatized psychological state and it feels both realistic and important. It's so ironic how many books tried to replicate this series with a young female protagonist while completely missing the point that is so emphasized in this book: Katniss isn't all-powerful and cool and smart. She's just a damaged teenager who is used and directed by older people with more political savvy. And that's what makes her character so interesting. Spoilers below (view spoiler)[ I think when I read this in middle school I did not really care that much about Prim's death? Probably because I knew it was coming, (thank's Sophia) and because I thought Finnick's was much worse (it still is...just awful). This reread though, I really saw how important Prim was and how tragic her death truly is. I think this change goes along with my overall lower interest in the romance. It just feels so besides the point? Also, while I still find Gale's interest in killing civilians upsetting, I don't really hate him anymore. So there's that.

I remember when the movie started getting all the hype in middle school and all people talked about Peeta vs Gale. (I also remember feeling superior about the fact I had read the books months before everyone else, but oh well)Since then, The Hunger Games has not really occupied much of my mind (at least considering how obsessed with it I was back then), but I did remember it was a very well built dystopia with accurate and important social commentary (in comparison to nearly every other series that tried to recreate its success). I'm happy to say that it has not let me down and that the reread was just as simultaneously engaging and emotional as when I was eleven. One thing I find super interesting is the reader's experience of the story. As readers, we are Katniss, angry at the capitol and heartbroken over her losses and the unfairness of it all. And yet at the same time, the book itself is a form of entertainment, where we are hooked on the plot of the games and how she will win them - so in a way, we are also the Capitol. THG is one of the most read books on GoodReads, and say what you will about people only focusing on the love triangle (which I do wish was less emphasized in the books), I think most people who read it will come out with some degree of self-reflection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Sep 19, 2020not set","Sep 19, 2020Sep 2011","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games

Kristin Cashore really said ""I'm going to write a book about a nation recovering from collective trauma"" and then went and did it. It's so unlike most YA fantasy out there and I can see how it's not everyone's cup of tea. For one, it's messy. There so many characters in the main cast and so many little mysteries that build up, that it's pretty hard to keep track of everything. And the story is also messy, not really following a classic plot in any way. But for me, that messiness is what makes it so realistic and so interesting.  How  do  societies rebuild after an era of oppression and trauma is suddenly concluded? How do people move forward, when nothing can bring back the loved ones they lost, and their search for the truth behind these losses is repressed by the new ""better"" government? It's so complicated, and I understand why many fantasy books skip over these issues, and yet it's clear Cashore did her research because these questions are relevant to real historical events. The other thing is that this book is  very  dark. A giant content warning for recurring mentions of rape, suicide, self-harm, torture, and domestic abuse. That being said, it never feels as though Kristin Cashore just drops these additions in for shock value. The whole motivation behind it is for Bitterblue to understand and cope with the trauma she and those around her have been through, and they actually address how upsetting it is for Bitterblue to discover these things. On the flip side, there is so much love and light in the story. I live for Katsa and Po's ridiculous antics, for the dialogue between our old friends Raffin, Bann, Giddon, and Helda. And I love Death and Madlen and Teddy and Saf, and everyone else who joins the circle of people that Bitterblue can trust throughout this book. It's a story about healing, of a nation, and of a young (superpower-less) girl who is just trying so hard to do right by her people. It's a beautiful conclusion to the trilogy (which isn't a trilogy anymore but I guess we'll see how I feel about Winterkeep). --Spoiler---(view spoiler)[ Ok literally how did I not remember how big of a character Giddon is in this story? I think the first time I read it, I didn't even pay attention to him at all, then the second time I remember vaguely thinking, oh huh maybe the end indicates some closeness between Bitterblue and Giddon. This time though I was shocked by how big a presence he has, and how obvious it seems that the book hinting at a future romance. The promise that she'll never lie to him?? At one point Giddon takes Bitterblue (and Helda and Bann) sledding to cheer her up???? I'm so surprised I forgot all these things. Anyways, two chapters into Winterkeep it's very obvious now that that is the direction we're going, and I guess I can really see it now.

I've realized that I'm just a sucker for books with themes of all-around love. Not just love between lovers, but also between friends, and real family, and found family. And also the kind that is complicated and makes no sense: the love people have for those that have hurt them, and those that have hurt others. The royal family in this book is so messy and torn up by awful events from the past, and yet they love each other so much, and their dynamics are wonderful to read. I'm also just a huge fan of good world-building, court intrigue, palaces, and balls so this really checks all the boxes for me :)Despite the fact that not much happens plot-wise in the first half, I really think it would make a great GOT-style TV show, with some added side plots (maybe intertwined with the Graceling story). The world and the characters are so well developed and the story is a good mix of gritty and beautiful (though definitely not as dark as GOT - which I think is a good thing). Anyways, I know it will never happen, but I like to dream about it. Interesting note: In the third book, Fire and the rest of the Dellians are described as dark-skinned and people, including myself, were skeptical of this sudden detail being added so late. However, after a close reading this time, it seems it might not have a late addition after all. The only times Fire describes people's skin color is to explicitly say that the Pikkians' pallor differentiates them from Dellians and that Leck is notably light-skinned - just as a book narrated by white people might only mention the color of people darker than them. Archer being blond, and the first edition cover of Fire certainly add to the confusion around this. With the common reader mentality of defaulting to white characters, it's pretty easy to initially read the book imagining everyone as white, so perhaps she should have been more clear (as the new cover of  Fire  does), but I do think there's enough in the text to claim she didn't quite retcon the diversity in  Bitterblue ....more",Notes are private!,0,4,4,"Jan 19, 2021Oct 07, 2017Nov 22, 2014not set","Jan 22, 2021Oct 08, 2017Nov 23, 2014Jan 2012","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6137154-fire

It sets a strong foundation for the complex themes that are explored in later books, all the while following a relatively straightforward plot. It's fast-paced and exciting, but of course, where Cashore really shines is with her characters and relationships - also bonus points go to her absolutely terrifying(ly accurate) depiction of power abusers.There is so much Katsa hate in s (see later for a long description of why this makes me mad), but I love her and I think she really does read as an 18-year-old - albeit an incredibly powerful one. Her journey to finding agency in her life and reconciling who she wants to be with what she has done (a theme throughout all these books) feels real and important. And I love watching her relationships with Po and Bitterblue develop, as she learns the reaches of her power are ultimately limited by how much she can protect those she loves. I also just take a moment to shout out Kristin Cahsore's blog, where she shares her stories about making a literal library costume for Halloween ,  going to the arctic sea on a program for artists  (a trip I now know was for Winterkeep research!),  the reality behind in her fictional villains , and many other random things! Ok here's my moment to complain a bit (or a lot oops):On Goodreads, I've seen a large number of s that heavily criticize the portrayal of Katsa's attitude towards femininity and marriage. This book definitely does have flaws, and Kristin Cashore has written about of things she wishes she had done differently, but as for it this particular brand of criticism, I am tIrED of it.Katsa hates dresses, and swears that she will never marry. She doesn't want children, and she prefers to cut her hair short. ""Wow what a feminist book! - look at all these gender norms being defied!!!!"" the advertisers say, ""Katsa is a modern hero! A true role model for young girls!"" Incorrect! And many many people have already written long paragraphs about how going against gender norms does not inherently make a book feminist.  But here's where they go too far.  People act like Katsa's views on these things reflect a broader moral view of what girls should and shouldn't do. As if Katsa saying ""I won't ever feel free if I marry"" is supposed to imply a judgement on girls who  do  want to marry. First of all  nowhere  in the text does Katsa judge other women or their choices. She only know what her own experience is. And if you consider that this takes place in a high fantasy medieval world, she's not  that  out of touch with reality. Because yes, in that context, it doesn't matter how loving and fair and honest your husband is - at the end of the day, the law will judge that you are his property. So to apply her views to a modern context seems ridiculous. Second of all, even if we  did  judge her words in a modern context, it still wouldn't be #problematic. She's eighteen and entirely fictional, and grew up in traumatizing circumstances. Authors are not obligated to have their protagonists portray a perfect and nuanced worldview. Cashore was clearly not trying to tell young girls to never get married or wear pretty dresses (just look at the next two books)!In the end, Graceling is not a feminist book simply because the protagonist is a badass girl fighter who crushes the patriarchy. But it is a feminist book because it tells the story of one brave and flawed young woman, and gives her room to learn and grow from these flaws. Her perspective might be different than yours or mine, but that doesn't diminish the value of telling her story....more",Notes are private!,0,2,3,"Jan 16, 2021Nov 17, 2014not set","Jan 19, 2021Nov 21, 2014Jan 2012","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3236307-graceling

And so I thought I knew exactly how I felt about this story and its characters. But of course, I was wrong, and I'm so happy I got to see this from a new light. There were some things that bothered me more so than in adaptations, the primary one being Mr. Knightley. I think he's great (far more of a real person than Darcy) and he and Emma's relationship development is still cute, but this book  kept on  emphasizing the age difference! Especially in the way he treats her as if he were a mentor. And he's a good dude, but he's literally always right in this book, and so the whole idea is that he's much wiser than her due to age. I would've liked to see more flaws, and I think some adaptations go about it slightly better. But the shining star of this book for me was Emma herself and how  so relatable  she is, particularly regarding: 1. Her long bouts of introspection where she sits down with herself after something has happened, and debriefs it all, and doesn't stop until she understands how she feels about it, and why. 2. Her rational approach to emotional subjects (like love and marriage) and how she doesn't understand how other people aren't similarly rational. 3. The mixture of both indignance and mortification she feels when being reprimanded for anything small or big. (Also she nearly calls out sexism a few times which is great)Emma is certainly very flawed: some of the time I felt called out, and some of the time I myself was frustrated with her. But overall, she is outwardly composed and put together in a way that doesn't quite transfer in film...Which brings me back to the adaptations, because I barely relate to Emma at all in them. And I think it's because so much of Emma's character is narrated from her mind, and her judgemental nature, while still mean in the book, appears even worse on screen, where she has to say everything she is thinking out loud for the viewers to understand. Due to her having to overtly talk badly of people, she is conveyed as more of a fake person than I believe her originally to be. Also Gwyneth and Romola, and Alicia, add a bit of caricature ridiculousness to her, which is very comedic and entertaining, but not quite how I picture her (Romola's version basically removes all dignity and composure, and exchanges it for a childish giddiness and eagerness that I thought was a bit much- but also pretty funny). ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Oct 2019,"Oct 06, 2019","Jan 04, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36252851-emma

As was customary in our friendship, Sophia got to read it first (only logical choice since she would read it faster than me), and I remember her handing it to me afterward and warning me that the reunion didn't happen. Alas!Anyways, I stand by my statement that Heroes of Olympus, while it has a lovable cast of characters, does not match the quality of the original series.

Also in this  I will pretty much only be rambling about spoilery drama so I guess this whole  is a spoiler. (view spoiler)[Where do I even BEGIN with Percy's love life omg. First of all: the immediate thing to address is his age. He is FOURTEEEN AHAHHAHHA and this adds so much important context. As a smol 10 year old, Mathilde did not pick up of the absurdity of some of the things that happen in this book. (For example, I do not buy for AN INSTANT that Calypso, a gorgeous immortal goddess is falling for Percy. Nuh-uh. It was actually so funny to me, until I remembered that she comes back as an actual feasible love interest in HoO.)So I guess let's start with Percy's whole attitude. After coming from more YA/Romance/Fanfiction type of narratives, it is So Funny to read from Percy's POV because he is absolutely clueless in the romance department. He doesn't even know what he wants, which makes him an incredibly unreliable narrator. Instead of descriptions of yearning, we get lines like ""for some reason, my face was really red"". This is hilarious to me, and a good example of show-not-tell. But also it's like wow! children will really take absolute crumbs of dialogue and RUN with them. Percabeth was pretty much my OTP back in those years (aside from HP couples) and I read and re-read every single interaction that even mildly suggested something of romance in these books and ate them all up. But in actuality, it's also a little strange to read back on. Because while young Mathilde was all ""la-la-la Percabeth 4eva it's meant to be!!! True love!!!"", older Mathilde is like ""damn, this 14-year-old boy actually did  not  know what he wanted at ALL.""To use ~official~ language, there is evidence in the text to suggest that Percy was nearly just as romantically interested in Rachel and Calypso as he was in Annabeth. Now, this is perfectly alright and realistic for a 14-year-old, but my current self feels just a touch betrayed? Like I wanted more indulgent proof that Percabeth was actually was the only valid ship. I think I just have high standards for my young self's champion couple. To build on this, the end of the book is also SAD! He spent ALL the rest summer ""skirting"" around Annabeth, and now I'm thinking this is 1 of of 3 summers of friendship when they just aren't hanging out  (hide spoiler)]...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Feb 21, 2022not set","Feb 22, 2022Mar 2010","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2120932.The_Battle_of_the_Labyrinth

Back then, it consumed so much real estate in my brain. It was basically Harry Potter and Percy Jackson from ages 10 - 12. My friends and I had so many in-depth make-believe games revolving around these worlds (I was , of course,  always a daughter of Athena), and they'd take up every minute of our sleepovers, lunch breaks and recesses.So it's actually pretty funny that, considering my favorable feelings towards rereads, I am only returning to these books 12 years later. I'd been meaning to do a reread since the show was announced but over winter break I started listening to The Newest Olympian  and I thought ""now seems a good a time as ever""*. I made it through the first book's recap in the podcast, so I actually did not reread this particular book (went straight to #2). I'm just about to start #5, but I don't like only leaving s in the middle of series. So I am introducing my thoughts here.Now for the actual . The Percy Jackson series is excellent. Am I biased? yes. But does my 22-year-old, capable-of-critically-analysing-literature, self still approve? yes. I truly believe that these books hold up and I would definitely recommend them. The narratorial tone is consistent and funny, and the incorporation of greek myths into the 21st century (although sometimes a tough inaccurate) is creatively executed. Ultimately it's also just a series full of magic, wonder, and heart which are the themes I was raised on, and will always fall for. I can't wait to introduce them to the next generation!*Funny that Mike Schubert's podcasts are the reason for my 2018 HP re-read and now my 2022 PJO re-read - the two series that most shaped my young years, and also that I had chosen not to reread for years. Maybe when something consumes your life for so long you don't feel the need to re-read?...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jan 2010,"Jan 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28187.The_Lightning_Thief

Maybe it was because there was too much time for me to forgetWell.I didn't get into this book as much I as did for the others during my #4-#7 reread. Maybe it was because there was too much time for me to forget about Harry Potter while I waited for the #7 library ebook. Or maybe it's because I just prefer the setting of Hogwarts for the books, where mystery and magic and adventure mix into relatable school life, with friends and jokes and good times. It's probably a combination of both. BUT, I still think the final battle of Hogwarts and everything that occurs in it was a fantastic ending to such a long and impactful series. Everything comes full circle. We see all the characters together, our favorite old characters, but after 7 seven years of growth, all developed into brave and smart people (cough cough Neville). Yes, it was 2:30 am and I did terribly on my math midterm, but it's still saying something that the scene with the stone in the forest made me cry. Few books really make me cry; I don't think I even cried the first time I read the series at 10 years old. The way Harry describes death as he comes to terms with facing it felt real and powerful, especially considering the close deaths that have just occurred. (view spoiler)[ And seeing the Marauders + Lily, together and young again, never truly coming back (LUPIN! *cries forever*), but nonetheless guiding Harry to his end. So many emotions!  (hide spoiler)] Also Harry's final duel speech is pretty freaking amazing.A lot of people have complaints about the 19 years later chapter, and I see their point. The whole name thing is a little weird (see my note at the end)* and the jump feels strange overall. But I still think the chapter is entirely necessary. After 7 books, 10 years, and probably thousands of pages, I think the Harry Potter readers needed some sense of closure. I know I did. Even  with  the epilogue, and even after having spent the last 8 years of my life discussing Harry Potter, and watching musicals and, yes I admit it, reading fanfiction, I still closed the book (or rather my kindle) at 3:10 am with the feeling of ""...well what now?"" We really go through an emotional journey with these characters, which speaks to the importance of this series, and it's really no surprise that it feels shocking for it to end.** I am so thankful for the  Potterless podcast  for causing me to relive the magic of this entire series, and motivating me to actually re-read the books! This podcast is also probably the only reason I'm not in total shock after finishing the last book. I'm comforted by the idea that the podcast will eventually get to the end, and I can go over everything again, hopefully with more closure. I was reading this series from my grandparent's house in Brittany, to my aunt's cottage in Dordogne, to my college dorm. Thank you, J.K. for making me feel all the feels, even 8 years later. *(view spoiler)[I get Albus (despite his problematic aspects) but Severus is pushing it a little. Snape had redeeming qualities, but he was still a terribly mean person (Hermione's teeth, book 4) and overall a bad teacher. I get that Harry might have wanted to represent those who will be forgotten by others, with no ties to the world, but still... Snape literally only did good stuff for ONE person and didn't care about hurting others (hide spoiler)]**And yes it ends there. The Cursed Child was terrible and will never be recognized by me as real.

I think I'll just have to settle for loving them both equally. Some more raving about Kel. As many s have already captured, Kel shines as a protagonist because she doesn't have any special magical powers, nor is she fated by the Gods for great things. She makes herself  into a hero through her poise, determination, intelligence, and pure grit. This makes her such a powerful role model - her strength (both morally and physically) may put the rest of us to shame, but that doesn't mean we can't strive to embody it.* Also, shout out to Kel for being the only female protagonist in a fantasy novel who is allowed to have crushes that develop and fade with time and don't have to mean anything in the Grand Scheme of the Plot. Let teens have meaningless crushes in fantasy! Finally, a note on Tortall as whole. It is so cool to see how the country changes between Alanna's generation and Kel's generation. It's still the same country (and there is a lot of character overlap), but Tamora Pierce does such a good job at subtly showing how Tortall's politics, traditions, and public attitudes have shifted over the course of Jon and Thayet's reign.*The only thing I don't necessarily aim to strive for to is Kel's desire to participate in real combat (it's a no for me), but you gotta let the Lady Knights do their thing....more",Notes are private!,0,2,4,"Mar 03, 2024Mar 31, 2018Oct 12, 2014Feb 2012","Mar 05, 2024Apr 08, 2018Oct 17, 2014Feb 2012","Jan 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153795.Squire

Very beautiful writing and I love reading from Enna's point of view. See below for some spoiler-y analysis! P.S. I noticed that I also re-read this Sept/Oct my first year of college and I think that's some beautiful symmetry.(view spoiler)[ The first time I read this book (age 12), I distinctly remember feeling doubt about Enna's romantic outcome. All the time she was in captivity I was thinking to myself ""is this an enemies to lovers plotline?"" and being pretty uncomfy with it since I liked Finn so much. Of course, I was later reassured, and every reread since then, I've been like ""duh! of course she wouldn't end up with Sileph!"" - but even so I always reflect on this aspect of the story. I've come to the conclusion that Hale's writing excels in two ways here. (1) She does a good job at making Sileph seem like an empathetic character at the beginning, while also dropping subtle hints about his true nature. This creates some good suspense/mystery - we love a little bit of uncertainty in a book. Upon reflection, I don't think my 12 year old self was that dumb for wondering if this romance was endgame. (2) (this is the one that aged VERY well). She portrays a version of stockholm syndrome mixed with romance that is SUPER popular in YA novels - and then  shows us why it's messed up . This popularity has grown through the years, especially with BookTok's upsession with enemies to lovers (I could do a whole power point on enemies to lovers - my goodness) and honestly sometimes it concerns me. People really like to romanticize captivity and overprotective, possessive, jealous male love interests. And.... this is Not Great in a relationship. Sometimes (rarely) this story involves the love interest realizing the error of their ways, apologizing, and changing - but I feel like most often, these traits are seen as pros and aren't really addressed. I love the fact that this book simultaneously validates Enna's feelings of romance, while also later establishing that ""actually nope! Sileph's behavior is indicative of a power hungry man and this is not OK"", and I  love  that it does this for a younger audience in an appropriate and yet effective way. Gotta get these ideas in early!Yay Shannon Hale!

I will always have a soft spot for the novels I read as a child, and not just purely out of nostalgia. This book is just all around good, for any age. Plus it’s 500 pages so not exactly ""light."" Much like my other favorite children's-but-really-for-all-ages novels, the writing is quite sophisticated and feels quaint and timeless, but also very personal. The Mysterious Benedict Society is comprised of four very lovable, charming, and incredibly talented children. I am a huge fan of teams where every member brings their own skills to the table to create awesomeness − and this group certainly fits the bill. In this whole series, there are A LOT riddles, and puzzles and mysterious tests. I loved trying to figure out the answers myself (though by now I know most of them by heart), and I loved being able to count on the characters to succeed whenever I’d had enough. Sometimes it’s nice to just watch the geniuses (or child prodigies in this case) do their work.For adults and teenagers, it can be hard to recommend a book because people often have defined opinions about what they like.

They are both young sovereigns trying to hold populations together, and will often exert violent punishments for both political and anger-motivated reasons. But this quote exemplifies how Attolia's development shines where Dany's breaks down. Both rulers are faced with the failure of their most trusted advisors, except --- spoiler for GOT ---- Dany always exiles or murders them whereas in this book Attolia learns that she cannot. Season 8 Dany's descent was terribly written, but I think the problem goes even further back when they time and time again made her character choose the path of violence.

That being said, I think I was able to appreciate it so much more on this reread. The dynamics and dialogue are great, and Kamet's character is so interesting. Once again, MWT gives us an unreliable narrator where Kamet's own pride blinds him to a lot things. Most notably is how he perceives his relationship with Nahuseresh - blaming himself for getting beaten, not knowing how to react to an honest apology because no one has ever apologized to him for real :(((( It's really just his journey of finding value in real friendships and his own agency in life, and it is very very well done. --Spoiler--(view spoiler)[ the big question at the end of this book is: what is the nature of Costis and Kamet's relationship?

I still think most of the story could be interpreted either way - as a close friendship or a romance, except for a few scenes and parallels to other stories that would indicate the latter. Also, the end was quite the ""running to the airport in a rom-com"" cliche.

You wouldn't expect 232 pages to succeed in making you feel anything, and yet this book does. Side note: 100% of the reason I re-read this is because of a youtube video ranking Cinderella dresses in various movies. The movie is obviously nowhere near as good but now I want to rewatch it just to laugh at it. Also, it turns out I really enjoy the Cinderella story... in general?

And in this book, Julia Alvarez mixes reality and fiction to tell the story of four distinct and interesting sisters. Over the course of the book, I really enjoyed seeing them grow as individuals and as a family. This book is as much about family as it is about revolution. And I appreciated how the sisters’ contrasting perspectives highlighted the nuance and complexity of both. Nothing is simple in this book. Nothing is black and white. Overthrowing a dictatorship is hard, but so is forgiveness.In literature, especially YA, people often think of “strong” women as those who are stereotypically badass: outspoken, brazen, and possessing a powerful presence. Yet only one of the sisters fits this description. I loved reading from her perspective, but I also loved how the other sisters showed different forms of strength, founded on mixed emotions of love and fear, and not just pure passion for a cause. The doubts they possess felt very real and relevant to anything as messy as a revolution. Despite their fears, they all find drive to do what is right and protect those they love. This wasn’t really a page turner for me. As far as plot goes, family life isn’t always the most suspenseful, even when you throw in some underground revolution-planning action. Nevertheless, I thought the way Alvarez developed her characters and themes was superb. Overall, a lovely read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 10, 2018","Feb 20, 2018","Dec 25, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17336318-in-the-time-of-the-butterflies

Much of the plot seemed unnecessary to me and the end was tied up rather hurriedly. Also Wentworth is good and all, but he is not as interesting or lovable as Knightley or Darcy.

The plot switches frequently between tranquil scenes of domesticity, brutal and acts of violence, and flat out bizarre personal interactions to conclude with a less-than-satisfying endingIt’s very easy to get frustrated while reading, especially around the slow pacing and convoluted web of characters and frame stories. I don’t know if I would’ve made it through if I hadn’t been reading it for a book club. That being said, I did find ways to enjoy it. What makes the book weird is also what makes it super interesting and fun to discuss with friends. The characters’ complicated backstories become much less frustrating if you stop trying to figure out exactly how and why they connect. I think you just have to get ready to go a wild ride, and accept that not everything will make complete sense.
