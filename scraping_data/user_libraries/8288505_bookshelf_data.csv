This must be the first book I’ve read by an author who was later executed by firing squad.The Riddle of the Sands is an early spy/adventure thriller. Set before WWI, the plot largely follows two English gentlemen cruising near the Frisian Islands on a small yacht. They suspect a German plot to wage war against England and try to uncover proof, leading them into both adventure and intrigue.Two men on a boat seems a simple premise, but there is nothing simple about this book. The writing is excellent; the detailed descriptions of sailing instantly clue the reader in to the expertise of the author in this area. His knowledge of the Frisian Islands and the general area is extensive, adding to the verisimilitude of the story. In fact, it turns out Childers even did some gun smuggling in his life (not the reason he faced the firing squad).

That had to be the end of the love triangle (my least favourite trope) in my mind, but errr no.I got so tired of Bree making dumb decisions throughout this book. At times I found Alice's character completely different from how it started in book 1.

I have never been so bored reading a book. It is utterly underwhelming.The audiobook was terrible. Actually, the male narrator was okay, but the female narrator drove me nuts. She was overly dramatic in scenes where it just wasn’t warranted. A relatively minor thing would happen, but she’d screech her way through the scene like it was the end of the world. There’s only so much hysterical I can handle. There was no real tension, no reason to like the characters, no real hook, nothing.

On her first night there she sees a demon being killed by members of a secret society. She is mesmered to forget what she saw, but instead remembers and realises that she's been mesmered before, right after her mother's death. Determined to find out the truth about her mother's death, Bree finds a way into The Order, a society based on Arthurian legend who protect humans from demons.While I found Bree and her best friend Alice a little annoying at the start, things definitely picked up once Bree infiltrated The Order. It was a little tricky trying to figure out exactly how the world within The Order hung together. There were Pages, Scions, Merlins, etc., in the end I read on without fully understanding and that was fine.

Andie’s body was never recovered, but the case is closed. The alleged murderer, Andie’s boyfriend Sal Singh, committed suicide immediately following Andie’s disappearance. But Pippa knew Sal and doesn’t believe he’s guilty, so she launches her own investigation. It’s not long before she realises people really don’t want her looking into Andie’s murder.I liked this YA murder mystery, but I couldn’t shake the sense that I’d read it before. It is entirely possible that I did and forgot to mark it as read at the time. The audiobook made Pippa a little on the young side at times and the voice of her best friend (which was awfully similar to her younger brother’s) was also too young and drove me nuts. Pippa makes some dumb decisions, putting herself in danger in the name of plot progression a few times, but I like the complexity of how things play out, with the exception of one particular twist which was simply not believable.

Not only was he a great thinker, he was a man of conscience and socially progressive in ways Once again, I find myself incredibly impressed by Wells. Not only was he a great thinker, he was a man of conscience and socially progressive in ways that were so far ahead of his time.The story is about a castaway, Prendrick, who is stuck on an island with a shunned scientist and his companion. When he discovers the nature of their scientific endeavours and comes face to face with some of Doctor Moreau’s previous experiments he is horrified. This is similar to Frankenstein. It’s man using science to create man with disastrous consequences, but it also draws a line between men and beasts. It’s about how easily the rules used to govern society, when toppled, lead men to revert to their baser (more beastly) natures. With the animal cruelty depicted here, it doesn’t take a lot of reflection to agree that men are the real beasts.As usual, Well’s writing has echo points far into the future. Despite this being written in 1895, long before WWII, it made me think of the concentration camps and the atrocities committed there in the name of science. And more recently, cloning and the ethics debate associated with it.After reading this book, I stumbled across an early foreword written by Wells. In it he states the book was written in response to the ‘scandalous trial’ of Oscar Wilde, which he referred to as ‘the graceless and pitiful downfall of a man of genius’. So, in addition to what I said about Wells at the start of this , he was also a brave, caring and awesome human being....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 24, 2022","May 05, 2022","Apr 24, 2022",,Unknown Binding,view (with text),/book/show/29981.The_Island_of_Dr_Moreau

I read somewhere that there was panic when the radio play version of this story first aired as people believed there was a Martian invasion taking place.The first person narration worked well to explore the novel’s themes of religion, colonialism and social Darwinism. Wells has a solid dig at British imperialism not just in the text of the book, but also in the title (‘World’ in Earth’s case being London and surrounds). Clearly he wanted to provoke thought at the time with his choice of setting. I got a distinct flavour of let’s see how you would like being invaded.

Sadly, it didn't work for me.It claims to be a romantic comedy, but it's more like a romance/mystery. It wasn't what I expected from Beth O'Leary, having read The Flatshare and The Switch. The way it's marketed and the cover suggest comedy, but if there was any I missed it.As the blurb states one guy, Joseph, stands up three women on Valentine's Day. The story switches between the three women, starting with the Valentine's Day no-show and then following Joseph's relationship with each of them.I spent most of this story feeling slightly uneasy, waiting for things to be made clear. Whose story is it? How do these women fit together? What is going on? There were a couple of twists here, the first one I didn't see coming and the second one seemed obvious after the first. The problem with the big twist is that with two thirds of the book slowly leading up to this pivotal moment and the excitement of finally getting there high, it was completely undercut by the twist.Beth O'Leary doesn't paint a great picture of Joseph. While we learn new things about him as the story unfolds, it came way too late for me. It would have been like turning around the Titanic after disliking him for most of the book. While I didn't mind the ending, I was left feeling dissatisfied.

Staying invisible ensures she's not targeted by the school bullies. But when Paige is asked to work on the Yearbook, she comes face to face with the very people she works so hard to avoid . . . It's funny looking at the s for this book how a few people have referred to it as a light read. For me, it was anything but. The emotional abuse Paige suffers and her invisibility were aspects of her character I could relate to on some level. I found it really tough to read those chapters. However, once Elijah was in the picture, there was a bit more light to go with the shade and a couple of laugh out loud moments. I also really enjoyed that Paige and Elijah were both deep thinkers and genuinely kind people.While my school experience didn't include the intense bullying depicted in The Yearbook, I have family members who were victims of attacks of this nature and worse, and I'm glad Holly Bourne puts that behaviour under the spotlight. The way she juxtaposes the bullying at school with Paige's home life and her mum's situation, in particular, is quite powerful.This is definitely one of the better YA books I've read this year.

Especially when they were patently not what was going on. There was a real logic break that Kiva had been in prison for 10 years and her family keeps sending messages that they are coming. It’s been 10 years . . . Because of the way it was written, Kiva made choices that seemed really stupid at the time. And some of the plot points felt convenient rather than organic. Kiva’s assumptions around the water task had me rolling my eyes they were so obviously wrong. And the trials felt like an idea borrowed from Feyre’s trials in ACOTAR.The ending left me liking Kiva a lot less.

And I'll be so disappointed if it leads to a cheesy cameo.It felt like the plot seams were really showing in this book and some of them were coming apart. In particular, character motivations seemed to be flimsy at best. Let's all risk our lives for a kid we don't know because he's a kid. Let's get involved in things that turned out badly for us before because some guy we don't trust says we should. A whole lot of actions taken by characters in this book weren't underpinned by strong enough motivations. And Hunt doesn't put up nearly enough resistance as events unfold. It simply wasn't believable. Nor were some of his interactions with the new archangel, which seemed really out of character. The sex scenes had hardly any romance or chemistry involved. I started thinking, not again, whenever they cropped up. And seriously, how many more new plot points can Danika drive from the bone quarter? The Danika revelations just keep coming. For most of this book, I felt like I was watching a game of chess where there was little strategy. Pieces were being moved just so we could get to where we were supposed to end up.

I adored the first book and really liked the second book, but this one felt flat in comparison. The magic of the first two books for me stemmed from El’s character and then the interactions between El and Orion, but the plot of this book didn’t allow for the same magic. I also missed the setting/character of the Scholomance, which didn’t feature much in this book.So much time was spent on setting up the logic of the ending that it totally dragged in parts. There were new developments in terms of relationships that I didn’t think were necessary and seemed wrong. It actually felt like they were being dropped in to tick some box, ie tokenism, but they felt like a betrayal. The ultimate villain was revealed, and I was looking forward to a big, tension-filled ending, but they didn’t really embrace their villainy to the full so it fizzled.I still enjoyed the series, and I’d still recommend it, but this book was missing the thing that made the earlier books special and so much fun to read....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 27, 2022","Sep 29, 2022","Oct 02, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/55858638-the-golden-enclaves
