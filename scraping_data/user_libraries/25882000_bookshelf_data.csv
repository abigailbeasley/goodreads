Reading these books necessitates a suspension of disbelief that is simply beyond my capabilities. Washington Poe is a hunter of serial killers - the more bizarre/grisly said criminals/crimes are the better - as each series entry proves. Poe is a loner, borderline curmudgeon who follows his own rules - at times regardless of the law - acting as judge, jury and executioner without remorse and as this series progresses, without repercussions. In short, Poe is a “tough guy”.His supporting cast is mostly strong independent women - until they need Poe’s help or to be rescued - all of whom adore our hero in their own special way. One case in point is his side-kick Matilda “Tilly” Bradshaw, a young computer genius, lacking social skills whom Poe has taken under his protective wing much like a stray dog and she reciprocates with blind trust and loyalty. Where I seriously run into trouble reading these books is with the continual plot twists that compound/escalate upon each other - which even taking into account this is escape thriller fiction - reach a point beyond silly/farcical/ridiculous - and not in an Austin Powers/James Bond kind of way. A(nother) case in point - without spoiling anything. Poe’s boss - 8 months pregnant - signs on for surveillance duty on a remote(ish) island, at the end of December during a freeze/snowstorm to try and trap our insanely evil villain. It never dawning on anyone - including our two heroes and the expectant mother - that this may not be the best idea/plan considering the circumstances. I know I’m in the minority - just not my cup of tea....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 16, 2023","Aug 18, 2023","Aug 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53242941-the-curator

I’ve had some difficulty embracing Philo as a protagonist - to call him an eccentric fop is a vast understatement - and this entry didn’t make him any the more huggable for me. (For the record Vance is a well-to-do amateur sleuth with interests/hobbies such as psychology, ancient history, dog breeding, chess, golf, art, Egyptology - he was in the midst of translating “the principal fragments of Menander found in the Egyptian papyri” when interrupted to solve this one - and much much more. When the case calls for a strong foundation/knowledge of some topic - any topic - Philo is your man.)Philo is called by his good friend - the NY DA - to assist in the Bishop Murder case which involves a serial killer following a “script” - in this case Nursery Rhymes. It’s a mystery/puzzle for the ages which Philo reminds us of constantly. (Considering this book was published close to 100 years ago it’s almost “current” in its plot.) Unfortunately I found the story/writing very uneven. For instance while the reader is getting to know the victims/suspects Philo - as he is wont to do - frequently pontificates on topics as varied as mathematical theory to the righteousness of suicide. These digressions becoming more than a little aggravating - impeding the story-line for this reader. (I also have an issue with the way the author portrays women - even taking into account when these books were written.

On the plus side there’s a very interesting cast of characters including our hero and his side-kick, a convoluted yet entertaining plot concerning the murder of a not so well-liked and not so good of an author and his final unpublished manuscript - the manuscript itself a unique mishmash of sci-fi, violent fantasy and pornography. Overall and unsurprisingly the author spins a very good tale. On the negative side for this reader is the sheer amount of telling the reader vs showing the reader which becomes mind-numbingly repetitive in its detail. This includes such topics as our hero’s doggedness, his choice of transportation through the constant inclement winter weather, the pain and trouble of his prosthesis and the saccharine, soap opera - dare I say adolescent - portrayal of romance here - all of which is surprising considering the author.

Although there were plenty of people present there are no clues nor a clear cut motive for our hero to investigate/follow - a locked room mystery in the wide open - and of course the “spree” continues before Charlton identifies the culprit. This one started a little slow, not helped by the 1930s British slang/humor, which eluded this reader in more than a few instances. And the solution may frustrate purists, although it is a harbinger/foreshadowing of current mysteries/police procedurals.

First a body is found in a local river with no apparent cause of death. Second a well connected politico murders his family and then takes his own life for no apparent reason. The two cases appear initially not be connected to each other - but we mystery readers know better, (which is fine).Unfortunately the story then grinds to a halt as the investigations begin, proceed and disappointingly conclude. The reader sidetracked by repeated scenes in which we are privy to a Scottish winter - it’s cold and snowy; our hero’s recovery from a fractured leg with each and every ache and twinge of pain documented as well as his visits to the therapist - both physical and psychological - our hero hates both; in depth descriptions of a fellow officer’s battle with a mysterious illness - it’s nasty; and in case the reader doesn’t grasp our lead character’s tenacity to solve the case(s) - it is explained over and over. The irony here being that virtually all the clues are literally handed to him - actually “mysteriously” delivered to his home. And of course our hero has problems with his boss who just doesn’t understand the “complexities” of the cases - just the politics. There is also a femme fatale whose involvement is murky at best - not sure if that is intentional or not. The comparison to the Ian Rankin/John Rebus series - a favorite of mine - is superficial - Scottish police procedurals sums up the similarity. Otherwise while the Rebus books are lean and character driven - the McLean books are bloated and repetitive, populated with “stock/off the shelf” characters.

It’s classic Christie in that a mysterious woman mysteriously dies with seemingly a cabin full of other passengers. And no one saw thing - including our hero. There’s an interesting cat and mouse game with the case bouncing back and forth between England and France. The cast of characters/suspects is well enough developed to allow the reader to form a few opinions/theories.

Jefferson Farjeon, (1925).This story starts with an interesting premise/hook which the book’s title does an admirable job of describing and teams together an amateur and professional sleuth to do the investigating/solving. Unfortunately for this reader the story crumbles under its own weight with a fairly cheesy love story and a lot of - literal - meandering . For instance our amateur sleuth is a big late night bicycle rider and his professional counterpart likes his disguises - both of which grew tiresome - thus rendering the not so creative conclusion anti-climactic. As an aside - some of the statements and actions of Detective Grant - the professional - could easily have been made by Peter Sellers as Clouseau. Not sure if that was the author’s intention. Having several other mysteries on the shelf by this author I’ll read another, but the proverbial jury is out whether I’ll buy any more Farjeon books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 12, 2023","Jan 13, 2023","Jan 12, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60348077-uninvited-guests

Our hero - along with Scotland Yard - is asked to solve two murders - of a night watchman and a wealthy man - that happened miles apart, yet are tied together by artifacts belonging to Mary, Queen of Scots. Our young Bathurst is nowhere near as eccentric as say Poirot, Vance or Wimsey, but is still clever. And the mystery here is entertaining although purists might have issues with the solution.

Several observations This is the second adventure of our hero Inspector French - the first, his “Greatest Case”, proving to be a tough act to follow. Several observations - This is more of an international(ish) caper as opposed to a classic mystery. For those of you unfamiliar with this author Mr. Crofts likes his details, albeit police procedure, blind alleys, room/clothing descriptions, monitoring characters while they think, specifics of meals eaten and much more. Point here is that at least for this reader this extremely observant fly on the wall perspective bogs down the storyline. Lastly our intrepid Inspector does not show up until almost 2/3 of the way into this tale which means the reader spends way too much time with the eponymous Maxwell Cheney - a man who makes Charlie Brown, (i.e. Lucy & the football), look shrewd. When “Max” is not blowing his stack he is stumbling from one all too obvious predicament to another which unfortunately also proves a detriment to the story.

What both authors do extremely well is place the “baseball story” within the context of the times while telling the stories/biographies of the main players - pardon the pun. This book centers on 1968, (Epplins’ two decades earlier - 1948), and the World Series that year between Detroit and St. Louis with Bob Gibson and Denny McClain serving as our guides. There is a lot of baseball here - on and off the field - as well as history - to put it mildly 1968 was not a quiet year.

The reader knows this because she/he is told tThe Guest List centers around a posh wedding that takes place off the Irish coast on a deserted island. The reader knows this because she/he is told that repeatedly. (This being one of the many problems I had with this book - a lot of “telling” - little if any “showing”. Another for instance - the reader is told over and over again each of our characters has secrets.)Once the guests assemble on “Fantasy Island” mayhem and finally - murder - ensue - unfortunately not soon enough. The lead up to this much foreshadowed event taking up most of the book as the reader “gets to know” the cast of characters through separate narrators - The bride to be - a self-centered, successful, perfectionist, (read nagger), who is a pain in the keister. The maid of honor - the bride’s half sister who is a self-centered college student nursing a broken heart - who is a pain in the keister. The best man - an immature self-centered ne’er’do well, who is nursing a substance abuse problem and is a pain in the keister. The bride’s best friend’s wife - a self-centered, incredibly insecure & needy stay at home mom and who is a pain in the keister. Noticing a theme? The cast also includes the stiff upper lipped martyr of a wedding planner/owner of said island establishment and her pet dog of a husband, the bride’s narcissistic mother who makes Charlie and Alan’s mom look caring/nurturing and the groom’s ushers who make the guys from Omega House seem mature.Unfortunately the multiple narrators are indistinguishable from one other - blurring together and becoming repetitive.(Interestingly not only are the narrators’ names used to title their respective chapters, but also their role, i.e. Jules - The Bride - a necessary scorecard to keep the characters straight.)This is just one of the many “tricks” used here. Along with the not so varying narrative perspectives there are short chapters - many ending at “suspenseful moments” like commercial breaks which are at first aggravating , then predictable and finally yawn inducing. Add in the inevitable wonky cell phone service and electricity that blinks out at (in)opportune moments, multiple “BOO!!” false alarms - again way too overdrawn/overwrought and much too many to add any real tension/suspense to the story and a non-linear time-line which serves no purpose except to fill pages delaying the inevitable dud of a finale. None of these ploys by themselves or collectively capable of disguising the less than minimal storyline here. And just to add to the tedium - all the characters - most in their mid-30s - talk and act like adolescents. And not in a cute and endearing way, but rather in a gum-smacking, flip of the hair, “got me some attitude” way - particularly when it comes to communication, i.e. dialogue - which is truly painful at times; descriptions - ditto; relationships and gender roles - let alone how imbibing and sex are portrayed. Bottom line The Guest List reads like a teenaged version of a really, really bad B-horror movie. I finished this book simply to say so here.

Before departing the Inspector stops for a cocktail in a hotel lounge and meets Mr. Parkenham from New York City. Mr. P is hosting an annual gala dinner he throws for eight other men - all of whom survived the sinking of their ship - the other eight younger men keeping Parkenham alive while they waited in their lifeboat to be rescued. He being so grateful for their kindness - and a man of some means and no family - Parkenham has also made them all beneficiaries in his will. This being a murder mystery trouble soon follows as the number of said Samaritan beneficiaries begins to dwindle “one by one”- thus the pot of inherited money grows for the “survivors”- and Collier - smelling a rat - cancels his vacation to investigate. This is not the tightest mystery - there are a few holes and obvious red herrings - but the characters are well drawn and the story moves along well enough. So I enjoyed the book - except for one thing. There is a young female character that even considering when this was written, (1929), is over the top in the “innocent naive damsel in distress” department and I found her extremely annoying. (She’d be the one who trips and twists her ankle in every B horror movie.)That being said (written) - I’ll read more by this author....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 29, 2022","Apr 30, 2022","Apr 29, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43815113-one-by-one-they-disappeared

And to be perfectly honest if I had not been told/ read elsewhere that the following books are better I’m not sure I would continue on with these two co-authors. But one does catch glimpses of - hopefully - what’s to come and I already have their next book - a Christmas mystery - so I will be reading at least one more. Our heroine/narrator - Carla Bray - is on a Pacific cruise ship en route to San Francisco. Her fellow travelers include the usual cast of characters with a nosey matron, a family of four, a teacher and several eligible bachelors - for what’s sea travel without romance - among others. The hi-jinx begin with the murder of another young female passenger and Carla finds herself right in the middle of the “investigation”.Being set in the late 1930s there are plenty of cocktails, cigarettes and some ballroom dancing. And being the 1930s women are delicate creatures - at least according to the authors. Poor Carly - again our narrating heroine - when not in hysterics, is either crying, paralyzed - or conversely - shivering with fear, suffering from headaches, trying to run and/or scream and then fainting - only to be continually rescued by one of the eligible bachelors mentioned above. When Carly does have her wits about her she provides us with snarky descriptions of - and treats her fellow passengers in such a manner - that would make any thirteen year old proud. (Similarly “romance” as depicted here is straight out of junior high - whoops I’m dating myself - middle school.)Case in adolescent point - “I went up to the boat deck and sat myself down in a prominent spot. I felt sure that someone would be along presently and at least I would be the center of attention for a while.”.And that’s the major problem I had with this book - Carly is a very difficult character to spend much time with and the reader - since she is our first person narrator - unfortunately is stuck with her from start to finish. The above line in and of itself is actually funny and provides the reader with some valuable insight into Carly, but it’s overkill by the time we read it eighty seven pages into the story. And last but least - the mystery solution and the culprit. No spoilers but simply put - preposterous....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 04, 2021","Dec 05, 2021","Dec 04, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1890959.The_Grey_Mist_Murders

Expecting a straightforward “diary narrative” of the 2020 election - this is that but also much more. First the author delves back into the Obama administration - as well as tracking the president’s input/effects on his party during and after his time in office. Second the 2016 presidential election is covered here - although not in detail - to give a context to the 2020 campaign/election and the Democratic candidates. The majority of the book then tracking/following most of these Presidential wannabes until Joe Biden became the last candidate standing and then his victory. The last several chapters deal with the interim between the election and Inauguration Day 2021 - including the insurrection on January 6th.The narrative here is Pearlstein-ish, (NixonLand), mini-bios, anecdotal inside stories with “fly on the wall” observations and opinionated analyses - although it should be noted - this author does have a sense of humor. Just one brief example - the author describing the multitude of “pundits/experts” in Iowa during primary/caucus season…Imagine trying to get a room full of five year olds to agree on the best ice cream flavor ever. Last note - it may take a bit of reading to acclimate to this author’s writing style. He digresses often - time lines or chronology be damned. Think Ron White’s Tater Salad comic bit - “I told you that story so I can tell you this one.”. This author does that a lot. Also Dovere’s sentences can - at times - be somewhat convoluted - I imagine diagramming one of them would resemble a John Madden drawing outlining a specific football play. Also If it’s not clear at this point from both the book’s title and this , “Battle for the Soul” is Democratic Party centric - Not a knock - just another heads-up.Highly recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 30, 2021","Dec 07, 2021","Nov 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57289445-battle-for-the-soul
