But presents itself in a manner that makes you want to pay that attention. This all takes place in the world after the events of the original Watchmen series and all of the unsettling airs that come with it. Tom King uses this environment to tell the story of the investigation into a botched political assassination attempt. King’s work with time - often the past and present are told simultaneously, somehow - is remarkable and I am totally impressed.

(My mother had worked in an office at Georgetown before I was born and still had friends there ... I had connections).Upon registration each attendee got to meet Thompson and have a moment to chat one-on-one. I shook his hand. He shook my arm. At the opening lecture he asked for everyone who brought a book to raise their hand. I raised mine, along with several other guys. Then he asked who brought a Game Gear. Many more hands went up. “You’re all jackasses”, he said. In “I Came as a Shadow”, the title a reference to a poem written by his uncle, Thompson discusses how much he loves to cuss and uses the language freely. This isn’t so much a book about basketball as it is about pedagogy and race in America and the confluence of the two. Thompson was keen to the equity versus equality argument back in 70s and used “we may have the same goal but some get to start on the 50 yard line” throughout the book. He also tells some good stories about the superstars who had played for him. And we learn that he is an avid fan of country music. “I Came as a Shadow” may not be a great piece of literature but it is a great story about a great man who lived a great life.

Chantler executes a master class in possibilities of graphic storytelling. Bix is the story of jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke and his struggles with family, fame, and addiction. Chantler tells it with over 200 pages of nearly wordless panels. For the most part the panels are presented in a strait line, not unlike a newspaper comic strip, on a seemingly oversized page. But when the action starts, particularly when the jazz really starts swing, we get to see what all that white space is there for. The illustrations are a touch on the simple side and perhaps the book would’ve been more powerful if it 100% without conversation (though it makes those few more significant) but Bix is an excellent and unique piece of storytelling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Feb 06, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50804759-bix
