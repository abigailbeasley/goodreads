Her insomnia started when, in a short period of time, her sister and partner had separated; her cousin died unexpectedly, only being found two days later; her father fell from a ladder and would be unable to walk for a year; and her father’s partner was diagnosed with dementia. In that context, some insomnia is not surprising. Harvey did not have some insomnia; she was enveloped in a tsunami of existential anxiety.Harvey documents her insomnia in obsessive (and overwhelming) detail: in dreams, flash fiction, and streams of consciousness. She asks for help repeatedly, but nowIn the eyes of the doctor, I am just neurotic and self-obsessed. The more I do to be listened to as a human being, the more I strengthen my role as neurotic and self-obsessed. The less she listens to me the more I tell or show her that I’m suffering. The more I tell or show her I’m suffering the more she thinks I am neurotic and self-obsessed. Each time, my role is reinforced and my role overrides my humanity. (p. 119). Presumably, her friends and family (and readers) respond similarly: with advice, with “just do,” “all you have to do,” and “only.” The cure is simple from the outside, but not from the inside, as Harvey turns to psychotherapy, antidepressants, sleeping pills, swimming, late night puzzles, and nutrition assessments.And, then, everything changes. What made the difference? It’s entirely unclear to Harvey and to us: things change.This is the cure for insomnia: no things are fixed. Everything passes, this too. One day, when you’re done with it, it will lose its footing and fall away, and you’ll drop each night into sleep without knowing how you once found it impossible.

This is truBeing a child can feel magical and mysterious, as adult secrets are rarely shared, either whispered or assumed to be known and understood. This is true in a calm, predictable world, and perhaps even truer in an unpredictable one peopled by secrets.Téa Obreht’s The Morningside centers a family of climate refugees in the near future, a world of tight rationing, climate disasters, genocide, mistrust, bland euphemisms, and dirty politics that skims funding for refugees and redirects it to the rich. Silvia (Sil) is 12, attempting to protect her mother from pending disaster, without the skills or resources to do so. She plants protections around her apartment building – a jar of jam, a perfume bottle, an old pair of scissors – and touches them physically or with her mind (“one, two, three”). When left alone, who can Sil trust? The gentle man who gave her hazelnut crème sandwiches? The witch in the penthouse? The people on the street? The janglers who send her to buy meat? (Meat?

Would that have been enough for a grown-up? Or would a grown-up have denied him the letters on the simple, irrefutable grounds that they did not bear his name? (p. 90)While Obreht identifies more than enough reasons for Sil – and us – to be anxious, she does not succumb to easy mood manipulators. Sil worries but she and her friends and family also solve problems, identifiy good support systems, and find ways to live in an unpredictable world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 07, 2024","Apr 07, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/179546766-the-morningside

In Dragon's Winter, Dragon is caught between good and evil, and must make a number of difficult choices. It is a conflict between two superpowers, which could move the land into an ice age. Dragon's Treasure, on the other hand, is a somewhat quieter book. Karadur continues to struggle with impulsive outbursts of anger, but he also practices forgiveness (of self and others) and builds his chosen family.Dragon's Treasure feels like the second in a longer series, although it is Lynn's last novel. Her secondary characters – Shem, Hawk, One-arm, Azil, Maia and her child, and others – seem to have been set out on Karadur's keph board, to put into play in future books in the series. I imagine a Shem grown into his abilities; a wise Hawk, guiding the less experienced around her; Maia's child, also Dragon. Unfortunately (for me), Lynn struggled with writer's block, writing sporadically in later years. As far as I can tell, she only published a single short story since this last book.

He writes thoughtful, literary fiction with themes from Greek myths. His books aren't ""Black enough."" He is simultaneously aware of his race and yet that fact does not touch his life on a daily basis. The hard, gritty truth of the matter is that I hardly ever think about race. Those times when I did think about it a lot I did so because of my guilt for not thinking about it. I don’t believe in race. I believe there are people who will shoot me or hang me or cheat me and try to stop me because they do believe in race, because of my brown skin, curly hair, wide nose and slave ancestors.

She saw patterns, guided kings, and predicted the future. In Menewood, Nicola Griffith's much anticipated follow-up, Hild is now grown (19 at book's end). She rejects the restricting label she had been given and now says, ""I’m not a seer, I watch. I name the patterns that anyone could see, if they also watched.” (p. 525). Nonetheless, an amazing woman. An amazing person.All who left Menewood—or Urburg when she was there—took with them stories of the uncanny wit of the lady who could look at a man and greet him by asking, What news from the mines of Craven? before he even opened his mouth. And she was surrounded always by Fiercesomes, killers who would slaughter a person at a look, and women with tongues sharper and faster than the best sword, women whom everyone obeyed, sometimes even the lady. (p. 715)During early seventh century Britain, where Menewood is set, Cadwallon and his men were rampaging across the isle, wantonly slaughtering its people, burning its buildings, killing its livestock and allowing their carcasses to rot, and stealing their gold. He did these things because he could. He did because they struck terror across the land.Cadwallon had almost devastated Britain's kingdoms when Hild determined to stop Cadwallon. Some readers might find Menewood slow or bloated. I found it fascinating. Nicola Griffith described Hild's ways of thinking and seeing – part careful observation and part free association – and her careful build of a strategy of war: seeing the strengths of the women and men who she surrounded herself with, training them, supplying them, creating careful alliances (without email or cell phones), and scouting the land. I hate reading war books, but this, set in a time of war, was no simple war book: farmers, accountants, songwriters, priests, and weavers all played as significant a role in the coming battles as did her warriors. ""She felt like a mummer at a fair, keeping hoops spinning on each leg and arm, around her waist and neck, some going this way, some going that, all while juggling, and singing out jokes"" (p. 671).The book's heart is an intentional community, Menewood, an egalitarian, feminist community, led by women and men who were far seeing. As Brona said, ""You said you wanted curious people, clever people. People who listen, people who learn. People who have to be told only once. And people who aren’t afraid to try a better way” (p. 634). Not something that many are willing to do.I appreciated Griffith's maps, the extensive list of characters, family tree, pronunciation guides, etc., that are almost necessary for those of us who don't speak Anglisch and are confused by the similar names among family members (e.g., Oswald, Oswine, Osthryth, Osric, Oswiu, and Osfrith).

Memory is the house on the sand with a red door I have stepped through, trying to remember the history of the waves. (p. XI). You get the picture: a memoir that recognizes memory as changing and changeable. A poet's memoir. How to Say Babylon was written by a Rastafarian musician's oldest daughter. Although there are various Rasta sects, they all are part of a nonviolent movement that aim to free the poor and downtrodden of ""Babylon’s colonial system."" Rasta attempts to challenge poverty and racism through unity and Black empowerment. Nonetheless, in a racist colonial system, he often felt excluded by both Blacks and whites and oppressed by wealthy Jamaican and Foreign whites. He attempted to find a foothold that fed his soul, protected his children, and kept his daughters pure – although often did not have enough money to put food in his family's stomachs or keep lights on in the evening. ""He believed that if he kept playing his reggae with righteous conviction, this crooked world would wake up and change. If he kept playing, he could save Black people’s minds, and we would reach Zion, the promised land in Africa"" (p. 44).Sometimes love saves us. Sometimes it kills. Safiya Sinclair's parents followed different paths in sharing their love. Her mother was nonjudgmental and nurtured Sinclair's mind and poet's soul. She fought to give her unimagined opportunities. Her father's love was fearful and paranoid. In his eyes, the perfect daughter was humble and had no care for vanity. She had no needs, yet nursed the needs of others, breastfeeding an army of Jah’s mighty warriors. The perfect daughter sat under the apple shade and waited to be called, her mind empty and emptying. She followed no god but her father, until he was replaced with her husband. The perfect daughter was nothing but a vessel for the man’s seed, unblemished clay waiting for Jah’s fingerprint. (p. 107)Often memoirs arc from poverty and abuse to empowerment and success. How to Say Babylon is no exception. She described finding the courage to change, discovering a voice and meaning through her poetry, being mentored (well and poorly) as an intellectual and a poet, and forgiving.

I just watched a video where people voting for one candidate were told outlandish things that their candidate had done (attributing it to the other candidate); they denounced the action. When they were told that the interviewer had made a mistake, they excused it. We can identify countless examples of this all around us. (It's not one of our prettier characteristics.)1984 and Julia, a retelling of Orwell's classic, focus on the consequences of totalitarian governments, mass surveillance, informational distortion, and repressive categorization of people by class (the Haves, Have Littles, and Have Nothings). Both novels consider the ways that truth and facts – and the people reading or listening to them – can be manipulated. “Truth Is Hate. Plenty Is Hate. Peace Is Hate. Love Is Hate” (p. 177). These distortions and the resulting disorientation we experience are purposeful: ""All was false. It was known to be false, but everyone lied about the lies, until no one knew where the lies began and ended"" (p. 370).

Sometimes books don't translate well across a lifespan, but The Tombs of Atuan did, maintaining the sense of dread, empty power, fear of change, and magic across time. Its language continues to feel magical, to sound like the beat of a drum (even though that isn't its language's rhythm). ""But Arha had learned not to command Kossil. She had the right to do so, but not the strength; it would take very great strength to stand up against Kossil’s jealousy of a higher status than her own, her hatred of anything she herself did not control"" (p. 62). The Tombs of Atuan speaks clearly to the fears of growing up, individuating, recognizing the failures and hypocrisies of some adults (and the strength and courage of others). Arha ruled ""a dark, empty, useless realm, Her power imprisons her"" (p. 185). Young readers might consider the power that they have in their family, friend group, school, and community. To what degree is their own power freeing or imprisoning them? The Tombs of Atuan also speaks well to those outside young adulthood, as even adults must recognize and challenge empty power and hypocrisy, must find ways to challenge evil, muster courage when that courage seems impossible, and work together. Ursula Le Guin notes, ""neither the woman nor the man can get free without the other…. Each has to ask for the other’s help and learn to trust and depend on the other.

This book is a story about a strong-arm robbery. It is about family and friends trying to recover what was stolen. It is the testimony, and the verdict that a jury of our peers has never heard."" (p. 9)Black AF History is a rollicking, often irreverent Black-centered history, shared as a series of stories. Michael Harriot's goal is to recenter history, challenge old ways of looking at that history and provoke new ones. He argues that history – told by whites – is a series of fairy tales to justify their (our) behavior rather than admit to the atrocities committed by their (our) ancestors. We have whitewashed history and patted ourselves on the back for a job well done. For example, the condition we broadly refer to as slavery has existed in so many different iterations that it is almost unfair to sweep all the different variations of human bondage under the umbrella of one language’s inadequate definition. Is a prisoner of war the same as a domestic servant? Does an unpaid worker serving a period of indentured servitude fall synonymous with a woman forced to enter an arranged marriage? Is criminal incarceration indistinguishable from mandatory military conscription? (p. 42)What is the difference among these groups – other than who tells the story? As Harriot observed, ""Of course, “Give me liberty or give me death” sounds perfectly rational when it comes from the lips of a white person. But logic, common sense, and the narcissistic delusion of whiteness dictates that Black people who would rather die than be enslaved must be mentally ill,"" and should be diagnosed with drapetomania (p. 113). Harriot used family stories to reframe historical events. He followed these with briefer narratives, as well as multiple choice questions:The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Why doesn’t it have the lowest crime rate?a. Because incarceration doesn’t stop crime. b.	Crime is caused by poverty, not lack of cages. c.	It’s probably a coincidence. d. Seriously, was slavery outlawed? (p. 333)Those questions were often followed by Activity prompts, this one includes part of the questions in ""Name the Race"":Assign the race of Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, white, or “Other” to the following people.++ A person whose ancestors were from France, except for one great-great-grandfather, who was from Africa. ++ A person whose ancestors were from Africa, except for one great-great-grandfather, who was from France. ++ A person who emigrated from Ireland before Irish people were considered white. ++ A Spanish-speaking indigenous native of Texas when it belonged to Mexico. + An English-speaking indigenous native of New Mexico. (excerpted from a much longer list, pp. 66-67).Obviously, Harriot intends to be provoking – thoughts and emotions (both laughter and anger).

Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer report thThe Federal Poverty Level for a family of two in the US in 2024 is $20,440. $2 a day poverty equates to $1440. Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer report that 1.5 million American households, including about 3 million children, live on $2. 00 per person, per day (about 4% of US families with children in the house). For comparison, this is about ½ gallon of gas or a ½ gallon of milk. SNAP benefits (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) counted toward this $2 a day threshold, as did housing subsidies and TANF (both of the latter are rare). The eight families interviewed in this book often had no running water, lived with extended family and friends (24 children and grandchildren in one case), did not have a second pair of clothes, or did not have access to regular transportation. (If you live off of $2 a day, a car, public transportation, or Uber is outside your budget.)Take Tabitha, who was 18 when last interviewed by Edin and Shaefer. Tabitha lived in a family of 13 children with a single mother and her violent boyfriend. Tabitha and six or seven of her siblings shared a bed. Many nights, especially past the middle of the month, the children did not have enough food to eat and cried themselves to sleep. At 14, Tabitha was propositioned by her high school gym teacher in exchange for food. This was sort of okay for seven months, but she eventually reported the abuse to her principal and the district attorney. The gym teacher eventually was removed from the classroom but stayed working in the school (!!!). The district attorney never pressed charges.But there is some help: homeless shelters, food banks, and libraries, the last providing heat, electricity, safety, and entertainment. Tabitha had another teacher who arranged a field trip to Washington, DC, finding money for clothing for the trip. He helped her find a boarding school with a scholarship. He encouraged her to press charges against the gym teacher.Right now in the US, there is no cash safety net. There are few opportunities for supported employment – most of the families interviewed wanted to work but for one reason or another – mostly unreliable transportation, unreliable healthcare, health problems – regular full-time work was impossible. Many experienced work barriers that I never need to consider (e.g., unpredictable work schedules, and requirements to be on call). Cash is necessary, though; it allows one to pay rent; interview for jobs; get children socks, underwear, and shoes; and keep electricity and heat on. It keeps the demons at bay, which affected many of the families mental and physical health.I’m also reading Julia, a dystopian novel that is a retelling of 1984. It is not a huge leap, not just dystopian paranoia, to believe that in a short period of time many workers will be out of the workforce;. In the near future, 50% of the job market is likely to be displaced by machines and AI. We need to be thinking about these issues for our children, grandchildren, and maybe even ourselves, even if we are lucky enough not to be in the $2 a day population. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 17, 2024","Feb 29, 2024","Feb 17, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/26203855-2-00-a-day

I went from being a marginal (bright) student, contemplating not going to college, to one who gobbled down books, courses, and ideas.What made the difference?

I have taught between 60 and 140 students a semester – while doing all sorts of other job-related tasks (e.g., writing, service, advising, admin). I don't really think I can pull off ungrading well under such a system, one where I rarely feel that I can put my feet up and contemplate where I'm going. Still, reading Ungrading gets me thinking about what strategies I can adopt to offer my students greater control, choice, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation. I'm not just teaching content; I want to help my students learn how to learn, to learn how to approach learning and life with passion.

She notes the ways that she is damaged:the last will and testament of a selfish prickand to the girl who gave me her entire life for nothing in return i leave my violence and my resentment may she suffocate under the weight of all of my unhealed childhood trauma (pp. 49-51). i am prince charmingit’s my soul’s purpose to save you so that we can finally live happily ever after but truthfully, the wind whispered, you have been my story’s most insidious villain and this is my final battle my resurrection phase it’s time to defeat you by rescuing myself (p. 69)I think one way that we lose our voices, as the narrator here has, is by being told that we are or should be pretty. Audrey Kawasaki's illustrations both objectify young women (big eyes, long hair, tiny bodies, large breasts) and flatten the poems' emotions. They remind us that being pretty and sexualized are most important, being real is not.

He responded, “And have you heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year?” (p. 7). Her friend had to say, ""That's her book"" three or four times before he recognized his error, went ashen – and began expounding on something else.Most women have had this experience: of being told by some men something that they know better than the speaker, of being talked over, of being dismissed. Men, in this world, are credible, while women are not – even when ""running out of her house naked in the middle of the night screaming that her husband was trying to kill her"" (p. 9). On two occasions she ""objected to the behavior of a man, only to be told that the incidents hadn’t happened at all as I said, that I was subjective, delusional, overwrought, dishonest—in a nutshell, female"" (p. 10). Haymarket Books. Kindle Edition.Solnit is quite clear that not all men talk over / explain / dismiss women and that some men have been quite supportive of her personally and professionally.If this was as far as Solnit took her argument, we would be entertained and enlightened; however, she related it to all sorts of silencing: talking over, violent silencing, domestic violence, rape, murder. ""We would understand misogyny and violence against women even better if we looked at the abuse of power as a whole rather than treating domestic violence separately from rape and murder and harassment and intimidation, online and at home and in the workplace and in the streets; seen together, the pattern is clear"" (p. 16). Solnit noted, ""Violence doesn’t have a race, a class, a religion, or a nationality, but it does have a gender"" (p. 18). It seems to me that she has overstepped her argument here. We do much the same with anyone we see as having – or who we believe should have – less power than we have. She recognizes that in a somewhat later essay: Her name was Asia. His was Europe. Her name was silence. His was power. Her name was poverty. His was wealth. Her name was Her, but what was hers? His name was His, and he presumed everything was his, including her, and he thought he could take her without asking and without consequences. (pp. 31-32)Solnit's ideas are fresh and revolutionary, even 10-15 years later, even as many of her ideas have become a part of the larger narrative.

It's also the second written by journaliThis is the second book on Philippine's Rodrigo Duterte and his war on drugs that I've read in the last year. It's also the second written by journalists at Rappler (the other is Maria Ressa's How to Stand Up To a Dictator). I did not plan this, but both journalists impressed me with the courage of Rappler's staff. I love reading anything written by passionate, courageous authors excelling at what they do. Ressa won a Nobel Prize for her work as a journalist.Although the Philippines has a drug abuse problem half that of the world average, Dutarte called a war on drugs: ""“Hitler massacred three million Jews,” he said. [It was more like six million Jews and five million Soviets, Romany, Jehovah Witnesses, communists, and homosexuals.] “Now there are three million drug addicts. I’d be happy to slaughter them”"" (p. 12). He was not calling for their capture and imprisonment, but for outright slaughter on the streets, what has been called extrajudicial killings (EJK).So is it the goal (removing drug abuse) or the means (slaughter or imprisonment) that matters? In the US, we have engaged in mass imprisonment as a strategy for clearing the streets and, while it is not as despicable as EJKs, the impact on families and communities has also been horrific. Duterte has been a popular president, although this has been a popularity built on lies. ""“I have no pretensions,” he said. “I am a small-town boy,” he said. “I am an ordinary Filipino,” he said. “I know the sentiment of the ordinary people. I can talk to them because that’s where I come from.”"" (p. 61). And yet, he had enjoyed a privileged upbringing, surrounded by guns and bodyguards, flying his father’s plane, and hanging out with the sons of the local elite in his Jesuit-run boys’ school. Who was the real Duterte?To believe in Rodrigo Duterte, you had to believe he was a killer, or that he was joking when he said he was a killer. You had to believe in the specter of a narco state, or you had to believe that he was only playing to the crowd. You had to believe drug addiction is criminal, that drug addicts are not human, and that their massacre can be considered acceptable public policy. You had to believe he could make crime and corruption and illegal drugs disappear in three to six months. You had to believe that a mayor who kept peace by ordering undesirables out of his city could succeed in a country where undesirables were citizens too. You had to believe the intended dead would be drug lords and rapists, only drug lords and rapists, and not your cousins who go off into Liguasan Marsh to pick up their baggies of meth. You had to believe there would be a warning before the gunshots ring out. (p. 118). One of the things I liked best about Some People Need Killing was Patricia Evangelista's focus on language. Were speakers using passive or active voice – and what were the implications of that choice? Who and what was the sentence's subject and object? What words were chosen? """"They would be drowned, stabbed, shot, buried, dropped into Manila Bay, fed to fishes, and sent to purgatory, and none of it would be murder because it was not murder, only justice…. “Simple justice,” he said. “Not murder-murder""” (p. 147). And, it was not just Duterte who played with language. We are all guilty of Crimes Against Language, when it is convenient. In Filipino, maganda means “beautiful.” It can also mean “good.” It was unclear what the president meant that afternoon in August, but there was a reason every English-language local news organization chose to use the word good instead of beautiful. Good, as egregious a judgment as it was, was far less outrageous than beautiful. Beautiful would have offered an element of pleasure, a romanticizing of brutality, the impression that the commander in chief of a democratic republic was not just pleased but delighted by the ruthless killing of his citizens. (p. 168). [image]The Philippine ""Pietà"": Jennelyn Olaires holding her husband, killed as an alleged drug dealer.

These three women – and the women and men they worked with – fought against the odds, but were not perfect by any means. (Who is?) Smith lied when first reporting the murder, had lost custody of her children, and had a history of abusing meth; however, Elizabeth Flock clearly described the gender bias threaded through Stand Your Ground trials (compare her treatment with that of George Zimmerman, who killed Trayvon Martin); the meaning of women ""protecting"" themselves, especially in Alabama; questions about whether one can be raped by a friend, boyfriend, or husband; and other kinds of victim blaming. In addition, this family had little money and, in the US, quality of one's defense is influenced by the resources one has to hire attorneys and consultants. Carolyn Light, author of Stand Your Ground argued, ""A woman capable of violence needs to be pathologized: Is she angry or is she crazy?” (quoted on p. 57). Perhaps she is responding to her trauma history (Smith had an extensive history). A 2010 study of women in the Illinois prison system reported that 98% had experienced physical violence, 85% had been stalked or emotionally abused, and 75% had been sexually abused before they entered prison. Karla Fischer, a forensic psychologist, observed that women with a history of abuse may respond more intensely to abuse inflicted upon them. “It’s not overreacting …It’s knowing that people will hurt you, that they will follow through on their threats, that certain things done to your body are painful. I think people with a history of violence may be more accurate with their perceptions of what people are capable of” (quoted on p. 87). Flock next shared Angoori's story, which started admirably – think of Zorro or Robin Hood – but she also ran into problems: trying to take on too much (she may have had 1000s in the Green Gang at its height), failing to investigate the problems they received, and being corrupted by power. Cicek seemed to maintain her ideals, but lost three of her closest friends in an extended guerrilla war that they were outresourced in and experienced either depression or PTSD at the end of her story.One of the things that I had difficulty with in The Furies is that Flock challenged my thinking more with the Smith story than the other two. Angoori and Cicek's stories, although interesting, did not seem to fit well with Smith's – in tone or style. For me, it would have been better if The Furies had become two different books. Flock justified placing their stories together: all three women ""sought to change the status quo, yet never fully escaped the oppressive systems they grew up in and continue to live under"" (p. 285). Still, that each story ended on a sour note meant that the book fizzled for me.

We see a Palestinian family respond to an cope with war and displacement – and all of the other things that families experience over the course of their lives.Most memoirs and books from this part of the world focus on refugees (e.g., The Last Girl). That is an important perspective, but Salt Houses describes an upper middle class family who are touched by war (view spoiler)[– one is murdered, another treats refugees, and the family must listen to frequent bombings and wonder what a loss of electricity means this time – (hide spoiler)], but even when they are not hungry, politics and unrest weaves its way throughout their lives. Will their building be the next one bombed? They can leave their apartment, city, country, and yet are not immune to the effects of war. This is a different view of Palestinians and war: the Yacoub family is not displaced, not starving, but often deeply traumatized. And yet, they also get married, have babies, get divorced, redecorate their apartments, and die. They love deeply and are irritated by each other, just as you and I are.I'm reminded of an international student who lived with us when I was in high school. His family worried about him coming to Chicago – we lived in a suburb – because of all the killings.

This left the family often questioning who they were and where they belonged.  And Linah felt confused, was speechless, wanting to say something about how no one ever really talked about being Palestinian in her house, the same way no one talked about being Iraqi, that when either set of grandparents came over, they spoke of things like villages and bombings with a sort of mournful resignation, as though the places in question had vanished into thin air. She wanted to say something about how she’d never been to Iraq or Palestine, that she knew only Boston and Beirut, that this was her home in the summers, and Marie must be wrong, because whoever it was that killed her uncle, it wasn’t Linah’s people, whatever that meant.

There is lots of angst on both sides, although often feminist angst: ""And when others are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own"" (p. 512). Violet and Xaden's romance takes place against a background where she, as daughter of one of the most powerful women in the empire, begins to question the empire's decisions. She begins to notice the information that isn't shared, to question how decisions are made, to refuse to be complicit in genocide, to recognize that there may be more than one perspective on national events.The part of Fourth Wing described in the first paragraph is tasty candy, that in the second, read against events taking place in the US, feels as current, fresh, and inspiring as a romantasy with tightly clothed, highly attractive people and their dragons can be.Rebecca Yarros overuses the word ""teases"" throughout the book, which causes it to lose its power, causes Violet to seem smaller than she is.

Unfortunately, UpdikI am a huge fan of Edward Gorey and think that I would have enjoyed John Updike's ""terrors"" as a small sidebar in the New Yorker. Unfortunately, Updike's terrors, when collected, strike me as the tired jokes that people share during Christmas parties after a few too many eggnogs – that is, cynical and predictable. [image]Why would anybody halfway normal want to live at the North Pole on a bunch of shifting ice floes? Or stay up all night flying around the sky distributing presents to children of doubtful deservingness? There is a point where altruism becomes sick. Or else a sinister cover-up for an international scam. A man of no plausible address, with no apparent source for his considerable wealth comes down the chimney after midnight while decent, law-abiding citizens are snug in their beds – is this not, at the least, cause for alarm? (p. 4)On the other hand, Gorey's drawings, while always identifiable, feel fresh and make me smile. (This smiling, I'm afraid, may say something bad about me.) His freshness may come from his drawings' movement, their surprising juxtapositions, and the contrast between the careful line drawings that appear quickly drawn.[image]The Twelve Terrors of Christmas was first published in the New Yorker in December 1992. As originally published, it included the twelve terrors, introduced by Edward Gorey's magazine cover art. Updike and Gorey subsequently completed their collaboration with a full-fledged book of ""poems"" matched to Gorey's drawings. Gorey also illustrated the works of Samuel Beckett, T.S. Eliot, Charles Dickens, Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Muriel Spark, Virginia Woolf, H.G. Wells, Bram Stoker, Raymond Chandler, Gilbert & Sullivan, and more.[image]The first two images are from The Twelve Terrors of Christmas, while the third is the New Yorker cover, which did not appear in the book.

Paul Murray spoofs survivalist culture, but The Bee Sting tosses a broad net and is also anti-gun and pro-conservation. Everything is connected to everything else, and the world is going to hell in a handbasket – just as the Barnes family is. ""The trouble is coming from inside; from his family. And unless something happens to stop it, it will keep billowing out, worse and worse, like black clouds of oil from a stricken tanker, till everything is coated in it, suffocating from it"" (p. 157).What could stop it? Recognizing our problems, accepting our responsibility for them, and moving on from our shame. (Dickie and Imelda don't do this, of course.)We all have problems. But often instead of accepting the truth about ourselves, we cover it up. We try to make ourselves the way we think we’re expected to be. So many of the bad things that happen in the world come from people pretending to be something they’re not. (p. 36) Paul Murray gives Dickie an out at several points—God even gives him advice at one point—and he continually chooses the road to ruin, even when it seemed he could and will turn things around. I loved The Bee Sting – until the end. Each section was narrated by a different member of the family, giving a broader, more complete understanding of their dilemmas. Dickie was deluded, but Cass had potential, and PJ was sweet and curious. Imelda kept surprising me, though. She is the most beautiful woman in their county, uneducated (her sections have no periods or commas), and with a shopping addiction, but also insightful, naïve, and charming – and as doomed as her husband. That naivete did not serve her.(view spoiler)[The last section is told from at least six points of view, its style and tone different than earlier ones. I suspect I would have liked the ending better if it had been told from fewer and more sustained perspectives – and if the characters' beliefs and actions had been less ridiculous.

She vowed that she would not suffer her mother's fate: nameless and lost to history. Jezebel was married off to Ahab, who became king of Israel after his father's death (ruling c. 874–853 BCE). Ahab ""had no chance of becoming nameless. He did not have to fight to make his mark on the land. From the moment of his birth until the day of his death he would be remembered. His name would be recorded in the book of kings even if he was a drunkard king who did nothing but sleep with his concubines and throw dice.” In fact, Ahab was less well-suited to ruling than Jezebel – or than Jezebel would have been if she had been endowed as her brothers had been. Instead, her name has come to be associated with sexually promiscuous and controlling women. She was accused of misleading Elijah and the people of Israel into idolatry and sexual immorality. The make-up she wore on several occasions came to be associated with vice and harlotry.In this retelling of Jezebel's story, Megan Barnard recognized the queen's successes (e.g,, building schools) and acknowledged her mistakes (e.g., killing a man she thought was a demon during a period of postpartum psychosis), yet also suggested her problems were at least partially due to being born female in a patriarchal society and living in a culture that failed to accept hers – while she failed to correctly read Israel's values, beliefs, and norms. Here, Yahweh was portrayed as a vengeful and jealous god, relative to her Tyrean gods, especially Astarte.

And I think it makes us just flatten them, right? Like, they're flattened to just be victims often, and even I was struggling with it."" (Ward in Rascoe, 2023, para. 6)Annis is neither flat nor a victim. She is often starving – literally and figuratively – but she is not a victim. She grieved, but was neither lost nor alone.Not that Annis always recognized this. For much of Let Us Descend Annis descended into a kind of hell, much as Dante's Inferno, which she heard her half-sisters' tutor discussing. She traveled from one hell to another: her sire's rice plantation, the arduous walk to the New Orleans slave markets, the pen where she was kept for sale, a sugarcane plantation. ""Us walking cattle, us goats. Us made to be a herd, but we not. We not"" (p. 53). In her travels through various hells, Annis grieves the loss of her mother, her lover, her home. She grieves her loss of agency: that she must fear grabbing a handful of cornmeal for her day's food, that she is put in the hole without food or water for accepting a raccoon from an escaped slave. For much of the book, Annis is caught in this web, without enough energy to do more than what is demanded of her, even refusing to be awed by a waterfall on her walk, but the spirits all around her direct her, guide her, help her rediscover hope, connect her to her maternal line. They help her read the land, recognize possibilities, and ultimately discover what she wants. Rather than accepting the small bites that Ava, Bastian, and Esther offer, she chose to live life under her own terms. I don’t want to hide in the city, live my days like a rat, cleaving to walls and corners, averting my face, surfacing at night to beg, filch, steal. I don’t want to give over the tender parts of myself to men like the lady’s husband. And I don’t want to settle on the enslaver’s borders, either, even with Bastian, even with Mary, even with Esther, if they are alive, if, with Aza’s help, I could find them. I could never sleep, never laugh, for listening for the baying of the dogs, for the excited shouts of the hands. (p. 276)I was wowed by Let Us Descend. Annis' story is both ugly and awe-inspiring. Her voice was clear, direct, and as thoughtful as her half-sisters were sallow, unsure, and mumbling. …then a family of boar slips through the underbrush, and I watch them go, the bellies of the smallest piglets tickling the earth, and l think: I am not alone.

Against all odds, she earned her PhD in Romance Languages and Literatures, eventually serving as president of Smith College, Brown University, and Prairie View A & M University.Simmons' mother was uneducated, unworldly, and saintly, working long hours, although never learning to drive a car. Her mother was observant and discerning; as a result, ""I began to rely more on the meaning rather than the mere fact of what I was observing"" (p. 48). Her father put food on the table, became a pastor, but his behavior often didn't match his expressed values (e.g., running around with other women, neglecting and beating his children). Simmons attributed her success to her mother's influence, but also a series of mentors, siblings and teachers, who took her under their wings, encouraging and challenging her, providing positive (or negative) role models, and often financial assistance (money and clothes). Although many things went surprisingly well for Simmons, almost unbelievably so, not everything did. She attempted to transfer to Sarah Lawrence and was not admitted to Yale for graduate school, but believes that this worked out anyway. Any failures ""forced me to confront the reality that one path foreclosed is an invitation to consider other opportunities that could be equally, and, possibly even more, satisfying and beneficial"" (p. 201). Simmons described a philosophy that was empowering and that is likely meant as a model for high school and college students struggling to succeed under adverse conditions, and yet I wondered. I have worked with many First Gen college students, presumably most raised under considerably less adverse conditions; yet, most do not navigate the system as easily as she seemed to do so. It felt as though she was attempting to connect the dots to her success, while leaving out some significant ones. Further, while Simmons means to inspire, her language often felt distant.

Charles Dickens wrote before Christmas became a commercial holiday, a godsend for retailers, but in A Christmas Carol, he reminds us that Christmas is much more than the presents. People find joy without presents. More importantly, for Scrooge (and the rest of us), Christmas is a time to re-examine our past, present, and likely futures and reconsider how we want to live our lives.Scrooge was living a life that the Grinch would have envied, ""He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas"" (p. 2). He blamed and ill-treated the poor; yet his night of hauntings – Christmas Past, Present, and Future – was disquieting, as it should have been, and ultimately life-changing. Dickens often painted his characters with a very broad brush, which he pulled out again for Scrooge. However, unlike many of Dickens' unlikable characters, who started bad and stayed bad, Scrooge had an arc and a backstory. Scrooge had been poor and had loved, but in attempting to become financially successful, overshot the mark and lost his sweetheart. Perhaps it's his early humanity that allowed him to change when shown the error of his ways: ""I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!"" (p. 66).This Christmas season, I hope that this can be said of each of us (Christian or not), ""that [we] knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge….

McCarthy and others accused people in government and Hollywood of being communists, many were blackballed and unable to work (e.g., Charlie Chaplain, Orson Welles, Pete Seeger, Lena Horne). When I was a teen, my grandfather railed at the Commie students (at least that's my memory), never against fascists. In all fairness, he lived in a town ""overrun"" with college students, so he was likely complaining about students rather than ""Commies."" When I was a young adult, the US was in a nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union. We were on high alert, believing that one side or the other had a hair trigger. I did not worry about the autocrats that the US supported or put in place.Now, there is a segment in the US (and other countries) wanting an authoritarian government. There are many who criticize anyone they do not like as socialists or communists (and use the terms interchangeably). This is Chief Davis, as quoted by Leon Lewis shortly after their meeting: ""You don’t get it. Hitler’s only trying to save Germany from the Jewish problem. And that the real threat is not from the Nazis and fascists, but it’s from all those Communists in Boyle Heights"" (p. 88).We have not talked about the threat of authoritarian governments with the same level of fear or passion as of communist governments. It seems we should pay as much attention to what is talked about as what isn't. Rachel Maddow's book Prequel is a thoughtful, well-documented, sometimes sarcastic view of the fascist movements (""…in the end they decided that a little coup here or there didn’t necessarily render a man unfit to serve in the highest legislative body in the nation,"" p. 261). Prequel increased my blood pressure and tightened my shoulders: ""One big appeal of fascism, if nothing else, was its unapologetic embrace of cruelty. Cruelty toward others, coupled with hypersensitivity toward any slight to oneself"" (p. 47). Prequel quoted from a wide range of sources about the guile and gullibility of the American public, this from a 1935 Washington Post op-ed: ""…in the career of Huey Long is epitomized the essential weakness of democracy—the pathetic willingness of the electorate to trust a glib tongue and a dynamic personality"" (pp. 39-40). Or from Arthur Derounian (1943), ""Most of the saboteurs of democracy looked and acted like ordinary men and women, went quietly about their work of destruction, lived on Park Avenue as well as Yorkville, came from our best families, and the most efficient of them were American-born and boasted of their ancestry"" (p. 268). Yet, Maddow also reminded me of the anti-fascists, including Leon Lewis, John Metcalfe, Leon Turrou, Arthur Derounian, William Power Maloney, O. John Rogge, Dillard Stokes, and Henry Hoke. They stood up to Nazi sympathizers in Congress and throughout the country, putting their lives, families, and careers at risk in the process. (Why such a long list? We should know about the good guys, too, many of whom have largely disappeared from the history books.)I have tended to believe that politicians and those in authority have our best interests at heart, that bad times in US history have been the exception rather than the rule. As Maddow points out, I am not alone in eliding the parts of American history I don't want to see. It is our long and continuing American tradition to carefully avoid reckoning for the grandest of American sins, especially when they involve alleged (or actual) illegal activity by government officials. Lincoln’s “malice toward none” of the Confederate insurrectionists in the aftermath of the Civil War; Ford’s full and unconditional pardon of Nixon after Watergate; Obama’s reluctance to prosecute anybody for systemized, well-lawyered torture practices during the post-9/11 wars.

Ern's goofy, somewhat incompetent, overlooked by many of his family members, and uses humor as a defense mechanism – and pulls together the disparate threads of this mystery quite masterfully. Is Ern's incompetence and apparent lack of courage an affectation? Will he up his game in his next book?

When the Wager was making this trip (1740), sailors did not have reliable measures of longitude, so might attempt to follow the Chilean coast too soon and run aground. In addition, months aboard a ship, in those days, often led to scurvy due to inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption (Vitamin C). The Wager's crew experienced severe scurvy: pain, fatigue, fever, tooth loss, neuropathy, swelling of the limbs, internal hemorrhaging, depression, confusion, and psychosis. These symptoms led to many deaths.The crew, both before and after they shipwrecked, were starving. In addition to the expected physical symptoms of semi-starvation were psychological ones: obsessive thinking, dreaming, and talking about food; fatigue, irritability, depression, apathy, and reported decreases of mental ability, although perhaps not true losses of mental ability (Baker & Kermidas, 2013). “How many people have I hurt with my indifference, my grouchiness, my overbearing perversion for food?” one of the crew wrote (pp. 113-114). Under these conditions, fearing that one would never get home, it would take a strong leader to keep such an afflicted crew on track. Captain Cheap was not such a leader. Most of the crew still living after the shipwreck were unwilling to follow what sounds to my 21st c ears like a poor plan from an autocratic leader who expected one to follow rather than causing one to want to follow. Nonetheless, failing to follow him could lead to accusations of mutiny and hanging.What the crew went through was truly extraordinary. That a captain would demand it, that a government would expect it, seems unreasonable, almost voluntary slavery (and not always voluntary). As David Grann observed, ""It is precisely such unthinking complicity that allows empires to endure. Indeed, these imperial structures require it: thousands and thousands of ordinary people, innocent or not, serving—and even sacrificing themselves for—a system many of them rarely question"" (p. 248). It is considering this sacrifice that makes this more than an entertaining tale. How do we continue to ask (or require) considerable sacrifice, then blame those who say, ""No, thank you""?And, I love the cover!...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Nov 26, 2023","Dec 03, 2023","Nov 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61854923-the-wager

I'm sure I'm not alone with this among my fiction-loving friends.I loved Diana Evans' use of language in A House for Alice, her use of adjectives to communicate the complicated nature of feelings: ""he’d thought it pretentious, earnest, western, sanctimonious, selfish, self-important, impractical, pseudo-buddhist and yogic, but now he could see her logic"" (p. 199). I enjoyed A House for Alice and kept reading, but this was not a book that I wanted to keep going, not a book that I will keep thinking about.I think there are several reasons. Her language seems designed to impress rather than engage. (I imagine Paul Hollywood's feedback if she were a contestant on Great British Bake Off: beautiful but needs more flavor.) She often used third person omniscient, which can leave one feeling connected but often doesn't. The cast of characters was huge, and I often wondered who a character was and why he/she was there. Some of the characters' dilemmas were such that I, the reader, found myself prompting them from off-stage. (""No! Don't go there!"") Several characters were opaque to the reader – until the end of the book when Evans removed our veils. If this had been a mystery, it would have felt unfair. This doesn't mean that I didn't like any of the characters: Ria, Melissa, and Michael were favorites, while I never liked either Carol or Adel. I liked the political dilemmas the characters faced as Blacks in London – as immigrants, as parents of Black boys, as caregivers to a cantankerous and abusive father, as parents to children with mental health and criminal justice issues, etc. – but I didn't feel that I got new insights in the ways that I'd expected.And, yet… Alice would occasionally say something about her desire to move back to Nigeria that made me think, made me smile:That was why she wanted her own house, to make herself strong again, even just for the leaving. “He take my life,” she said. “I blame myself for stay with him, I didn’t know, I didn’t know where else but be with you children.” Taking her napkin, she wiped it roughly across her face and eyes, then screwed it up in her hand. “I try to feel strong...it’s misfortune, my life is still here...” (p. 315)...more",Notes are private!,2,5,1,"Nov 26, 2023","Nov 27, 2023","Nov 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58950222-a-house-for-alice

North Woods has human characters who thread throughout the book, but its three main characters are time (from the 17th century perhaps into the future); the yellow house, which grows and diminishes across time; and its woods, which also changes in composition with time. These are benign beings, they are the constants. Human beings come and go (and come and go), but we are oft-deluded irritations. They were Witness trees, ""present at important moments in our history. In other words: the ones that witnessed us"" (p. 349). Theirs was an often difficult world, but reading about their world was always engaging, whether it was a woman kidnapped by Indians, a séance making true contact, a True Crime report of three murders, or elm bark beetles having sex.For the larval chambers of the elm bark beetle are nothing short of masterpieces. What might we compare them to? Etched Viking labyrinths? The facial tattoos of certain Pacific Islanders? A giant centipede? But they are nonpareil. Such symmetry, such grace! (pp. 235-236)In North Woods, human often misunderstand each other, especially those who step outside the typical rules of society. These rules were often rigid: opposing homosexuality, abolitionist leanings, and pomomania; condemning people who see and hear spirits, study ecology, date other members of the club, date anyone. These were often equally vile offenses, and those in power could both identify the crime and prescribe the punishment (often severe). Still, these outsiders often saw the world more accurately than the rest of us do: we miss the larger picture.I was about 2/3 through North Woods before I recognized it as more than a series of short stories (and songs and newspaper clippings) set in the same place with occasional crossovers of characters from earlier stories.

My older ""poked"" my younger, who then acted out. Who was the instigator? Who was wrong? (Most people blamed the younger).In some ways, that is what has happened in Palestine (including Israel, whose boundaries have changed throughout the 20th century). During six months in 1948, ""more than half of Palestine’s native population, close to 800,000 people, had been uprooted, 531 villages had been destroyed, and eleven urban neighbourhoods emptied of their inhabitants,"" not because the Palestinians had been attacking Jews, but because Israel wanted the land and wanted to be the majority group in Palestine (p. 17). Israeli leadership claimed that Palestinians left of their own accord, and any backlash was labeled a second Holocaust, even when Jewish mortality was lower than that of Palestinians (Muslims and Christians). Ilan Pappe concluded that portraying Palestinians as Nazis was ""was a deliberate public relations ploy to ensure that, three years after the Holocaust, Jewish soldiers would not lose heart when ordered to cleanse, kill and destroy other human beings"" (p. 126). Ruins from this period were largely removed after 1967 – or reattributed – partly for financial gain, but also ideological memoricide (as when Palestinian sites are renamed with Hebrew ones).The UN's Council for Human Rights (UNCHR) defined ethnic cleansing as ""'separation of men from women, detention of men, explosion of houses’ and subsequently repopulating the remaining houses with another ethnic group"" (p. 27). This is what happened in Palestine (which included Israel, whose boundaries changed throughout the 20th century), where ""more than half of Palestine’s native population, close to 800,000 people, had been uprooted, 531 villages had been destroyed, and eleven urban neighbourhoods emptied of their inhabitants"" (p. 17). Palestinian houses were looted, damaged, destroyed, or seized. Their fields were confiscated; farmers returning to harvest their crops were killed. Palestinian men (from 10-50 in age) were imprisoned or executed. Their holy places were desecrated. Israel violated basic rights including freedom of movement and expression, and of equality before the law. We were murderous, but it was not malice for the sake of malice. We acted out of a sense of being exposed to an existential threat. And there were objective reasons for this feeling. We were convinced that without Jewish territorial continuity, especially along [the aqueduct that runs from the Lake of Galilee to the south of the coutry], the Arabs would poison the water. – Arnon Soffer, quoted on p. 333As Zionists saw it, ""Palestine was occupied by ‘strangers’ and had to be repossessed. ‘Strangers’ here meant everyone not Jewish who had been living in Palestine since the Roman period"" (p. 39). For many Zionists, Palestine was not even an ‘occupied’ land when they first arrived in 1882, but rather an ‘empty’ one. This memoricide and occupation has gone so far as in replacing native species with European ones; only 11% of species in Israeli forests are indigenous.The US and UN have supported such actions, describing most Israeli actions as ""concessions,"" ""reasonable, and ""flexible."" Palestinians have been portrayed as unreasonable, their actions unprovoked. The US has a long history of supporting international actions that are consistent with US needs or policy.Ilan Pappe is an Israeli Jew of German extraction, currently living and working in England. He identifies as a New Historian, a group of historians challenging the standard narrative describing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. I am neither Jewish nor Palestinian, although most of my closest friends have been Jewish. Before reading Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, I tended to view each group as engaged in a vicious, but equal cycle.King Abdullah II of Jordan wrote:[L]et’s start with some basic reality. The fact is that the thousands of victims across Israel, Gaza and the West Bank have been overwhelmingly civilians. In the name of our common humanity, how can such brutal acts and murders be accepted?....If the status quo continues, the days ahead will be driven by an ongoing war of narratives over who is entitled to hate more and kill more. Sinister political agendas and ideologies will attempt to exploit religion. Extremism, vengeance and persecution will deepen not only in the region but also around the world…. It is up to responsible leaders to deliver results, starting now. (Abdullah II,  2023, para. 2, 13, 15)And, while I disagree with much of President Biden's Israel-leaning op-ed, which does not sufficiently separate Hamas' actions from those of Palestinians, I do agree with this:Our goal should not be simply to stop the war for today — it should be to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself. (Biden, 2023, para. 16)Tom Friedman's (2023) article in the New York Times is hopeful: ""I devoted a lot of time on my trip to Israel and the West Bank this month observing and probing the actual day-to-day interactions among Israeli Arabs and Jews. These are always complex, sometimes surprising, occasionally depressing — and, more often than you might expect, uplifting — experiences.

As for the old Jew and his kind that was on this hill, they got all their time back from them that stole everything from ’em. And the Jew lady they wronged, Miss Chona, she got her justice, too, for the King of Kings fixed her up for all the good things she done, lifted her up and filled up her dreams in an instant in only the way He can. (p. 5)The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store is an often philosophical book, with challenges about disability identities and rights, rejecting facile stereotypes. Chona (heart of gold, beloved by several communities, with post-polio syndrome) observed, “I was in town and heard a woman say, ‘That poor crippled woman.’ I thought to myself, Who is the cripple? The one who worships a thing? Or the one who worships something higher?” (p. 28). Anyone with a smidgen of wisdom would recognize that there are cripples in their community, but Chona is not one, despite her limp.I enjoy historical novels sprinkled with real people (mostly musicians here) and places.

Based on Vinegar Girl, I won't be back any time soon.Vinegar Girl is a more palatable version of Taming of the Shrew to this 21st c woman, although less entertaining than the original. In brief, this Katherine is acid-tongued, oppositional (but kind, somewhat against her will), with weak social skills. Her sister Bunny is beautiful, accommodating, and apparently empty-headed. Their father suggests Katherine marry Pyotr to allow his valued research assistant get a green card and stay in the country. Katherine is appalled but eventually discovers that Pyotr is a good guy and, despite some misadventures, they marry and live happily ever after as equals. The end. Vinegar Girl is too talkie, too flat for my tastes. In all fairness, however, I listened to the audiobook. Kirsten Potter narrated and was all snark. To my ear, snark works best in small doses.A three-minute summary of Taming of the Shrew: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw3C4......more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 07, 2023","Nov 18, 2023","Nov 07, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28961937-vinegar-girl

I felt like I had a mild case of vicarious trauma by the middle of the book, as each place I looked, there was a new war or genocide or stolen election. And, yes, that was Africa, although fitting all of Africa's late 20th and early 21st century wars and violence into a single book…? For context, I have a high threshold of tolerance for hearing about psychological pain and a low tolerance for reading about war. I have been (half-jokingly) waiting for a PG-13 version of The Sopranos and The Wire, both of which I enjoyed but had to give up because of their violence. I didn't reject them out of hand, but wanted to be able to see and respond to the joy, the humor, the connections obscured by the violence, all of which Love, Africa also clearly has.Personal space didn’t exist. Grown men walked down the beach holding hands, and once when I was standing in the middle of a pack of fishermen, I felt a set of rough calloused fingers interlace in mine. I liked that. I squeezed back. Wherever I went, so much warmth enveloped me; I could feel it opening me up. It made me think that maybe out here, you didn’t have to move through life hopelessly alone.

She was training as a curandera, which she believed would keep her family safe and grant her autonomy over her own life. Néstor, on the other hand, was working and saving to buy his own rancho. And, against all this, their community was being attacked by vampires. Vampires were both the Yanquis and their enslaved monsters. A vampire attacked Nena when she was 13 and left her apparently dead; Néstor was blamed for ""her death"" and left the rancho. Nena and Néstor were star-crossed and now mistrusting lovers.

How to Stand Up to a Dictator traced Ressa’s often harrowing journey from social media advocate to democracy defender in a system often more interested in protecting profit than public discourse. In 2021, Ressa was awarded the Nobel Peace prize, which she shared with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov.Ressa described the Philippines as “a fraud hub” for “click and account farms, information operations, and the rise of political influencers in the grayer areas of the advertising industry” (p. 124). This didn’t have to be the case. Social media monetizes page views and engagement times, favoring emotionally driven sensationalism. She argued “developments I welcomed in 2011 would soon be fine-tuned by digital platforms’ business models, co-opted by state power, and turned against the people, fueling the rise of digital authoritarians, the death of facts and the insidious mass manipulation we live with today” (p. 105)Mark Zuckerberg did nothing to stop this. She repeatedly showed Zuckerberg how Duterte and his supporters were using Facebook to spread disinformation – but was largely ignored.So, how does one stand up to a dictator? First, hold technology accountable through regulation that protects journalistic standards and ethics. Second, grow investigative journalism. Third, build global communities of action to protect frontline journalism through collaborations among free press, media, and civil society groups. These communities would collaborate to create databases to defend facts and shorten the time it takes to expose lies and correct misinformation.

I I frequently read and enjoy Heather Cox Richardson’s Letters to America, her daily Facebook/email message connecting current and historical events. I enjoyed Democracy Awakening even more. Cox Richardson, a historian of US politics, has an important voice for these times. Cox Richardson notes America’s current struggles are not unique, with this struggle for supremacy of wealthy whites vs egalitarianism was seen at the start of the US, during and then after the Civil War, as the New Deal, and over the last 40 years of the US (especially the last eight). The struggles for equality leave us vulnerable to authoritarianism.Authoritarians rise when economic, social, political, or religious change makes members of a formerly powerful group feel as if they have been left behind. Their frustration makes them vulnerable to leaders who promise to make them dominant again. A strongman downplays the real conditions that have created their problems and tells them that the only reason they have been dispossessed is that enemies have cheated them of power. (p. xii)Even the methods for responding to the liberal consensus repeat: derogation of other groups, evidence-less claims, slanted language about liberals and progressive outcomes (even moderates get called socialists), gerrymandering, restrictions on voting, “Get people fighting first and they can be led toward right-wing politics next” (p. 112). On the one hand, the ideas in Democracy Awakening are disheartening, but at the same time Cox Richardson’s voice is both smart and optimistic.

She described the impact of her search for health on her pocketbook, on the amount she was able to work, and her husband and their marriage. In general, O'Rourke is hopeful about medicine but believes it has fallen far short of what it is capable of accomplishing. In particular, her experience was that it was difficult to get seen, to have doctors share medical records, and to work together. She believed her physicians tended to focus on organs rather than systems and did not emphasize whole health to the degree that they should have (e.g., diet, sleep, stress, exercise).O'Rourke tended to dismiss the role of psychologists, as she heard this as dismissing her experience – it's all in your head. Some of the more integrative work that she wanted she might have found by going to a health psychologist, in or outside of a medical practice.I really liked hearing O'Rourke's experience as patient.

He also observed, albeit at a greater distance, Laudor’s first psychotic break, his time at Yale Law School, and his subsequent decline in less supportive circumstances.At some points, especially at the beginning of The Best Minds, the detail and name-dropping felt excessive. Yes, they were from a privileged area, although not as wealthy as many of the other citizens of New Rochelle, NY. Laudor’s intellect, charm, and connections bought him many advantages, including this 1995 profile in the New York Times, which gave him many opportunities to advocate for the mentally ill.One of the things you gain from Rosen’s narrative is a detailed (overly detailed?) description of the sociopolitical circumstances surrounding his life and the shortfalls of mental health care. Many of these descriptions are useful, as when he was encouraged to cashier at Macy’s following his release from his first hospitalization – a man who chose to go to Yale Law instead. Laudor complained about this, but Rosen did not consider the downside of either option or better alternatives. There are no easy solutions for very bright and capable people for whom stress puts them at risk. Laudor and others who have serious mental illnesses are less likely to be violent than to become the victims of violence, yet one cannot help but feel for Carolyn Costello and her family.

Cars need to be replaced with bikes and public transit. New buildings need to be not only efficient and built of sustainable materials, but also safe for people during increasingly intense heat waves. That means more green space, more trees, more water, more shade, more thermally intelligent urban design.

The evidence that The Claimant was notIn the 1860s, a butcher claimed to be the presumed-dead son of Lady Tichborne and the heir to her vast fortune. The evidence that The Claimant was not, in fact, Sir Roger Tichborne seemed overwhelming: He was much heavier than the remembered Sir Roger and his earlobes were different. He could not remember basic facts of his education and could not even speak French, his first language. Many details of his life during those missing years proved false, including the names of the sailors on the ship that he sailed on. Nonetheless, for his devoted followers, the very audaciousness of his claims argued in his favor: Would a fraud do such a thing, say such a thing? This story is so outrageous, that it has to be false – and isn't. And, it was difficult for this US reader to read The Fraud without thinking about our 45th president and the circuses and conspiracies that encircle him.A lesser author, a less ambitious author, would have clearly identified the fraud (or made connections to our contemporary Claimant); yet, I was never completely certain who the eponymous fraud was: The Claimant and his outrageous attorney? The novelist William Ainsworth, who believed himself a far greater writer than his frenemy Charles Dickens, but who succeeded only when writing about his cousin, Eliza Touchét? Or Touchét, the central viewpoint to The Fraud, who was her cousin's mistress for much of the novel, yet swooned over his first wife? Touchét, who did not quite live up to her high ideals – and was unsettled as she discovered the degree of her class and racial privilege. It seems that Zadie Smith argues that we are all hypocrites, sometimes well-intended ones, but hypocrites nonetheless.A less ambitious author, would have focused on authenticity and fraudulence and drawn them behind clear, bright lines, but Smith's narrative was more complex. She also considered her Black and female characters' search for freedom. What was freedom for a Black man in London, for a slave in Jamaica? Touchét was rendered invisible because of her gender and her age (60s); yet she’s smarter than Ainsworth and a better writer than he was (view spoiler)[– The Fraud may have been Eliza Touchét's own novel (hide spoiler)]. She wanted to be an equal party in literary circles, but was marginalized, ignored, and ridiculed by the male authors – and only knew of her female contemporaries. The Fraud is an epic with an unusual structure that moved back and forth in time, landing sometimes on Touchét's own life and desires, for a while on the trial, and then on Andrew Bogle's harrowing and horrific life as a slave in Jamaica. Most chapters were only a couple of pages long, and most of them described a discrete event (a dinner, a visit, a walk, a conversation). We moved back and forth over the course of Eliza's life, often without clear demarcations.

I teared up near the end, but this was not a grim book despite the content. It is a journey, a Coming of Age book (of an adult male), fitting for a book largely taking place on the road. Historical places, people, and objects reappear more than once in the present.As I said, I Am Homeless If This Is Not My Home is strange, but it is a book that centers the love between two brothers and, especially, between two lovers who often didn't quite connect. It is full of the kind of witty repartee and in-jokes that one often finds in long-term relationships: ""“You’ve been living in your car?” she asked. // For someone who’d been living in the dirt, it seemed high-handed and insensitive"" (p. 104). """"He claims I have inner beauty. // “I wish it would strike outward,” I replied. “It’s best to have things come to the surface"""" (p. 6). ""He knew Lily like the backs of [his hands]—that is, he never looked closely, too busy reading his own palm. But he had loved her always in that necessary, twisted, hurting way"" (pp. 67-68). Or, “You feel the same,” she said. “Fatter,” he said. “No.” “No? You think I’ve always been this fat?” (p. 119)Lorrie Moore talks movingly, thoughtfully, empathically about mental illness:“How can I put this: Lily says she wants to die. It’s what she always says. I just never told you. This has been her other self. Her secret and mine. But the wishing to die isn’t really her. The wish is made into actions and words by her illness. It’s an extra room in the house of her head. It’s like a spider inside of her telling her from its corner to burn down the whole thing.” (p. 28)And despite Lily (or that spider) being difficult, Finn thought of her every pathetic day. The prickle and tingle of her was a phantom limb: his mind was independent and self-starting and did not give up in its attempt to enliven the phantom. And even if the limb remained phantom, he knew it was on permanent standby, waiting for a signal. Suspended sensation encircled his head like cartoon stars after a punch. (p. 30)Lily was buried when we first met her, then decomposing in their cross-country journey. Finn admitted to her decomposition, just as we might talk about the mole that we love on our lover's face: ""She rubbed the roots of her hair until they had the nice grassy smell of a freshly killed stinkbug"" (p. 123).

Even in dying, even in killing, we acknowledge degrees.

Like many of his novels, the poor tend to be more morally virtuous and the wealthy morally bankrupt. His descriptions of factories strike me as believable (e.g., hard working conditions, exploitation by owners), but that of schools are difficult for me to accept as making sense.Mr. Gradgrind’s school focused exclusively on facts and figures rather than inferences, judgment, or values. The arts and imagination were seen as unnecessary. What was unnecessary was also corrupting. On the other hand, and this is not much of a spoiler, Gradgrind’s educational system ground compassion, joy, and morality out of its pupils, leading eventually to the moral problems and poor decisions of both his older children. Louisa, finally recognized the error of her ways and asked her father:“How could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death? Where are the graces of my soul? Where are the sentiments of my heart? What have you done, O father, what have you done, with the garden that should have bloomed once, in this great wilderness here!” (Kindle 3338)In this educational and work-oriented system, what we do matters (and if I have privilege, what I do matters more than people without that privilege). What we purchase matters, just “a bargain across a counter.”It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for. Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase. Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be. Every inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain across a counter. And if we didn’t get to Heaven that way, it was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there.

Harlem Hustle is largely set in Harlem, its story taking place in three interconnected novellas between 1959 and 1964, as he came into himself, as he grew into straight success and embraced his ""bent"" side: ""I may be broke, but I ain't crooked"" (p. 16). Carney's is Harlem Hustle's primary voice, but Freddie and Pepper also share their perspectives, and we (I?) end up liking them, too.An outside observer might get the idea that Carney trafficked quite frequently in stolen goods, but that’s not how he saw it. There was a natural flow of goods in and out and through people’s lives, from here to there, a churn of property, and Ray Carney facilitated that churn. As a middleman. Legit. Anyone who looked at his books would come to the same conclusion. (p. 25). Harlem Hustle is a surprising book. Carney is goal-focused and self-aware – and often consciously (?) underestimates his ""bentness."" He is loyal to a fault and so gets drawn into criminal activity that he shouldn't make it out of(view spoiler)[, yet does: ""It was part of their Laurel and Hardy routine—Freddie sweet-talks him into an ill-advised scheme and the mismatched duo tries to outrun the consequences.

If you're a Carney, ""If you took a step back, if you were keyed in, you might observe these secret forces in action, how it all worked. If you were keyed in"" (p. 154). And, if you did so, you might land on your feet.In this Harlem, who is not bent? Sometimes it feels that everyone’s on the make – police, crooks, and people wearing expensive suits – everyone’s hustling. Hustling is not something that low-level crooks do. Harlem Hustle is set against the history of that period, with Harlem and the 1964 race riots playing a large role. Class played a larger role than race in the three men's lives, but they recognized the ""Harlem Tax,"" when they were ignored or disrespected, and that a Black boy's murder would not put a white policeman in prison.

In 1854 London, cholera was (still) devastating populations, but its cause was unknown. This was before our understanding of germs and bacteria. Microscopes were too poor to identify V. cholerae – although Filippo Pacini had first found them it that same year. Most people attributed cholera to bad air (miasma), which made sense, although it was wrong, as generally the stink of sewage and cholera went together. Common treatments included opium, leeches, castor oil, cleanliness, smoke, and laxatives. Some of these treatments were marginally helpful, others were harmful.John Snow and Rev. Whitehead systematically studied the cholera outbreak near the Broad Street pump. They discovered that (a) more deaths occurred near this pump, particularly among those people who drank the water, (b) people who did not die were unlikely to have drunk the water, (c) physically distant deaths were among people who drank the tasty and ""pure"" water, and (d) ""sanitary"" homes were as likely to have deaths as ""unsanitary"" ones.[image]A modern heat map superimposed on John Snow's original map. Yellow and red indicates more deaths, as does the black bars.The Ghost Map is thought-provoking and engaging, both its science and its communication of the science's historical context. I knew 19th century poor people died young, but in 1842, ""the average 'gentleman' died at forty-five, while the average tradesman died in his mid-twenties. The laboring classes fared even worse: in Bethnal Green, the average life expectancy for the working poor was sixteen years"" (p. 84). Children under five accounted for 62% of all recorded deaths.Steven Johnson attributed the fight against cholera to an ensemble cast, rather than a single Great Man. Edwin Chadwick continues to influence us, as he convincingly argued that the state should protect ""the health and well-being of its citizens, particularly the poorest among them; that a centralized bureaucracy of experts can solve societal problems that free markets either exacerbate or ignore; that public-health issues often require massive state investment in infrastructure or prevention"" (p. 113). Nonetheless, he unwittingly sent thousands of Londoners to early deaths, as he got the public health right although messed up on the science.The Ghost Map tickled my curiosity neurons.

It is variously defined as someone who claims to have magic powers and to be able to use them for good or bad purposes or an ugly and ill-tempered old woman, a hag, or a crone. In Megan Gaddings' dystopia – and, if we're honest, throughout time and across the world – witches are people who defy the status quo, refuse to get married, or maybe just irritate the wrong person at the wrong time. The narrator's mother ""believed that most of what people believed was magic was actually just a way to wash out the accomplishments of women, make their hard work small"" (p. 3). Jo, working at the Museum of Cursed Art of Southern Michigan, believed ""today’s witches were just people who refused to conform, who saw tradition as the shackles and bonds it was"" (p. 27). In this world, somewhat like Atwood's   Handmaid's Tale, women were suspect, black and lesbian women especially, and particularly black women whose mothers were suspected of being witches, as Jo's was. In this world, women were to look toward safety, security, a career. ""All I had to do was shut the fuck up, get married, and try to be good."" But being told that's how we should live removes the pleasure from it. ""All I wanted was to live a life where I knew I wanted to do those things, not because that was how I could survive or because it was expected of me, but because I wanted them"" (p. 49). Being unable to know for sure that she wanted the goals valued by the status quo tainted them.Many of the men in The Women Could Fly are good and caring men, but Gaddings points to the oppressive elements hidden in the ""good"" behavior. We know that burning, drowning, and imprisoning witches is not okay (but happened in that culture), but Jo's father, for example, betrayed her in ways that she initially couldn't afford to recognize.He had let his fourteen-year-old daughter, a girl who was barely sleeping, who was trying to figure out how to exist without her mother, go to this facility alone and be questioned without any warning. He didn’t try to go with me. He never asked me what happened or checked to see whether I was okay. I would read later about these meetings and investigations, about how parents had the right to attend them with their children. Some states don’t let any minors be interrogated for witchcraft without a guardian present. My dad had forfeited these rights and let me go on my own. He had decided his own safety, even over mine, was the most important thing. Or at least that’s how I understood it. Every time the subject of this meeting came up, he left the room or said, “I did what I had to do.” (p. 89)He refused to talk to her at one point when she was suspected of being a witch, when she was being questioned and nearly drowned. He did not pick her up when released or initiate contact. Being an ally requires courage. But it also requires giving them the freedom to be themselves rather than only what we want them to be.I love dystopian novels, including the background paranoia that they implant. The Women Could Fly is difficult to dismiss, as it feels very present day (or maybe 10 years in the future). In this near future, only 5 degrees different from our current one, Gaddings asks us to think about what we sacrifice for our ""safety"" – and what we ask others to sacrifice.

Maintenance of this land is peculiarly dependent upon seismic equilibrium, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the orogenic can establish such. A blow at their bondage is a blow at the very planet. We rule, therefore, that though they bear some resemblance to we of good and wholesome lineage, and though they must be managed with kind hand to the benefit of both bond and free, any degree of orogenic ability must be assumed to negate its corresponding personhood.

It questions how (if) we can save the world, what it means to be human (or fill in the blank), how we are formed and misformed by prejudice:“I’ve done bad things, Daddy, like you probably thought I would. I don’t know how to not do them. It’s like everybody wants me to be bad, so there’s nothing else I can be.” She hesitates, then says what’s been in her mind for months now, unspoken.

Its eponymous heroine was raised believing she was white, although she had a grandparent who was Black. When her father died, her world was upended and she and her mother were sold into slavery. Rather than attempting to pass or marry into white society, her family proudly identified with and became part of the Black community. Iola Leroy is not much of a novel (thus the above is not really spoilers); instead, it reads more like a series of scenes in an abolitionist's play or a script for a debate. “But, Johnson, you do not look like them, you do not talk like them. It is a burning shame to have held such a man as you in slavery.” “I don’t think it was any worse to have held me in slavery than the blackest man in the South.” (p. 40)Some of Frances E. W. Harper's arguments remain current, as this dialogue could profitably be read by Gov. DeSantis and some other US politicians:""I have often heard that colored people are ungrateful, but I don’t think Tom’s worst enemy would say that about him.” “Captain,” said Robert, with a tone of bitterness in his voice, “what had we to be grateful for?

(pp. 46-47)Harper draws her characters in black and white, good and evil, although not solely according to racial lines. She argued in 1861 that African American writers should write about more than politics and slavery, as doing so limited their vocabulary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qoa-i...

(p. 144)When I was in high school, I was full of questions like these. I wondered whether you and I saw the same color as red. I wondered whether what was true for me was also true for you. The adults I knew didn't know what to make of such questions and mostly dismissed them. What would it have been like to have a teacher, like Sarah Viren's Dr. Whiles, who took those questions seriously and helped students develop the skills to question the nature of reality and the stories people tell about them.As Viren observed, while this questioning is a useful and important skill to develop, it can also be a dangerous teaching strategy if not handled well (e.g., the difference between the philosophical freshman year Dr. Whiles and the conspiracy-filled junior year version). Against this backdrop, Viren described the story of her partner – and eventually Viren, herself – being (falsely) accused of sexual harassment by several anonymous students. How does one believe – and we encourage people to believe victims – and fight back? How does one go through this without it damaging one's career, family, and friendships? Viren's story is about truth and survival, but it's about more: Would I have been able to distinguish truth from fears from propaganda? Would I have sided with Socrates? Or those standing beside and among me who wanted to put him to death? The question of justice inherent to those calculations no longer seemed all that abstract. Neither Dr. Whiles nor Jay was a figure like Socrates—I knew that—but I still felt myself, both audience member and author of this much smaller drama, wanting not only to know what was true but also what was just. (p. 158). Dr. Whiles' story alone would make a thrilling book, but it becomes a thought-provoking one when seen against both the political times in the US, which she only briefly talked about, and her history as Dr. Whiles' student. Aren't we always looking at our world through a glass distorted by what happened earlier? Viren clearly recognized this duality, what Virginia Woolf called the ""I now"" and the ""I then,"" and that each influences the other. I am my history, my history is seen through my present eyes. I wouldn't have read The Bigger Lie if it had been a novel, as most thrillers feel far-fetched. The Bigger Lie is far-fetched, but sometimes far-fetched is true. I felt paranoid along with Viren, worried about how students (or professional enemies) might spread rumors that would hurt me and my family. Not far-fetched in these times.One narrative that analysts tell about conspiracies is that those subscribing to conspiracy theories are less well-educated and less intellectually-gifted. One of the interesting things is that Dr. Whiles was clearly thoughtful and well-read, yet fell down a conspiracy rabbit hole, taking a number of his students with him. Subscribing to conspiracy theories is about more than poor critical thinking skills.Viren originally published this story in the New York Times.

She also clearly outlined how out of control her behavior had been between ages 11-16, but also observed how clueless she had been as she tried to support herself, traverse relationships, and stay safe. Relative to Westover, who'd emphasized the psychological trauma she'd experienced, she observed her blanket ignorance, which set her apart and put her life at risk.I want to say that my parents did the best they could under the circumstances and with the resources they had. But I don’t think this is true. I don’t think they did their best. (p. 280). Still, Snyder did not skip from out of control to professor at American University. She outlined her journey and the ways that she had struggled. She blamed herself rather than acknowledging her grief and normal reactions to being moved three states away to a new family, a new religion, new school, new life. However, rather than focusing on her adolescence (okay, 45% of the book did), she described the ways that she leveraged her ways out of a hand-to-mouth existence and began solving a series of problems with equal parts of chutzpah and ""found"" social support. Part of her recovery involved traveling the world, both out of curiosity, but also her work as a journalist working on human rights issues.

That narrative can focus on Great Men, people (men) in power, wars and diplomacy, etc. It often doesn't focus on new immigrants, the underclass, women, and the contradictions in their experiences. In Buddha in the Attic, Julie Otsuka provides a short history of early 20th century ""picture brides"" from Japan, not by describing the typical experience (was there a typical experience???), but by giving a range of experiences and asking the reader to abstract a central quality, much like a pointillist painting (e.g., Georges Seurat). Otsuka had started her career as a painter. Was that her intention?Here Otsuka describes the panic following Pearl Harbor, but before Japanese immigrants and their American-born children and grandchildren were interned in concentration camps:It was nearly impossible to get your name on the list. It was extremely easy to get your name on the list. Only people who belonged to our race were on the list. There were Germans and Italians on the list, but their names appeared toward the bottom. The list was written in indelible red ink. The list was typewritten on index cards. The list did not exist. The list existed, but only in the mind of the director of military intelligence, who was known for his perfect recall. The list was a figment of our imaginations. The list contained over five hundred names. The list contained over five thousand names. The list was endless. Every time an arrest was made another name was crossed off the list. Every time a name was crossed off the list a new name was added to it. New names were added to the list daily. Weekly. Hourly. (pp. 83-84)Otsuka's paragraphs captured the diversity of opinions, approaches, beliefs, and responses of the picture brides, but she often used the first person plural, ""we"" – although not in the examples here. Perhaps as they became acculturated into the more individualistic American society, their voices and experiences were named for the first time later in the book. ""There was an old man from Gilroy who left on a stretcher. There was another old man—Natsuko’s husband, a retired barber in Florin—who left on crutches with an American Legion cap pulled down low over his head. 'Nobody win war. Everybody lose,' he said. Most of us left speaking only English, so as not to anger the crowds that had gathered to watch us go"" (p. 105). Buddha in the Attic feels like poetry – broad and simple strokes carrying deeper levels of meaning. Imagine a different, non-contradictory list of suggestions for how to interact with white Americans. Would it be as effective? Would it tell us as much about this group and that time? Stay away from them, we were warned. Approach them with caution, if you must. Do not always believe what they tell you, but learn to watch them closely: their hands, their eyes, the corners of their mouths, sudden changes in the color of their skin. You will soon be able to read them. Make sure, however, that you don’t stare. With time you will grow accustomed to their largeness. Expect the worst, but do not be surprised by moments of kindness. There is goodness all around. Remember to make them feel comfortable. Be humble. Be polite. Appear eager to please. Say “Yes, sir,” or “No, sir,” and do as you’re told. Better yet, say nothing at all. You now belong to the invisible world. (pp. 25-26)Buddha in the Attic was moving in a way that I found unexpected.

Although she wrote for faculty working with high school and college students, her observations and suggestions are equally useful for other people working with students in this age group and for other people struggling with anxiety and depression.Mind over Monsters presents a wider range of suggestions for preventing anxiety from ruling us than I had expected, especially as she did not explicitly discuss challenging automatic thoughts – at least in the ways that a clinical psychologist would do. She used psychological research, interviews with students and experts in the field, and her personal experiences (she has had panic attacks and periods of selective mutism) to describe a nuanced way to handle anxiety successfully and handle high school college well. Bottom line, she recommends compassionate challenge, with equal emphasis on both compassion and challenge and makes a compelling case for this approach to teaching (or working with this age group).Among many other things, Cavanagh discussed going toward achievable tasks rather than avoiding them, matching anxiety to the task, recognizing that not all anxiety is a monster, supporting physical health and safety, learning to accept that some discomfort is normal (and health-guiding), and creating warm and safe environments (not cushioning). Adults need to create challenging but achievable environments, where students can succeed with appropriate work. She argued that ""accommodating the student’s anxiety permanently also communicates that the anxiety is a core feature of the person, that it isn’t malleable or subject to change"" (p. 51). Instead, we should be communicating, ""I think you’re amazing. I think you are so smart, and so strong. Let’s do this together. I am here to support you” (p. 115). I enjoyed Mind over Monsters a lot. Cavanagh is a clear and entertaining storyteller who offers strong and compelling examples. She's a bit like me as a gardener: she likes a bit of chaos rather than a well-tended formal garden.

What you believe you know about almost everyone is wrong: some surprise you with their kindness and unexpected competence, others not so much. Elizabeth Strout gives us multi-layered characters and offers few answers, easy or otherwise. This means that The Burgess Boys is a low simmer of a book, even its climax might leave you expecting that more is still to come. This is an Indie film, not a Hollywood blockbuster. If the latter, the climax might have taken place in Act 1, Scene 2. Instead, the foreplay is comprised of confusion and incomprehension – between parent and child, among siblings, across classes, and across cultures. All you know is that you don't know. ""Because two people can’t have entirely different opinions without one of them being final"" (Kindle Loc. 3639).Living in a world where constantly one turned and touched incomprehension—they did not comprehend, he did not comprehend—gave the air the lift of uncertainty and this seemed to wear away something in him, always he felt unsure of what he wanted, what he thought, even what he felt. (Kindle Loc. 1328)Much of this story takes place internal to the family, even as it plays out in the community and across the nation. The Somali characters who recently moved to Shirley Falls, Maine, offer especially interesting perspectives on American life.""Americans really did not understand desperation. It was easier, and certainly more pleasing, to view the Gulf of Aden as a lawless place where Somali pirates reigned.""

Kuang lambastes authors, the publishing system, readers of GR and Twitter, and everyone and everything else in Yellowface. She has an unreliable narrator, June Haywood, who is whiney and unlikeable, sees the people around her as getting unfair advantages (Haywood is the kind of white Progressive that DiAngelo was talking about in Nice Racism), and sets up a variety of problematic interactions as a result. I felt dirty spending time with June – and the people in her world – and yet I kept reading. A long hot shower was in order after finishing this book that had not a single unmitigated good guy.A three sentence summary: Brilliant, talented, and beautiful Athena Liu choked on a pancake and died. June Haywood – not as BTB as Liu – ""lifted"" Liu's unfinished manuscript and finished it. BTW, Haywood is white, writing a book about Chinese laborers in WWI.You may not agree with everything here (I don't), but she's right that the road to success can be unfair. Publishing picks a winner—someone attractive enough, someone cool and young and, oh, we’re all thinking it, let’s just say it, “diverse” enough—and lavishes all its money and resources on them. It’s so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one’s prose. Athena—a beautiful, Yale-educated, international, ambiguously queer woman of color—has been chosen by the Powers That Be. (pp. 5-6)Haywood avoids blame and justifies everything she does, ""It’s not like I took a painting and passed it off as my own. I inherited a sketch, with colors added only in uneven patches, and finished it according to the style of the original. Imagine if Michelangelo left huge chunks of the Sistine Chapel unfinished. Imagine if Raphael had to step in and do the rest"" (p. 36). She sees herself as knowledgeable enough to write a Chinese history, but her understanding is very thin: ""it’s important to be anti-PRC (that’s the People’s Republic of China) but pro-China (I’m not terribly sure how that’s different)"" (p. 71). And Haywood recognizes Liu's brilliance, but also puts her down, ""The original draft made you feel dumb, alienated at times, and frustrated with the self-righteousness of it all. It stank of all the most annoying things about Athena. The new version is a universally relatable story, a story that anyone can see themselves in"" (p. 45). That is, ""universally relatable"" if you're white. And, she's most racist when protesting it. As one er in the text said: she ""uses the suffering of thousands of Chinese laborers as a site for melodrama and white redemption” rather than as an opportunity to excavate a forgotten history (p. 99). Okay, I don't need to tell you more, except that everyone piles on building a good product, loving the book, then hating it, then hating Haywood. Accusations fly, with interesting questions all the way around. (If someone tells you their personal story and you use it in a story you publish, is that also theft?)The truth is fluid. There is always another way to spin the story, another wrench to throw into the narrative. (p. 317)Earlier this week, Stevens (2023) argued that ""audiences are finally getting to see all dimensions of the Asian American experience — even the weird, bad and raunchy parts"" and that this is good for Asian Americans.

I read it in fewer than four days, often in large gulps. Fifty-two percent of GR ers rate Cutting for Stone five stars, 15% three or fewer. I am in the former group. I loved Cutting for Stone. I love epics and the space they allow us to observe personal, cultural, and historical changes, especially when they cover three continents, as this does, although time on each continent is not equal. I wouldn't have imagined that I would have followed – and enjoyed – Abraham Verghese's lengthy descriptions of medical decisions and procedures and of Ethiopian politics. I did. I love reading/watching anything that one does with passion. They are also compassionate, thoughtful, and sometimes downright funny.The five major figures in this book are surgeons and passionate about their work. The narrator is one of a pair of conjoined twins, Marion and Shiva Praise Stone, who were separated at birth, and born to a nun who died in childbirth. Their purported father abandoned them shortly after their mother's death, and they were adopted and raised by a pair of loving and joyful physicians in their Mission Hospital (called ""Missing"" by all). Many of Verghese's points were made through stories and aphorisms. (Many people parent this way, right?) One important story was the Abu Kassem story: a miserly merchant held onto his battered, much repaired slippers, despite them being objects of derision and hateful even to himself, yet every attempt to get rid of them led to disaster. Everything we see, do, and touch, every seed we sow or don’t sow, becomes part of our destiny. (view spoiler)[""Shiva, do you see how deflowering Genet, a biological act as far as you were concerned, led to all this? It led Rosina to kill herself, led Genet to stray from us? It led to this moment where I hate the woman I hoped to marry?"" (p. 446).  (hide spoiler)] The beauty of the Abu Kassem story is that to get rid of the slippers, we have to admit they are ours. Once we do, the ""slippers"" will get rid of themselves.Like R. K. Narayan’s Man-eater of Malgudi, one of the family's read-aloud books, the Stone world “boring” in its small details, but also ""interesting and even funny."" They were ""imprisoned by habit, by profession, and by a most foolish and unreasonable belief that enslaved them; only they couldn’t see it"" (pp. 256-257). What should we hide? What should we share? What should we strive for and why? ""This was what growing up was about: hide the corpse, don’t bare your heart, do make assumptions about the motives of others. They’re certainly doing all these things to you"" (p. 331). Even these brilliant, compassionate, and wise people were often misguided.Like his narrator, Verghese was born in Addis Ababa of parents of Indian descent. He ended up in the US during Ethiopia's Civil War (1974), later doing medical school in India. Verghese is now professor of medicine at Stanford Universities, where he encourages doctors to place themselves in their patients’ shoes. His motto is “Imagine your patient’s experience.” He won the National Humanities Medal in 2015. Several times the elder Dr. Stone asked, ""Tell us, please, what treatment in an emergency is administered by ear?” (p. 520). The answer, of course, is ""words of comfort."" That comfort and empathy undergirded the work of each effective physician in this book.The book-loving members of my family urged me to read Cutting for Stone to ready for Covenant of Water.

But when the traumatic events are of human design, those who bear witness are caught in the conflict between victim and perpetrator. It is morally impossible to remain neutral in this conflict. The bystander is forced to take sides. (pp. 14-15)Unfortunately, people tend to want a world that makes sense and is fair (a Just World) and, further, align with power (e.g., parents, men, authority figures). As a result, bystanders often have a difficult time believing trauma victims, especially those experiencing interpersonal trauma. Imagine being accused of causing your own abuse. Imagine people blaming and shaming you for what you do to survive. Remember, level of social support is one of the strongest predictors of a range of positive outcomes. As she wrote, ""Traumatic events destroy the sustaining bonds between individual and community"" (p. 307). Herman reminds readers that trauma is not an equal opportunity destroyer. People who had early adversity (including early trauma), were less well-educated, have family members with drug and alcohol problem or in prison, and have fewer social supports post-trauma were more likely to develop chronic PTSD.Despite being first published in 1992, Judith Herman's Trauma and Recovery does bit feel dated; she outlined the dominant narrative that continues to control conversations on trauma. She continues to be referenced regularly, with people filling in the details rather than drawing a whole new picture. Most treatment still emphasizes the roles of the therapeutic relationship and traditional talk therapy. People continue to aver that effective treatment follows three stages (Safety, Remembrance, Reconnection) – although therapists do not invariably follow this process.My edition of Trauma and Recovery has afterwords from 2015 and 2022. Herman's updates remind us of what changes there've been in the 30 years since her first publication: changes in placement of PTSD in the DSM-5 and an addition of complex posttraumatic stress disorder to the ICD; a focus on the role of Adverse Childhood Experiences in poor physical and mental health outcomes; the role of attachments with early caregivers in preventing/reducing trauma; early intervention programs to improve outcomes; and more. Trauma and treatment of trauma continue to be a source of productive writing and research, but as much as anything, we need to focus on advocacy.

Unfortunately, 12th century Britain was embroiled in a family feud between cousins King Stephen and Empress Maud. Family feuds over a throne generally lead to war and death. Thomas of Bristol was killed during St. Peter's Fair. Was this related to the strife plaguing the land, to a theft gone wrong, a grudge, or...?

He was still very young, there were excuses to be found for him. Brother Cadfael had more sense, and no such scruples. The manifold gifts of God are there to be delighted in, to fall short of joy would be ingratitude. (p. 14). So, Cadfael. Cadfael sensitively observes the crime scene, the players, and their world, then rights this world; nonetheless, he shares the stage well. In this case, he shared with Emma and Rhodri ap Huw, who are each sound observers in their own right, thoughtful and brave. In all or most Cadfael mysteries, the central dilemma is feminist in nature – which is surprising since Cadfael is a monk, his companions are mostly male, and the mysteries are set in a Benedictine abbey. Saint Peter's Fair is the fourth book of the Brother Cadfael series.

The type of relationship, the type of death matter in predicting how I will respond and grieve. For me, Jane's death was one of the worst things in my life – I spent at least my first year of college depressed – and, paradoxically, one of the most important and transformative events. As a result of her death, I learned life is unpredictable and can be short, that one never knows when a person will leave, and that there is a possibility for great joy as well as great pain. ""The sky was gorgeous and calm, but what if a hurricane struck and my friends were stranded? It suddenly made sense to always assume the worst"" (p. 140). And yet, as Viktor Frankl asserted, life is marked, if not defined by suffering and our response to it.Jane and I had gone to an all-weekend outdoor concert several days earlier, but I hadn't seen or talked to her between the concert and her death, not even to tell her that I had gotten my driver's license. (This was before cell phones and easy access to cars.) For a long time, I felt guilty about not having seen or talked to her. ""I believed I had somehow allowed all this to happen"" (p. 124). What I am saying is that Hua Hsu's Stay True, a story of friendship, books, writing, and grief, was different from my experience (his friend was murdered, for example), but also similar. Death often comes with all sorts of other emotions – and that person can hang around for years, in both positive and negative ways.Hsu wrote, ""This is a book about being a good friend, a term that only occasionally applies to me"" (p. 195). While this may be true, he did a fine job describing friendship. One can be good friends even if nothing alike. That push and pull in a relationship can be exciting. As he noted in a letter to Ken following his death, ""'I don’t care if you can see through me,' I wrote, confessing to a list of imperfections and insecurities. 'Just as long as you can see me'"" (p. 165). Often books written by men feel stiff and only deal with some parts of the emotion spectrum (e.g., anger, resentment, frustration). I liked reading and ""watching"" the central relationship here, as well as Hsu's relationship with his father, who was often living and working in Taiwan. I would have wanted to have been part of their larger friend group. I also liked that Stay True is by a Taiwanese-American, writing about a Japanese American, each with different immigration histories and family. Their ethnicity is present, without being all-consuming, as they are also people obsessed with music, sitcoms, books, the subtexts of each – and just growing up....more",Notes are private!,1,29,1,"Jun 05, 2023","Jun 07, 2023","Jun 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60429621-stay-true

I love a good epic, one where characters are not entrapped by a single storyline, but allowed to grow, change, and show multiple sides of themselves. Where people live but also die, as we all must eventually do. Where the story is not linear in time, but intertwines several stories (here: war, art, and coming of age). Each of the major characters is a square peg in a round hole world, but deserves a world that lets them be who they truly are.Whalebone Theatre takes place over a 55+ year period (1890 to sometime well after 1945), although is largely set during WW2 (1939-1945). It largely takes place in Dorset (the author's home), which feeds some of the magical aspects of the story, but also plays an important role in the war, being the part of England closest to France. [image]Durdle Door, DorsetCristabel, the Veg (later Flossie), and Digby Seagrave, siblings, but not quite, are the center of Whalebone Theatre. I would say that they were raised by aristocratic wolves, but wolves would rightly feel slandered. Their parents are wealthy dilettantes, who drink and collect artists and sexual partners. Cristabel is a headstrong girl interested in her world – including the whale that washed up on their beach – and stories. Under her tutelage, they – and the adults they roped in – began performing the Illiad and Shakespeare.One GR er commented, ""I've never taken to the idea that books can be too white, too middle-class and too, well, sort of First World Problem-y."" You can hear the ""but…"" Many of the adults were each of these ""toos."" Their mother was typecast as Helen of Troy: ""But you must show through your face that you know the man you love is a dilettante. A man who chose beauty over wisdom"" (p. 161). She was later painted holding realistic roses but ""there is only the outline of her body and a swirly blur where her face should be"" (p. 199). The children (later young adults) rarely complained and were intensely loyal, hardworking, curious, and willing to do the right thing, despite the high risks incurred by what they were doing (undercover agents working with the French Resistance).I've read many WW2 books. Although the Seagraves were privileged and protected from some of the worst of the war, Joanna Quinn let them be three-dimensional: to take risks, make mistakes, to love and grow, not only starve in the cold and the dark. This was a thrilling story – and not just the spy parts.

They are often literally there as San worked in a flower shop for much of this short novel, but they also serve as metaphors: shrinking violets, Venus flytraps, surprising papaya palms. Kyung-Sook Shin clarified this double meaning when, for example, San looked up ""violets"" in her Korean/English dictionary and began reading the definitions surrounding it: Violator: Noun, one who breaks rules, invades, insults, rapes Violence: Noun, a disturbance, disruption, destruction Violet: Noun, a plant, a swallow flower … purple, the color, also used to describe … an oversensitive person, a shy person (“shrinking violet”) Violin: Noun, a musical instrument … a player of, a violinistSan is this shrinking violet, small and lost, surrounded by violence and violators – abandonments, rejections, repressed desire, fire, obsessions, kidnapping, and sexual assault – and also beauty, but the violence overpowered the beauty and later she only saw the violence: ""violets, violence, violator."" Her memory was incomplete and even radically distorted by earlier experiences. And, this distorted memory impacted her choices: turning away from the kind and toward those who ""look like they want to eat her."" These distortions blinded her to the choices she had. Violets was written in short, declarative sentences by an omniscient, yet distant narrator. Kyung-Sook Shin began:A little girl.One day in July, rain pours from the skies. In a house with shut doors, a mother closes her eyes as the baby's grandmother offers her the newborn. The mother knows what will happen now. An uncelebrated girl. The infant accepts her mother's closed eyes in lieu of a loving caress, perhaps having intuited her fate from the womb, and does not bother crying.This narrative choice was fitting for a protagonist who barely had a voice, who was dissociated from her feelings, and often was an object acted upon but rarely able to fight back successfully. In her afterward, Shin noted ""there are women all around us who exist in silence, anonymous and without anything special about them; she could be me and she could be you.""

Fires in the Dark is largely, ""a love song to psychotherapy,"" a phrase that she would have used to subtitle this book (Schwartz, 2023).Her description of psychotherapy is like that of a courageous journey with a fearless guide. Jamison – and the healers she quoted – describe this journey as often difficult and sometimes paradoxical: ""to treat, even to cure, is not always to heal"" (p. 3). Strong healers are curious, a refuge, at ease with ambiguity, comfortable with complexity, They help their clients (others prefer to talk about them as ""patients"") to feel safe, to make ""intolerable memories tolerable"" (p. 60), and hold ""an unshakeable belief in … the ability to get well, compete, and make a difference"" (p. 160). To heal is to recognize what was lost and to reshape that loss into something good. It often has a spiritual basis.Jamison referred to a number of healers, most of whom were active in WWI. Almost all were white males, although she quoted some war nurses, as well as some fictional characters (e.g., T. H. White's Merlyn and P. L. Travers' Mary Poppins). She especially focused on the trauma of war. Clearly, early 20th century is where Jamison's reading heart is, but as psychotherapy is a diverse field, focusing her reading there limits the kind of conclusions she could draw about psychotherapy, which she sees as generally long-term and insight-oriented, rather than emphasizing solution-focused treatments, Ericksonian hypnosis, or family therapy treatments.Despite this limitation, Fires in the Dark is an engaging set of musings, although its path is not always clear.

This is something we would have naturally grown out of, like our nondisabled friends, but we live in an inaccessible world, so we have not. We loved our parents but we relished our freedom from them…. The freedom we felt at camp was not just from our parents and our need for their daily assistance in order to live our lives. We were drunk on the freedom of not feeling like a burden, a feeling that was a constant companion in our lives outside of camp. (pp. 24-25)This new way of thinking about the world is one that my colleague needed, but Heumann made clear that so did many of the disability activists: ""People had been internalizing the idea that our barriers were our individual problem for so long it was hard to shift. People had to get out of the habit of thinking “I can’t get up the steps because I can’t walk” and get used to thinking “I can’t get up the steps because they’re not accessible.”"" (pp. 111-112).

UntIn 1847, when Tenant of Wildfell Hall was published, it was illegal for women to own property, seek a divorce, or keep children from their father. Until 1870, a married woman in England had no legal existence independent from her husband. Two became one with marriage, although that one was the husband. When the Married Women's Property Act 1870 passed, married women were allowed to be the legal owners of the money they earned and could inherit property.Tenant of Wildfell Hall should be read in this context. Women, their children, and their products were property – sometimes valued property, but property nonetheless.If all was good, life was good. But, in that context, particularly because couples had little knowledge of each other and well-to-do people had little meaningful to do, they experienced a series of related problems: objectification, leading to jealousy, flirtations, affairs, gossip, drug and alcohol abuse, and domestic violence. Mrs. Huntingdon, a strong, thoughtful (and beautiful) woman was doubly oppressed: by society's expectations and laws and by Christianity, which kept her encaged, even after she left her husband. She returned to help her husband after he became ill (maybe Type II diabetes). He was no longer physically abusive, but remained financially and emotionally controlling and abusive.Many men and women in Anne Brontë's novel were scoundrels, although the men were often worse, as they had looser social norms keeping them in place. Charlotte and Emily Brontë's heroes were fixer uppers, tortured souls. Anne Brontë took a clearer feminist perspective on her characters, refusing to glamorize an oppressive man (view spoiler)[although Gilbert Markham got away with jealousy and violence (against other men) (hide spoiler)].

What does this say about us that we want a rom com (Jane Austen) or brooding Gothic (Charlotte or Emily Brontë) rather than Anne Brontë?After Anne's and Emily's early deaths, a publisher asked Charlotte to prepare new editions of her sisters’ novels, as a tribute to them. Charlotte happily did this for Emily's Wuthering Heights and Anne’s Agnes Grey, but would not do so for Tenant of Wildfell Hall. She told them that Tenant ""hardly appears desirable to preserve.

We all occasionally disassociate and do so without knowing it – as when we drive down the highway and miss our exit, when we are ""unfeeling"" after a personal tragedy, when we capably walk and chew gum.Martha Stout capably describes both the normal dissociations and the more problematic types of dissociation. She observed that some people's dissociation, while more florid, may be easier to treat, as they are more willing to take responsibility for their behavior. Others' may not be as apparent, yet more difficult to give up.This book was written in 2001, which is important to note. That was the end of the period where therapists were doing hypnosis with possible trauma victims and discovering Satanic cults and all sorts of other things. Psychotherapy is now more in a middle ground on this issue. We no longer deny child abuse, as had been common into the middle of the 20th century (although there is a lovely article in the New York Times about parental alienation syndrome that indicates that this denial continues).

I Have Some Questions for You is a complicated mystery exI haven't read anything by Rebecca Makkai before, but I Have Some Questions for You sold me. I Have Some Questions for You is a complicated mystery examining the murder of the narrator's boarding school roommate – rich, beautiful, white – and a search for answers, especially regarding apparently falsely accused athletic trainer at her school. A successful podcaster, her students at her alma mater, and social media obsess on the murder (remember: rich, beautiful, white girl) and its probable miscarriage of justice (somewhat immature Black man, outside the boarding school's power hierarchy). The last book I ed flattened its story: a simple and straight line from birth through adulthood. In I Have Some Questions for You, its narrator is a smart, successful, insightful, and messy hypocrite who drank too much. Her memories of herself as a broken outsider were repeatedly challenged (who of us did not feel like an outsider?); in fact, she often reinterpreted events 20 years earlier. She tried out and rejected eight possible murderers – including herself – and asked many questions of herself, our culture, and the man to whom she was writing.Makkai suggested we are all messy hypocrites – and likely less insightful than Bodie (probably no accident that her name looks like body???). When accusations of sexual abuse were raised against her ex, Bodie refused to see the two cases as similar (her ex's accuser was four years older than the murdered girl). One had agency, the other was just a teen. When do we obtain agency and control? Or was the accuser looking for success and fame in all of the wrong places? Who was the hypocrite? Who the schemer?Makkai wove several stories together into a cohesive whole – the murder; emotional, sexual, and physical violence against women; #metoo; cancel culture; sexual violence in the news; Bodie's podcasts and book; policing and imprisonment of Blacks; and garden variety relationship problems – arguing that these couldn't be understood in isolation. Anonymized lists of violence against women recur repeatedly. Violence surrounds us – and we accept it.It was the one where the woman who stabbed her rapist with scissors was the one who ended up in jail. It was the one where the star had a secret button to lock the doors…. It was the one where the harasser ended up on the Supreme Court. It was the one where the rapist ended up on the Supreme Court. It was the one where the woman, shaking, testified all day on live TV and nothing happened. (p. 62). Makkai did not flatten these stories; she was outraged. She described the casual ways that apparently good guys (growing up to be human rights lawyers) tolerate, support, and even laugh at terrible behavior. She observed that the murderer's actions took place in a system that put the murdered girl at risk and covered up for him. Men and women accepted bad male behavior – due to power differentials, the desire for acceptance or money, loyalty, or a lack of insight and awareness.(view spoiler)[ The good news? While the murderer may have gotten away with it, one of the others likely paid the price for his crimes: ""And maybe you’re the missing piece of the puzzle. You, Robbie’s motivation. You, who knew a lot about a lot of things and never said them. You, with a front-row seat to what went wrong. You, a big part of what went wrong"" (p. 430). (hide spoiler)]How should we raise young girls? “""It feels wrong to give [little girls] all this happiness and confidence when we know what’s coming. Seventh grade’s gonna hit like a wall. It feels like fattening a pig for slaughter.” // But what was the alternative? Starving the pig?"" (p. 404). There are plenty of bad men here (and girls and women), but I Have Some Questions for You is also peopled by men and women who are ethical, work hard, search for justice, and change their minds. Some characters leave you feeling dirty, but others make you proud to walk the same Earth. Many feel like real people and left me caring deeply for them. They left me hopeful about the future. “The victory we’ve achieved is that Omar knows there are so many people who believe him.

She thinks that one of my friends is involved in a government conspiracy. She watches Wheel of Fortune and thinks that the puzzles are sending her secret messages” (p. 146). She also had periods of food avoidance and anorexia, as well as agoraphobia.If all Cho did, however, was describe what it was like to live with someone with this diagnosis, it would make Tastes Like War one of many similar books. As she said in the introduction for Part III, ""Schizophrenia is the story of way that poverty, violence, and being on the wrong side of power drive us mad"" (Marrow & Luhrmann, 2016). Cho detailed how systems of oppression, including US imperialism in Korea, contributed to her mother's symptoms and disease. Cho's story was not just about her mother; in fact, she often made inferences about her mother's early life given what she knew about Korea's history and the Korean women who immigrated here, as her mother rarely talked about her life in Korea. Cho captured the gendered racism against Korean girls and women there and abroad and described her mother's and her own experiences of racism and sexism growing up in a predominantly white town in the state of Washington. She outlined how sociocultural factors influence our individual psyches. Although Cho described her mother's schizophrenia and agoraphobia, she also spent almost the first half of Tastes Like War describing her mother's strengths: her hard work, her skills in identifying mushrooms and providing for her family, her love, and her hope that her daughter will have a better life than she had. Although she had difficulty seeing them when she was a teenager – relatively few teenagers see their parents' strengths – she still saw glimpses of them as an adult.Cho turned to her academic work and her baking and cooking to make sense of her mother’s life and to grieve her mother's loss, to help her mother remember and talk about her childhood. Food always has meaning: nurturance, wealth, security, comfort. For Cho's mother, cheeseburgers, one of her favorite American foods, ""was a complex symbol of survival and subordination, a luxury item that the Americans could afford to throw away while Koreans starved. For my mother, it also symbolized all the hope and possibility that America had to offer"" (p. 274). * * *I have always wondered about how family and friends feel about a memoirist's work. I suspect that most never read these memoirs for any of a number of reasons. In this case, Cho's brother wrote an angry screed arguing that he believed Tastes Like War should be considered fiction (his family seemed to pick up on single words rather than the overall gestalt). Different people in the same family – my own, for example – can have different experiences of that family. In fact, their fight about the nature of the facts and apparent shame about the events described seems to mirror our avoidance of the possible involvement of societal traumas in the etiology of schizophrenia.In a response to her brother's GR , Cho's partner wrote, ""Grace has set out to honor her mother’s memory through her work. Her family’s actions do the opposite."" Putting a parent's behavior into a broader context would be one very effective way of honoring them: You're not crazy, you make sense. I choose to work to understand you.Regardless, it seems likely that Cho's mother would never have wanted this in-fighting, either in public or in private....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"May 08, 2023","May 10, 2023","May 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56047271-tastes-like-war

Her parents were physically and emotionally abusive (think golf clubs, fists, and chopsticks, not prime parenting material); she was a panicked then out of control parentified child. Ultimately, she was abandoned by both parents (her father sent her grocery money, and she continued to live alone in her childhood home). Other ers describe her childhood as ""harrowing,"" which is quite fair, although I didn't find the reading difficult (but this is me).Foo clearly described the consequences of abuse and abandonment: somewhat paranoid interpretations of others' behavior, frequent mistrust, easily triggered anger and stress, expectations of abandonment. Connect the dots, and these are easily related to childhood dynamics.Foo then reported her tempestuous journey in search of healing: EMDR, mindfulness, internal family systems therapy, various coping strategies. A number of these treatments were somewhat helpful for her, but she often dealt with therapists and physicians who made me uncomfortable. (Really, there are some very warm and competent therapists available. If your first is not a good fit, try another.) Foo eventually found the psychologist Jacob Ham, who listened deeply to her and helped her learn to listen to and be there for herself and others as well. Foo included some segments from her therapy in the audiobook; listening to these segments was likely more powerful for me than only reading their transcripts.I also really appreciated Foo's curiosity about Asian immigrants and their histories of trauma both in their first country and this one and how this trauma might have played out for her parents and Asian communities, as a whole. Racial trauma is not just set aside as one moves from one generation to the next, but reinfects members of later generations unless put to rest. Her ultimate description of tiger parents (and frankly abusive ones) was thoughtful, contextualized, and compassionate.People with histories of abuse and neglect are often pathologized and misunderstood. They are often described as unable to heal or fully recover.

He is an interesting salesperson, as he often shares his skepticism but is clearly enthralled by hallucinogens, although wants to use them in the right environment with the right guide. I started reading How to Change Your Mind – and his more recent, This is Your Mind on Plants – as a skeptic. I'd listened to Seasons 1 and 2 of Cover Story on the role of hallucinogens in treating people with trauma and unresponsive depression. Cover Story was clear that there are a number of poorly trained and unethical practitioners out there who have done the sort of work that makes my skin crawl (e.g., numerous boundary violations have been reported).That wasn't Pollan's experience, but he was also picky about who he worked with as guides. As he repeatedly observed, set and setting matter (i.e., how you think about the experience, where and with whom you have it). That set and setting matter to such a degree suggests that any effects are not solely due to the drug, perhaps an interaction of the drug and psychological factors.It is difficult to do good research on the efficacy of hallucinogens – either for the searching well or for the dying, addicted, or depressed. The people serving as participants in such research are probably unusual, not a random sample from the larger population (remember, set and setting?). In addition, one cannot compare hallucinogens to a placebo, even an active placebo, as it is clear that hallucinogens have an effect on the mine, one that both subject, guide, and researcher recognize: one cannot do single, double, triple blinded research.And, I wonder whether this can really become a wonder drug. In the 1950s and 60s, people were paying $500 a session for hallucinogen-assisted therapy. If the cost of hallucinogens came down – and do we really expect that Pfizer and Lilly will get involved, would we want them involved? – much of the cost would still be human labor. Would any insurance panel be willing to pay for a professional mental health worker to accompany a participant for a five-hour session? Would the guides, then, be poorly trained and paid guides (refer back to what I said earlier about the ethics of such work)?And yet, the worried and wealthy well who are looking to expand consciousness may find such experiences tempting and enlightening....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Apr 30, 2023","May 11, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/37674171-how-to-change-your-mind

As daylight chases away darkness so will the white man drive away all our customs. (p. 85)Like Things Fall Apart, Arrow of God is about a people in transition, destroyed by an often arrogant culture that often misunderstood members of the Ibo culture, perceiving the Ibo as stupid, lazy, and obstinate. They were often these things and more, just as my own culture often has people with these traits, but they also had people who were wise and forward-thinking. Chinua Achebe fleshed out the Ibo to a greater degree than he did the British, but many mistakes were made on both sides, sometimes due to failures to understand the other. As in Things Fall Apart, Achebe paints a beautiful, often slow portrait of Ibo people and customs. Proverbs add flavor and deepen my understanding of the people and their culture: ""To you whatever I say in this house is no more effective than the fart a dog breaks to put out a fire"" (p. 9). “Every one of you go back to the house. The inquisitive monkey gets a bullet in the face” (p. 44). I wondered what it would be like to be part of a culture where language, metaphors, and stories are so much a part of the culture. Imagine Ezeulu, instead, telling his wife only that she never listens to him. Captain Winterbottom's language also was often telling: ""He would have preferred [a] cold [bath] but must have hot to stay alive (since Africa never spared those who did what they liked instead of what they had to do)"" (p. 30). And, while he had some sympathy for the Ibo, it was limited and deeply infected with prejudice:""When you’ve been here as long as Allen was and understood the native a little more you might begin to see things in a slightly different light. If you saw, as I did, a man buried alive up to his neck with a piece of roast yam on his head to attract vultures you know . . . Well, never mind. We British are a curious bunch, doing everything half-heartedly. Look at the French. They are not ashamed to teach their culture to backward races under their charge. Their attitude to the native ruler is clear. They say to him: ‘This land has belonged to you because you have been strong enough to hold it. By the same token it now belongs to us. If you are not satisfied come out and fight us.’ What do we British do? We flounder from one expedient to its opposite.”  (pp. 35-36) This limited view doomed Ezeulu and the Umuaru, as the British assumed that he would jump at the opportunity to serve as a Paramount Chief because he was the Chief Priest of Umuaru and was educating a son in the Christian school. On the other hand, Umuaru's god, Ulu, doomed them by being inflexible. As one of his wives argued, ""Ezeulu’s only fault was that he expected everyone—his wives, his kinsmen, his children, his friends and even his enemies—to think and act like himself"" (p. 93).I'm reading and enjoying Achebe's African trilogy with my GR friend, IJ....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Apr 30, 2023","May 08, 2023","Apr 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37774.Arrow_of_God

Brigid Pasulka did not sugarcoat this time and place, nor did she allow her readers to believe that these characters were victims surviving without hope (although the characters might have characterized themselves that way at some points). Self-confidence, hope, and optimism fluctuated with time and circumstance.[image]Baba Yaga, as in Ivan Yakovlevich Bilibin's, The tale of the three tsar's wonders and of Ivashka, the priest's son (1911)Pasulka's characters were three-dimensional, resilient, and believable: ""Irena can squeeze five cups of tea out of a single tea bag, use a match for a week, butter two slices of bread with what others leave on the knife, and wash an entire sink full of dishes with half a liter of hot water"" (p. 10). The protagonist is affectionately referred to as Baba Yaga who, in Slavic folklore, is an ogress stealing, cooking, and eating her victims, usually children (imagine Hansel and Gretel's witch on steroids). I like this reclamation of ""Baba Yaga."" Despite her nickname, she was raised on happy stories: Thanks to Nela’s careful editing, when I arrived in Krakow, my vision of the city was simple and pristine. Nela never talked about the Nazis or the Soviets, never mentioned the food or shoe shortages, the cramped flats, or the curfews. Never the knock in the middle of the night or the screams from the basement of the police station on Rondo Mogilskie (p. 63). Pasulka's dialogue was often acerbic, ironic, and humorous, and always smart: ""What is wrong with expressing brotherhood?” “Brotherhood? Why doesn’t anyone ever say sisterhood?"" (p. 183). Times and places – rural and mountainous Half-Village, shortly before, during, and after WW2 and Krakow, mostly in the ""New Poland"" of the early 1990s – were woven together, mostly but not entirely alternating, and illuminating each other.

If America’s poor founded a country, that country would have a bigger population than Australia or Venezuela. Almost one in nine Americans—including one in eight children—live in poverty. (p. 6)Poverty isn't just about the lack of money, but also backbreaking and dangerous jobs, increased violence, less well-funded schools, drugs taken to cope with trauma, and unstable jobs and housing (Desmond is best known for his book Evicted). Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir describe “the bandwidth tax” on the poor. “Being poor… reduces a person’s cognitive capacity more than going a full night without sleep.” People preoccupied by poverty and its sequelae “have less mind to give to the rest of life” (pp. 21-22). Even people above the poverty level in the US experience poverty-related problems. Why do so many people in the US live in poverty? Matthew Desmond concludes that people live in poverty because it is convenient for those of us with more wealth and privilege. In order for us to get cheap goods at Walmart (or McDonalds or Burger King or Starbucks), we must pay these workers low salaries – and hope that they access federal services (e.g., EITC and food stamps). Desmond asserts that poverty isn't a line (i.e., the poverty line), but a ""knot of social maladies connected to every social problem we care about"" (p. 23).Desmond argues that social ""ills"" that some politicians like to complain about (e.g., single parenting, imprisonment) are not causes of poverty, but consequences of poverty. People don't avoid work, but cannot afford to pay for childcare, for example, while working. Desmond also argues that if some of the ""welfare"" given to wealthy people (e.g., tax credits on homes, EITC and food stamps benefit businesses by allowing them to pay low wages). When we walk past the homeless, see someone asleep on a bus, he says we should ask, ""Who benefits? Not Why don't you find a better job? Or Why don't you move? Or Why don't you stop taking out such bad loans? but Who is feeding off this?"" (p. 79). Desmond, of course, also argues that our moral compromises hurt the rest of us. The problem isn't welfare dependence, but welfare avoidance – partly due to confusing paperwork and long lines. If your income puts you above the poverty line, you likely also get more in government benefits than the poor receive. We ""prioritize the subsidization of affluence over the alleviation of poverty"" (p. 121). If we were really interested in alleviating poverty, we would make different decisions (e.g., fund the IRS, integrate communities across income status).I read Evicted when it came out and loved the data/policy chapters and enjoyed the case examples but thought that book was out of balance.

And that hopefully you could see us outside of the headlines, outside of our suffering, that even in the suffering there are joyful moments"" (Nicolaou, 2022).In all fairness, though, Zamora has observed that migration is more dangerous now than when he traveled in 1999 – on both the Mexican and US sides. Here, though, four create a family that includes Javier. The kids make up games, the adults tell jokes. Strangers help each other. Can the immigration system in the US become more efficient and more humane? My Irish and German ancestors immigrated to the US recently enough that my maternal grandfather's older sisters were born in Germany, my paternal great-grandparents in Ireland.

Such stories are comprised of everyday events and complex emotional situations, a pretext facilitating analysis of the characters’ feelings and passions, which often evolve over the course of the book. (My apologies to those of you who already knew this. I hadn't.) Detransition, Baby shifts across time, so we see Amy's evolution and the events leading to the current dilemma – how they might parent this baby – which is even messier than one might imagine. I am a cis woman with trans friends (one of whom is in the process of trying to become a parent), but I live outside queer culture, so I knew but didn't know many of the dynamics described here, many with significant political overtones. As Peters says, domestic novels are ""a place where artistic form and politics could meet up"" (p. 341). Peters describes the roles of attractiveness among trans women and cis-passability, reminding me of the privilege I have to pay relatively little attention to my appearance, and conversely the oppression that trans women experience that prevents them from just being themselves. She talked of detransitioning not as a change in gender identity, although it may be, but occurring ""because life as a trans person is sometimes incredibly hard, sometimes too hard to bear"" (p. 341). And the way that trans women may need to dissociate in their male bodies or during sex. In her dedication, she compared being trans to divorce, ""To divorced cis women, who, like me, had to face starting their life over without either reinvesting in the illusions from the past, or growing bitter about the future."" But it is Peters' language and thoughtfulness that pulls me in: * ""It is not just her clothes that are perfectly pressed: Everything about her is apple crisp and seems newly made. Her skin, Reese imagines, must smell like dryer sheets"" (p. 292). * ""If I had been born cis, I would never even have had to answer these questions. I wouldn’t have had to prove that I deserve my models of womanhood. But I’m not cis. I’m trans. And so until the day that I am a mother, I’m constantly going to have to prove that I deserve to be one"" (p. 176). * From Katrina, ""at least from the outside, motherhood is just some vague test designed to ensure that everyone feels inadequate” (p. 174).

Martin often talked about ""successful"" and ""failed"" suicides, which is a pet peeve of mine. I don't believe there is such a thing as a successful suicide or an inevitable one, and prefer talking about completed suicides. Maybe subtle, but I think we need to change the culture that endorses and often glorifies suicide. Suicide can be contagious, especially depending on how it is discussed in the media and social media (e.g., endorsements, excessive postings, and saintings). Given this contagiousness, I wonder about the readers of the first half of HN2KY. That half establishes his expertise but also presents Martin at his very worst: struggling, seemingly attention-seeking, and often apparently intimate and charming without becoming truly intimate. He acknowledged that one chapter would likely be triggering for people who are suicidal (I suspect more than only people who are suicidal), and that many would be triggering for people who are struggling with alcohol. Family members of people who suicided would likely have significant difficulty with the often self-absorbed, superficial treatment of their concerns – although he seems to truly care about his children and his current wife.Martin's last third, though, was thoughtful and informed about literature written by suicidal and suiciding writers (e.g., Virginia Woolf, David Foster Wallace, Yiyun Li, and Akutagawa), as well as about suicide from a psychological perspective, although he is surprisingly much less interested in what psychology has to say about suicide. As he now identifies as a Buddhist, he framed many anti-suicide interventions from that perspective and focused on what helped him rather than what the literature says (mostly the same things).At almost 500 pages, many of which have Martin figuratively throwing himself down the stairs, I would have liked to have seen HN2KY given an editor who helped him more clearly articulate his vision (and maybe edited out some of Martin's self-promotion and self-congratulation, which are rarely necessary or attractive).My thanks to Penguin who gave me a promotional copy of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 22, 2023","Apr 22, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62814657-how-not-to-kill-yourself

Things Fall Apart, the first in Chinua Achebe'Novels are often about personal transitions, but also sometimes about cultural or societal transitions. Things Fall Apart, the first in Chinua Achebe's African trilogy, focused on the latter kind of transition that took place when the traditional Ibo society (now called Igbo) came in contact with white Christians in late 19th century Nigeria. No happy ending here.Things Fall Apart sketched a technologically unsophisticated culture, but Achebe avoided both idealization and caricatures of the Ibo and its people. Okonkwo, its central character, was an unlikable character: uninsightful, inflexible, and afraid of showing positive feelings towards others: ""To show affection was a sign of weakness; the only thing worth demonstrating was strength"" (p. 28). This style didn't seem to cripple his children, as they had other people who supported them, but his fears and inflexibility crippled him. Interestingly, Obierika, his best friend, reminds us that there is more to Okonkwo, as he himself is a thoughtful and good man who questioned the Ibo way while also accepting it:Why should a man suffer so grievously for an offense he had committed inadvertently? But although he thought for a long time he found no answer. He was merely led into greater complexities. He remembered his wife’s twin children, whom he had thrown away. What crime had they committed? The Earth had decreed that they were an offense on the land and must be destroyed. And if the clan did not exact punishment for an offense against the great goddess, her wrath was loosed on all the land and not just on the offender. As the elders said, if one finger brought oil it soiled the others. (p. 125). Often, a character like Okonkwo would turn me off from a book, but having Obierika and others changed my view of Okonkwo and Things Fall Apart. For me, Okonkwo's tribal family and the Ibo culture was a large, complex, and interesting character, one that engaged.Although the Ibo here are individuals, many of them open to new ideas, Achebe drew whites as rigid and with imperialistic intentions, failing to understand the Ibo. In this respect, Okonkwo was more similar to the white characters than to other Ibo. I have not read the colonialist literature on Africa, which stereotyped Africans, while allowing whites greater agency and superior morality. Agho (2010), for example, criticized Joseph Conrad, Graham Greene, and others, quoting Ogude's critique of Heart of Darkness as “perhaps the most telling account of the rape of Africa by the white man. So complete is the destruction of this portion of the continent that the only Africans represented in the novel are realized as shadows, mere shadows which are often felt merging with the immensity of dark impenetrable, tropical forest” (p. 173).Contrast that with Achebe's own hope for his African novels:Here, then, is an adequate revolution for me to espouse – to help my society regain its belief in itself and put away the complexes of the years of the denigration and self-abasement. And it is essentially a question of education, in the best sense of that word. Here, I think, my aims and the deepest aspirations of my society meet. For no thinking African can escape the pain of the wound in our soul.... I would be quite satisfied if my novels (especially the ones set in the past) did no more than teach my readers that their past – with all its imperfections – was not one long night of savagery from which the first Europeans acting on God’s behalf delivered them. (Achebe, 1965)I both recognize and fail to recognize the propaganda in what I read. I thank Achebe – and Agho and Ogude – for helping me find greater balance.I read Things Fall Apart as part of the 2023 Read Harder Challenge: a book I had DNFed.

Characters were not hyperstylized or -sexualized. Sadie, Mazur, and Marx's games were often thought questions and, although T3 occasionally showed game play, often focused more on the fraught nature of work, friendships, identity, and love. ""Maybe she had been like the player in Solution. Maybe she hadn’t asked the right or enough questions because she hadn’t wanted to know the answers"" (p. 33).

The resulting war against Turco-Egyptian rule, then later the British, devastated Sudan. Was he the true Mahdi? Although this initially mattered, later his appearance seemed to offer a response to Turco-Egyptian oppression, ""injustice unleashes storms; injustice causes the kind of damage that perpetuates itself"" (p. 32). But governing people is challenging, as Yaseen observed, ""Fanatics can never draw out the good in people. They will go to war I predict. They will raise armies, invade, and pillage because it is only aggression that will keep their cause alive. Fighting an enemy is always easier than governing human complexity"" (p. 136). That complexity is at the heart of River Spirit, a story told in eight voices: Musa, Zamzam, Yaseen, Salha, Fatimah, Robert, Charles, Christina. Four female, four male; five from Sudan, three from the UK; one enslaved, five well-educated. The white narrators, in particular, believed they understood others' intentions and acted in what they believed were the best interests of the Sudanese, but their understanding was clouded. General Gordon, for example, sent the Mahdi a gift of a Turkish cloak and a tarbush – when men were killed for wearing a tarbush. The Mahdi sent ""the clothes of true humility and asceticism. Clothes like the ones these two are wearing—muslin trousers, a jibbah with patches of different colors and a straw skullcap"" (p. 223). General Gordon was outraged – by the Mahdi's words, his tone, his nonchalance. Was the Mahdi's act courage or ploy? From Gordon's perspective, either was a provocation.Robert's paintings of the Sudan were (apparently) beautiful, but he painted two paintings of the conflict. In the former, Gordon was an insignificant figure; the latter rewrote history and played to Britain's patriotic impulses, eventually (according to this narrative) leading to British involvement in the conflict. Christina found her father's painting of Zamzam after his death – naked, savage eyes, muscular, insolent expression – and burned it, as an affront to propriety and his reputation. This painting had probably been his favorite, his masterpiece, from his time in the Sudan.We cannot understand each other. We choose not to understand each other. These misunderstandings lead to violence: Gordon pulled a gun on Robert. Zamzam damaged her portrait, Robert then beat her. The previously described gifts fired outrage and attacks.Nonetheless, at the heart of this story is an unexpected and touching love story, one that withstood class and religious differences, multiple enslavements and separations. Zamzam and Yaseen are both surprising characters, but so was Musa, an uneducated supporter of the Mahdi.[image]Stamp honoring Marie-Guillemine Benoist's Portrait of Madeleine And its cover?

Native Speaker is a heady stew of love, loss, and betrayal; grief, alienation, and connection; and perhaps acceptance – all from the perspective of a Korean American man of immigrants who had a complicated relationship to the US. Henry Park is a son, father, husband, and spy, but each of those roles is strained.Who is Henry Park? This is a question that Chang-rae Lee answers several times in different ways. His white wife left a note when leaving him:You are surreptitious B+ student of life first thing hummer of Wagner and Strauss illegal alien emotional alien genre bug Yellow peril: neo-American great in bed overrated poppa’s boy sentimentalist anti-romantic ——analyst (you fill in) stranger follower traitor spy (p. 5)This description would leave me devastated but also slightly pleased that I had been seen (and yet not). His own self-analysis is more nuanced: I am an amiable man. I can be most personable, if not charming, and whatever I possess in this life is more or less the result of a talent I have for making you feel good about yourself when you are with me. In this sense I am not a seducer. I am hardly seen. I won’t speak untruths to you, I won’t pass easy compliments or odious offerings of flattery. I make do with on-hand materials, what I can chip out of you, your natural ore. Then I fuel the fire of your most secret vanity. (p. 8)This makes Park a good friend, an easy date, and an excellent spy. In meeting his wife for the first time, for example, he observed,I did something then that I didn’t know I could do. It was strangely automatic. Instantly I was thinking of the lover she might want, the man whom she’d searched out but hadn’t yet found in her life. I thought of the ways Nils was perhaps falling short. I put myself in her place and imagined her father and mother. Boyfriends, recent loves. (p. 14)How flattering and attractive! But I don't think I would want to be married to a chameleon. The traits desirable in a date are different than those in a spouse and partner.This is a spy novel unlike any I've read (not that I've read many in the last 40 years), although sometimes I thought of John le Carré while reading this. Henry Park, like le Carré's protagonists, is knowledgeable and competent, an outsider, a consummate observer, loyal. These traits/skills make Park a good friend and colleague – and a wonderful spy (view spoiler)[– until he's not, as these strengths both facilitate and undermine the spying enterprise (hide spoiler)]. This story focuses more on Henry as a person, which includes the spy, rather than primarily the task at hand.

She had written about 10 ½ of the ultimate 30 chapters at that point. The version I read was finished in 1975 by ""Another Lady,"" a pseudonymous British novelist identified as Anne Telscombe on Goodreads.Austen's section of the book really only sets the scene, as it is only the first 22% of the book. All but three of the final characters can be found here, but the raw materials could be recombined in dozens of different ways and still remain within Austen's oeuvre. In fact, this version of the finished novel – there are probably others – appears very different from PBS's version (we're early in Season 1). As a result, Sanditon should probably be authored by ""Another Lady"" with Jane Austen.Is Sanditon consistent with Austen's other works? By my reading, yes. Charlotte, the heroine, is an observant but shy country girl who made some errors in understanding others, some because they were hiding their intent, others because she was self-absorbed with love. The characters vary, but there are a number of narcissists, silly buffoons, hypochondriacs (who made me very thankful for modern medicine), and of course the Love Interest, who is obscure at best. Charlotte noted, ""Very few of us lack superficial faults and we must rely on each other’s kindness to overlook them."" (p. 97). Many of the characters here have far more central faults. As Austen's other books, there is no place for death, maimings, or politics, but there is a happy ending. Austen (and ""Another Lady"") wrote what we would call romcoms. Charlotte is a very likeable character, as are all of the Parkers – and several other characters. Unlike many of the others, she underestimated herself; this lack of self-worth (or relative worth?) was a central motivating force for much of the action. Charlotte ""well knew that such beauty as she herself possessed was unlikely to tempt so popular, polished and lively a young man, that her fortune was nonexistent and her personality a trifle narrow and over-decorous for his tastes"" (p. 242). Any reader of Austen knows that her characters do tempt such men.A fun read....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 20, 2023","Mar 24, 2023","Mar 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48616745-sanditon

What I learned when reading Anne Frank in 8th grade is that the worst can happen.Dystopias are often drawn with a broad brush: 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm. There's something to a dystopia painted with a more subtle brush, where good and evil reside in a single person, where people fail to match simple stereotypes and stories (e.g., Sunlight Pilgrims).[image]Norman Rockwell, The Problem We All Live With, 1964Our Missing Hearts is a subtle dystopia. Our Missing Hearts is set maybe 20 years in the future, with numerous events crossing the line from life to novel, so close that I was looking up PACT (Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act) to determine whether it was real. Its characters are believable, and I would want Bird, Margaret, Sadie, Domi as friends, even Ethan (I would want to tell him to grow a pair, although I might make choices similar to his own). Bird's father told him: ""Don’t attract attention. Keep your head down. And: If you see any trouble, you go the other way, understand?"" (pp. 75-76). Many of us would choose to tell our children to do these things. Many of us already do. [image]George Floyd mural at CUP Foods, where he was murderedOne way the government controlled people under PACT was by removing or threatening to remove children from un-American environments, ""the definition of which was ever expanding: Appearing sympathetic to China. Appearing insufficiently anti-China. Having any doubts about anything American; having any ties to China at all—no matter how many generations past. Questioning whether China was really the problem; questioning whether PACT was being applied fairly; eventually, questioning PACT itself"" (pp. 185-186). This strategy of family separations is not a new one but one used throughout US history (e.g., boarding schools for indigenous children, separations of slave families, migrant families at the US/Mexico border, class inequities in the foster care system). What would you be willing to do to keep your children safe? (view spoiler)[Margaret chose an equally valid, although perhaps surprising strategy to keep Bird and other children safe (hide spoiler)] PACT also sounded much like McCarthyism (Joseph, not Kevin). These similarities added to its truthfulness.[image]Keith Haring, Ignorance = Fear / Silence = Death, 1989I loved that art, poetry, and memoir were at the center of political protests in Our Missing Hearts – although art was also used to support the status quo. Art's function in protests isn't new, but Celeste Ng (pronounced ing) argues that art captures our attention and can redirect the narrative. Pay attention to how you respond to the images in this .

Clearly false claims of rape against Black men (think Emmett Till) are unfair, but sometimes this unfairness is much more subtle. At a meeting I was at last year, when a white woman felt guilty – she wasn't even being discussed or attacked – she began crying and our discussion of race just stopped. How can you talk about serious things with someone who is sobbing? Instead, we soothed her feelings, leaving the others in the room, especially the black women, out in the cold. The issue here is the fragility with which some people respond when their worldview, their dominance is threatened.[image]Emmett Till (1941-1955)What is unfair? White women believing that we cannot tolerate any racial discord. As Ruby Hamad argues, The mere suggestion that being white has meaning often triggers a range of defensive responses. These include emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and withdrawal from the stress-inducing situation. These responses work to reinstate white equilibrium as they repel the challenge, return our racial comfort, and maintain our dominance within the racial hierarchy. (p. 12)Hamad felt guilty when a Black woman lost her job for posting an article Hamad had written about white tears. She then noted, ""But this reaction is itself internalized racism, scolding people of color for whatever bad thing happens to us, telling us it’s our own fault, keeping us in check by taking away our will to speak"" (p. 15).What is unfair? Failing to see beyond stereotypes when looking at BIPOC women: Jezebels, Black velvet, harem girls, China Dolls, Princess Pocahontas. ""If [BIPOC women] are angry, it is because we are bullies. If we are crying, it is because we are indulging in the cult of victimhood. If we are poised, it is because we lack emotion. If we are emotional, it is because we are less rational human and more primitive animal"" (p. 16). Hamad says more, but read White Tears, Brown Scars, regardless of your gender, skin color, or ethnicity.The Angry Black Woman and Angry Brown Woman are tools of gaslighting.

Oppressed/depressed—either way, you can’t feel good about yourself” (p. 123). Although Aviv does not offer single, clear answers, I suspect that is her point: there aren't easy, simple answers.

It is the small things we remember, when time and mortality close in, and by small landmarks we may make our way at last humbly into another world. (p. 182). Brother Cadfael reminds us that the world is both bigger and smaller than we often think, but often more interesting and arousing more curiosity. Cadfael often stops to look, to listen, to wonder.

(p. 2). Demon Copperhead is Barbara Kingsolver's brilliant reteAnybody will tell you the born of this world are marked from the get-out, win or lose. (p. 2). Demon Copperhead is Barbara Kingsolver's brilliant retelling of David Copperfield. Demon (what else would you be called if named Damon?) had a hard life from the get-go. His father died before his birth, he was parentified and caring for his mother even as a young child, his stepfather was abusive of both her and him, and his mother eventually overdosed, after having been clean for a long time. From there, Demon entered the foster care system, where he was enslaved, underfed, and maintained in abusive, neglectful, and dirty surroundings, foster parents themselves attempting to make a living in difficult places. Free school lunch and Backpacks of Love programs filled in some of the gaps, but young Demon experienced few adults who had his back until middle school – except for the Peggots, who were often overextended themselves.Demon made mistakes – layers or layers of them – and engaged in considerable self-blame, ""What a useless dickhead. Knowing basically from birth that my mom was not to be counted on. And still no plan B"" (p. 48), but Kingsolver clearly attributed the opioid crisis, foster care system, and chronic unemployment to systemic factors. Government is pro-Pharma (oxycodone, fentanyl, etc.) because it is pro-business, for example. Tommy Waddles observed government is on the side of the money-earning people, and down on the land people [e.g., Appalachians]…[because] money-earning ones pay taxes. Whereas you can’t collect shit on what people grow and eat on the spot, or the work they swap with their neighbors. That’s like a percent of blood from a turnip. So, the ones in charge started cooking it into everybody’s brains to look down on the land people, saying we are an earlier stage of human, like junior varsity or cavemen. (pp. 522-523)As June Peggot concluded, ""The first thing we had to do… was quit thinking this mess was our fault. 'They did this to you'” (pp. 455-456). Demon, despite it all, was resilient. Even when he fell hard, he was able to pull himself back up, that he was ""like somebody of worth"" (p. 358), but he was an attractive, bright boy with Superpowers, who also had adults who believed in him and supported him, even though he often dismissed their good views of him. How can you not like Demon, even as he circled the drain? He was ""a beautiful man with too much heart for the raw deal he got"" (p. 455). What about the Swap-Outs of the world, those kids who have three strikes against them from the very beginning, have no Superpower, and no adults believing in them?I read David Copperfield before the Kingsolver, which added a layer of enjoyment (seeing Uriah Heep, for example, become U-Haul Pyle), but reading it was in no way necessary. Like the Dickens book, Kingsolver's is a takedown of systems for responding to child poverty, but it was fresh and vibrant, even though of its plot elements were take offs and reworkings of the Dickens – and to my ear, often better than the Dickens. Demon noted, ""a good story doesn’t just copy life, it pushes back on it"" (p. 520).

I found Carlos Ruiz Zafón's sketches of the book at the center of Shadow of the Wind a useful way of describing and summarizing his novel: As it unfolded, the structure of the story began to remind me of one of those Russian dolls that contain innumerable ever-smaller dolls within. Step by step the narrative split into a thousand stories, as if it had entered a gallery of mirrors, its identity fragmented into endless reflections. (p. 7)and""This is a story about books….About accursed books, about the man who wrote them, about a character who broke out of the pages of a novel so that he could burn it, about a betrayal and a lost friendship. It’s a story of love, of hatred, and of the dreams that live in the shadow of the wind.” (p. 178)Shadow of the Wind is often dark, yet the relationships that Daniel has with his friends, especially Fermín Romero de Torres (or whatever his name really is) often had me smiling and wanting to share a piece of dialogue. Daniel was a courageous and loyal friend, wise beyond his years. I would like to live in a world peopled by them. (Okay, the women in this book are generally voluptuous caricatures.)Shadow of the Wind is occasionally unbelievable. Do 10-year-olds behave as this one did? Do people beaten within an inch of their life recover this rapidly? Are pregnancies as quickly identified as they were here? These details bothered some GR ers, but not me, as Shadow of the Wind often operated in the land of metaphor. Who was alive and who was merely a member of the walking dead? When can one come back to life? Can one? How many of us waste our lives…IN SEVEN DAYS’ TIME, I WOULD BE DEAD. (p. 312)I suspect that I could easily read Shadow of the Wind at different points in my life and would read a different book. Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul.

In Fahrenheit 451, the peripheral characters believe that they live in the best of times. They can drive 100+ mph in their beetles and forget everything. Their ""family"" talks to them all day from the parlor walls – and they can talk back if they've bought the media upgrade. But… they were unaware and did not have intimate relationships with others, and reflection and self-reflection were discouraged:“Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. You’d find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more ‘literary’ you are. That’s my definition anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often.... So now you see why books are hated and feared? They show the pores in the face of life.” (p. 79)Books were one way of seeing the ""pores"" but, frankly, there are many ways of stopping to smell the roses, to see the world. In burning books, their society also encouraged an avoidance of anything real. Montag, a fireman, described book burning:""The police went first and adhesive-taped the victim’s mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when you arrived you found an empty house. You weren’t hurting anyone, you were hurting only things! And since things really couldn’t be hurt, since things felt nothing, and things don’t scream or whimper, as this woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work, essentially."" (p. 35)This inversion of what was real was also seen in how behaviors were labeled. Seventeen-year-old Clarisse who, from our perspective, seemed exactly on track, had been labeled ""insane."" She said,“I’m antisocial, they say. I don’t mix. It’s so strange. I’m very social indeed. It all depends on what you mean by social, doesn’t it? Social to me means talking to you about things like this…. Or talking about how strange the world is. Being with people is nice. But I don’t think it’s social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? An hour of TV class, an hour of basketball or baseball or running, another hour of transcription history or painting pictures, and more sports, but do you know, we never ask questions, or at least most don’t; they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film-teacher. That’s not social to me at all. It’s a lot of funnels and lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom, and them telling us it’s wine when it’s not."" (p. 27)The society of Fahrenheit 451 could feel dated, as this novel was published in 1953, seventy years ago; yet, it was addressing modern issues: censorship, authoritarian controls, loss of connection, and anti-intellectualism.

This is the most-realistic of the three, also one with the lowest mortality.In Lucy By the Sea, Elizabeth Strout sketched the loneliness and confusion of the pandemic, the obsessiveness that many of us had with the news and with numbers, and missing old friends and family, as well as the unexpected gifts that we may have found: the sea's beauty, a more mindful presence, new friends. And, despite COVID crashing through our lives like a bull in a china shop, our lives went on: we connected and lost relationships, marriages ended and relationships began, and distant memories of childhood continued to touch our current lives.Lucy By the Sea is the most recent installment in the Amgash series. I read its first installment in 2016, but haven't (yet) read the middle two books. That was okay. Here, Lucy is a successful novelist and memoirist who came from nothing. Her family was too poor for salt and pepper shakers. They frequently ate molasses on white bread for dinner, for lack of anything more substantial. It was also a family that was emotionally, physically, and probably sexually abusive, one that never said ""I love you,"" (view spoiler)[at least until her brother's death (hide spoiler)]. These contrasts – profound neglect with international travel, the ability to leave New York for Maine when COVID first appeared, and people who loved Lucy enough to save her – were an interesting subtext running throughout the book. She is stuck between her real mother and her ""nice made-up mother,"" feeling alone and lost, but also sometimes recognizing that she is supported and loved. Perhaps Lucy's history – a poor, uneducated, COVID-denying family – made it possible for her to build a friendship with a vaccine-refusing, supporter of the former president and for that friendship to feel real rather than forced, even though Lucy is currently affluent and liberal. She understood people and valued trying to understand them even when they were doing things that didn't initially make sense. She had several ""visions"" – what I prefer to see as deep empathy – at various points, although also sometimes missed the obvious.Lucy was more anxious and neurotic than I'd prefer (although my friends are often anxious and neurotic), but I felt like I was walking with her along the beach, sharing a conversation with her. The first person narrative contributed to this feeling, but so did her deep honesty and empathy.

He rivals Pauline (from The Perils of Pauline) and may have been her precursor, as he was repeatedly snatched from safety and dragged into the fire. What a wonderful way to serialize a book: Oliver Twist was released in 24 pieces between 1837-1839.Dickens, as in other novels, decried the life allotted the poor. Oliver's mother died in childbirth and other family members were unidentified. As a result, he had few options available, none good (workhouse, crime, death). In fact, the criminals were stereotyped and described in terms of their roles: the Jew, the robber, the murderer, the bastard child. I'm not clear whether this was the time that Dickens was writing or that Dickens was commenting on how crime flattens those engaging in it into stereotypes. At least it can flatten them, as few of the thieves escaped with their lives and moved on to another life. (view spoiler)[Similarly, Rose and Oliver's reputations were saved only through a series of accidents. (hide spoiler)]Another way of reading Oliver Twist is that this is Dickens' study of nature/nurture. Is it the criminals' nature to do bad things or their environments? Can good characters be corrupted? Can they be saved? (view spoiler)[If good-natured and beautiful. (hide spoiler)] I loved Dickens' asides. The system was often described as being for Oliver's benefits – and any reader would clearly see through the self-congratulatory claims:Let it not be supposed by the enemies of “the system,” that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.

Cloud Cuckoo Land follows five children and one book across time – and centuries, continents, and space – as worlds fell apart (e.g., war, climate change, disease). Its characters often dealt with personal barriers: homophobia, religious intolerance, being orphaned, autism, and cleft palates. None of us escapes life unscathed. Doerr followed his central characters over the arc of their lives, having noted that a child character allows him “to see more nakedly some of the things that we’ve elided or erased in our minds because of age” (Beckerman, 2021). Even as some characters aged, however, they remained open to new perspectives on lives.

That would be a nice way to die (hide spoiler)]. Books open doors and Cloud Cuckoo Land, Antonius Diogenes' ancient lost (and fictional) novel was no exception. His Cloud Cuckoo Land described a shepherd, Aethon, who sought a magical, heavenly place in the sky, but first had to experience a series of (physical) transformations. Stories help us make sense of the world, inspire us, and spark our imagination. Decoding this degraded manuscript and reading it aloud sustained these characters, gave them courage, and offered them hope and meaning, often in the most dire of circumstances. Reading the ancient Cloud Cuckoo Land aloud relieved one character's pain as she approached death, healed a sick child, and even lured birds to feed them as they starved.Diogenes' Cloud Cuckoo Land tells of Aethon's search for a utopia, but Doerr's Cloud Cuckoo Land questioned whether that utopia could be achievable or was even desirable.""I have heard of a city in the clouds where thrushes fly into your mouth fully cooked and wine runs in channels in the streets and warm breezes always blow. As soon as I become a brave eagle or a bright strong owl, it is there I intend to fly.” “You always think the barley is more plentiful in another man’s field, but it’s no better out there, Aethon, I promise you,” said the crone. “Bandits wait around every corner to bash your skull and ghouls lurk in the shadows, hoping to drink your blood. Here you have cheese, wine, your friends, and your flock. What you already have is better than what you so desperately seek.” (p. 69).But, although Cloud Cuckoo Land is a cautionary tale about utopias, his characters are not complacent. They – like Doerr himself (see Doerr's 2017 op ed) – see the horrors in their world and attempt to do something about the problems they face (not always successfully).Cloud Cuckoo Land is full of ""Easter eggs,"" which means that although you and I may read the same text, we may see different things now – and the next time we read it. It is a long book (600+ pages), so it makes many side trips: lovely descriptions of reading and translation, even by young children; anger about our destruction of the Earth; people trapped by prejudice, sometimes escaping those traps; frustrations with intimacy – and surprising connections; recognitions that even the all-knowing know nothing.

[image]Art's father, Vladek, was a survivor. He worked hard in Auschwitz, learned desirable skills (tin smithing, shoe repair, etc.), curried favor and alliances people in power – and those without. He was helped by others when it was to their advantage, but also by people, Poles and Germans included, for whom there was no advantage. Nonetheless, ""in some ways [Vladek] didn't survive"" (p. 90). How can your view of the world remain untainted after seeing Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Breslau? Vladek became miserly, a difficult and complaining racist who alienated his family – and burned his beloved wife's diaries of the war rather than having to think about such a period. His son and daughter-in-law felt sorry for Vladek – as does the reader – until any of us had to spend any time with him. Vladek's behaviors are likely survivor's guilt, preparations for future disasters. What he did to survive, however, hurt him in the long run.[image]Maus II was more autobiographical of the artist than the first volume, which was more focused on Vladek. This volume considered the difficulties of writing/drawing about the Holocaust – ""sometimes I just don't feel like a functioning adult"" (p. 43). When Art talked with his ""shrink,"" he himself shrunk physically (in the drawings), as he had difficulties facing his arguments with his father, thoughts of Auschwitz, etc. We saw his struggles in how to draw his wife, Françoise, and present Vladek's complaints and tics. He reflected on his older brother, who died in a concentration camp. Richieu could remain an ideal child, never throwing tantrums, while Art was ""a pain in the ass,"" as any flesh and blood child must be.One advantage of a graphic novel is that it can include more layers of life in and around the Holocaust than many Holocaust novels are able to do. The first drawing in this , for example, both flattened the Jews and made them all alike, but each mouse was also an unique individual. Art can shrink when talking to his therapist, without spending words on that shrinkage. The reader can see the ways that Vladek is difficult – returning, for example, a partially eaten box of cereal because his estranged second wife bought it – and identify with Art and Françoise, but also make those decisions for ourselves.Drawings are from this volume....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 03, 2023","Jan 23, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15197.Maus_II

Most people will focus on the former, so I'll take the road less traveled.In Crooked Kingdom, this group of homeless, parent-less teens living on the streets are each damaged in one way or another. Several hide their gifts – and struggle as a result. Most are traumatized and rejected by parents; they have been trafficked, abused, and are outsiders. But, they are not like Alys, who is told kind lies, and remains silly and unaware.Fear is a constant companion, but a companion that kills rather than saves.How do you handle relational trauma without having it damage other relationships? Most people don't even ask themselves this question initially. Others handle the violence of their divided, prejudiced world by closing their eyes. This is only a partial solution: ""You’re the man who sits idly by, congratulating yourself on your decency, while the monster eats his fill. At least a monster has teeth and a spine” (p. 62). In Crooked Kingdom, this motley crew lives with integrity and self-acceptance, helping each other recognize ""you could love something and still see its flaws"" (p. 383). Are my weaknesses all of me or only part? “You’re not weak because you can’t read. You’re weak because you’re afraid of people seeing your weakness. You’re letting shame decide who you are"" (p. 283). They begin to declare their power instead of hiding it. “What kind of mother would I be to my son if I hid away my talents? If I let fear be my guide in this life? You knew what I was when you asked that I choose you, Colm. Do not now suggest that I be anything less” (p. 258).They support each other and – the good parents among them – their children, even when they disagree with their decisions: “You’re my son, Jesper. I can’t protect you. Maybe I shouldn’t have tried. But I will be there even when you falter. Every time” (p. 513).These messages are powerful, especially for young adults, who tend to think dichotomously, who believe that they are what was done to them. This crazy roller coaster of a story is great fun, but what makes this an especially good story is that the characters believe in and heal each other – and without a dose of saccharine. “I would come for you,” he said, and when he saw the wary look she shot him, he said it again. “I would come for you. And if I couldn’t walk, I’d crawl to you, and no matter how broken we were, we’d fight our way out together—knives drawn, pistols blazing. Because that’s what we do.

Do you perceive the same world that I do? I asked some of these questions as a teenager (and, to some degree, now).[image]The young woman or witch?These questions underlie Emily St. John Mandel's Sea of Tranquility, a book that is, in theory, a stand-alone book, but that has characters that first showed up in The Glass Hotel and a character who wrote a famous book about a pandemic (much like St. John Mandel's Station Eleven), right before a pandemic. Its central characters move around through time (20th through 25th centuries), attempting to identify and resolve a glitch in the timeline, a glitch that confused me in The Glass Hotel and here had much larger implications, as it suggested that our world was a corrupted computer file: ""If we can run fairly convincing simulations of reality now, think of what those simulations will be like in a century or two. The idea with the simulation hypothesis is, we can’t rule out the possibility that all of reality is a simulation” (p. 99). When asked why she wrote sci fi in her last book, Olive Llewellyn said much as St. John Mandel might have, ""but there’s just, there is so much death. There’s death all around us. I don’t want to write about anything real” (p. 168). Those of us who followed the death counts in the last several years or who had a family member die of COVID could easily empathize. Nonetheless, Sea of Tranquility reads more like literary fiction than science fiction, with very little focus on science or space travel, even though the book's characters can travel across time and galaxies. These things are incidental to the real questions of the multiverse: ""rats can’t talk here, she pointed out, but does it logically follow that they can’t talk anywhere?"" (p. 69).Space travel is also incidental to her discussions of living through a pandemic. Llewellyn was on a book tour, discussing her pandemic book shortly before the start of the pandemic and stayed on tour, with the hubris that we humans often have, rather than recognizing that she could die any day. Any of us could die any day.Pandemics don’t approach like wars, with the distant thud of artillery growing louder every day and flashes of bombs on the horizon. They arrive in retrospect, essentially. It’s disorienting. The pandemic is far away and then it’s all around you, with seemingly no intermediate step. (p. 107)I loved Station Eleven, but wasn't thrilled by The Glass Hotel. I started Sea of Tranquility and wasn't thrilled, feeling distant from several of its drifting, alienated characters. Ultimately, Sea of Tranquility was quietly moving, as its characters groped with life – real or otherwise – and lived with dignity, purpose, and connection.

As a story about these things, Horse works well. But it's not just about any horse, but arguably the fastest Horse in the 19th century and, in this book, that Horse becomes a stand-in for several other issues. Its focus on objectification and empathic subjectivity is fascinating: Horses, slaves, and Black men blossom from native talent and drive, but when they are treated as things, they are damaged – or give up. And, those in power repeatedly strike out to keep others in control, often with bad result: ""He came to believe that horses lived with a world of fear, and when you grasped that, you had a clear idea how to be with them"" (pp. 13-14). Why do we do that???But objectification works both ways. In numerous places, people act with ill intent – stealing from and beating slaves, putting their ownership before the slave's name (e.g., Alexander's Jarrett), and even failing to recognize them – but there are other places where microaggressions are more subtle. Jess, for example, assumed that Theo was stealing her bike – which was both an unusual, high-end bike and identical to her own. Theo responded with anger at being stereotyped, Jess with guilt about her cluelessness. In discussions about art, Theo, an art history graduate student, noted that some 19th century representations of Blacks were ridiculous. His initial thesis was ""that these paintings were never meant to be viewed as portraits of individuals, merely status signifiers of the privilege, wealth, and power of the White sitters"" (pp. 56-57). Frederick Douglass ""mocked the caricatures that White painters produced—the broad noses, the thick lips—and asked his readers to consider if they’d ever seen, in life, an actual face that combined all these exaggerated features"" (p. 57). As a different sort of example, the Black woman in Manet's Olympia was almost invisible.[image]Manet's Olympia (1863)Consider other depictions of this painting and how Manet's depiction becomes absurd:[image]Done, The Downgrading of Olympia (2014)[image]Nancy Ellison, Hume Cronyn (as Manet’s Olympia), (1990)Nonetheless, not all depictions of Black slaves were made ridiculous – or invisible:[image] Edward Troye, Richard Singleton with Viley’s Harry, Charles and Lew, (1834)Geraldine Brooks seems to talk about two kinds of barriers to understanding: seeing the horse or person as a unique individual, but also misunderstanding the implications behind words and behaviors. Why would Jarrett like the dirty and noisy city as opposed to returning to be Alexander's Jarrett? ""Their hands is their own. And that dollar that get put in those hands, that’s their own dollar"" (pp. 263-264). These simple – and fundamental – misunderstandings often had significant implications, some of which were not much different today than in the 19th century US.One of the brilliant things about Horse is that most of the historical figures – and all of the horses – were real, although many stories about their lives were imagined. That underlying truth connecting the three stories adds an additional layer of mystery and glitter.

Unless you are a Holocaust denier, you already know the general outline of his father's story: working the black market in order to support his family, hiding from the Nazis, fighting in the war and becoming a prisoner of war, moving from city to city, attempting to find safety, attempting to pass as a Pole to travel or work safely.[image]p. 8Told as a graphic novel, with Jews drawn as mice, Poles as pigs, and Nazis cats, Maus could easily flatten or idealize/demonize the father's story and the Holocaust. Instead, Art Spiegelman includes small details that prevent us from backing away from the Jews' humanity: his father's courtship of his mother; their attempt to save his older brother, which unknowingly sent him to his death; their dinners of the entire family, many in denial about the danger they faced (even as they were hiding in a small apartment).[image]p. 125The Holocaust period was presented against the backdrop of their current lives: his father's miserly behaviors, suspiciousness, and irritability; his stepmother's complaints about her husband; and his search for information about his mother, who committed suicide in 1968. These behaviors contrasted with his story of the war, where he was a compassionate and considerate husband. Did the father omit the behaviors that the son saw or were they the consequence of the war and life or both? Just as his father was presented warts and all, the author did not shy away from showing his own frustrations with his father, even calling his father a murderer at one point (his father had burned his mother's diaries after her death).

(p. 38)Frankie and Zeke, age 16, created a poster with these two sentences and a drawing of two large hands reaching toward a town and the child in it. They hung the poster throughout their community – and it went viral (it was found in other states and countries). Although these two bright but awkward outsiders had no negative intents, we impose meaning. People thought this anonymously-hung poster might contain the lyrics from a heavy metal song, be related to a previously unknown cult, be lines from the Bible, echo street graffiti, or be influenced by artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring.In other words, people lost it and lost perspective. At least two people died in their town as a result, with others likely elsewhere. Frankie, who narrates Now Is Not the Time to Panic, obsessed over her phrase, but hid her involvement with its creation.So, Now Is Not the Time to Panic is about art and finding meaning in art: “We’d created meaning where there was none, but, I don’t know, isn’t that art? Or at least I think it’s the kind of art that I like, where the obsession of one person envelops other people, transforms them"" (p. 47).It is about being a teenager in a small town and feeling invisible and alone: ""And he’d sniff and sniff, and I’d pray that he couldn’t smell me, what was underneath all that perfume, because I knew it would smell so desperate, so lonely"" (p. 32). I started grabbing anything I could find [to read] and I had no idea what other people thought was good or what was important. And so I almost never told anyone what I liked because I was terrified that they would tell me how stupid it was. Every single thing that you loved became a source of both intense obsession and possible shame. Everything was a secret. (p. 108)But a person can't live this way. When anything/everything can be a source of shame, that damages how you look at yourself and the world: the world is unsafe and the self is unworthy. So Now Is Not the Time to Panic is also about trauma. Frankie struggles with whether she is a good person despite their poster causing several deaths. She obsesses about the poster, but also hides her knowledge of it and is afraid of being judged, but ultimately recognizes that speaking aloud about it will set her free and, rather than interfering with her relationships, may strengthen them.I may be imposing this last view on Now Is Not the Time to Panic, having also read Kevin Wilson's Nothing to See Here, which I loved (but I love this more). Both books speak in metaphors and edge on fantasy, but Now Is Not the Time to Panic is more realistic, which I think makes it more powerful.I need more Kevin Wilson in my life....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Jan 2023,"Jan 04, 2023","Jan 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60755035-now-is-not-the-time-to-panic

The good thing is that people experiencing fibro fog – and those who need to make a significant shift in their thinking about fibromyalgia – are repeatedly reminded that there are things that they can do. Unfortunately, this book could be a pamphlet, maybe several pamphlets, with no loss to the consumer.So, if you're wondering whether you can do anything to handle the pain, here's the skinny: medications can be helpful but also have significant downsides. Massage works short-term but does not seem to have long-last effects. What seems to be helpful is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, moderation and pacing of physical activity, reducing stress and resolving depression, social support, stretching, and setting reasonable goals. Partnering with your medical team – and your family – is very important. And, bottom line, these suggestions are much the same as those given for any chronic pain problem. Pain can be handled well. That doesn't mean that pain is easy to handle, just that it does not need to take over a person's life.

In the US, we identified and prevented animal abuse before abuse against children. The first USWe ignore trauma and fail to recognize it when we can. In the US, we identified and prevented animal abuse before abuse against children. The first US state law against animal cruelty was passed in New York in 1828, while child maltreatment only became a growing social concern in the 1960s. There is still no specific law outlawing domestic violence in 49 countries, no legislation addressing sexual harassment in 45, and nothing criminalizing marital rape in 112 countries. Not seeing trauma or recognizing its impact is a big thing. As a result, trauma sequelae are seen as senseless and the people who are acting out – for trauma-related reasons – are seen as crazy or bad. People who are traumatized are often given a series of diagnoses rather than having the deeper core of their pain recognized. Many are given a diagnosis that sounds like a disease state but misses (and obscures) the underlying cause, trauma. Staff discussions on the unit rarely mentioned the horrific real-life experiences of the children and the impact of those traumas on their feelings, thinking, and self-regulation. Instead, their medical records were filled with diagnostic labels: “conduct disorder” or “oppositional defiant disorder” for the angry and rebellious kids; or “bipolar disorder.” ADHD was a “comorbid” diagnosis for almost all. Was the underlying trauma being obscured by this blizzard of diagnoses? (p. 169)Failures to recognize trauma and using the disease model to describe symptoms subverts control over a person’s life, taking it ""out of their own hands and [putting] doctors and insurance companies in charge of fixing their problems"" (p. 68). Trauma changes everything. Being hurt by a caregiver, for example, affects many people's ability to recognize and maintain safe relationships, their ability to trust others, and beliefs that they deserve to be kept safe. After a history of sexual abuse, how do children become able to trust their bodies or themselves?Agencies and practitioners talk about trauma-informed care – almost 60 years after we finally acknowledged that child abuse is real. All care should be trauma-informed; yet, agencies and practitioners still ignore/fail to recognize the impact of trauma. Given this, The Body Keeps the Score fills an important role. Bessel van der Kolk's description of trauma is clear and accessible to a lay population and describes many ways that a range of traumas can affect a person. On the other hand, The Body Keeps the Score feels flabby and would probably be more useful as two much shorter books. One-third of the book describes a series of somatic therapies; it might be more useful to say that any intervention that presents a corrective emotional experience (rather than only a cognitive one) is helpful – and make this section a second book. What do I know, though? The Body Keeps the Score has consistently had a waitlist of a month or more at my local library – eight years after it was first published!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 26, 2022","Jan 22, 2023","Dec 26, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60749618-the-body-keeps-the-score
