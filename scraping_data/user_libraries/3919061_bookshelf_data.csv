The editors' decision to include some works by a few seminal songwriters (e.g. W. C. Handy, Ma Rainey) is a good one. The proportional representation of each poet feels about right, with the largest sections being devoted to Frost, Stevens, Pound, Williams, and Eliot. The biographical sketches are excellent, as are the notes, by and large (the notes on Pound's poems occasionally seem arbitrary; apparently, the editors have decided to translate the foreign-language phrases used by Pound, but have decided not to try to explain many of the now foreign-seeming references--to be sure, a thorough annotation of the Pound poems included in this anthology would quickly overrun the space available). One of the pleasures a of a good historical anthology such as this one is the way it allows one to see the work of one poet vis-a-vis the work of another. For example, I found it rewarding to read the best of Edward Arlington Robinson's work in proximity to some of the best poems of Frost. Similarly, it is quite interesting to go from some of the cantos of Pound right into the work of Marianne Moore--this reminds one how playful (often mischievously, even angrily playful) Pound's poetry can feel and how serious Moore's poems can seem, just beneath the comedic surface. (One also is reminded of how much of Pound's poetry seems suffused with a paranoid fear of usury and money in general--and there can be little doubt that, in Pound's paranoid, half-baked political worldview, his raging against money-lending and ""the Syphilis of the State"" is all bound up quite tightly with his virulent anti-Semitism.)There are many poets in this volume to discover and re-discover. I had forgot just how startling Mina Loy's poems can be. I had never paid any attention to Robinson's poems, thinking he was old-fashioned and backward-looking; what a pleasure it was to read his poems in this collection. I had not read Jeffers in a very long time, and it was good to read poems like ""Vulture"" and ""Hurt Hawks"" again. (I read a lot of Jeffers in my last two years of high school, and then later 'rejected' his work as being a bit too macho--and I also was turned off a bit when I read of critics finding in Jeffers a kind of ""proto-fascism""--which is somewhat absurd on a number of levels, particularly considering that few intelligent readers would reject the work of Yeats because of his dubious political views, and Pound is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential poets of his century. After all, even Wallace Stevens--aesthetic radical that he may have been--was a Republican who apparently liked to provoke inebriated fights… Not exactly the amiable, 'sensitive' man one might expect or hope for.) It was great to read H. D. again, and Amy Lowell. And it was good to discover a poem like Einor Wylie's ""Incantation.""This is a great collection to keep near to hand.

Anyone who wants to understand the fraught history of the Left in America has to include this wild, ironic, and visionary title on her or his reading list...A few quotes:On the change of mood in the hippie movement, over the course of the 1960s, from bright and happy, to dark and tormented:“A generation of the American young had come along different from five previous generations of the middle class. The new generation believed in technology more than any before it, but the generation also believed in LSD, in witches, in tribal knowledge, in orgy, and revolution. [...] Their radicalism was in their hate for authority—the authority was the manifest of evil to this generation. It was the authority who had covered the land with those suburbs where they stifled as children while watching the adventures of the West in the movies, while looking at the guardians of dull genial celebrity on television; they had had their minds jabbed and poked and twitched and probed and finally galvanized into to surrealistic modes of response by commercials cutting into dramatic narratives.”""Now, here, after several years of the blandest reports from the religious explorers of LSD, vague Tibetan lama goody-goodness auras of religiosity being the only publicly announced or even rumored fruit from all trips back from the buried Atlantis of LSD, now suddenly an entire generation of acid-heads seemed to have said goodbye to easy visions of heaven, no, now the witches were here, and rites of exorcism, and black terrors of the night...The hippies had gone from Tibet to Christ to the Middle Ages, now they were Revolutionary Alchemists."" “An extraordinary multiplication of the romantic, but it was not Rubin’s apocalyptic vision alone–it had been seen before by men so vastly different (but for the consonants of their name) as Castro, Cortes, and Christ–it was the collective vision now of the drug-illumined and revolutionary young of the American middle class.”And the great, gothic, brilliantly hyperbolic last paragraph of the book—could there be a better way of summing up 1967 in America:“Brood on that country who expresses our will. She is America, once a beauty of magnificence unparalleled, now a beauty with a leprous skin. She is heavy with child no one knows if legitimate—and languishes in dungeon whose walls are never seen. Now the first contractions of her fearsome labor begin—it will go on: no doctor exists to tell the hour. […] she will probably give birth, and to what?—the most fearsome totalitarianism the world has ever known? or can she, poor giant, tormented lovely girl, deliver a babe of a new world brave and tender, artful and wild? Rush to the locks. God writhes in his bonds. Rush to the locks. Deliver us from our curse. For we must end on the road to that mystery where courage, death, and the dream of love promise of sleep.”...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 06, 2013","Nov 08, 2013","Nov 06, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12474.The_Armies_of_the_Night

Girard argues here (without a shred of real evidence) that the Christian 'Passion story' fundamentally changed human consciousness, human ethics, and human history. Accordingly, Girard argues that Christianity is the one true belief system--all other beliefs (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc.) are erroneous. Even though I was raised as an Episcopalian, and continue to attend an Episcopalian church on a fairly regular basis, I find the sort of argument that Girard makes here to be fundamentally repellant and shameful.While Girard is very careful always to refer to ""Judeo-Christianity,"" he makes no secret of his belief that Christianity is an improvement on Judaism. I also find this sort of thing highly dubious, repellant, and shameful. This is in fact the sort of thing that makes me always rather suspicious of French Catholicism (such as Girard's).This is not a work of anthropology (as Girard claims it to be). It is simply a conservative Christian polemic, in which the author rages, eventually, against postmodernism, relativism, secularism, 'unbelievers,' abortion, the pursuit of pleasure, ""too much freedom,"" and all forms of non-Christianity.

The treatment of religion also interested me more. St. John resembles a sternly passionate, self-conflicted pastor in an Ingmar Bergman film ('Winter Light'?); and of course there is Brocklehurst, the cruel, evangelical hypocrite. And yet I had forgot utterly that the novel ends, rather suprisingly, with the closing of a pious prayer, not uttered by Jane herself (that would be truly surprising) but in a letter from St. John:‘Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!’(It is somewhat curious that 'Jane Eyre' begins famously with an exterior blockage--‘There was no possibility of taking a walk that day’--and ends with an interior invocation, and a desire to be removed at last from this world of suffering and 'vile bodies,' as St. John would see it.)At all events, the character of Jane herself is so impressive and attractive--so smart, so witty, so strong, so human--that whatever reservations one may have about the patent absurdities of the narrative are jettisoned; all disbelief is suspended willingly, and one is happy to follow Jane anywhere.There is so much brilliant writing in this book, and there are so many tightly-wrought dialogues--the repartee between Jane and Rochester seems to contain the seeds not only of Henry James's psychological nuances but also the pleasurable tension of a Preston Sturges script.One could draw many quotations from 'Jane Eyre,' but one passage that stood out for me, in this re-reading, is surely the voice of Charlotte Bronte herself, contemplating the state of literature and poetry in her own post-Romantic, post-idealist time. Poetry's situation looks bleak, facing the twin juggernauts of capitalism and materialism, but one cannot give up hope...'I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day. Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius Banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell of your own meanness.'The illustrations by Simon Brett in this edition are, I think, just right.

(Taleb avoids the long-standing question--arising from both physics and mathematics--of whether there is such a thing as randomness at all.) It is, rather, a book partly about extremely complex systems and low-frequency (rare) events, both of which present huge obstacles when it comes to forecasting. It is also about the all-too-human tendency toward overconfidence--we often think we know more than we do know. We are often more optimistic than may be warranted by the facts, and this optimism may simply be part of our inherited cognitive 'toolox,' as it were. (On the other hand, others may be too pessimistic than is warranted, which also presents problems, of course.)Markets are not random (""random walk"" theory notwithstanding), but they are extremely complex, needless to say. Markets can be analyzed into vast numbers of transactions, none of which is truly random. (Even transactions executed by a computer are determined by a program, which is itself determined by its human authors.)As with many authors (and philosophers), Taleb is well aware of how extreme propositions tend to attract much more attention than do moderate ones (or obviously ambivalent ones). For this reason, I think, Taleb tends to overstate the case wherever possible, only to back down and moderate his position elsewhere in the book. For instance, Taleb will in one place mock all attempts to forecast markets through the use of models (no matter how sophisticated), while in another place in the book he will give a certain amount of credit to the use of models (as he should). Taleb likes to compare not only the markets but life itself to a Roulette wheel, though surely he knows that such a comparison breaks almost as soon as one begins to give it any serious thought. (As any biologist or paleontologist can demonstrate readily, nature exhibits a high degree of order and predictability.)Taleb, being an avid collector and auto-didact, cobbles together little insights from various disciplines, such as mathematics, game theory, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary psychology. None of the theoretical information is new, exactly, but Taleb, like Malcolm Gladwell, combines existing theories with a certain elan.One may appreciate, too, Taleb's brief forays into Proust, Rimbaud, and Cavafy, though it is difficult to shake the impression that Taleb's use of these authors is not terribly deep or compelling; on the contrary, Taleb's literary references feel gratuitous and decontextualized, giving rise to a suspicion that they may be part of an effort to create an aura of erudition. (In my own experience, truly well-read people tend not to go round boasting of their reading, the way Taleb does again and again. Some variation of Queen Gertrude's line, 'The lady doth protest too much, methinks,' begins to rise up in the reader's mind, slowly but surely. There is something vaguely arriviste about Taleb's literary name-dropping, perhaps not unlike the showy talk of wine vintages and hand-tailoring that Taleb so hates to hear among newly-enriched, vulgar traders.)Near the end of the book, Taleb turns to the philosophy of Stoicism, a philosophical heritage from which Taleb feels we can learn much of use today. It is hard to object to this, but this book is not a particularly Stoical text. The Stoics believed in viewing all people as impartially as possible--whereas Taleb relishes mocking people, both particular people and whole classes of people. Not only is this not Stoical, but it seems childish and transparently resentful, and makes the author seem silly and tedious, like an angry boy settling some scores with other boys in the school courtyard.Indeed, this is a highly attitudinal book, in which the author arrogantly displays, peacock-like, his colorful biases. Unless one enjoys Taleb's now-famous personality, one is likely to find in this book a few interesting signals, buried in an awful lot of blustery noise.Regarding the markets, here is what the investor and analyst Kenneth Fisher has written, perhaps with less drama than Taleb, but more measured and, perhaps, more sensible: ""You can’t develop a portfolio strategy around endless possibilities. You wouldn’t even get out of bed if you considered everything that could possibly happen..... you can use history as one tool for shaping reasonable probabilities. Then, you look at the world of economic, sentiment and political drivers to determine what’s most likely to happen—while always knowing you can be and will be wrong a lot.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 12, 2013","Jan 16, 2013","Jan 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness
