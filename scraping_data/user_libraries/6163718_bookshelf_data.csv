And then I had to find a book at short notice with a statue on the cover, and this was available at the library.I have never read Sylvia Plath. I should, but with all the hype around her, I am hesitant to. And so a book about a Sylvia Plath scholar writing a thesis and presentation about her, didn't tickle my fancy. But this book was surprising. And not at all what I thought it would be.This is a wonderful dissection of growing up in Australia, as an immigrant and what it is like in an immigrant family, but also just as an Aussie kid or young adult at a certain time. It's an interrogation of being a young woman at a certain point in time in both Australia and the world generally, and the toll it is to be a constant people pleaser. What it is navigating the word as someone who was religiously brought up is now lapsed, the complicated nature of creative friendships, how it is to live with chronic pain, the constant struggle to work within the academic space... There is a fricking lot in this tiny book.The book annoyed me at times with it's overly laboured poetic or creative writing exercise passages which were interesting the first time or two they got you, but carried on a little to much. But at the same time, there was writing in this book that will absolutely stick with me for a long time - the interrogation of growing up in the time of the bimbo as an example. Or the discussion of how the concept of God impacts your life when you were raised in the Church but no longer believe as another.The narrator was exceptional as well. She did so many accents well it was amazing - Australian, Malaysian/Australian, multiple English dialects, New Zealand, Scottish - a lot within the same conversation. She also had to change between English, Malay, and Hokkien words mid-sentence. It sounds like a recipe for disaster but it was really well done....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 17, 2024","Feb 24, 2024","Feb 17, 2024",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/201067243-but-the-girl

I learnt a lot, and appreciated the historical notes at the end. While I didn't love the characters, I felt fondness for most of them. Particularly with Zare and his family. I hope the Sami mythology and culture we were taught was in consultation and therefore true to what they believe and would have done. The period of witch trials I find fascinating and horrific. It was obviously a lot of semi-educated men who were deeply suspicious, deeply superstitious, and had to have believed women were almost a different species. Hated women but still needed them. This book highlighted the above and showcased the contempt and cruelty enough so you could get a understanding but not too much to make you stop.What did make me stop was just the fact this book just seemed to never end. It was a 16 hour audiobook. I usually listen to a book or a podcast for at least an hour a day. This took me 6 weeks to listen too, as I was just going to anything else after about 8 hours. It was just so long. I think that my tolerance level for superfluousness and bad writing (latter not so much of a problem in this book) is a lot lower in audiobooks, as I have to spend time listening to someone speak it, and I know it's going to be annoying or necessary before the sentence is finished (let alone the paragraph) - a bit like this sentence! Like a lot of small talk at parties. But you are stuck. All the podcasts I listened to instead of going back to finish this one was me looking desperately around the room for someone I vaguely knew. I think I would have enjoyed it more as a print book. But still a good story....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 26, 2023","Dec 13, 2023","Oct 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62605504-the-witches-of-vard

I think she is incredibly intelligent, has highlighted massive problems within society in regards to misogyny and disability welfare, and a brilliant public speaker. She was also wonderful when I met her at an author signing, warm and engaging with everyone, before and after her Ask the Author event.That said, this book nearly did me an injury from the amount of eye rolling and mutterings of ""for fucks sake"". RSI worthy amounts. Pandora is not just naive, but is mind numblingly dumb at times. Other times, she is conveniently savvy and resourceful for the plot. But most of the time she is devoid of any deductive reasoning. The world, or really, suburb, Moss is creating I am interested in. I want to know about it and it's inhabitants. That was the most interesting bit of the story and it was sort of mentioned and then chucked in a corner. Which was a shame. I also do not care one bit about fashion. I know Moss was a fashion model before writing/PhD/advocacy work. But my god, I do not care. And the clothes are all such a thing in this book. Like in her other series, where the main character is a model, it just bores the shit out of me. If I had to pick the next book up because there were no other real options for a challenge book, I wouldn't avoid it. But it's just not my kind of urban fantasy.

Which is a cheap paperback in Australia, and I am a book hoarder and the child of a WWII kid who was a stockpiler of bargins, so I was sold. And this book was one of the other two in the bundle.At this stage, I will read anything Emily Henry writes. And not because I like romance, I usually hate it. But her writing is clever and witty, sarcastic and satirical, and just gets you engaged as much as the majority of your body is actively resisting you getting invested. The two books I have read, the four main characters are involved in the book industry which I kinda love the meta-ness but also, write what you know!This all said, I preferred Book Lovers a little more. This one felt a little more cliche and I am not sure if it was because it was an earlier book or coz the premise was similar to the other I had read and it felt a bit same same. I also wasn't entirely sure about the cult stuff, which another part of my brain was 100% in for. But was it the right fit... not sure. But still very enjoyable, brain cleansing read with a positive relationship.

Particularly as I sat on her last rec for 10 years and it was a 5 star read (On Chesil Beach), so was not doing that again.This isn't a stereotypical romance book as I think of. This one is very self aware and very tongue in cheek, actively discussing and paying out the tropes of the romance genre, either making them a game, or doing so because it is ultimately a romance but it knows it is doing it. I really appreciated it knew exactly what it need to do and what the book was.Speaking of appreciating, another massive thing I appreciated was Nora and Charlie's flirting. My god. As someone who is full of sarcasm, cynicism, and pay outs, their quick and intelligent flirting, banter, and just interactions were wonderful. I know it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it very funny and if a man I was interested in had conversational sparring matches with me like that... I mean it would probably end like the book did. And on that, you know what the ending is because, its a romance. It again probably didn't need as many tension points in the book that it did. I didn't really get the sisters' relationship but I never really do. But was a little to saccharine and inconsistent for me.Otherwise, my friend was right.

And it is, to an extent. It's a twisty, turny book, told from multiple perspectives. The first you take as true, as why wouldn't you? But each new person who picks up the baton learns bits and pieces that shake what you thought was true before and makes you question everything.That said, there are a few flaws that drove me a little crazy:• The details that are given about getting places is excruciating. I don't care what highway someone took out of New York, what turn off they too, how long they drove down it and turned right on to something in New Jersey, then took a left and parked in front of the school house. I do not care.• The second and third perspectives are incapable of referring to any of the other characters except by their full names. I know Laura is Laura Baines. There is only one Laura in the book. You could call her Laura, or Baines if you wish, but you don't have to... oh okay, you're going to anyway... for 200pp or so. Great.• The author has this annoying habit of over explaining details. They don't really have rhyme or reason of what he chooses to go into great detail about, but you will be stuck there being borderline mansplained to.This said, it was a reasonable twisty read for a random pick up....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 30, 2023","Jul 08, 2023","Jun 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29905588-the-book-of-mirrors

This is a book you need to take time with and let the stream of consciousness take you. This is a book where you need to be prepared for the topics (I was slightly but had forgotten) and be able to give them and you the care and attention they and you need to deal with them. You need to absorb and be swept along with the lyrical nature of the writing.I really enjoyed this book, although I feel uncomfortable using that word with this book. It was an exploration into some heavy topics and a man who has lost's state of mind. I did take my time with it, but this meant I spent a lot of time with it in a few days. In some ways I think that was a blessing as I think it worked me spending more time with Tom at once, although I do think I still rushed him a little. And sometimes you don't rush an Irishman.This was my first Sebastian Barry, and it will not be my last. Even if I marinated fully in this book I still think it would have been a 4 star read.

I found a poetry book I cannot stop thinking about. I found a poetry collection that made me stop and find Lexx and make him listen to the poems I had just read. I found poetry that connected.Not all of this book did it for me. There were certain poems that I just did not have the cultural experience or understanding to connect with. But I appreciated them and their teachings.But others. Others about colonialism, nuclear testing, racism both from within and outside the Pacific communities, climate change and impacts, health issues within Indigenous communities, internalised racism, politics... they all resonated. And at times resonated with a punch to the gut.And that is not to say this tiny book is bleak. It is funny and insightful, it just doesn't gloss over the massive impacts that the Marshall Islands (which includes Bikini Atoll for those of us old enough to remember that name. I didn't know that until this book) have experienced over the past 150 years or so. I have never understood 'modern' poetry before. It can pretty, but why not write prose? But this is a collection that shows why you use poetry as a medium, where a perfect phrase and no other fluff, structured in the simplest way is art with words, and sometime literally is art with words.

Finding a YA book that doesn't annoy the shit out of me at the moment is an amazing achievement.There was vague faerie feel but with an original spin. There were Hungarian lesbian punks.

Then I accidentally listened to the audiobook as I forgot I had the hard copy and the narration was really good too.

I have a friend who's family owns a large cattle station in Far North Queensland, and this book matches so many descriptions that he has told us over the years. The oppressive and lethal heat (although he still finds days here down south under 40C cold), the barren and desolate but completely beautiful country. The isolation and the need for families to be completely self sufficient and able to rely on themselves and their staff for everything. And with that comes problems. I very much appreciated the honest take of the problems that happen in Australian life still, not just in remote, isolated families, but in urban environments too. The problem however with these communities is that when help or friends or medical assistance are a drive hours and hours away, the issues compound. People have problems with violence in the home when help is 15 mins away, when it is 4 hours away that must be so disempowering. And I appreciated the detailed discussion about these issues.

I was skeptical, mainly as I don't really like celebrity memoirs. That and when it was first suggested to me, I had only seen Eric Ripert's own show and I did not like him at all. As 2021 has progressed, I have now watched a fair amount of Parts Unknown, and Bourdain obviously liked the guy. He was also shown in a very different light than his own show, and was much more likable. So here we are.I really enjoyed the first half of this book, although enjoyed seems a bit harsh with the realities that young Eric had to live through and deal with. A lonely kid who had to deal with a lot of loss and upheaval. As well as violence and other near misses in his life. But it was lovely how he talked about his mother, that maybe he was unaware at the time, but she was his biggest believer even when she made poor decisions that impacted him. I have no doubt she has beaten herself up over some of this as she has learnt of it. But also hearing how he grew and thrived under the wings of other adult advocates and, dare I say it, mentors, was great.I just think the book plateaued a lot once he got to Paris. I understand the restaurants he was working in where some of the best in the world at the time. I understand that this was so so so incredibly formative. But this part really needed a good edit, I just got stupidly bored.I was ready after this to find out how the move to America went and how it ended up the way it did in New York. But the book just ended. Which was a little anticlimactic after all the build up. It just, fizzled.But if you need a book to tick Andorra off the list.

There wasn't really anything on this persons shelf on my tbr list, that I could source easily, or not cost me a large amount of money. Except for this one. I had heard about Ali Smith, but I must say that I was never really won over by anything I had read about her or her novels.So with low expectations (well, critics say she's brilliant but doesn't sound like my thing) I went into this novel about a woman and her navigating a post-Brexit UK, her long term friendship with an elderly neighbour, and her relationship with her mum. And I was wonderfully surprised. Mainly as any of you who have read some of my other s would know, that I am not a fan of poetry. I want to be, but am not. But *this* novel is that bridge between the two that I have wanted to find. Enough narrative to drive the poetry, and not enough poetry to overwhelm the narrative. The writing here is poetic and stream of consciousnesses at times without being wanky and pretentious. It's lyrical but then reigns it in and tells the story.It also has the most real and perfect piece of writing I have ever read that sums up my own personal feeling of exhaustion at everything that has happened in the world, particularly for me in Aus, the UK, the US, but just generally everywhere over the past 5-6 years. I still think on this frequently:""I’m tired, she says.It’s only two miles, Elisabeth saysThat’s not what I mean, she says. I’m tired of the news. I’m tired of the way it makes things spectacular that aren’t, and deals so simplistically with what’s truly appalling. I’m tired of the vitriol. I’m tired of the anger. I’m tired of the meanness. I’m tired of the selfishness. I’m tired of how we’re doing nothing to stop it. I’m tired of how we’re encouraging it. I’m tired of the violence there is and I’m tired of the violence that’s on its way, that’s coming, that hasn’t happened yet. I’m tired of liars. I’m tired of sanctified liars. I’m tired of how those liars have let this happen. I’m tired of having to wonder whether they did it out of stupidity or did it on purpose. I’m tired of lying governments. I’m tired of people not caring whether they’re being lied to any more. I’m tired of being made to feel this fearful. I’m tired of animosity. I’m tired of pusillanimosity.I don’t think that’s actually a word, Elisabeth says.I’m tired of not knowing the right words, her mother says.""I was going to give this 4 stars, and was going to say that I wasn't really going to seek out more of Smith's books. But writing this I think I will give it 5 as it's stuck with me so much since. And I may seek them out, but I need to make sure I manage those expectations down again. I feel if you go into her writing looking for the sublime it won't work.

They are interesting relics of the past that are discussed and discarded in Psych 1001 and moved on from to the scientific method instead of what someone told me while sitting in their parlor drinking tea, that their wife said once. So with a degree in Psych where day one is ""Freud is bullshit, lets move on"", this book was excruciating. Also the characters cannot put two and two together at all.

Everyone, EVERYONE, she met decided a 12 year old was grotesque and therefore not a human.That was not okay and was rather jarring with EVERYTHING else in this book.
