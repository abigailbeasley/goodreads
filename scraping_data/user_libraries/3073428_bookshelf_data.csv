Instead of reacting as one might expect, she continues on autopilot, becoming increasingly undone as the wedding day nears. What I found compelling about her unravelling is that she finds comfort in food. Lots of food. The complicated relationship many women have with food is a topic not often explored. There’s a line towards the end of the book when Piglet compares her fiancé’s indulgence in pleasures of the flesh to her indulgence in culinary pleasures, and I loved it. I’m a stress eater, so I related to Piglet’s stress response (although hers was pretty extreme!). Ultimately, this is a book about family and finding oneself.
