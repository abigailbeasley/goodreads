It did get a bit confusing and dragged at times because there were so many characters and because of the back and forth and the details about the operations. It was well written but didn’t really hold my interest even though it got more personable toward the end and less about the operations even though it was based on real people.Even though it was not an enjoyable read for me, we do need to thank these brave men and women for their unwavering efforts to fight for France and risk their lives as they resisted the Germans.THE WOMAN WITH NO NAME will be enjoyed by historical fiction fans, fans of strong women based on a real person, and details about war operations. 3/5Thank you to the publisher for a copy of this book.

Why? That definitely kept me reading. I wanted to find out the reason why and what the kidnapping was for and what the non-revealed secret was that popped up from Cassie’s past.

You will love Hira, a 10-year-old who ran away from a life of luxury at her unloving, cruel uncle’s house, just because of her innocence about not knowing what was really out there outside of her lovely upbringing.You will love Alice just because she’s a feisty woman in the 1920s and head of a gang of women who steal to survive.You will love Lillian, a police woman from Scotland Yard, who is trying her best to show the men that she can do what they do, and even do it better.You will love Dorothy, an unassuming, but talented clerk in a department store who is kind and generous especially to Hira. Queens of London will capture your interest immediately because of the setting, the time period, the characters, and the interest about these women called The Forty Elephants and what they do.You won’t know who to root for because they are all likable characters, but I was sort of leaning toward Hira, because she didn’t know what she had gotten herself into after leaving her uncle's house even though she knew it would be worse where he was going to send her.Dorothy was also a favorite because she was a sweetheart, and I hoped she would be able to get her designs noticed. I knew Heather Webb would not disappoint. Her books are always amazing...terrific writing and interest-keeping storyline.Her research is impeccable. Based on characters, THE QUEENS OF LONDON will be enjoyed by historical fiction fans and fans of life in London at this time.ENJOY the antics, sorrows, and lives of the characters!!

She saves books and people.Another marvelously researched gem by Madeleine Martin focusing on the love of books, enduring hardships, friendship, and family.Be sure to read the author’s notes.Thank you to the publisher for an advanced copy of this book.

The children had a wonderful life of learning and love but a life that heart-wrenchingly changed after the war. Where will Ana and Oskar end up?We meet Roger who grew up in a convent to be kept safe, who was very inquisitive, a clever, witty writer of stories and jokes, and sadly had no parents to go home with on holidays.We find out what happens to him and where he goes.We meet Renata as an adult who is a scientist in Israel at an archeological dig. We learn of Israel’s beauty as Renata takes side trips to Tel Aviv and other places. On her shopping trip she finds a hand-chiseled chessboard and an ornately carved set of nesting boxes.Could the craftsman in the shop be none other than Oskar whose uncle taught him to whittle and make beautiful shapes out of wood?I will dearly miss the characters…especially Oskar….he was my favorite.It also was fun to see our favorite violinist again from THE YELLOW BIRD SINGS.Another beautiful, beautiful but heartbreaking-to-the-core read based on true events.ONCE WE WERE HOME does have some happy stories tucked inside as well, along with comments you will ponder, and thoughts about life’s worries and lessons.

A little later, we follow Fenna as she escapes from an orphanage and goes back home to live with Arie and his family.Fenna and Arie are in love, but Fenna can't marry because she said she would never be a good mother since the screams from the Christmas event of screaming children still rings in her ears.She then leaves Arie...she is heartbroken and she knows he will be too. Fenna learns tricks and is in a Vaudville show when she is approached by an intelligence officer who wants her to help them defy the Germans.We follow her through the war as she helps invent gadgets for soldiers that look like one thing but could be a razor or a compass or anything to help soldiers escape.The turned down edge of the cover gives a clue about one of the clever gadgets created.Fenna was a very determined, brave girl and woman.Despite the historical aspect and the interesting facts about the inventions and the as-always marvelous writing style and extensive research of Ms. McMorris, THE WAYS WE HIDE was not that attention-grabbing for me.  It moved along slowly and took a while for me to be fully engaged in the story line, but the last quarter of the book pulled me in. Those readers who enjoy historical fiction and want to learn something new will definitely enjoy this book that I think could have been a bit shorter.Her author notes give wonderful facts you won’t want to miss reading. Of special interest is the meaning of Fenna's last name.

Gran dies, but before she passes she leaves a note for Audrey about a cottage in Yorkshire, England, that she left to Audrey.What also is puzzling to Audrey is why did Gran leave the cottage all those years ago and why if she had been a Lady why wasn't the cottage grand. Audrey finds the cottage charming and full of things from Gran's past.Under the floorboards are even more interesting pieces of Gran's life. She kept them secret for all those years.1915 - We meet Emilie, Gran's mother, and Audrey's great grandmother.Emilie lives in luxury, but feels hemmed in with all the restrictions put on her by her family and their decision to have her marry someone she doesn't love.Emilie escapes to London with nothing but scorn from her family and joins the VAD's - nurses in the Voluntary Aid Detachment. Nursing isn't for Emilie, but she finds her true love in one of the hospital beds.We follow both women and learn how everything is connected.I fell in love with the cottage and would love to live in it. Does Audrey sell the cottage or go back to her life in the United States with her controlling sister and father and a life of nursing she hopes is still there for her? I know which one I would choose.The writing is wonderful, and the cover is a pull-in, but I enjoyed the present-day chapters more than the 1915 ones.

A horrible institution for the mentally challenged and an institution that tortured the patients and didn't take proper care of them.Sage overheard her stepfather talking with a friend about how the school called and said Rosemary ran away again.When Sage confronts him about it, he denies it. He then explains that he and her mother thought it would be better if Sage had thought Rosemary had passed away.Sage was furious - knowing her sister was still alive and she could have visited her was heartbreaking. Sage made a decision to go to the school and help find her sister.She told no one her plans, got on a bus dressed in clothing not suitable for winter, had her purse stolen, and got pulled into the bowels of the institution with the doctors and nurses thinking she is her sister....the missing Rosemary.What a nightmare, and to think this is based on a true story and where they put mentally challenged children for over 40 years until it was exposed by Geraldo Rivera.Ms. Wiseman takes us inside to witness the treatment of these girls and of Sage's nightmare of trying to tell everyone she is NOT Rosemary.

In essence, it was a demotion.She wouldn’t give up her investigating that she had worked on for years and became obsessed with the family who moved into her home - especially the woman Madeline - because she thought she was the Iranian spy.Beth also lost her husband to divorce, and her last child was now in college.

The German officers would ""shop"" in the store.Some of the workers found the things from their families and made their time in the furniture store even worse.The prisoners also confiscated personal papers they found for anyone who may survive and have something of their loved ones. That was one way they could defy the enemy.We follow Mathilde and Capucine both present and past through alternating chapters.Loved learning about the gorgeous fans Capucine's father made before the war and that spoke to others simply by where the fan was placed on one's face or heart. You will LOVE the characters as we also meet men and women in the French Resistance.You will be amazed at how the prisoners in this furniture store camp worked together to keep spirits up. I had never heard of this camp and what was going on inside. Such interesting facts and research but that obviously included the heartbreaking situations of WWII.THE PARIS SHOWDOWN will keep your interest even though it is a bit confusing at first with all the characters.Another book Juliet Blackwell fans won’t want to miss. 4/5This book was given to me by the publisher via NetGalley for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 28, 2022","Mar 03, 2022","Feb 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58613554-the-paris-showroom

Her first position did not last long because she couldn't leave England for America with this family. The school found her another position at the remote Hardcastle House taking care of the four children of Mr. and Mrs. England.Ruby May was worried about taking care of four children, but the children should not have been her main concern.The staff at Hardcastle House was not welcoming, and Ruby had to do many things she hadn't done in her first position.Along with everything else, Mr. England was subtly controlling, and Mrs. England was quiet as a mouse. Mrs. England seemed to be afraid of her husband, and Ruby saw cigar burns on her hands.Was this house safe for her and for the children?Why was Mrs. England so quiet, and why did she seem so indifferent to her children?Why did Mr. England not trust his wife to take care of their children?MRS.

I was looking up Clara Lemlich and the owners of the factory Isaac Harris and Max Blanck who literally got away with murder.The book also addressed the love of family and keeping religious and family traditions from fading away as well as women protesting for rights.

How could danger be this far reaching?Owen McKenna is back and this time is solving the disappearance of Jade Jaso who was related to a Pony Express rider and whose ancestors had something to do with stolen jade statues.While searching for clues in Jade's house, Owen finds a coded letter from 160 years ago that was written by President Abraham Lincoln. After reading the letter, and finding out the meaning of the coded message, Owen realizes this definitely has something to do with Jade’s father’s death and then her disappearance.What could have been in that coded letter that someone desperately wants after all these years?Owen amazes us again at his research skills and his skills at intimidating witnesses with the help of His Largeness.As the investigation continues, in typical Owen fashion, we can’t have him investigating without some tension and danger as he narrows in on where he thinks Jade may be.This time Owen’s plane is shot at and is leaking gas as he and his girlfriend, Street, are 10,000 feet in the air.Of course that isn't all he was involved in that upped the tension as the book draws to its close.Owen's ending heroics will have you on the edge of your seat as he narrows in on Jade's rescue.I always learn something about an unknown sport or an interesting historical fact when reading Mr. Borg's books.He is a wealth of information, and his writing style keeps you very interested.If you are interested in the Pony Express, Abraham Lincoln and his connections to Leland Stanford of California, learning horse jargon, and following Owen on his newest detective adventure, you will enjoy TAHOE JADE.We also can’t forget that gorgeous cover. 5/5This book was given to me by the author in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 10, 2021","Jul 13, 2021","Jul 10, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57812762-tahoe-jade

Yona knew nothing other than living off the land, surviving in the forest, and stealing things from stores and people in the villages.When Jerusza died at 102 years of age, Yona was alone but able to survive because of her skills.When Yona meets a group of Jewish folks who had escaped the ghetto, she felt it her duty to help them survive.THE FOREST OF VANISHING STARS takes us with Yona through her years with Jerusza and her harrowing, frightening, and dangerous time with the group as we see them learn the ways of the forest, live with fear, hide from the Nazis, and learn to trust each other.When she is betrayed by the group, she leaves them and has to again make decisions on her own.Ms. Harmel again did meticulous research and portrayed the plight of the characters with such authenticity that you were right there with them suffering through all the horrible conditions they had to endure.This book is a beautiful tribute to the human spirit, to perseverance, and to finding the qualities a person possesses for empathy, kindness, and making choices.Another FIVE star but very heartbreaking gem from Kristin Harmel. 5/5This book was given to me by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"May 31, 2021","Jun 02, 2021","Feb 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711683-the-forest-of-vanishing-stars

Emma had no photos but did some research.Emma’s work was definitely cut out here, but it was so exciting for her to be able to recreate these famous gardens.We also meet two other women who had something to do with the gardens and Highbury House. Each time we meet one of the women, we find a little more about the garden, their lives, and their connection to it all.Venetia Smith, 1907, was the original designer of the many gardens at the Highbury House Estate.Beth Pedley, 1944, worked on a nearby farm. She would deliver goods to Highbury House and loved the gardens. She also wanted to and did sketch the gardens. These sketches were helpful to Emma.These three women were easy to like, and I loved how the gardens were the main focus for all three of them.There were many gardens filled with flowers that represented the name of each garden.The different gardens were: The Tea Garden, The Lovers' Garden, The Bride's Garden, The Poet's Garden, The Children’s Garden, and The Winter Garden that was behind locked gates and Emma didn't know why.No one knew why it was kept locked or where the key was, but you will find out when you read this lovely book.Along with the beautiful writing of Ms. Kelly, the gardens, and the story line, there also is some romance in each time period.If you enjoy Ms. Kelly's books, you will not want to miss this one. 5/5This book was given to me by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Dec 10, 2020","Dec 13, 2020","Aug 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54304262-the-last-garden-in-england

THE VACATION was a bit slow and had a lot of domestic drama and characters with secrets - adults and children alike.Cliffhangers were placed at the end of each chapter that definitely were intriguing, but I wasn't ""dying"" to get back to reading the book until around 50% in.There was a slow build up with hints at things not being right, but the last chapters definitely made up for it all.The ending was typical, amazing Mr. Logan that was oh so good and satisfying because most of the characters were not likeable. 4/5This book was given to me by the publisher via Netgally in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 11, 2020","Jun 14, 2020","Jun 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51177136-the-vacation

When she questioned the governors of the Foundling, they had no answer, but her second try at finding something out had her introduced to a doctor who was going to try to help her.

If you can hang in there, the ending is well worth the wait.The ending wraps up all the loose ends for a satisfying conclusion that will stick with you. 4/5This book was given to me by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2020","Feb 28, 2020",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/44422774-the-other-mrs

Did this newspaper article actually show the book she had used during the war to put children's names in that they had to change to protect their identity?Eva had to go to Berlin immediately to claim it.We now move from present day to 1942 where Eva and her Mother escape from Paris with documents she forged the morning after her father was arrested and taken to a prison camp.Eva and her mother travel to Aurignon, France, on the advice of a friend where they found lodging and an observant owner that realizes their papers aren’t real.That turned out well, though, because the owner was part of the French Resistance. Eva was asked to help forge travel documents and birth certificates for Jewish children.Eva didn’t want to allow the children to be lost forever to their real names so she and Rémy invented a code that would keep the children anonymous but be able to know their real names some day.The code they used was brilliant, and Eva saved many children.

What could have happened?Joe was in treatment for nightmares, and his father wouldn’t let him come home until the treatments resolved his problems.Another question is how did his grandmother find him, and why did she want to find him? Answers are she had a private detective look for him mainly because she wanted him to clean out her house and inventory everything that was in it. That would be a great way to learn about Grandmother Pearl wouldn't it?We go back and forth from 1916 to 1983 and see the family Joe never knew about as we meet Alice and Pearl as young women and Pearl present day. The story from 1916 gave details about the family’s life without their mother, and present day gave details about what Pearl told Joe about her past and his place in her life now.We have another story line that involved a young woman, Kathleen, hiding from her abusive ex-husband in her aunt’s home. Whose home could it be? None other than Aunt Edna.Who is Aunt Edna? She knew Pearl's family, and her sister, Alice, was Aunt Edna's best friend. The odd thing is that when Kathleen and Joe met each other, they did a double take because they seemed familiar to each other, but they couldn't figure out how they knew each other.DOVETAIL pulled me in because the characters and story line were warm and inviting.

She needed to get away and had the perfect excuse. She drove her fiancée to the front, and on her way back, her car was shot up. She thankfully was near her father’s estate and walked there to only find she would be stuck there because the Nazis had arrived and had taken over the estate.We meet Daisy in 1942 who was raised by her grandmother at the Ritz and who eventually helped her grandmother with the resistance.

Babs wants to find out who La Fleur was since her husband called out her name a number of times before his death. She also meets at the Ritz with an American lawyer who is also looking for La Fleur. There are quite a few characters to keep straight, but the main characters are strong, brave, and very likeable.

The funny thing is that her mother has passed away.Miranda never was reliable, and after her job disaster and her father's finding her another job she doesn't want, she thinks this letter from a cousin will save her.Miranda tricks her father into paying for her flight from Australia to England to find out what the letter meant and finds herself being interviewed for a job as a nanny instead of why she came in the first place. Did Miranda go from a bad situation to a worse one?She can't reveal why she really arrived, and she doesn't know what really is waiting for her at Barnsley House, but she soon finds out all isn't as it should beWhat she finds are three children, their father, a housekeeper, an empty, not well-kept inn, an estate in disrepair, odd things happening, and no visible mother.Ms. Cockram created the story line in a very creative way. She revealed some of the family's secrets by using a book Miranda’s mother had written that describes the history of the house and the family. Ms. Cockram also used a diary with background information of the characters written by the infamous, ""missing"" mother.Everyone and everything seemed to have a secret at Barnsley House. The housekeeper was especially secretive, dangerous, and frightening.If you enjoy odd characters, old mansions, family secrets, supposed ghosts, a stolen book, and Gothic undertones, you will want to have THE HOUSE OF BRIDES added to your TBR.HOUSE OF BRIDES has an absorbing, captivating story line you won't want to put down.Ms. Cockram’s writing style is descriptive and draws you in.

It could have been a number of people...the flirty neighbor, the wife having an affair with Gwen's husband, the husband, or even the daughter. Who is the most likely one?And....this isn't the only crisis in this book...it is only the beginning.We have two families, two unhappy marriages, unhappy children, unhappy adults, an affair between one of the husbands and one of the wives, and a lot of drama with both the children and the adults.The characters all seemed to be distant with each other and focused on themselves with little regard for the other family members.I originally thought THE LAST AFFAIR would be about solving the murder even though the title should have been a clue, but the book is more focused on families. Most of the book was about family relationships more than the murder, but once the affair was revealed to the non-participating spouses and the murder scene described, the book’s tension ramped up and concluded with a chilling ending.This is my first book my Ms. Hunt.

She just wasn’t comfortable around him and felt something was not quite right.Since her father was never found after a boating accident, things had been rough, but this seemed worse.As the days go on, Maggie sees more things happening that seem like control on Simon's part.

Who wouldn't want to go to Champagne, France - well...Rosalyn isn't too excited about going.On her flight over, Rosalyn meets Emma who has found letters from a soldier and a woman that corresponded during the war. She asked Rosalyn to help her put all the letters together and to make some sense out of them, but Rosalyn declines the offer. She said she has to do what her employer asked her to do.When Rosalyn finds one of the letters in her bag that Emma must have not picked up after they all fell to the floor, she becomes interested in the correspondence as she translates the letters through all the grime and worn out and unable-to-be translated words.Rosalyn wishes she would have told Emma she would help her.

All she knows is that she is happy she has her son.Her brother-in-law, Ian, says Tess needs to pay back the 100,000 her husband lent him, flowers are left on her doorstep with no note, her son is being very difficult, and an appointment with a social worker that Tess doesn’t remember making do not add up and make things worse for Tess.We learn of all these things in between the time we meet Tess in the hospital and the flash backs to the days before her son’s eighth birthday party where Tess was stabbed.There was a lot going on as Tess grieved for Mark, and what was going on wasn’t good. She thought she saw Mark in the grocery store, heard people in her driveway at night, had a social worker stopping by looking through her mail, had questions about what Ian told her, had hang-up phone calls at all hours, and other odd happenings.You can feel there is something going on and plenty of hints that seem to go in the wrong direction not allowing you to be able to figure out what is really happening. If you enjoy the feeling of something not quite right growing underneath it all, THE PERFECT SON shouldn’t be missed. If biting your finger nails keeps you reading because of the choices a character makes and doesn’t make and other characters that don't really have another character's best interest in mind, THE PERFECT SON should be your next read.

Being a miner's wife she knew how they and their families could always use help in one way or another.Because of the need, Annie banded together with the wives of the copper miners to stop the unsafe conditions in the copper mines and the deaths of loved ones by trying to get the miners to join the union. The other and main theme was the strike called by the miners so the company would recognize the union and get better working conditions.Annie and the other wives want the men to join the union so they can ask for shorter days and more pay for their dangerous, unhealthful work that only makes the owners of the mines rich.We follow Annie and the families as they prepare to strike to get what they need for their families.We get to see the personal side of this community, share in their sorrows and worries, see how they suffer at the hands of company owners who won't give into union demands, and see how they come together to help one another in times of need.Most of the characters were easy to like and to relate to. Some were despicable.If you are a fan of historical fiction, women's fiction, and learning about the lifestyle and hardships in the early 1900's both personal and work-wise, THE WOMEN OF THE COPPER COUNTRY will be a book you will want to read.This book brought to light for me another not very well-known historical event about the plight of the copper miners and their families in Calumet, Michigan.

The only other choice Ailsa Calder had was to occupy the house which held memories both good and bad.She finds out there are more bad associations with the house than good. The neighbors have been freely roaming in it, and the town’s residents have nothing good to say about her father who disappeared with diamonds.Along with all the trouble with the residents, odd things also happen in the house itself.Ms. Elliott’s writing style is descriptive, but the book is a bit slow and focuses on where Ailsa’s father could be or whether he is dead and on the house that seems to be haunted. At the end of each chapter, a blurb is added about where her father may be or where he may have been all these years.The odd and different characters do pull the story line along and work well together as one mystery after another comes to the surface along with secrets that are revealed.If you are a fan of old houses, family secrets, sibling rivalry, family sagas, mysteries, and some unresolved issues, THE MISSING YEARS is a book you will want to read. You just need to move slowly along with the characters and the story line as everything is revealed in the very peculiar, twisted wrap up. 4/5This book was given to me as an ARC by the publisher in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"Apr 18, 2019","Apr 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40953912-the-missing-years

There are so many references to things that happened in my Italian family that made the read more special - especially the food aspect and the Italian expressions used.

Charlotte blames herself for Phoebe's placement.Once Charlotte is inside, just like Nellie Bly, she sees the horrors and wonders how she will every get out. It was easy to get in, but not as easy to get out.Charlotte found many women there that were not mad but just a nuisance to their family for one reason or another.Charlotte is put in a ward for those women who do not talk and then moved to a different ward shortly after, but she still can’t find her sister in any of the nine wards.What she does find is that these women are not treated very well at all, and it is difficult to see how the harsh treatment could cure anyone.We meet many different personalities, and Ms. Macallister’s detailed descriptions put you into the institution and have you feeling what the women are feeling and going through.Charlotte passes the time she has, and she only has six weeks to find her sister and get out, by figuring out how to find Phoebe, by working in the soapmaking shop, and thinking of her previous life at home and her time with Henry. As Charlotte continues her quest to find her sister, the search becomes difficult and has some unexpected surprises.I enjoyed WOMAN 99.

Are they jealous of each other? Why do they do this reunion every year? They all seem to have secrets and pasts that the others don’t know about.The first-night dinner brings many feelings about each other and frightening feelings about the couple from Iceland. They are poorly dressed and seem most interested in the hunting party that has been arranged.Along with the Lodge guests, we meet mysterious Heather. She seems all organized and put together on the outside, but she has her secrets and something in her past that she wants to forget.THE HUNTING PARTY lets us get to know the guests very well. Actually a little too well...going into all the detail about their lives past and present got a bit too much, but I guess it was necessary for the reader to get the full impact of the reunion and events. We are taken from the festivities to Doug, the gamekeeper, finding a body and showing Heather where he found it. When Heather sees the body, she knows it wasn't an accident.Waiting to find out which one of the friends was the victim and who the killer was kept the tension high. The identity was not made known until the very end. The mystery was a well-kept secret.Ms. Foley's writing is very descriptive and beautiful. I could see every detail of the landscape and feel the emotions of each character. If you can describe writing as lush, that is how beautiful the sentences flowed and created a picture.If you enjoy a mystery, antics of characters, learning that the characters really didn't show their true colors, and waiting for the “ball to drop,” THE HUNTING PARTY will be a book you will want to read. The story line was perfectly carried out and nothing was revealed until the very end. It was an interesting study of personalities. 4/5This book was given to me as an ARC by the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jan 08, 2019","Jan 14, 2019","Jan 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37642030-the-hunting-party

No one does things for her. She is the one who never says no and does things for everyone else.When Martha sees what is in the package, she can’t stop asking herself questions about it. Does this book actually have copies of Martha’s stories that she would write because of her Grandmother's prompting? Martha always was interested in writing stories because her grandmother encouraged her to write them. Her hopes went up, but then went down again thinking it couldn’t be possible that she found a book with her stories in it.What about the note scribbled on the front page that was dated years after her grandmother had died? Could her grandmother have written that note in hopes that Martha would eventually see the book and see that the childhood stories had been published?Could Grandma really be alive after her parents told her she passed away 30 years ago? If so, what made them say that?We meet lovable, helpful, selfless Martha who works in a library and only has her critical sister left so she can’t ask her about the book or Grandmother because Lilian's answer will be completely negative about Martha's findings and her questions just like her father.Martha finds out that Owen a book store owner found the book and the note and left the book for her because she was the only Martha Storm that he knew of.We follow Martha on her quest to find about the book, her grandmother, and how all of this could be possible. We also find out how she changed her life, trusted people, tried to forget her father’s negativity, and came out of her shell.THE LIBRARY OF LOST AND FOUND is another heartwarming GEM by Phaedra Patrick with lovable characters you would want to have in your life and is a book you won't want to end.

They wished for a baby, and when she finally arrived, she was a frightening, evil child.Wishing for a wonderful relationship was what Clara hoped for and thought that's what she had until Luke disappeared and she found out unpleasant things about him.THE LIES WE TOLD has two stories which somehow are connected, but how they are connected is cleverly woven and a well-kept a secret. Hannah, the evil child, was a very frightening story line. The disappearance of Luke was not pleasant, but didn't seem as bad. Hannah was the tie between both story lines, though.THE LIES WE TOLD is so good you won't want to stop reading. The plot is brilliant and tense in both stories and increases with each turn of the page and with each secret and lie revealed.The only way you can experience this amazing thriller is to read it yourself. It is very twisted and very good, and you will be thrown off with each clue.Those readers who like to figure out plots and usually do will most likely be baffled and incorrect in this case.Read THE LIES WE TOLD so you can join in the discussion of this masterfully created book...the characters are quite cunning themselves...namely Hannah. Make sure you have a large block of time available when you start reading this book. 5/5This book was given to me as an ARC by the publisher via NETGALLEY in exchange for an honest .

The rain and flooding continued throughout their time in Paris and throughout the book with worries it would be as bad if not worse than the Paris floods of 1910.THE RAIN WATCHER brings together this family of four from Venozan, London, and San Francisco - no spouses or children - just the four of them. We meet Linden from San Francisco who never got along with his father, Tilia from London who is unhappily married for the second time, and Paul and Lauren their parents. All the characters seemed to have something to hide, but you warmed up to them as the book continued.The children had grown up in Venozan after their parents met when Lauren was on a vacation in France more than 30 years ago. It was a whirlwind romance that had Lauren never going back to the states.The family was still indifferent as always as they gathered together for breakfast and the rain continued to pour down. Lauren insisted they were in a non-flood area of Paris and should continue with their celebration plans.Their celebration was wonderful until something tragic happened at the restaurant and Lauren became ill as well.Besides being part of family issues and seeing how people interact, there was a lot of interesting information about photography. Linden was a famous photographer with a photo of his father taken years ago that made him famous. There is also wonderful information about plants and gardening and Paris.THE RAIN WATCHER is beautifully written and pulls you into the story line with Ms. De Rosnay’s marvelous storytelling skills and details about every situation.

Every whim and want was satisfied for Greta and her family. The description of the mansions was unbelievable, and I laughed when one of the servants confessed she needed a map to navigate the home.The writing style and the detail Ms. Solomons uses draws you into the story even though some of it is filled with politics and business dealings.

He was convicted and sent to prison for five years.When he was released with no home and no money, he went back to his childhood home and decided he needed to change his identity and his entire life.He did find a job as an artist in a theater, but his drinking to blur out all his troubles might turn out to be his downfall.

One day after hours as he was exploring the structure of the theater with his architect’s eye, Douglas noticed something with the wall that looked wrong. What he found in that theater and a second theater gave him pause and had him questioning who really did cause the collapse of the theater. He now knew it hadn’t been his error.The investigation to clear his name had begun.

Did Gilbert really agree to the reason they were going on the Lusitania or did he have ulterior motives?Along with Caroline and Gilbert on a ship in waters that German submarines were prowling, we meet Tess, a female thief, who needed to steal valuable music sheets to pay her bills. We also meet Robert Langford, a man who has been in love with Caroline since the first day he saw her many years ago.All of the characters had a reason to be on the Lusitania, and the reasons were all different.Meanwhile the story line moves from the 1915 Lusitania story to present day and introduces the reader to a struggling author, Sarah Blake, who found a trunk containing things of her great grandfather’s who perished on the Lusitania. This mystery centered around what could these things have to do with Robert Langford and the story.And.....what could Sarah, Caroline, and Tess have in common all those years apart. We knew why Robert was there even though it actually was a coincidence that he and Caroline were booked on the same ship.THE GLASS OCEAN weaves all of these characters together taking us on a ship that was to be a luxury cruise but leads to intrigue, mystery, death, and secrets.The writing is flawless and beautiful even though I was a bit confused at first about how it all was to fit together. Learning the history of the Lusitania, the life style and protocol of the ship’s passengers, and having no sea legs along with the passengers kept my interest.THE GLASS OCEAN is another marvelously researched book that smoothly moves from chapter to chapter and gives the reader a marvelous history lesson. One chapter ended and the next began with a take off from one or two words that ended the previous chapter.ENJOY when you read the newest gem by these lovely, talented ladies. 5/5This book was given to me as an ARC by the publisher.

Was she really born in Illinois? Was Sloan really her last name? Was what her mother told her not the truth?

Lola’s mentor suggested walking in Frieda’s shoes to get an idea about her. Lola did just that, but it didn’t turn out too well. Lola mistakenly and unknowingly came across Dean Reeve, a serial killer who kills anyone who has contact with Frieda, and who still has it out for Frieda. Dean kills others to get to her.No one has been able to track Dean down. Dean has been a character along with Frieda in previous books.Was Dean Reeve back? Frieda definitely thought so, and Dean made sure she knew. And...Frieda knew he wouldn’t stop until he killed her.The book begins as we find that a killer is on the loose. The murders started with a dead man in a stolen car barreling down a steep hill, and another one was a dead man being burned in a bonfire. But that wasn’t the end of the bodies. The count kept getting higher, and the bodies followed a pattern.This is only the second book I have read in this series, and I actually didn’t know it was a series when I read the first one.

Ulla was pregnant with her husband’s brother’s child, but when the husband found out about the baby, he badly hurt his brother, Harald, so Ulla sailed away with the injured Harald and sailed to Odrhan for help. As generations continued so did the legend and its people. The most interesting aspect was that Libby was the current generation of the women involved, and there were many secrets kept by them all. WOMEN OF THE DUNES was captivating simply because of the lifestyle of the original family as well as those who lived in the Sturrock estate today.The women of all generations had stories to tell, the estate’s castle-like home still kept its charm, and the legend made WOMEN OF THE DUNES enticing.I really enjoyed the descriptions of the land and the house. Going back in time and hearing a story re-created is something I always love to read about.The two stories - present and past - connected, came full circle, and brilliantly meshed together as mirrored stories. Any reader who enjoys castles, secrets, looking for clues in old documents, and re-tracing the steps of characters that lived long ago will want to read WOMEN OF THE DUNES.WOMEN OF THE DUNES is going to be a favorite. 5/5This book was given to be as an ARC by the publisher.

Taking him home was the worst thing that could have happened to her because he may be the reason her secret becomes revealed. For some reason the boy, Tobias, knows Cecelia knew Annie, the woman who took care of him and abandoned him. We get background information on Annie that is not very pleasant and then move back and forth to the present with the little boy that connects it all.I wasn't a fan of the main character Cecilia. Her past lifestyle was off-putting for me, and her current life was made of lies. She currently had everything and still wasn't happy.Tobias was a sweet boy who kept everything inside, and he definitely had secrets and answers to the questions the police were asking, but he wouldn't tell them anything. Some of the other characters were very unpleasant. The ongoing questions in the story line are who is Tobias' mother, how did Cecelia really know Annie, and just what is Cecelia’s secret that will destroy her current life.The author’s writing keeps you engaged and especially when she leaves an incriminating, clue-revealing tidbit as the last sentence of the chapter and moves on. We gets hints about what is bothering Cecelia, but never enough information to figure it out. Tobias knows, though, and Cecelia is worried.THE BOY AT THE DOOR is brilliantly written with a creative, odd story line that is a bit unbelievable, but oh so good and attention grabbing. The tension kept me on the edge of my seat as the police questioned Cecelia about Annie and Tobias.

The tension mounted even more when the police arrived, but up until that point, I didn’t think there was that much suspense.GIRLS’ NIGHT OUT gives wonderful reasons for friendships to repair themselves and for women to support each other.GIRLS’ NIGHT OUT was suspenseful because of the missing friend, but the majority of the book was about repairing friendships and revealing secrets.Most of the secrets dealt with domestic abuse which is an excellent topic to get out in the open. Another issue about being safe and making smart decisions when you are in a foreign country and with strangers was addressed. That is great advice and very frightening.

The advertising agency in 2018 became interested in the Subway Girls as an ad campaign for themselves. Olivia who worked for the advertising agency had a brilliant idea to help the transit system and made a connection with the 1949 Subway Girls campaign for their current advertising. She found the campaign as she was doing research, and wondered what really happened to the Subway Girls and if being a Subway Girl really changed or enhanced their lives. Finding this information gave Olivia some hope for her agency’s winning the bid for the ad campaign.Olivia and her assistant, Priya, hit the jackpot when they found actual posters of The Subway Girls and stories of their lives.She uncovered more gems when a neighbor knew and had been one of the The Subway Girls.THE SUBWAY GIRLS is a delightful read. I enjoyed going back to 1949 and seeing how women had to really struggle to get out of the required mold of being a housewife and mother.Ms. Orman Schnall's writing is refreshing and enjoyable. The story line is interesting and had me researching The Subway Girls.According to Wikipedia, these women were called Miss Subways, and the program lasted from 1941 to 1976. Ms. Orman Schnall also added information in the ending pages about how she became interested in The Subway girls and gave some background information about them.THE SUBWAY GIRLS has everything historical fiction and women's fiction fans will love. There is love, heartbreak, secrets, and the story of how women have been trying to ""break out"" from their stereotypical roles since forever.The book goes back and forth from the 1940’s to 2018.

After a plane Two women in dangerous situations through no fault of their own.Annabelle was married, but her husband seemed to be married to his job. After a plane crash, she finds out why there had been a plane crash with him in it.Marina writes stories about men like Annabel's husband, but this current story is a bit too dangerous to continue with even though Marina does.Actually a lot of folks seemed to be in danger, and the persons behind this situation are aware of every move Marina, Annabel, and others are making.After the plane crash and when Annabel was out of her Geneva apartment, it was ransacked. Annabel really became angry and frightened when she came home to the damage. Marina really became angry when she found out some information about her future father-in-law and when she found her friend had been murdered for uncovering incriminating information. What was going on? It all seemed to stem from the Swiss bank and its clients.So many people were involved in this illegal money hiding. It is a pretty frightening concept that seems like it could be “real” in today’s world.The behind-the-scenes hacking and finding out information is also a bit on the scary side.The story line was interesting, but was a little slow at times with all the technical information. As the story continued, though, the tension mounted as everyone involved in the money scheme was coming to the surface and trying to keep those who knew what was going on quiet.THE BANKER’S WIFE addressed high profile and powerful men and women where money was the catalyst, and as the saying goes “the root of all evil.”Perhaps it isn’t a good idea to be a “banker’s wife.” :) If you enjoy secrets, intrigue, corruption, and love, you will enjoy THE BANKER'S WIFE. 4/5I received an advance copy.

She hasn’t told anyone the reason why she has returned to Winthrop’s Island with bruises that no one mentions, but since she stays for a relatively long time, the reason can be assumed even though it might be the wrong guess.Miranda's return isn’t a welcome event even after all of this time, though, because of her testimony at the trial of the lighthouse keeper’s son back in 1951 when she was eighteen and in love with the accused.Miranda hadn’t grown up with the elite and wealthy. When her mother married Hugh Fisher after her father was killed in WWII, she is introduced to that life and also sees how the year-round residents who fish and work as domestics live.THE SUMMER WIVES goes back and forth from 1930 to 1951 and then to 1969. We learn about Miranda’s life, the lives of the Fisher and Monk families, the lives of other island residents, and how the lives of the domestic help are all connected by one specific incident during those years. I enjoyed the story from the 1950’s the best. It was the most interesting and the least confusing. The 1930’s didn’t make sense to me how it fit in, but as I kept reading, I found out that it kept a secret and held a BIG surprise.Ms. Williams has written another book that will hold your interest but has a bit of confusing story line with all the back and forth. THE SUMMER WIVES is a story of the typical antics and lives of privileged families. We learn that most of the Winthrop Island families may have had money, but most of them are not happy.THE SUMMER WIVES has a great setting, good story line, and has characters with problems and secrets both past and present.

Maggie is still on probation because of the automobile accident and is not to associate with other felons, but a criminal incident occurs that makes Maggie think about being there for her friend instead of thinking of herself.

What do all of these have to do with Dr. Daniel Abend and his patient, Jessica Burke? Father Spurlock wants to know too.Jessica had been a patient of Daniel’s, committed suicide, and with careful planning somehow had mailed letters to Daniel after her death and then three years later. The puzzling thing was how that letter could have been mailed by Jessica when she had been dead for three years? Another thing that confused Daniel is that from these papers, he now knew that everything in the investigation was not revealed or seen by the police.Daniel continued to receive letters about the death. These papers also brought back memories of what happened long ago in Paris.When Daniel’s daughter, Clementine, disappears after she finds something about long-ago Paris, and then shows up at Father Spurlock’s telling him that her father mailed him something, Father Spurlock became more confused because he had received nothing.Then all of a sudden letters and clues begin showing up, and Father Spurlock was extremely bothered by them because his only connection to Jessica Burke was when he did the service for her funeral, and he had no idea why he would be involved in whatever was going on. He is also bothered because Daniel was the one directing all this correspondence to him, telling Father Spurlock the story, and putting the responsibility on him.

Josephine is an ornery woman who wants what she wants. Brooke desperately needs the money so she takes this job. Brooke wasn’t sure she would legally be able to take on this assignment because she and her mother surprisingly were named in the inheritance that included twenty acres of land and a pink mansion.  THE HIGH TIDE CLUB is set in Georgia and has eccentric, fun characters. We follow Brooke as she goes on her search for these women and/or family members. We also get the treat of going back to 1941 and seeing first hand all of the antics and mischief THE HIGH TIDE CLUB girls got into along with secrets kept and heartaches.Ms. Andrews smoothly goes from one time period to another linking both stories and keeping your interest with her marvelous, detailed writing style and story line.The fun of finding these friends and/or family members made this book delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the story line. The story line became better every time I turned the page and especially when secrets were revealed about Josephine’s life and those in it.  The characters were the highlight for me as well as the location.The island, its history, and its description made you want to be there with the characters.I enjoyed the lives of the characters in 1941 as well as the present-day family members. This was my first book by Mary Kay Andrews, and it was a very pleasing, entertaining read. If you enjoy family sagas, secrets, and mysteries, you will want to read THE HIGH TIDE CLUB. 5/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and NetGalley in return for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Mar 03, 2018","Mar 10, 2018","Mar 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36336690-the-high-tide-club

Her father worked as a Sandhog with men that built the underground train tunnels, and her mother worked in a garment factory. Both jobs ruined her parents' health and their lives. Vera grew up, and when she was seventeen, she thought meeting Angelo at their appointed time was going to be it. He was going to ask her to marry him, right? Unfortunately, that didn't happen. He introduced Vera to his fiancee.The good news, though, was that Pearl was a Suffragette, and she wanted Vera to help her. Being able to help Pearl would allow her to be close to Angelo. It was very difficult, though. Her heart ached every time Angelo smiled at her, but then Vera found out something that changed everything.THE WAY OF BEAUTY is a beautiful book about love, family, Suffragettes, the building of Penn Station in New York and has characters you will fall in love with.

Was anyone really worried about Eliza or just themselves?Eliza couldn't let everyone think she had purposely jumped in the pool and was more interested in clearing up the story the police are telling everyone about the pool incident than worrying about publicity for her book.Each chapter was titled Eliza or Dot, and the ending of the chapters about Eliza seemed to have someone questioning her memory. When Eliza asks a question about a situation since she can't remember, the other characters confirm that it is someone she knew or a situation that had happened.

She hasn’t told anyone the reason why she has returned to Winthrop’s Island with bruises that no one mentions, but since she stays for a relatively long time, the reason can be assumed even though it might be the wrong guess.Miranda's return isn’t a welcome event even after all of this time, though, because of her testimony at the trial of the lighthouse keeper’s son back in 1951 when she was eighteen and in love with the accused.Miranda hadn’t grown up with the elite and wealthy.

Is that what Sam really wanted?Probably not, but it made her mother and grandmother happy so Sam accepted it and made her first pie.THE RECIPE BOX was a gift no thirteen-year-old wanted, but it was a gift that kept on giving throughout Sam's life.We follow Sam as she leaves her loving Michigan home and goes to New York to attend culinary school. She was a hit in New York, but her boss was a fake. To her family’s delight Sam decided to come back home.Sam comes back to the love and warmth of her family and their bakery and orchards. Was she really ready for this? Did she make the right decision by coming back home?All of the characters were lovable, but Grandma Willo was my favorite as was the story from her youth and her life. Grandma was simply someone you would love to have as your grandmother because of her positive attitude and attention to making sure her family was happy in everything they chose.THE RECIPE BOX is a “sweet,” loving read that makes you want to go into the kitchen and be with grandma making the pies and other delicious desserts.Each chapter was titled with a recipe and inside each chapter we get to join in the family fun and view the ingredients and directions for the yummy food the family makes.THE RECIPE BOX is for anyone who loves to bake with family, who loves recipes, who loves family history, and who enjoys being in a beautiful setting.You most likely will shed a few tears not because of sadness, but because of the warmth and love that oozes from the characters and from things they say. THE RECIPE BOX is a book that is an uplifting, make-sure-you-make-the-right decisions in your life by following your instincts and embracing change.

Anna Fox was all of those, but mostly agoraphobic. Anna hadn’t left her home for ten months and even rented her basement to a young man who could do errands for her so she wouldn't have to leave the house.To pass the time, Anna would sleep, drink wine, take her meds that were not to be taken with alcohol, spy on the neighbors, wonder what they did, and pray that no one ever saw her looking at them through her camera lens. You do have to feel sorry for her because agoraphobia is a crippling disease. Anna saw things she shouldn’t see and heard things she shouldn’t hear, but she said it isn’t any of my business so she left it. One night, though, she saw something she shouldn’t have seen and reported it to the police anyway.THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW dragged on talking about Anna’s days and her chats with people on the computer about their shared disease.The dragging immediately ceased and the tension immediately mounted when Anna saw her neighbor get stabbed, when she called 911, when no one believed her, when she started to investigate, and when she became more paranoid when out-of-the-ordinary things started happening to her. THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW kept my interest, but it wasn’t edge-of-your-seat or gripping until the last half of the book. The ending had enough gripping action to make up for the slow start.

Something else must be behind all of this.We follow Flora as she investigates the contents of the apartment and the path of sales of the Renoir from the painter to each seller. She came to a standstill when she found out that a dealer who dealt with the Nazis was the last recorded owner of the Renoir. If that was where it ended, no one would want the painting.

A perfect marriage, three perfect kids, and a loving relationship until..…The Connor family looked perfect on the outside, but the Connors were not perfect at all. Ryan and Cass started out as the dream couple until Ryan showed his true colors of physical as well as psychological abuse. When Cass would confront him with things that happened, he would turn it around and make her feel as if she were the guilty party.Ryan went from the perfect loving husband and father to an abusive monster that Cass put up with and even denied.POISON had good writing that pulled you in, but it seemed to drag on and brought up one crazy situation after another.Domestic abuse was the main theme of POISON and very upsetting, but not as upsetting as some domestic thrillers. It definitely is frightening how often domestic abuse occurs and how many books have this as a theme.Cass made some very stupid decisions that put herself and her children in danger when she knew she should have just left. It was pretty tense at those moments.POISON was not a bad read, and the ending was unexpected, but it could have been shortened. It definitely is a psychological thriller and makes you wonder who you can truly trust.I would not recommend reading this book if you have been in a similar situation.If you like intense situations, you will enjoy POISON.

The method of death was pretty grizzly, and this wasn't the end of the terror. When McKenna is approached by a man who says his girlfriend is missing and needs McKenna’s help, he gets involved in this and other similar cases. This woman was the unlucky first victim hung upside down with roses in her mouth.Victim Number Two was also hung upside down with a tennis ball in his mouth along with a plastic tennis player wedged in the side of his mouth.Victim Number Three was hung upside down from an Amtrak train and had military medals in his mouth.We follow McKenna as he investigates in his unorthodox, but workable ways. It always is a treat to see how he looks for clues and works alone as well as with his Great Dane, Spot.As McKenna investigates, he finds corruption in a huge charity that Victim Number One was in charge of. The victim ran a multi-million dollar collection scam and kept all the money herself.TAHOE PAYBACK seemed a bit more gruesome than Mr. Todd's other books. The murder scenes were chilling.

The time was early 1800's and women were to be wed and not be in a trade, but the Sutherland girls didn't abide. Well Lucy didn't. Nellie sort of did, but she still had high hopes of her books being published, and they were published.We follow both girls from their childhood to becoming adults. The writing pulled you into the story line and kept your interest with the antics of Nellie and Lucy. Both women are delightful, strong, and enthusiastic about their chosen choices for what they decided they wanted to do.They both had ""it"" - charisma and charm.I enjoyed how excited Lucy was about her dressmaking business and how Nellie was happy or seemed happy with her life with her husband in the beginning.Lucy's gowns were named for passion further increasing the moving forward of women. Some thought the names and her products were scandalous.Nellie’s books were considered scandalous as well.One of the gowns was titled: DO YOU LOVE ME. Along with the gowns and the scandalous books her sister has been writing, the two women kept moving forward making a name for themselves. :)We follow their business dealings and their love life.THE IT GIRLS is set in the late 1800's when these two feisty women want to change from only being homemakers to being able to handle a career as well.If you enjoy cheering on women who most likely led the way for all women to make a name for themselves, then you won't want to miss reading THE IT GIRLS. The cover is dazzling just like the two main characters. My only complaint was that the story line dragged out a bit at times.If you enjoy determined women, fashion, and books, you will love THE IT GIRLS. 4/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest .

Nate was always involved with this students on a personal level and helped the ones who appeared to be in distress. Did this backfire on him?THE BLACKBIRD SEASON is mainly about the characters and their lives after the blackbirds fell and after Lucia disappeared. Did Lucia have anything to do with the blackbirds falling from the sky or did the blackbirds have anything to do with Lucia's disappearance? Her fellow students do call her a witch.THE BLACKBIRD SEASON is considered a thriller, but it didn't seem like a thriller to me. I saw it more as an investigation into people's lives and what some people have to go through on a daily basis or during a crisis.Addressing teenagers and their behavior was a major theme as well.The book has four main narrators, and we hear from each one and how each one is connected to each other and to the situation. The intrigue for me was in the behavior of the characters. The characters did grow on you toward the end as you became familiar with their lives instead of feeling annoyed with them.Nate seemed to be too helpful for his own good.Poor Alecia was so overwhelmed with her special needs child and had no clue about anything her husband, Nate, did.Bridget, still mourning the loss of her husband, seemed genuine and a bit shaky about the situation Nate was in since he was a good friend.Lucia was a troubled teenager with a bad home life and a teenager who needed attention and got attention in the wrong way.The flocks of blackbirds seemed to serve as the background for the ominous situations that occurred in the small, gossip-ridden, mill town of Mt. Oanoke, Pennsylvania. The book kept my interest because I wanted to see what happened to Lucia and if Nate would be found innocent. The suspense definitely was not edge-of-your-seat.If you enjoy digging into the lives of folks and their emotions along with a lot of questionable choices, THE BLACKBIRD SEASON should be a good read for you. Let me know what you think of this book. I started out with a rating of 3/5, but raised it to a 4/5 because the ending was suspenseful.This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and Net Galley in return for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Sep 14, 2017","Sep 18, 2017","Sep 14, 2017",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/32895536-the-blackbird-season

The fresh food offered at the diner drew in the crowds along with great s from food bloggers. The only problem was the neighbors and specifically the next door neighbor to the restaurant.The next door neighbor was grumpy and reluctant for the change, and the entire neighborhood was not happy about rebuilding that area.We follow the cousins through the ups and downs of owning the restaurant as well as the ups and downs of their once-close relationship.The descriptions were so beautifully detailed in THE WELCOME HOME DINER you could see the butter dripping down the sides of the pancakes and smell the delicious soups and sandwiches being served.The descriptions also allowed you to experience the characters' feelings for each other, their passion for food, and for Detroit. You will also experience the kindness and love for mankind.I enjoyed the banter between the characters and the uplifting feeling THE WELCOME HOME DINER gave off. The cover ITSELF is very welcoming.If you are a fan of food and love, THE WELCOME HOME DINER fits the bill.

What Liam returned to was his being chosen as the Trustee of his uncle's will and a task that was both dangerous for Liam as well as his family. There were a lot of stipulations set in the last will and testament for distribution of the estate as well as hard feelings because Liam had been out of touch and was now in charge.Liam now wished he hadn't answered that phone call not more than a week ago. If he had ignored it, he may not be in the legal predicament he was put in by his uncle nor the danger it was causing the entire family both in Ireland and the United States.Being Trustee carried a lot of responsibility as well as legalities family members didn't want to understand. The family also couldn't understand why Liam wouldn't break the rules and tell them the details of the last will and testament of Uncle Fergus.To further complicate things, the Taggert family was getting threats and notes indicating payback time. No one was sure who was murdering members of the Taggert family, but forty years of hatred, vengeance, and fighting still ran deep among the Northern Ireland residents.The Taggert family was an interesting lot, and the murders and family mystery were intriguing.THE TRUST is beautifully written and so well written that you smoothly move along and become captured in the story line and the characters.If you enjoy books set in Ireland, mysteries, murders, and family drama, you definitely do not want to miss reading THE TRUST.
