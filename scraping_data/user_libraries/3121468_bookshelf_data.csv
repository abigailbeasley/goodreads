The old man sits up, trance-like, and prophesizes that the newborn son will have five terrible days, indicating the exact date of each event. He also, gives more immediate information that soon proves true and adds credibility to his predictions. Meanwhile, an angry circus clown goes on a murderous rampage, in the same hospital, when his own wife dies in childbirth. Rudy is soon staring down the barrel of this killer’s gun.And that’s my introduction to the very first Dean Koontz book I ever read. The story is a page turner as we go from the resolution of this opening scene to one predicted day after the next in the life of the newborn Jimmy Tock and others who get pulled into the adventure, most notably and often, his wife, Laurie. The storytelling is riveting. Koontz has a knack for dragging out individual events to encompass as much as a dozen chapters without breaking the tension.If you like thrillers, this is the book for you. I’m more a fan of literary novels, though, and I didn’t like the general lack of character study and character growth. Also, the protagonists are always found in situations where they must react to events rather than incite them. The story lacks depth because of that. So I give this novel just three stars. Good mind candy, but don’t expect much more than that....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 20, 2017",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16435.Life_Expectancy

SouThe Bone Clocks is a collection of six interconnected novellas forming a larger story about a battle to the death between two groups of immortals. Sounds too far out there? Not hardly. These stories are beautifully written and grounded so deeply in the real world (and plausible future versions of it) that the paranormal element takes a back seat. By the time it does seize control of the novel, you, the avid reader, will be so engaged in the characters and plot, you won’t be able to turn the pages fast enough.Each novella is presented from the first-person narrative point of view, starting with Holly Sykes, a plucky sixteen-year-old English girl who runs away from home in 1984 over a tiff with her mother. From there, the novel hopscotches forward in time to the early 90s where we become intimately familiar with a young grifter; then to the early 2000s where we meet Holly’s eventual husband, a war correspondent; then another decade or two forward to a fading novelist and close friend of Holly’s; and then, some twenty years forward to Dr. Marinus, an immortal warrior who needs Holly’s unwitting assistance in a fierce battle. Each of these characters is fascinating in his own right, and also adds to our perception of Holly, who makes appearances in their stories. Finally we see the world through Holly’s eyes again in her old age, when climate change is causing the collapse of civilization.Climate change? Is this novel not about a paranormal war? Well that takes place, too, and the battle to the death is a seat-gripper for sure. But this novel has so much more!I give it five stars.

Henry, the young farmer who never left the tiny town of Little Wing. Two of his friends, Kip and Lee, who found fortune and fame but lost their bearings along the way—they return to Little Wing to reestablish roots and, in Lee’s case, find the love of his life. Ronny, the rodeo rider who came home a mentally-damaged man from an accident, but not nearly as damaged as his friends think. And Beth, Henry’s wife—the focal point of a love triangle. A few interesting side characters, Lucy the stripper, Felicia the disappointed wife, and Chloe the fickle movie star add spice to the brew.Ultimately, this is a story about a group of friends who try to control but ultimately become overwhelmed by the world they live in and all of its emotional complexity.

The fascinating premKaren Thompson Walker's debut initially caught my eye, because she supposedly received a seven-figure advance from her publisher. The fascinating premise later compelled me to buy the book, and Karen's outstanding voice kept me reading it.This is the story of a slow-motion catastrophe as seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl. The rotation of the earth has inexplicably begun to slow. Just a few minutes per day at first, then more. Gravity becomes affected. Birds start falling from the sky. Our clocks grow increasingly out-of-sync with the lengthening days and nights, leading to a social poloraziation between those who decide to doggedly live by the clock and those who want to rise at daybreak and sleep after nightfall.As the situation worsens with every passing day and the possible obliteration of all plant life looms ever nearer, young Julia lives the semblance of a normal teenage life -- suffering from shyness, dealing with the rejection by a close friend, falling for a boy who doesn't seem to notice her, and watching her parents' marriage disintegrate. This would be an excellent coming of age story even without the fascinating disaster ever present in the background.The author was a professional editor when she wrote this book, and it shows. The writing is strong and flows well. Some of the similes Karen uses are so original as to be breathtaking. Definitely worth the read and an easy book to get through.

Throughout the story, she deals with prejudice against her Mexican ancestry as well as against her gender. As anyone who watched the movie Changeling knows, women were little more than prisoners in a man’s world during that era. Even a movie star (and Addie briefly becomes one) had little freedom.The novel is a romantic suspense revolving around Addie’s run-in with a brutal family of bootlegging mobsters and her awkward love affair with a studio hand, Zeke Shafer. These storylines are compelling and give the book a good overall flow. I particularly like how the author drives a wedge between Addie and Zeke by using a highly discriminatory event appropriate to the era (which I won’t spoil by describing here). Illona Fridl clearly did her homework in putting this novel together, and it shows.I don’t read many romance novels, although I must admit guilt in writing one. Silver Screen Heroes follows the formula. Girl meets boy, girl loses boy, and so on. But the telling is quite interesting, particularly with the many period details pulling the reader into 1920’s Hollywood.I would have preferred a little more of the story from Zeke’s point of view. Illona writes the male point of view well. But Addie is clearly the protagonist, so maybe this preference is just me being a guy. One thing I’d like to see all romance writers do though is lose the inner dialogue. For those of you reading a romance novel for the first time, you’ll sometimes find brief italicized passages in which the character is basically talking to herself in her head. Often this boils down to I like him and I hope he likes me musing that doesn’t advance the plot and often diffuses the tension.

I didn’t intend to read Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl when I did. Two other books sat on the top of the pile, begging for a thorough read, the Amazon reader  thing, and so on. But one dark day, I needed a book with an edge to it, and having peeked at a sample page of Gone Girl already, I knew where to find that edge.Gone Girl is the story of Nick and Amy, a seemingly perfect couple to anyone looking in from the outside. But at the start of the book, on the couple’s fifth anniversary, when Nick comes home to a ransacked living room and a missing wife, the marriage has already deteriorated to a far from perfect state. Talk about your love hate relationship. Nick and Amy have one in spades at this point – mostly hate, but with love so excruciatingly painted around the edges you can’t imagine a better combination.Nick’s clumsy handling of himself during the police investigation and an accumulating, increasingly-damning pile of evidence soon point the finger at him as the murderer. We, the readers, don’t know whether he is one or not, even though we’ve been reading most passages from his first person point of view.So is he or isn’t he? I won’t spoil it. Let me instead touch on two compelling aspects of this novel. First, Gillian’s voice is one that many writers would kill for (bad pun, I know). Through the first half of the book she alternates her passages from Nick’s point of view (written in a Jess Walter voice, and you never think for one second that hmmm this is a woman trying to write from a man’s POV), and Amy’s point of view as found in diary entries written before the climactic murder or abduction or whatever actually happened (because I still refuse to tell). Amy’s voice is much different than Nick’s and I love that. She’s brilliant and has a fascinating perceptiveness about each of those many people who just can’t help but revolve around her irresistible gravitational force.The other can’t-put-it-down aspect of this novel is the quick pacing both before and after a sudden switch in plot halfway through. By that point, as a reader, you think you know the whole story and how it will all end, and you can’t imagine what the second half of the book will be for. Why isn’t this a novella? What’s coming next? What’s coming next is motive, and true circumstances, plans going awry, plans being reshaped, and a remarkable elevation of compromise to an art form.I loved this book.Joe ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2012","Jul 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8442457-gone-girl

All citizens of this dictatorship are forced to watch the prolonged spectacle – often lasting for weeks – on live TV. I expected the motivations behind this premise to be silly, but, in fact, the leadership of the country used a brutal logic in devising these games, and one I totally bought into.Contestants are chosen by lottery, and in this starving world, teenagers must acquire lottery tickets in order to obtain the meager rations of food needed to keep their families alive. (Let me just say here, that although this is perhaps the most depressing premise I’ve ever read, the story itself is uplifting, if anything. Don’t be put off by this.) When sixteen-year-old (or seventeen . . . it isn’t important) Katniss Everdeen’s twelve-year-old sister is chosen in the lottery, Katniss steps up to take her place. A boy her age, Peeta Mellark, is also chosen from Katniss’s district and a mild, star-crossed romance develops between those two (according to the rules, only one of the twenty-four contestants can survive). However, most of this story’s focus is on survival.About a third of this book covers the preparations and ceremony leading to the games, and the other two-thirds cover the tournament itself. This novel is a stay-up-till 2AM page turner from start to finish.VOICEThe novel is written in first person, present tense narrative. You won’t find a lot of dialogue, but the pace is swift and the story gripping. The author provides enough information to pull you into every scene. She paints a good picture, but doesn’t go overboard. I believe I might read another of her novels just for her voice alone.CHARACTERIZATIONCharacterization is outstanding. We come to learn everything about Katniss during this tournament and, through her eyes, the many other contestants in the tournament, the organizers, and her supporters. These are all unique, interesting characters.

So many changes to society and technology have occurred in the past three decades, reading this book was like traveling through a time capsule to a far earlier age.This novel is a throwback in several respects and, in fact, resembles 1970s fiction, thus matching the era of the story. The book is thick, around 600 pages, and doesn’t have a lot of white on its pages. The narration isn’t quite omniscient, but there is quite a lot of head hopping from one character’s point of view to another.

They were a major factor in the housing crash, but I don’t remember seeing the word condo anywhere in this book. An inside look at one of the mortgage originators would have been helpful. Also, with Lewis’s credentials, I can’t believe he couldn’t have gotten somebody at Moody’s or S&P to explain what was going on behind the scenes of the regulators.

This is a stIf you're looking for a book that shows how superficial we men are, The Friday Night Club by Jacob Nelson Lurie is a good place to start. This is a story about sex, promiscuity and unfaithfulness, and yes, the characters are shallow. But the book isn't. Light and witty though the presentation may seem, this novel is a deep, introspective look at what distinguishes most of us guys from most of you women.Ladies, we may give lip service to what you want to hear, but put any of us in a wild party or some out-of-town convention locale away from you and we'll forget who you are. When confronted by the least bit of temptation, we're simply not capable of hanging onto whatever emotional bond you think we've established. Davis Robertson, the hero of this story, gradually comes to terms with what a low-life, whoring, unreliable boyfriend/fiancé he's been for most of his adult life, and his character growth is commendable. But I'm sure the sequel will show some backslide. We are what we are.Some of the scenes in this novel could have used a bit more description to help me find my bearings and get grounded. But that's a small price to pay. The Friday Night Club is an excellent character study and satire of the battle between the sexes....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2010","Mar 28, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7444145-the-friday-night-club

Not many authors can make me care so much about their characters, and frankly, I didn’t expect it of Hornby. I hated when the story ended.

Duncan and Annie, a forty-something couple, are nearing the end of a long, loveless relationship. Duncan is the head of an obsessive internet fan club whose greatest passion is an endless loop of speculation about the lyrics and whereabouts of reclusive rock musician, Tucker Crowe. Annie is a museum curator in a nothing town who has settled for dull Duncan and his mind-numbing lifestyle. Tucker Crowe, the third part of this quirky triangle is a rocker who briefly found fame after a single successful album in the 1980’s. He retired shortly after its release. Now in his mid-fifties, Tucker is broke and dependent on affluent ex-girlfriends for room and board. The man has gone through a string of failed relationships and has four children he hardly knows. Only his precocious six-year-old son Jackson lives with him. The two share a close bond. A fight between Duncan and Annie over the quality of a new Tucker Crowe CD triggers a series of events in which each character finds a way out of his or her rut. Duncan leaves Annie for another woman. Annie stumbles into an email correspondence with Tucker Crowe and becomes infatuated with him. Tucker finds himself just as smitten and arranges to meet her in London. He soon escapes with her to her sleepy English town so that he might avoid a reunion with his estranged extended family. When the time comes for Tucker to go back and face the music, he and Annie are reluctant to write off their relationship as yet another dead end.This novel is not without its flaws. None of the protagonists are likeable, and I have difficulty understanding what Annie and Tucker see in each other. Young Jackson is too smart and well-spoken for a six year old. Finally, the story itself feels plodding at times. Still, it’s an easy read and has a much better ending than the straight-forward, happily-ever-after I was expecting.

A hardworking, successful and happily married businessman has his life turned upside down by a weird mental illness. His legs take on a life of their own, forcing him to walk compulsively until he collapses in an exhausted heap wherever they take him. This malady , waxes and wanes but often continues for weeks or even months at a time. Like the best horror writers, Ferris shadows the menace over the story. Even when things are going well, we know the bad times will return again.I loved the first half of this novel, but the story gradually drained and wore me out, as if I were the one doing the walking. I hated most of the decisions Tim makes, particularly his inability to look beyond his own distress and see the pain endured by his wife Jane and daughter Becca. Those two are admitable characters. I didn't feel that way about him. Perhaps I'm being unfair. Maybe severe mental illness would make anyone self-absorbed. But I wanted to see more effort by Tim to come to terms with the problem and find a way to keep his wife and daughter closer in his life. The man is rich and has options for coping that he never explores. I also disliked Ferris's tendency to introduce various storylines only to neglect and abandon them. In the end, the book left me feeling unsatisfied and depressed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 14, 2010","Feb 14, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6422678-the-unnamed

If you want to cut to the chase and avoid reading the rest of this , let me just say I’ll never again buy a book solely on the basis of favorable Amazon reader feedback.The central conflict in this story involves an ancient curse threatening to turn the young witch Lena into a dark and evil little soul on her sixteenth birthday. For any of you who believe hell is populated by all of the fun people, this is hardly a page-turning threat. In fact, the girl’s former best friend turned dark a year earlier, and she seems to be having the time of her life!

I feel deserving of a prize for finishing it. The authors sprinkle present-tense words throughout their past-tense narrative, constantly scraping their fingernails against the chalkboard of my mind. I tried to look past this flaw and enjoy the reading experience, but weak writing kept pulling me out of the story. The hero, Ethan, seldom shows a physical or emotional response to anything. Two major secondary characters are vaguely drawn and wildly inconsistent in their motives and behavior. The remaining characters are portrayed as stereotypical snobbish cheerleaders, dumb jocks or clueless adults. This book comes across as a first or early second draft badly in need of polishing. Where was the editor? I’ll admit the paranormal elements of this story are fascinating at times and the ending is strong. I gave the novel two stars instead of one for those reasons.

The characters in this story are cartoonish mayors, police investigators and spies, none of whom are believable. In addition, Walter pokes fun at the post-911 authorities while ignoring that every one of us had become swept up in rampant patriotism and paranoia at the time. Remember being inspired by some of Bush’s overly simplistic speeches? Remember using gloves to open your mail? I suppose by the time Walter wrote this novel, we had all calmed down and started realizing the country was run by idiotic zealots, so he aimed his satire in the direction we were all beginning to point rather than at the American population at large. Still, I thought his shots at Giuliani were unfair (the mayor is never mentioned by name or even referred to as mayor, but the identity of The Boss is obvious). Rudy is presented as a publicity hound, whore monger, buffoon and advocate of the goofy idea that all the paper strewn from the collapsing towers must be gathered and organized for things to be set right. Some or all of that may be true, but one must remember the strength we all drew from Giuliani’s calming, self-assured personage during the terrible days after the attacks. A second flaw I had with this novel is the recurring joke that becomes overused and tiresome. Brian Remy, the hero, suffers memory gaps and often asks questions such as why am I here? or what does this mean? These questions are always misinterpreted by those around him as words of wisdom or challenges to strive more steadfastly toward some goal. We’re not talking about just one or two instances, either. This happens dozens of times throughout the book, reminding me of an eight-year old who tells the same funny story over and over again until long after the humor has been wrung out of it. Okay, so why would I give such a flawed presentation three stars? The writing is brilliant, and I was completely drawn in by the POV of a man suffering from a split personality. We only see one of the two people sharing his brain – the man who is confused and trying to piece together the damage done by his other half. This POV allows Walter to tease the reader with mystery throughout the book. Also, although most characters in the story are one-dimensional parodies, I fell in love with the portrait of Remy’s girlfriend April who struggles to hold herself together after losing a husband and sister to the carnage. Finally, being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, the subplot about a woman possibly receiving advance warning of the attacks heightened my enjoyment of the novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 22, 2010","Jan 23, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22195.The_Zero

This is not a book to race through, nor is it a book that will grab you by the lapels and pull you headlong from start to finish. No. It’s a book to be savored and enjoyed for what it is -- a character study and compelling portrait of America through one man’s eyes.Lay of the Land is the third book in a trilogy about novelist turned sportswriter turned realtor Frank Bascomb. The first novel, The Sportswriter was an excellent read, and the second, Independence Day, won a Pulitzer Prize. This third novel, published in 2006 (which goes to show I’ve fallen behind in my reading -- hence the New Year’s resolution), is as good as the previous two. You can read it on its own and learn the back story as you go along. Still, Richard Ford writes so well, you really should start with The Sportswriter and move on from there. This novel covers a couple or three days in Frank Bascomb’s life, right around Thanksgiving Day, 2000. Don’t look for plot. Don’t stop and ask where the story is going. It will take you where it wants to go -- sometimes to the ordinary but more often to one surprise after another. You’ll learn all about Frank, his past and his relationships, almost all of which are at least borderline dysfunctional and sadly in need of repair. You’ll feel for Frank as a man whose life isn’t what he wanted it to be, even though he is now a wealthy and successful businessman. You’ll root for him throughout a tale full of humor, brilliant characterization and plenty of emotion.I hope you enjoy this novel as much as I did.Joe...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 10, 2010","Jan 08, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12372.The_Lay_of_the_Land
