Each of these characters shares many of the things they are in search of but they are unique in their approach on achieving that goal. They are looking to their past and worried about what their future may hold for them, searching for answers and clarity and wanting to know where exactly they fit into this great big world that is spinning. 	The most salient idea in McCann’s novel is the idea of connection. We see throughout his novel that his characters are interconnected by a singular theme. They are searching for where and what their place in the world and how it fits into the bigger picture. McCann’s use of metaphysics in the novel is so well placed and used throughout the novel, it helps us as readers to understand what the characters are going through and gives us a broader sense of what they are searching for. Judge Soderberg is one of these characters and he finally comes to the realization that he has been a part of a system that he has been trying to avoid, but now realizes there was no way to escape it. McCann says “ He refused to believe them for many months, but slowly it dawned on him that they were correct – he was caught, he was part of the system, and the word was appropriate, a part of the Parts” (256). Judge Soderberg is coming to grips that not only is he a part of the system but that we all have a part to play in society; we all have a role to play. It does not seem that way on a small scale, but we are a piece of the puzzle to be completed. 	And yet a more ambiguous suggestion in this novel is McCann’s communication regarding the tightrope walker and how he fits into the scheme of things. The novel starts off with him being the main focal point, and we get snippets of information about him throughout the novel, but the reader does not really understand what connection exactly he has with the rest of the characters Is he a metaphor for what the characters in the story are searching for? Is he an actual character that they encounter, and connect with him that way? My sense is that he is a metaphor of what the characters are searching for. He is different from the rest of the characters; he seems to know who he is and what he wants. The tightrope walker is whole while the other characters are broken. McCann illustrates, “Within seconds he was pureness moving and he could do anything he liked. He was inside and outside his body at the same time, indulging in what it meant to belong to the air, no future no past, and this gave him the offhand vaunt to his walk. He was carrying his life from one side to the other. On the lookout for the moment when he wasn’t even aware of his breath” (164). The tightrope walker has a peace within him especially when he is on the tightrope. He lives for the moment not thinking about the past and not worrying about what tomorrow brings; he is living for the moment right then and there. This is the place within all of us that is hard to find and once we find it, it is hard to keep hold of. 	And yet there may be ways to reconcile these two perspectives. In Let The Great World Spin I believe that the connection between the characters and the tightrope walker are intertwined. The tightrope walker is all of them. It is representative of the pureness and goodness they are all in search of. They are all desperate to find this pureness, inner peace and one within themselves. This connection in society shows them that their lives are just flashes or pieces of a puzzle and when it is all put together then and only then do they see what the final outcome is and how it all comes together in the end. Fiction influences and reflects culture. In the example of McCann’s novel I believe you have a balance of both. It takes from the culture we currently are living in and weaves the story in such a way that it reflects current society, thus it is influencing you along the way with possibilities and perspectives that you may not have thought of before. His idea of a novel is in tradition with time, and the novel’s job is to do accomplish that goal. The novel shows a more positivistic format in which, towards the end you see how the characters have progressed and have improved their lot in life. These are just a few of the characteristics the book holds to show you that it is a novel even though it may not seem that it conforms to the expected. It is done so well and in a way that we understand it because it is how we live our lives, not in one moment but of many moments put together. This is important if we as readers want to be able to relate and feel like we understand what McCann means when he says Let The Great World Spin.Works Cited:McCann, Colum. Let the Great World Spin.
