At first I picked up this book because it was billed as sci-fi, a tale of the colonization of the Earth by an alien race. Instead, I found myself immersed in a brutal, violent, extremely raw and unflinching tale of seemingly, the colonization of Australia by the British. Terra Nullius, Latin for ""nobody's land,"" was the premise upon which Britain claimed Australia, and survived as a rationale well into the 20th century when, finally, following a grueling 10 year trial, on 3 June 1992, the High Court of Australia ruled that terra nullius should not have been applied (Mabo and others v Queensland). Coleman masterfully weaves several story lines together that put on display the multi-faceted nature of the violence faced by the ""Natives"" at the hands of the ""Settlers"" - there is a re-education center, a boarding school run by sadistic nuns, there are plantations on which slaves labor in horrific conditions, there are those few who have not been captured but who live in continual terror that they will be found in addition to their struggles to survive in the arid, unforgiving landscape.The tone undergirding the novel is one of seething anger and condemnation; nothing is left to the imagination or interpretation of the reader - subtlety is entirely absent. In general, this feature would be a significant detractor for me, however, depicting colonization in its encompassing brutality may be the one scenario for which absolute, uncompromising forthrightness is not only tolerable, but best suited for the task. An example, re the nun at the school: ""Sister Bagra was dedicated to her duty, to bring faith to these people, if they could be called people; to bring religion, to bring education to these savages. An almost completely thankless task, a seemingly pointless, useless task."" The true brilliance and novelty of Terra Nullius occurs about half-way through. Now, what I am about to write is not quite a spoiler, because the book is teased this way and ed by many who give away this ""twist"" but, do not unhide the following if you like surprises and plan on reading this book(view spoiler)[About halfway through, Coleman reveals that in fact, the ""Natives"" are human beings, and the ""Settlers"" are reptilian creatures from another planet. By this point, the reader had become fully invested in feeling the overwhelming injustice but may, depending on their disposition and identity, not been fully sold on the caricature of the ""Settlers"" as fully evil beings who scorned all ""Natives"" as animals and such... but now, realizing ALL of us are the Natives, the reader, any reader, even entitled white never-experienced-discrimination readers (probably, hopefully) begin identifying as the ""native"" and understanding, in a profound way, the ""native"" point of view.  (hide spoiler)]This book is not pleasant, and I definitely did not ""enjoy it."" But I am so very grateful to Coleman for writing it, and I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone interested in learning more, in a truly immersive way, with the lived experience of colonization....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,not set,Jan 2019,"Feb 10, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35603581-terra-nullius

The magic-infused surrealist story aligned perfectly with my whimsical light-fantasy mood, but alas THE MISOGYNY oozing from every page induced dramatic eye rolls, exasperated annoyance, and occasional urges to yell loudly at men (ok not all men, but at least, at Dimitri). First, a bit about the story - which, had it been done without the abject objectification and sexualization of women, I would have immersed myself fully into, with complete joy and wonder. Four (Southern Italian) men, friends from childhood, have a 'pact' to meet on a specific day of the year in a specific place to catch up; this year, one of them, an esoteric brilliant mystic curious about all facets of the world, does not show up. Worried, his friends begin their search, which plunges them into an ethereal world bordering on the magical (filled with ominous olive groves and mysterious disappearances and fight/dance circles at campfires in deserted fields and fortune tellers and the like) - a world that is also, from a more practical lens, dangerous for its affiliation to the mafia (seems like everyone in town is either connected or pays their dues in order to be allowed to live in peace). I would have been captivated fully had it not become clear, just several pages in, that this was ""men's fiction,"" of the type that is grievously unaware of its own biases, that portrays women as props in a man's world. Most women who appear on the pages of ""The Book of Hidden Things"" are gorgeous and/or big breasted (some are even ""much more than beautiful""), they live for pleasuring men (and themselves via pleasuring men and did I mention they all love to be dominated), they don't think twice about cheating on their husbands with the husbands' good friends, in their beds at home while their children are in the next room, or quite literally at their own weddings (and don't apologize for it when their husbands find out), they love to strut around naked (""she didn't have qualms about being naked... She had started sunbathing topless at eighteen. We had all seen her boobs; this wasn't the first time for me, or the tenth""). Meanwhile the men choose their professions (ie photographer) because they want to see women naked, or they concoct elaborate plans in order to meet with women (in other worlds?) who offer unlimited sex, or they wax nostalgic about times before when they had kids, whom they find boring and a drag on the possibilities for excitement in their lives.(*note: I'm all for women choosing domination or sex or being naked or even sex outside marriage if they so choose but I'm NOT for men making these decisions for them. So this is a perfect example of a scenario in which the author's identity matters: had a woman written all the above, and had the book been written from the pov of women, I'd be game). I began gagging a few pages in, when ""the Beauties"" are introduced: ""Carolina was one of the Beauties.. I once managed to get one of the beauties naked for my camera, but that's as far as any of us went, until many years later when Art came back to town and started banging Carolina. I have not seen her in maybe ten years, which suits me fine. Her voice had always grated on me."" Oh, those pesky women with their grating voices... This from a man who also writes, about his job as a photographer: ""I'm aroused. That happens often while I work. My love for boobs, and bums, and legs, has never waned. Beauty is not something you get accustomed to, and no beauty in the universe is a match for a naked woman's. I say this with no shame or guilt""... And then, bang, I'm toppled by this unadulterated misunderstanding of women: ""nothing in this world is as erotic as the wetness of a woman; it means she likes you, that you are worthy of her."" UM, No? To be fair, there are two women who are not portrayed thusly, one fitting the old hag-like crazy fortune teller stereotype, and another, the sister of one of the four men, who is given a bit more power and autonomy outside of her sex. And, to an extent, the men do realize they are driven by their teenage sexual urges long past the time when they should learn to use their brains and not capitulate to the dictates of their dicks, and the one with kids does come to a realization that his daughters are not a net negative for his life. But I wasn't fully convinced of the sincerity of these transformations, nor of Dimitri's awareness of the extent of the immaturity of the worldview that permeates most of the book.If I had to guess about Dimitri's personality, I'd say he reminds me of the 'old world' European (especially Latin/Eastern European origin) men, who truly and honestly don't see the bias and sexism imbibing their perspective, ie they will NOT apologize that they understand beauty, for example, as centered around a woman's naked body. I grew up in Romania around pretty rampant and blatant misogyny that was not always seen as such from within that context, but became obviously clear once I immigrated to the US, and now that I am observing or reminiscing about these scenarios from a distance, and/or observing her compatriot men in this new environment. Anyways, THAT type of worldview is what this book brought back for me, and it was anything but magical, ruining the mystical-magical-realist aura of the storyline.Usually I'd give misogyny zero stars, but I'm capitulating to two not because I did actually love the premise and story (would still get zero for misogyny), but because Dimitri did attempt, albeit clumsily and unconvincingly, to admit that this worldview is flawed and that potentially more holistic and mature possibilities exist....more",Notes are private!,2,161,1,not set,Jan 2019,"Jan 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36569910-the-book-of-hidden-things

Perhaps if I had, I would have been prepared for what was to come, but alas as it was, what I read was not in the least what I expected (ie a magical fairytale or a cozy mystery). No, indeed: this was a gritty, dark, meticulously researched work of historical fiction that covered some incredibly challenging themes: child abduction, rape, devastating natural events (floods, blizzards), bribery and corruption at the highest levels of local politics, and more. Considering that I was expecting (and in the mood for) a light and magical tale, it speaks to the excellence of this novel that I was quickly pulled in and enthralled to the point I was staying up long past my bedtime to find out what happened next. Oliveira builds a rich atmosphere depicting late 19th century Albany in great detail, and she examines the sensitive themes she does with tastefulness that does not brush over their horrific nature. The story is essentially about two girls, orphaned in a blizzard, who are kidnapped and held against their will, while the 10 year old one is raped. Some chapters in and several weeks later, the girls are able to escape the basement where they are held because of another natural disaster - a flood caused by melting ice and snow. The remainder of the story is about the aftermath of their travails - about the trail, both legal and public opinion, about the difficulty of healing from such traumatic and horrific crimes, about the power of familial support. But what makes this an excellent historical work is that Winter Sisters is not just a story of individual overcoming of hardship, it is also an expertly woven political tale about city machinations and crony relationships within the governmental and business spheres, and about corruption at the highest levels. And finally, it is a searing depiction of and commentary on the historical oppression of women, not only by the literal letter of the law, but also by public opinion. In 1879, the age of consent in NY was ten years, and the vast majority of rape victims (who even made it to trial, as rape trials were incredibly rare) - were accused of ""wanting it"" and ""asking for it"" and as long as they were 10 years old or over, usually this defense worked. So many of these themes held on for at least a century, though to an extent we are finally now emerging out of this era of traditional debasement and devaluing of women.This novel is not for the faint of heart and also not for those who do not wish to read about such horrific acts as child rape (which is implied only, not described). But if you can bear that, I highly recommend this to anyone interested in historical fiction, especially that set in the United States around the period of industrialization and urbanization, and especially to those interested in women's history....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Jan 16, 2019","Jan 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35876392-winter-sisters

When I looked up the book and learned it was translated from the French, then I had to get it because, obviously, if you've ever seen a French film, you know about the French reputation for avant-garde subtlety and cryptic brilliance. How could these qualities apply to a supposed ""Gone Girl""-esque novel? (most s I read called this ""The French Gone Girl""). I was intrigued.In those respects, The Perfect Nanny did not disappoint. The book is not actually a ""thriller"" or a mystery in the traditional sense because we know ""what happened"" and ""who did it"" within the first few pages in the book: a seemingly perfect nanny stabbed the two children she was entrusted to caring for to death. The rest of the novel is essentially a character study of the nanny, told through scenes from her own story, the family's, and those of people tangentially related (another nanny from the park, a neighbor, and the like). To make a character study compelling takes major skill imo, at least for an audience like myself, who gets bored quickly reading biographies or stories with no real thrust. And Slimani accomplishes this brilliantly - The Perfect Nanny is addictive, the reader propelled along with irresistible urge from page to page. In all, I don't find that the parallel between this novel and ""Gone Girl"" makes sense at all. GG is basically a domestic mystery/thriller, in which there is a mystery that is solved and the story is explicit. The Perfect Nanny is a gripping character study that does not tie up loose ends neatly, that does not spoon-feed the reader its own conclusions and that leaves the question of ""how could this have happened"" wide open. The nanny is not portrayed as evil or even obviously unstable, and there is no direct line from her personality or circumstances to her horrific act. That said, if you prefer more of a storyline and more concrete answers, this novel may not be for you.I'm giving it 5 stars because (1) I'm biased towards all things French and (2) this book truly surprised me; I don't like books on domestic themes, and I tend not to be a fan of pure character studies, and yet I was breathless from beginning to end....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,Jan 2019,"Jan 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38330854-the-perfect-nanny

And he is also the pinnacle of what American xenophobic racist ""conservativism"" has been building up to in this country for decades- it's perfectly clear at this point, from the ways in which his own party has enabled him and refused to check him, that the conservative party has been co-opted by hateful bigots lacking any ideas, driven SOLELY by a fear of the other and by their terror of the fall of white supremacy. On a personal level - Trump is a petulant man-child, someone who is so insecure he thrives off inflicting pain on others and gets off on being praised (say, by the likes of Putin) - even when this praise is clearly faux buttering-up. This book is mostly about this - about the way Trump basically has no clue as to what he is doing, the way he rules from a place of ignorance and pettiness, off-the-cuff, without any ounce of curiosity about the workings of our government.I wasn't a huge fan of the book mostly because it's written in the style of an extended article (instead of holding together more of a thesis), and frankly, it stressed me out to once again get down in the trenches and follow along with this insanity from the beginning, on the ground-level (I've been consuming the news at an intoxicatingly voracious pace these past couple years and I basically knew all the info in the book, which was mostly presented ""as is"", without much analysis that rose above the daily details). Other than that, yeah, definitely agree with the basic premise: Trump is a lunatic who attracts followers and ""rules"" by inspiring fear, and an individual who is deeply very afraid himself....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Jan 2018,"Dec 31, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41012533-fear

The premise is that a flight attendant wakes up next to a one-night-stand who has been killed ((view spoiler)[but then the novel steers desperately off course as there are hints at the dead man being a spy (he's not), more hints of his illegal monetary dealings (he's a fund manager), and more entirely incongruent story lines  (hide spoiler)]).To top off the ridiculousness of this story is the fact that the main character is a weak mess of an alcoholic woman who lacks any direction or self control. IF this had been written by a woman, or IF the main character had actually grown in any way throughout her tribulations, I'd feel a bit differently perhaps; however, such a character, seemingly lacking any redeeming qualities, written by a man, struck all the misogynist chords on my radar. I mean. FFS: the woman is hunted by the FBI, woke up next to a dead man in Saudia Arabia, is now a tabloid sensation and yet she learns NOTHING and seems almost nonplussed by it all- after all, her life is such a mess, what's one more tabloid story..

Many years ago, I started the series on a tablet (where I do all my ‘pulp’/relaxation/mystery reading) but for the past four installments or so I’ve graduated these to actual paper-copies (i.e. I deemed them worthy of my bookshelf space). After the Shardlake series (which is by far the most superior historical mystery series ever written, but sadly which is now not current, rumors have it, due to the author’s illness), this is my next favorite, for its fidelity to historical nuance and accuracy and for the environment Starr so aptly immerses the reader in.If you like historical mysteries, I highly recommend starting this series at the beginning; while each book presents a stand-alone mystery, it’s helpful to get to know Hugh, a surgeon and bailiff of a 14th century English estate, as he develops from a young graduate recently returned from Paris through his marriage, to his settling down in a new home, to his children, to the manors’ happenings over time.I don’t find the mysteries themselves particularly puzzling or intriguing, but I simply LOVE the atmosphere and getting lost in this time period; Starr writes in a straightforward manner but he clearly attends to the language and customs of the times with great care: we learn what people then ate, wore, on what types of beds they slept, how they led their daily lives (i.e. all the tiny details are fascinating, like how, for example, nails weren’t this common item one could just buy at some kind of store, but how they were precious and people would take them out of the one broken chair they had to use later on for making the one table in their house). Starr also introduces terms from that period (there is a glossary) – a toft was the name for the land surrounding a home, a ‘remove’ was a meal course, a runcie was a type of horse tethered to carts, and so on.3.5 stars, rounded up....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,Oct 2017,"Oct 29, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34896501-deeds-of-darkness

Definitely, a residue of my being born Umm.. so a chapter or so into the book, I began googling Basma Abdel Aziz to determine if she was still alive. Definitely, a residue of my being born and spending my childhood in a totalitarian country, for certainly a book like this would never have been published in the formerly communist Eastern block. Or, if somehow it had escaped the censors, I have no doubt its writer wouldn’t have escaped the gulag. Except perhaps, if such a book would have caught the eye of an English translator and had made its way to the West; this English publication may indeed be in some way, an insurance policy. It’s much more impractical for people surviving totalitarian dictatorships to “disappear” if someone somewhere out in the world cares or is at least aware of their existence.So. There isn't much information about Basma Abdel Aziz, an Egyptian living in Egypt, on the English web and I don't read Arabic, but I figure there probably would have been some scandal that would have percolated through to English, had Abdel Aziz been jailed or killed. So presumably, she is alive somewhere, and if the book jacket is to be believed, this journalist and psychiatrist who treated torture victims (!!!) at Cairo’s Nadeem Center (closed in Feb. 2016) still resists and speaks out and has even “earned the nickname ‘The Rebel’ for her outspoken struggle.” Now, you know those games, that ask you to ponder, “If you had an hour to chat on a bench/over coffee with anyone alive or dead, who would you choose?” Usually I come up with the usual, you know, Barak Obama, the grandma who passed before I was born, but now..? Now this is a woman I’d be so incredibly honored and grateful to meet. The fire that must drive her to write such critiques from within such adversity is probably the one quality I admire most in people: undeterred, passionate – exuberant even – determination to resist and battle injustice, at any cost. Back to the book. The Queue is a brilliant allegory/surreal tableau of life in an authoritarian regime. The narrative is composed of a pastiche of impressions from individuals, named and unnamed, fully drawn out and also only brief apparitions of ‘characters’ (archetypes) that may inhabit such a landscape. There is a doctor, torn between his duty to save lives and directives from the government; there is the garrulous neighbor-informer; there is a woman who dares stand up for what she believes in until she loses everything, at which point she turns towards feverish compliance, even to the extent that she begins converting others to the governments’ cause (and many more). The novel, as the goodreads blurb describes it, is Kafka-esque, in that it displays the absurdity of things-as-they-are through a surreal rendition of phenomena; but a more accurate description I believe would be Bulgakovian and Nabokovian, the distinction being the ethos of the work as grounded in the particular absurdity of totalitarian control over individual lives (not the more generic, “life is absurd” of Kafka, but a very specific, “life under authoritarianism is absurd”). And, like all Bulgakovian and Nabokovian romps, Basma Abdel Aziz’s work is not only tragic, but laugh-out-loud-hilarious (though not in any “western” way that would probably resonate as humor in the US, for instance). It’s a different type of humor, a tongue-in-cheek sarcastic dead-pan that could also come off as very serious to some (I personally subscribe to this kind of humor and consider myself a person who is very much able to take a joke but 99% of my American friends don’t get this and still treat me like I’m the most serious person they know…). An example: Abdel Aziz describes a woman who is refused service by her baker, and he asks her, “Who did you pick?” at which point she tells him “I checked the box next to the candidate with the pyramid symbol….Told me I needed to apply for a certificate- I forget what it’s called- the one with a government stamp, ‘cause they’ll be sure to ask me for one when my complaint gets investigated…” On one hand, this could be read as a serious and tragic conversation but, for someone like me, used to communist Romanian humor, this read as the funniest exchange I’d encountered in a while – not to mention that the underhanded critiques implicit in every word are pure brilliance.Conclusion: The Queue may be difficult to digest as it does not follow a traditional novelistic format or style, but if you are interested in the psychology of authoritarian regimes, if you enjoy surrealist romps, if you would like to know more about the creative minds of Egypt, I highly and with enthusiasm recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,not set,Oct 2017,"Oct 17, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30186905-the-queue

Alternatively it could easily have also taken on a self-flaggelatory flavor in its attempt to make up for the imperialistic ethos of aid-work. But, The Atlas of Forgotten Places turned out instead to strike a seemingly impossible, delicate balance between these two extremes. Williams offers an emphatically attuned story that portrays both white aid workers and native Ugandans with a similarly even, perceptive voice that takes as a starting point the underlying similarities in the human experiences of suffering, especially as caused by separation from those one loves. And, I also appreciated the perspective that is not marred by the distinctly Western romantic optimism that seems to bleed out of so many novels/movies/shows coming out of Europe or the States at present (those works that, despite portraying some difficult situation, ultimately leave the reader with a sense of explicit 'hope'). Atlas is realist, first and foremost - whatever sense of restoration or redemption one may garner from imbibing the story is the reader's decision alone, not a feeling that is spoon-fed by Williams. I loved this novel for many reasons in addition to that detailed above, such as, it forged the impetus for me to learn more about a region I had little knowledge of previously. Williams offers some of the background, but not more than is needed to further the story; still, for the curious, she offers the opportunity for as many questions as a motivated reader has time for. I found this to be one of the rare books that I  wanted to read side by side with an open-tablet, perusing Wikipedia and other summaries on Ugandan history, the Lord Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, regional topography, and more. Additionally, Williams' voice is engaging and her storytelling skills are to be envied by any veteran novelist, thus Atlas is not only a good first history lesson on Uganda/LRA but is also a truly fabulous, thrilling, well-paced adventure. Alternating perspectives between a woman looking for her niece who has disappeared in the Ugandan forests and a Ugandan woman who has lost her lover in the same way, Williams weaves a compelling story that induces the reader to continue, breathless regardless of whether s/he has been fully captured by the historical context/setting.Hard to believe this is Williams' first novel.

Prior to that law enforcement was haphazard and duties performed partially by community watchmen, partially by King's constables. While Taylor writes well, and as fascinating as I may find the setting - whatever merits this story may have had are entirely eclipsed by the glaring historical inconsistencies and anachronisms. The fact that the entire premise is about policing and detecting in a time and place in which such a thing did not exist is only the beginning of it - characters ooze modern sensibilities, while the details of daily life described are more similar to the 21st century than to the 17th. For example, people are described as eating salad (???) and ordering cold beer at taverns (ice is an invention of the 1800s); they also seem versed in modern medical terminology, for example our ""detective"" contemplates how ""exercise [helps him] digest more quickly."" I started making a list of these ridiculous references (ugh - another favorite is characters' relationship to time, i.e. referring to what happened ""only 10 minutes later"" and such). But, why recount all, my time is better spent finding a better book to read.Overall: story may be good; writing may be good; but, given the lack of attention to historical accuracy, this novel reads as a story staged against an artificial set/background.

I was leaning towards 4 stars until I finished the novel and came upon the Author's Note, which explained the basis of The Unquiet Grave as the folktale of the Greenbrier Ghost of West Virginia, a tale born of the real life story of Zona Heaster Shue (pictured below).[image]Zona Heaster ShueZona Heaster Shue was a young, beautiful farmers' daughter who married an equally handsome blacksmith, a man we would easily recognize today as a classic abuser (though at the time, in the late 19th century, the language to describe this behavior was not widely used or understood). Soon after her wedding, Zona's body was found (in the house pictured below), allegedly dead from a fall. However, suspicious circumstances in her husband's behavior and past (such as an abused ex-wife and another prior wife dead from a ""fall"") lead Mary Jane Heaster, Zona's mother, to believe that Trout Shue had killed his wife. Unable to think of another way to bring Shue to justice, Mary Jane recounted a story to the county prosecutor, John Alfred Preston, about her daughter's ghost returning to tell the tale of her murder; intrigued, Preston ordered an exhumation of Zona's body and found that, indeed, her neck had been wrung.[image]The house where Zona was killedThe novel alternates timelines between the late 19th century, mostly spoken in the voice of Zona's mother, Mary Jane (pictured below), and the 1930s, which presents the story as remembered by a lawyer from Trout Shue's trial. The 19th century timeline vividly depicts West Virginia small-town/farm life in the era and brings the region fully to life while sketching realistic portraits of characters who might have populated the landscape of the times. This part, I loved (I've been on a rural-America binge for some months now, and McCrumb skilfully transports the reader to the region). The 1930s timeline also fascinated me, seeing as the location is a segregated asylum; one of Shue's lawyers, a black man, recounts his life and the trial to the resident psychiatrist.[image]Mary Jane Heaster, Zona's motherHad The Unquiet Grave been pure fiction, I may have had some quibbles with the structure of the story, such as, for example, the integration of the 1930s timeline (why a psychiatrist would talk for hours on end about a patient's former vocation, without touching on his psyche/psychic condition, is a hard sell). Still, since McCrumb quite evidently spent years in archives and historical sites, speaking with experts, and even making a quite obscure (and original) connection to a similar case in England, imo she deserves a full rating for the precision of her research, as well as for the ways in which she brings the region to life....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,"Sep 26, 2017","Sep 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32620367-the-unquiet-grave

I found Ways to Disappear a pure delight, but warning: this book is not for everyone (reading the s, they seem to fall into roughly two categories: those who loved, or at least appreciated, Novey's poeticism and satirical, magical realist vision; and those who felt this book was a waste of time.Ways to Disappear is kind of about something, in fact so much so that the pacing is akin to a 500m dash (I finished this book in one day). Yet, whatever it's about, is kind of besides the point, or barely incidental to the actual point, which is to highlight the strangeness of the mundane by awakening the reader out of her/his pre-conceived notions - about novels, stories, words, structure. Partially, Novey achieves this through acutely perceptive observations - such as by describing the felt reality of being in Rio, and concluding that ""to arrive in Rio was to remember that one had a body and brought it everywhere"". Partially, Novey disrupts our expectations through the quirky structure of Ways to Disappear- which switches point of view without warnings, interrupts with radio broadcasts, emails, and 'definitions' of key terms, as well as, later on, breaking out in straight-up poetry. And partially, Novey forces the reader to stop thinking and to experience the story, by forcing the reader to perhaps think too much at first (but, this latter pursuit immediately becomes futile, because this book is not about cognitively 'getting' something, it's about trusting and fostering intuition). I do believe this is where the paths diverge between those who love this book (and who allow themselves to get lost in it) and those who simply detest it (because one cannot 'grasp' it by intellectually analyzing it). Basically, Ways to Disappear is poetry - in novelistic form- but still, poetry.I especially loved this work because it echoed some of my favorite Latin American poets like Robert Bolano - the voice is casually intellectual, incisive in a felt/embodied way, and brilliantly dead-pan hilarious (""She'd call Miles... they'd lived together this long, knew which mug the other preferred for coffee and which for tea... She could be grateful for Miles and for his steadiness. They would delight in exercise and recycling."" --> *insert laughing crying emoji* - this is for example how Novey describes the inanity of a relationship grounded in familiarity).Highly recommend this, or not at all, depending on how you felt reading this ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Sep 16, 2017","Sep 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25746685-ways-to-disappear

It's hard to believe this is Weiss' first novel - the voices of her many characters are so well developed, and the novel engenders so much empathy for their plight and so much understanding of their perspective. Chapters alternate points of view and are all written in the first person - from Sadie Blue, a young uneducated woman abused by her new husband to Eli Perkins, the village preacher dedicated to helping his flock, to Birdie Rocas, a mountain medicine woman, and so many others, Weiss convincingly depicts the struggles and hopes of those forgotten by the teeming bustle of the modern city/suburbian landscape. There's been much chatter recently about Hillbilly Elegy, but in comparison, that account is lifeless and rationalized - I highly recommend this work as a window into identifying with rural (white) America and its plight.A relevant aside, I'm also surprised If the Creek Don't Rise came out directly in paperback (the fate of books that publishers may not deem worthy of an initial hard-cover run).

I know many of us like to read widely and don't always appreciate savoring a book for months, but my recommendation would be, if you're not ready to spend weeks on end reading nothing but this book, to set aside some time each week while also continuing your regular reading. I took an extended vacation this summer (to Israel, where this book is partially set) - and was happy to bask in these glorious pages without other distractions, but I rarely have that leisure or patience at hand on my regular days. Whatever you do, my recommendation is to please be patient with this book. The pleasures it offers forth are profound, but not if you approach it as a ""book to finish"". This novel is an experience that is best imbibed to the core.A very quick synopsis: the story alternates timelines between modern day England (and the story of academic historian Helen), Helen's coming-of-age in Israel some decades ago, and the 1660s Portugal/England Jewish community.But really, this is a story about BOOKS, reading, knowledge, and the passion that each of us, as readers, holds for these intangible but empowering and delectable pleasures. (This is why it's so important to let it seep through your entire being while reading, and not to rush). Helen is a historian who has come across a newly discovered genizah, a trove of Hebrew/Jewish writings from a 1660s Jewish-English household, and The Weight of Ink details her journey into the life of the scribe who has set down these words - a woman who may have had previously undisclosed links to Spinoza, a Jew excommunicated from his community for his 'heretical' beliefs. Helen's world, the scribe's world, Spinoza's world - all revolve around books/reading/documents. And that's just the beginning - again, I have no words really to adequately describe the poetic nature of Kadish's words, but her language is divinely inspired and does full justice to her themes.There may be other books that I consider just as brilliant but right now they've all been eclipsed from memory - The Weight of Ink is not just by far my most favorite book of the year, it may be the favorite for a lifetime. No other has ever paid such reverent homage to the art of books, knowledge, and reading....more",Notes are private!,0,270,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2017","Sep 16, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971715-the-weight-of-ink

Turns out that's pretty far off in terms of a description: a psychological 'whodunnit' this isn't, and neither is it much of a paced thriller - these expectations, I imagine, are what brings the average rating of this book down so low (for GR, a 3.37 ain't good). And yet, the top s all give this between 4-5 stars, which does not surprise considering this book is actually quite brilliant and so unique in its genre.On the surface, this is a mystery of sorts: a couple, on a night out on the river in Houston, hear gun shots, screams, and moments later fish a seemingly wounded wealthy white woman out of the water. The young(ish) man, Jay, an attorney and former activist in the Civil Rights movement (in the late 1960s and 1970s), is pulled, unwillingly at first, into investigating this woman's story and the events of this fateful night. But really, the book isn't so much about the investigation as it is an exploration of the tumultuous landscape of Houston in the 1970s-80s: turns out, Jay has served time (in short, for his activism and for being suspected of 'inciting riots' in the days when the FBI was framing young black men and infiltrating black resistance groups). And, because of this history, Jay is reluctant and afraid of being involved with this wealthy white woman's case - he knows he may well be fingered for the crime that occurred that night.The white woman's case is one that reaches into the upper echelons of power in Houston - into the mayor's office (another white woman, one with whom Jay has personal history), into the boardrooms of the oil tycoons and developers in the city, into the parlor rooms of the most established Houston families. Meanwhile, on the sidelines, Jay continues to work his other cases in order to eek out a meager living out of his one-room attorney's office: that of a black sex worker who has been hurt in an encounter with a powerful white man; that of a dock-workers' strike and that of the beating of a young black man by white union workers. From union politics to the role of the church in the black community of Houston to oil monopolies and more, Black Water Rising paints a complex, vibrant, historically rich portrait of the era.If you're reading this expecting a 'thriller' you probably will be disappointed; if, however, you take it as what it is, a historical study of a city in transition, an exploration of the legacies of segregation and racism, and a window into the turmoil of local politics and power, you will be blown away....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,not set,Aug 2017,"Sep 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6214113-black-water-rising

""I'm scared.""""Good,"" she said. ""Now you have something you can kill.""Fear. The ultimate driver of hate, bigotry, conflict, ultimately: of war. The emotion that pervades so much of our current geopolitical situation: the fear of our neighbor, of their religion, of their skin, of their seemingly foreign customs and traditions. Fear: perhaps the only emotion hardwired into the human condition, the underlying evolutionary mechanism that keeps us alive and perpetuates our species, that bids us to fight or flee.American War is a powerful, devastating portrait of the world, some decades from now. And what makes it so potent and terrifying, is how plausible, how absolutely realistic El Akkad's conclusions about where we are heading sound. In this world, the United States is in turmoil: parts of the South have seceded after refusing a federal mandate to stop using fossil fuels; the coasts have been ravished by storms, while migration has wrecked havoc on inland cities; other parts of the South have been annexed by Mexico, while drought, wildfires, and disease have devastated the rest.El Akkad builds this world carefully and attentively, but the world itself is not so much what the novel is about. Rather, American War attempts to answer the question, ""How is someone radicalized into hate and into committing horrific terrorist acts in the name of this hate?"" El Akkad's answer, the story of Sarat Chestnut, is shiver-inducing in its simplicity, and for the reason that it does not rely on ideology (including religion) to explain how someone could be transformed into an instrument of war. For Sarat is no ideologue; she does not fight for the South, for ideas - she exacts revenge on those who have caused her to fear. What makes this novel especially terrifying is how the reader walks hand in hand with Sarat at every step of the way, from her relatively happy childhood: by the end of her story, the reader fully empathizes with her, and, dare I say it - may even understand Sarat's actions on a sub-cognitive, emotive plane. Not surprisingly, some have found American War too controversial for comment; also not surprisingly, it's been highly praised by critics, for indeed it is a true genius to induce such feelings in a reader.This novel is a challenging read: it describes horrific scenes of torture, it dives deep into devastating loss, it offers no platitudes about love ""winning"" over hate in the end. It is certainly not for everyone. But, if this summary sounds intriguing to you in any way, if you're the kind of person who likes to face your/the world's demons head on and shriek at them in their face, I highly recommend American War....more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2017","Sep 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32283423-american-war

The Willow Kind was published in Estonian in 2012 (as Mesilased) and translated into English in 2017.On the surface, this is a piece of historical fiction that follows a young man on his way to university in Dorpat (modern day Tartu); in terms of plotting, it's about 1/3 journey, 1/3 settling in in Dorpat, and 1/3 happenings around the University. Not terribly exciting, although the historical details are fascinating and so minutely detailed and accurate- if you, like me, love historical fiction for its depictions of bygone eras. At first I was a bit suspicious of some of the details - the author is an intellectual historian and some of the minutia about daily life seemed off, but after some research into these suspicions, I concluded that not only is Friedenthal spot on, but he is precise to a degree far beyond that of most writers. For example, our protagonist refers to 'travel guides' throughout his journey - which at first I found preposterous; a bit later on he refers to 'apodemic guides' and, in looking up this word (which is not in the dictionary), I find it in academic literature describing, yes, 'travel guides of the 17th century'... Now, what makes this book one of a kind: this is a historical piece, of which there are many, but I've never read anything that attempts to reconstruct a 17th century consciousness/psyche to such a precise degree. Friedenthal is an intellectual historian, well versed in the theories popular during this age (including those dating back to ancient Greece and the like), and he takes us inside the mind of our protagonist as he considers his 'melancholy' (what today we may call manic-depression, or depression with a mix of extreme anxiety). So, The Willow Kind is essentially a study of mental illness before we had concepts to describe mental illness, from inside the mind of someone who is attempting to understand it using concepts popular at the time (balance of humors; form, substances and spirits; stillness/rest and bleeding as cures, etc).

I’ve been reading some, and recently the pace has increased to pre-TOnce an avid user of GR, it’s now been a while – something creeping up on a year. I’ve been reading some, and recently the pace has increased to pre-The-Traumatic-Event levels; in the weeks to come I’ll be hoping to catch up on both writing my own s and catching up with what my dear friends here have been up to and reading.Of all I’ve read recently, I decided to make this one my first , so as to explain my prolonged absence to those who care to read about it (which I can’t do in the few characters the updates are limited to)… So, my world was shattered last November. I’d always been involved in politics – acting on a local level but also talking about it on the ‘forums’ (disqus/The Hill/Politico/WP/NYT and the like). But I’d managed, to that point, to keep my academic/reading worlds somewhat cloistered off from my activism and politics (which obviously seeped into my s and informed my worldview but weren’t always frothing on the surface). Well, then the Traumatic-Event of November happened, and I went into a coma of sorts – specifically, of a personal sort – I stopped being a person, more or less, with interests outside of the creeping fascism in the United States. My life became something like 40% survival – going in to work and tuning in enough not to lose my livelihood, with the rest of the time spent organizing marches, marching, attending meetings with every activist group I could find, organizing, and reading news while fighting in the dungeons of online political forums.Sadly and predictably, I settled into a life post-January 2017, in which each new outrage seemed to make the ones that came before slightly less traumatic (and thusly, humans adjust to extremist regimes). Into a life in which it now doesn’t even seem terribly odd that the President of the United States of America is defending white supremacists (see: Charlottesville) and equating their tactics to some on the left who would fight fascism.And that – the normalization of the previously abnormal in political life- was exactly the topic of Sam Harris’ interview with Timothy Snyder on his podcast when I came across it this past summer. (it may be found here: https://www.samharris.org/podcast/ite...). Touched, and trembling to my core, I picked up this book – without realizing at first it was a short, almost “pocket-size” summary of “twenty lessons” from 20th century dictators (ok ok I should have read the title and maybe the book specs before buying).The book itself is not detailed or terribly profound, and does not do justice, imo, to Snyder’s intellectual depth, but it’s a useful primer for those interested in a series of very brief political ‘devotionals’ (or, pieces of ‘advice’). It’s a bit like those books, “21 days to a happier you” but more along the lines of “3 weeks to a more aware self in the age of rising tyranny.” The advice is sensical but not earth-shattering – “be weary of paramilitaries, defend institutions, do not obey in advance”. The podcast for me was much more enlightening, while the book was not worth the $7.99 cover price. I’d recommend it basically as a stocking stuffer or party favor for your favorite activist, or as a daily 20 day meditation perhaps.Also – if you’d like to chat politics with me, I’ve been doing that mostly through Facebook (have moved off Disqus and the other forums that allow for anonymity since I found the commentary there to be much less civil and vicious). Please PM me on here with your facebook ID/link and I will send you a friend request :-) . I used to keep FB to real life friends only but recently have made hundreds of political friends and would love nothing more than making some political/book friends too! And if you feel you must delete me after reading this , then so be it. As Timothy Snyder says, “Stand out. Someone has to.” I won’t be shutting up anymore about what’s been happening in my country – not on here or anywhere....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,not set,"Sep 10, 2017","Sep 10, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33917107-on-tyranny

I’ve found it quite difficult to come across such books –first, there’s just not that many of them written, and those that are, usually exist as hidden gems that rarely surface on my media feeds. It is in this spirit that I one day came across and acquired Pandora in the Congo. The cover [retro mock-(post)-colonial?], the description [a story written by a ghostwriter of a ghostwriter of a ghostwriter], even the original language [Catalan]—suggested a humorous political critique, a dazzling adventure story, quirky worlds/characters and strange twists of plot. To my absolute delight, Sánchez Piñol trippy novel proved as off-beat and as Daliesque as I had been craving. Pandora in the Congo is:* an absurdist critique of race and colonialism by way of a parody of ‘traditional’ narratives (such as The Heart of Darkness)* an homage to classic science fiction and a playful but also subtly mocking imitation of Wells and Verne* an adventure story, a love story, a mystery, a sci-fi/fantasy tale, or perhaps just a pretense at being a bit of each of these* a uniquely inventive meta-narrative that in the form of a story that questions itself as a story. The book is (a supposedly true) account of an accused murderer told by a ghostwriter of a ghostwriter of a ghostwriter hired by the lawyer of the accused. And that is just the beginning of a mind-bending ride through a fabulously confabulated tale that blurs boundaries between “reality” and other realms.Pandora is sadly probably not for everyone, which is why, I imagine, it remains relatively under-appreciated. Still, I highly recommend it to anyone in the mood for a strange, unsettling, thought-provoking, smart and humorous post-colonial sci-fish epic that mocks colonial epics and the constructs to which they adhere. Because, perhaps you will be in that mood someday....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,Jan 2016,Jan 2016,"Dec 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2101955.Pandora_in_the_Congo

Still, as much as Bulgakov and Petrushevskaya capture my mood and existential stance towards the world, there's a ... spirit, born of my native tongue (Romanian) that no Slavic language can touch completely. There is just something so sonorous, so poetic, so voluble and ecstatic about Romance languages that, even in the midst of melancholy, renders a hopeful and fervently passionate tone. Which is I think why I've always been pulled to authors who write in Spanish (mostly, Latin American but also, in this case, a Spaniard)-even in translation, the musical quality of their work is preserved somewhat (although obviously not completely, which is why I really need to up my Spanish game already).[Before preluding with all that, I was afraid perhaps my interpretation was purely personal; I am no linguist by far. An admittedly superficial search led me to this article on the Encyclopedia Britannica, ""In comparison with Germanic languages, for instance, [Romance languages] seem musical and mellifluous—probably because of the relatively greater importance of vowels... On the whole, the vowels are clear and bell-like and articulation energetic and precise,... [this, along with intonation patterns] seem to some to denote excitability and emotional expressiveness."" That discussion just makes so much sense with my experience (take my name as a case in point about how much Romanians love vowels), and illuminated for me much of the ... romanticism of Spanish-language work that I identify with on a primal level. For, as American poet Wendell Holmes writes, ""Language is the blood of the soul into which thoughts run and out of which they grow""]Ok, so the point? (this is the first  I am writing after the last day of school; behold my manic excitability manifesting as loosely-related tangents. Oh, how I love GR that way :))The point: The Sky Over Lima is an evocatively poetic, lyrical retelling of the stranger-than-fiction true story of the two-year correspondence between Spanish Nobel laureate Juan Ramón Jímenez and two young poets (José Gálvez and Carlos Rodríguez) writing as an imaginary woman, Georgina Hübner. Even if there's not much of a story, the book is worth reading simply as an immersion in a lulling, comforting, beautiful world of words.The plot: Eager to read Jímenez’s work, which was unavailable in Lima in the early twentieth century, José and Carlos appeal to Jímenez directly; imagining they will receive a more favorable response by signing their letters as a woman, they write Georgina into being.Less a novel, this work is rather a gentle, beautifully crafted, humorous and incisively profound essay on love, identity and writing. There is not much of a plot—chapters meander leisurely through the young poets’ lives, and we learn a bit about their background here, a bit about their struggle to make Georgina come to life there, while being immersed in lovely elucidations about the craft or writing. In fact, The Sky Over Lima is literally a fictionalized account of the common trope, “letters to a young poet”—I would categorize it as a book proffering writing advice, in a “novel” format.The following quote is perhaps one of my favorites, capturing as it does Gómez Bárcena's incisive analytical prowess that paints such vivid contours around his poetry: on their efforts to create Georgina (and on, interestingly, Germanic languages, such as English):""To improve their efforts, they consult a book entitled Advice for a Young Novelist, a seven-hundred-page tome that is rather short on advice and long on commandments and whose target audience seems to be not a young writer but an elderly scholar. The author, one Johannes Schneider, repeatedly employs the words dissection, exhumation, analysis, and autopsy. One could not ask for greater honesty, as indeed the book undertakes with Prussian rigor the task of dismembering World Literature, until everything extraordinary and beautiful in that genre is writhing under its scalpel.""In addition to the theme of writing, The Sky Over Lima explores questions of love and identity; for, in writing and baring their soul to an anonymous ‘other’ through heartfelt letters, all three poet protagonists in this novel are essentially finding themselves, falling in love with their own realizations and words. In fact, ""in real life"", Ramón Jímenez acknowledged the deception that had been perpetrated on him, but still declared himself grateful for what it taught him about himself. For, after all,""Love is a discourse, my friend, it’s a serial novel, a narrative, and if it’s not written in your head or on paper or wherever, it doesn’t exist, it remains only half done; it does not become a sensation that saw itself as an emotion.""Overall, I highly recommend this debut novel by award-winning Spanish author Juan Gómez Bárcena (who has also published an as-of-yet-untranslated-into-English collection of short stories), especially if you are a patient reader who enjoys beautiful writing and a resonant atmosphere. For me, this work felt a bit too leisurely, too lacking of a concrete drive to sustain my undivided attention. Still, I would absolutely read Juan Gómez Bárcena again and look forward to more of his works.*I received a copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

BUT not I love being virtually scared - I'm a huge fan of horror movies, (carnival/Halloween) haunted houses, caves/dark creepy places, and the like. BUT not at all a fan of walking rickety suspension bridges or major turbulence on a flight. So basically, I relish and am excited by fear when I also feel somewhat in control, when I can ""simulate"" being afraid in an environment that otherwise feels safe (the psychology of this seems pretty obvious though I'm not sure that seeking these sorts of experiences is preparing me for anything; still, of all the ways I could be exhibiting my control-freakishness, enjoying scary books is one of the least stressful to my system...)Anyways, so: my favorite kind of scary is completely empty and action-less, a fear of the... void/ nothingness (death?) Annihilation powerfully induces such a state: nothing really happens, there's not much dialogue or communication (there are barely a handful of anonymous characters), we don't even find out much about the surreal world that is the setting of the novel. Still, I found it to be one of the most chilling books I've ever read-VanderMeer so skilfully builds psychological suspense by steadily revealing the scope of a horrifying mystery (but not its core). Also- thank you to my dear friend Emily for pointing this out - I didn't see this before her comment (see below) but this is SO TRUE: the mystery herein may be especially fascinating for those who are drawn to science, for it's structured like any good scientific investigation (and its drive arises out of the same flavor of curiosity). I was listening to this TED podcast  the other day, in which oceanographer Robert Ballard discussed humanity's propensity for knowing 'what is behind that door', for quests driven by curiosity (this quality may have killed the cat but it certainly is one of our most fruitful and fascinating features). Annihilation is exactly this: a journey into an infinite maze of doors, propelled by the pure desire to know; and, a mystery focused on place and discovery (not on characters or plot).The story, loosely, is this: there is a zone, Area X, which is completely devoid of human life, and which has been reclaimed by nature. Expeditions have been sent there over the years, but all with tragic consequences for those involved (they failed to return, returned as shells of their prior selves and/or committed suicide, they killed each other on the expedition, etc). Annihilation follows a biologist, one of a four person team to journey to Area X and to attempt to discover its secrets. I'll avoid spoilers but let's say for now, there are no zombies or monster chases - yet still the book is utter madness, like a parasite rotting your brain - IF you fall under its spell.Big IF there, because I can also see why this book may be considered 'boring' by some readers or nonsensical. If you like mysteries to eventually be elucidated, or if you prefer books in which events are clearly demarcated and in which a plot moves steadily forward, Annihilation is probably not for you. Also, I've read a bunch of s downgrading ratings based on 'poor' characterizations; true, in a way - this book does keep characters at arm's length, and the reader is never quite called to empathize with them. For me, this anonymity and detachment deepened the psychotic and unsettling mood, but it's also fair to say that if this description doesn't sound appealing to you, you may not enjoy this book.Overall: 3.5, rounded up. Ultimately, Annihilation falters towards the end; yes, it's part of a trilogy, but I still expected some resolution/understanding, or at least the promise of a satisfying conclusion in Book 3. However, I fear that VanderMeer became a bit too infatuated with his own mythology and got carried away - he builds so much in so many directions that I just don't see how he'll be able to resolve it all in a coherent, holistic way. I hope I'm wrong, but s of #3 don't leave me too optimistic. Still, I definitely liked this enough to buy #2, so we'll see how that goes and reevaluate. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jun 16, 2016","Jun 20, 2016","Jun 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17934530-annihilation

On May 12, a video Marzano had recorded before his death was posted to youtube. In it, he claimed that President de Colom was responsible for the death of two of his clients, political opponents of de Colom as well as for Marzano’s own murder, and went on to list numerous allegations of corruption, money laundering, and other illegal activities allegedly engaged in by the administration. By May 13, the FBI had arrived on the scene to assist in the investigation as Guatemala was swept by protests, political upheavals, and arrests (including of a blogger who urged depositors to withdraw all assets from Banrural). Six months later, on January 10, 2010, the UN International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala concluded that Marzano had commissioned his own death and been involved in an elaborate plot to bring down the Guatemalan president.That is the true story. The Mastermind is a reimagined account of this stranger-than-fiction tale, spun as a love-story and vivid account of the corruption permeating Guatemalan politics.Attorney Guillermo Rosensweig leads the picture-perfect life: wife, two kids, lucrative profession, nice home. He also sleeps around—a lot. And, of course, one day he falls madly in love (well, more like lust) with a client’s daughter. This client, incidentally, has been part of a commission set up to investigate the Guatemalan president for money laundering and other criminal activities. The story’s political and historical outlines roughly follow the ‘true story’ for much of the novel (with twists, which I will not spoil).The Mastermind was for me an incredibly fascinating read, especially as my first novel by a Guatemalan author. I visited Guatemala in 2013 and was so struck by its creative, vibrant, verdant, colorful vibe (to this day, I have not visited a place as welcoming as Guatemala, and I do mean: the place itself, not just the people, who were also extremely friendly).[image]Guatemala 2013As described by Unger, Guatemala is the ‘cultural’ center of Central America, but there are so many layers I, in my touristy, American naivete, was not aware of. I have read enough to know that we (the US) have wrecked significant chaos in Latin America by propping up puppet dictators amongst other imperial acts, especially during the Cold War (in our ever-feverish quest to squelch communist sympathies), and also enough to know I don’t really know enough to speak of this in an educated way, or even, apparently, to understand the undercurrents of the repercussions as they manifest today (during my visit).While much of the story revolves around the tortured love-making of Rosensweig and his client’s daughter, what struck me most about The Mastermind was the portrayal of modern Guatemala, of a life lived in a place beset with corruption at all levels of political, economic, and social structures. Unger renders daily experience as an acceptance of inevitable incompetence, murder, exploitation, and fraud, as resignation. “The beauty of living in a country as corrupt as Guatemala,” he writes, “is that evidence can vanish as easily as smoke. Scarcity creates a society in which the truth of any situation can be variable or even paradoxical, and very few people will care. It happens all the time…” Still, there is an undercurrent of hope displayed by all characters, even Rosensweig himself, who, after all, by creating the video, declares his willingness to sacrifice himself in order to expose corruption and ‘save’ his country (true, his life was in shambles by this point and he is an at times detestable, egoistical character, but still, he is unquestionably passionate about the state of Guatemalan politics/life). The book is not perfect—there is a good amount of ‘telling’, especially polemical asides about the political situation in Guatemala. I did not actually mind this at all (as I would if this book was set in the US and written by an American author), because this is the first I’ve read a Guatemalan voice on the matter. It’s also definitely rated “X” for graphic sex (not my thing in literature; usually I see it as a cop-out, but in this instance, it worked well with the tone/mood and characterizations).Probably the most exciting effect of reading this is that I am now absolutely motivated to read more about Guatemalan history (I have had The Blood of Guatemala: A History of Race and Nation by Greg Grandin on my shelf since my trip to Guatemala, definitely time to move it to the top of the list—and also, to find history books written by Guatemalans); I also very much look forward to reading more Guatemalan fiction.

THE most personally touching and relevant book I've EVER read. A book that penetrates the soul of my being and explains me to myself. An Autobiographical Reviewthis book is my autobiography, and it speaks my heart better than I ever have articulated it myself; many details below are personal, but they are also in the book, and what the book is about. ""Communism had an insane plan: to remake the ""old breed of man,"" ancient Adam. And it really worked … Perhaps it was communism’s only achievement. Seventy-plus years in the Marxist-Leninist laboratory gave rise to a new man: Homo sovieticus. Although we now live in separate countries and speak different languages, you couldn’t mistake us for anyone else. We’re easy to spot! People who’ve come out of socialism... We have a special relationship with death. How much can we value human life when we know that not long ago people had died by the millions? We’re full of hatred and superstitions. All of us come from the land of the gulag and harrowing war. Collectivization, dekulakization, mass deportations … This was socialism, but it was also just everyday life.""Not sure there is any overlap of experience between a life lived under communism as it manifested in Eastern Europe vs. a life lived in a capitalistic society, such as that embodied in the United States. My experience has straddled both, with the transition from the former to the latter a violently, radically sudden rupture at a young and impressionable age. One day, I was accompanying my mom on her daily errands through Bucharest's dilapidated landscape of empty government-run stores and identically dreary blocks of (state-issued of course) tenement housing, waiting in the 4th line of the day, for an extra handful of eggs she would receive for bringing me along. Then excitedly heading home for the 30 minutes of kids' TV programming offered daily (of 2 or 3 hours total broadcasting, on one channel). All the while, being tailed by the Securitate (my father had defected and been sentenced in absentia, so we lived under constant surveillance).Seemingly the next day - well. You've heard the stories of immigrant shock: the vast highways, insanely stocked supermarkets (supermarkets! we had no such thing). The variety, the diversity, the choices, the sheer mass, density, amount of STUFF. And people who nonchalantly wander through it all, completely nonplussed at the fact that there are mounds of bananas everywhere and people aren't shoving each other out of the way to get to them. Ok so I had had ONE banana my entire childhood - smuggled into the country illegally of course. To this day I'm still ... touched? surprised, just a little? at how much we take bananas for granted, at least here in the DC area.Of course the stuff is only the beginning, only the surface layer that one immediately notices upon stepping off a plane into the Land of Abundance and Freedom for the first time. The divergences penetrate deep into the psyche/soul/historical memory/collective un/consciousness of the people and place. Everything down (up?) to structures of thought, modes of interaction, even constructs for understanding the self - ALL are different in a society that limits ALL material conditions and social acts (energy, food, media, knowledge, books, speech, movement, communication) vs. a society that views freedom and choice as fundamental.Understanding the radical rupture created in my being by my move from Eastern Europe (Romania) to the US is the Holy Grail Quest of my life. I was young, it's true, but you never forget-""It wasn’t that long ago, but it’s as though it happened in another era … a different country … That’s where we left our naïveté and romanticism. Our trust. No one wants to remember it now because it’s unpleasant; we’ve lived through a lot of disappointment since then. But who could say that nothing has changed? Back then, you couldn’t even bring a Bible over the border. Did you forget that? When I’d come visit them from Moscow, I’d bring my relatives in Kaluga flour and noodles as presents. And they would be grateful. Have you forgotten? No one stands in line for sugar and soap anymore. And you don’t need a ration card to buy a coat. Did you forget that?No - you do not forget: childhood baths taken in a little pot in the middle of the living room, with mom pouring hot water heated on the stove. You do not forget relatives from the country bringing you the only meat you would eat that month - to this day, you do not scoff at pig feet or intestines or whatever items are too unfashionable in your new environment. You do not forget Sandy Bell, the only cartoon on TV for years, 30 minutes every weekday night. You do not forget salami (salami, the lifeblood/black market currency/favorite delicacy/only deli meat of communism - appears on almost every other page of Secondhand Time).Because you do not forget these things, because you can never quite look at bananas in the same way as your new neighbors or new generations, because you never do overcome the cynicism and bravado you learned in diapers torn from old sheets and laundered with coarse hand-made soap, because you do not forget, you don't ever fully adapt to Capitalism. Or, you adapt but do not fully accept - there is always a streak of nostalgia for old days of suffering, or a melancholy for the self-determination needed to survive 'back then', or paranoia, denial, indelible, fundamental distrust of/about existence, society, other people in your new environment. Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets is an oral history of this transition from full-blown privation, closed-off-to-the-world communism to a more or less capitalistic society. Told, as always with Alexievich's work, through a complex tapestry of voices, collected over many hundreds of hours worth of interviews, The Last of the Soviets is an explosively profound rendering of the collective memory of the region, before-during-after revolution. HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in either modern Russia/Eastern Europe, or the old USSR/Eastern Europe, or the transition from communism to capitalism, or in life under totalitarianism more broadly, or in the psychology of oppression and resistance.Note About Reading this in Parallel with The Fox was Ever the HunterEastern European literature speaks to me in a way that no other work can (the reasons are obvious). I find my heart somewhere between Alexievich and Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, and was so saddened/disappointed just earlier this week in my reading the first (German-)Romanian work about the period translated into English, by Herta Müller. The differences are stark. While both are Nobel laureates, and both write about life under communism - Alexievich's work showcases the triumphant, perhaps naively romantically melancholic, but, proud, self-respecting Eastern European soul, while Müller's worlds depict pathetic creatures unable to help themselves. While I wanted to throw The Fox out the window many a times (I settled for calling my mother to vent in frustration), Alexievich's work is like salve to my soul, and everything I remember about the people and spirit of the region.One last personal noteFor me, this was a tremendously personally important book, because, as an immigrant/emigrant, I have no grasp whatsoever of how the transition from communism to capitalism occurred for my fellow country wo/men. For me, it was an overnight affair: one day I'm in Romania, the next, in the United States. Which is perhaps why, when I visit Romania now, which I tend to every year/summer, it's so foreign to me. This book goes a long way into filling in the gaps from my absence.I received a copy from the publisher through Netgalley. Then I bought the book anyway when it came out - no question I need a physical copy to mark up and peruse like a personal bible. Obviously, all opinions are very much my own....more",Notes are private!,0,226,1,"May 28, 2016","May 28, 2016","May 28, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30200112-secondhand-time

While the latter firmly serves to reinforce all stereotypes known to humanity (blonde = beautiful perfection; brunette = chubby side-kick; non-white = ….. [non-existent]; materialism = rah, rah! etc and so on)- Binti unapologetically forges her own path, seeks her own meaning, explodes structural barriers sustained by history for generations: she is, in other words, one fully badass feminist heroine I’d want my (hypothetical) young daughter emulating.This slim 2015 Nebula-award winning novella, follows Binti, a young woman from the Himba tribe on Earth, who, against all odds, recommendations, and traditions, is accepted to Oomza University, the most prestigious in the galaxy (on another planet). This is just the beginning of her story (the first in a new series): an introduction to the Himba and Khoush people, the Meduse (a seemingly hostile, non-human race), as well as Binti’s spaceship travel to and arrival at Oomza Uni. The Himbas are a spiritual tribe, intimately connected to their land/place of origin. Their primary occupation is that of “harmonizers” – crafters of astorables for all Earthly races (an astorable is a smart-device that can do pretty much anything, by tapping into the mathematical ‘waves’ of the world). Himbas rarely leave their land, in fact they wear the clay of their home on their skin and hair (in a paste, otjize, featured on the cover), so Binti’s desire to attend Oomza Uni breaks all precedent. On her journey, Binti forges relationships with both Meduse and with the Khoush people (The Koush are metropolitan dwellers, an affluent race of pale skinned humans that uses the Himbas-everyone needs an astorable!—but does not usually deign to interact or forge relationships with them). She bravely and with youthful sincerity and non-duplicity seeks to understand all those whom she encounters, and uses her harmonizing skills to heal relationships and resolve strife, even violent situations. This is all while being the sole Himba on the spaceship and at Oomza, without the support of family or, at first, fiends.As other ers have written, the science in Binti is not articulated at length, and seems light at times, maybe an afterthought. As a math teacher, well, I definitely wasn’t feeling the “mathematical waves” that Binti tapped into as a harmonizer (but there certainly are physical waves permeating everything, and if you believe string theory, all is constituted of tiny vibrating strings…) So, true, this is not ‘hard’ science-fiction, BUT, these are my two rationalizations for upping the rating to 5 anyway:(1)	This book is for very young people; it could be read as early as 2nd grade, and even though I would have still enjoyed it in high-school, and read it as an adult, I’m not going to dock off points for the science not being fully worked out as it would be in an adult or even YA novel.(2)	For its intended audience, this is absolutely the most brilliant exploration of race, gender, identity, belonging, social-justice, peace-as-a-solution, and so many more crucial topics I have ever read....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"May 24, 2016","May 28, 2016","May 24, 2016",,Unknown Binding,view (with text),/book/show/25667918-binti

See, The Fox Was Ever the HPerhaps I was expecting a bit much of this book in imagining it would touch my soul in a most profound and resonating way. See, The Fox Was Ever the Hunter is the story of a teacher's life (1) during the last few year's of Ceausescu's communist regime (2; 1980s - place and decade of my birth), and moreover, it's written by a Romanian, also an emigre (3). Considering that's 3 for 3, I naively assumed this would somehow be the story of my life, the conundrum of my dual-identity explained, the nostalgia for a horrific yet clearer, more certain time expressed in all its contradictory complexity. Alas, it was not to be. This book reminds me not at all of Romania, answered no questions for me, resonated not at all with anything I remember, and was written in a style I do not recognize as Romanian at all. Perhaps the root of my incomprehension stemmed from the translation: of German into English. As any dual-language speaker can probably attest to, there are certain peculiarities of thought and experience that give language its meaning. An example: a quince. Do you know what that is? If you live in the US, most likely not. The word quince meant nothing to me in English, either; until recently I had no idea what this term even referred to (that was until the day I discovered this fruit at Whole Foods, in the bougie section). Of course, a gutuie - aah, that is something very different, a word that immediately conjures up tastes and fuzz and memories of summer and a tartness most unique. Also, of the country-side, of picking fruit from trees on the street in local villages - certainly not a $4.99/pound ritzy experience at the local Gourmet Grocery.Another example: cotton wool. The stuff cotton balls are made out of. See, in 1980s Romania, there were no fancy bandages or tampons or cotton swabs or cotton balls. No - there was simply ""vata"" - huge bags of cotton-wool, sold like cotton-candy. You'd roll it around toothpicks to clean ears, fashion it into pads or bandages, multi-purpose style. So when I read ""cotton wool"" - that means nothing. In English, we don't speak of ""cotton wool"". In Romanian, however, the word ""vata"" is imbibed with meaning - meaning that Müller does not always explain.Perpetually as I was reading this book, I kept trying to translate portions of it into Romanian - I just could not at all conjure the mood of Romania, the place, removed from the language.BUT, my disconnect from this book arises not just from the translation, but from Müller's style. The entire book is a poem - in prose form, but still, poetry, of a vague, indirect, fuzzy, detached form, completely humorless. If there's ONE characteristic of Romania 1980s I deeply believe was our saving grace: dark, surreal, ironic humor was it- biting sarcasm, cynical deadpan, the view that even in the most dire situation, we could still choose to laugh, to escape. And more than that, I remember a culture of directness, of a very pragmatic romanticism, of a quite attuned/attached approach to life - not the nebulous cloud of uncertainty and pointlessness Müller's writing suggests.This fearless, laugh-in-the-face-of-impending-death-sentence soul of communism is beautifully portrayed by writers like Bulgakov and by non-fiction studies of the period (such as a brilliant book I'm currently reading, Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets by Svetlana Alexievich). In contrast, Müller's work is about pathetic, paranoid, fearful people, who have no hope of salvation from the hopelessness and helplessness of their situation. Perhaps my reading is biased by the language-gap I was not able to overcome; perhaps, it's that I remember city-life vs. country-life (Müller is the daughter of farmers); perhaps it has something to do with Müller's Romanian-German identity/lineage vs. my Bucuresti-Romanian one. Who am I to say another Romanian's reading is illegitimate? What I would really like is to (1) read a Romanian translation of this and (2) read other Romanian people's thoughts on this book/.In the meantime, I'm going with 2 stars because not only did I recognize nothing of myself/Romania in this (perhaps unfair, but hey this is my ), but I don't necessarily see the broad appeal of this work. Feel free to negate this in the comments. As you can tell, I'm quite conflicted about my feelings on this one and will gladly take any input....more",Notes are private!,1,52,1,"May 11, 2016","May 24, 2016","May 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23847927-the-fox-was-ever-the-hunter

The Political.Nigeria has asserted its independence from Britain 35 years ago, but the devastating aftermath still resonates through all fronts of the post-colonial struggle. The militarized government (overturned and replaced in coups multiple times) executes human-rights activists it labels dissidents (BBC News). University students take to the streets in protest as reports of police brutality percolate the toxic atmosphere. As metaphorical darkness reigns, the (actual, physical) lights go out. Nigeria’s primary provider of electricity cannot sustain the country’s expanding grid as oil shortages are reported. Big Oil has been plundering the Nigerian landscape for years (Ogoni people struggle with Shell Oil, Nigeria, 1990-1995), and now the economic havoc caused by the wreckage comes into focus.1995. The Personal (Is Political).Young Ajie is plagued by guilt. Last to see his brother Paul, Ajie cannot stop turning the events of that day over in his mind, looking for clues to Paul’s disappearance. Later, he recalls: ""Things happen in clusters. They would remember it as the year the Mile Three ultramodern market burned down in the middle of the night… It was the year of the poor. Of rumors, radio announcements, student riots and sudden disappearances. It was also the year news reached them of their home village, Ogibah, that five young men had been shot dead by the square in broad daylight.""And After Many Days weaves the story of Paul’s disappearance into a broad tapestry that evokes the plight of a country fighting for its identity after hundreds of years of colonization. As Ajie and his family think about what may have happened to Paul, they recount the story of their family, and, in the process, of Nigeria. It is a striking contrast: told through a young boys’ eyes, the quotidian aspects of life, even amidst the violence, emit an optimistic sheen; still, profound loss is the driving force of the novel, in both the personal and political dimensions.As a novel, And After Many Days does not work terribly well, because it lacks a plot and compelling force that drives the story forward. Rather, AAMD unfolds as a casual stroll through Nigeria (in space, and time), with commentary. Still, this commentary for me is worth four stars – I knew embarrassingly little about Nigerian history before picking up this book, and Ile’s work taught me a pinch while sparking my interest in learning more, and in seeking out other Nigerian authors. I received this book from the publisher via Blogging for Books.

We do this, Foucault contends, because we are inscribed in fields of surveillance - we are forever watched, counted, tracked, observed. For example: FB, this site (GR), our credit-card records, our dress, our jobs, even our photo-albums - these are all ways in which our lives are documented, all are records used to evaluate/judge our worthiness/standing. F's insights always struck me as much more devastating than dystopian visions of state-surveillance. For at least in that latter case, power asserts itself as an external force. We thus have some chance of resisting it, at least psychologically or spiritually, if not materially. These chances are shattered to dust by Foucault's panopticon, which sows the seeds of self-modulation in our very psyches, and which thus teaches us to live, unquestioning, enmeshed in approved conventions and expectations.A Fine Imitation is one story of escaping the dreary existence we lead when we chose to abide 'societal standards' more than our own will and passions. Vera, a New York heiress, is trapped in a vapid world chock-full of society functions, charity galas, the latest fashion, 8-course dinners, and so on and the like, but entirely void of friendship, personal fulfillment and love (her husband, of course, only married her for the name and financial assets). The structure alternates timelines - in 1910 we follow Vera during her time at Vassar, and observe her failed friendship with Bea, a vivacious, spirited, earnest young woman (Vera sold out her friend for the sake of remaining in ""society's"" good graces). In the 1920s, we watch as Vera's marriage is derailed by her budding recognition that she has the power to escape her dreary existence. The medium of this realization, of course, is the most cliched trope in the romantic-playbook: the handsome, mysterious, foreign, brilliant artist who sweeps Vera off her feet (in his broody, artistic way).Mostly, I found this book as vapid as Vera's world of high-society. Vera is a timid, pathetic woman, an ardent devotee of 'Society' (she grovels to Mother, and patiently endures her husband's trysts for years). No development of her character, not even those manifested in the contrived situations woven by Brock, convinced me that Vera's journey was plausible. If anyone could have 'escaped' her situation, in other words, I am quite skeptical that it would have been Vera.The characterizations in this book weren't the only thin, brittle elements. The Gilded Age setting is barely visible, and not at all palpable (basically, people drink at home dinner parties but can't do so out on the town, re Prohibition Era). The romance is constructed out of 100% recycled materials (the dreamy artist, the reluctant wife, the ways in which the point comes when she inevitably stops resisting, tearing his clothes off in fits of rebellion and passion).I was riveted for the first half (before the story gave way to a full-blown Harlequin). Brock's language at first was literate (if not literary) and the story carried an aura of suspense (hence, +1 to 2/5). But, the latter portion of A Fine Imitation seemed written carelessly, in haste, without any attempt at originality of plot, language, or characterization.Lastly, one significant detractor from my rating - but, it's a spoiler.(view spoiler)[Vera runs off with the artist, who turns out to be a criminal (forger). They take on new identities, and lead comfortable lives as the artist becomes a set-painter in Hollywood. He provides so amply that Vera does not have to work, and she amuses herself by learning how to cook and such like. Moral of the story: shed it all, leave 'society's expectations' behind to... become a fugitive? leave an unsuccessful marriage for... risking a future with a creepy man you barely know, who could as well, in 'real life', turn out to be a more serious criminal? leave an empty life of not providing for yourself to... have another man provide for you?

Never before have I been so fully let down by a (used-to-be) favorite author. Night Soldiers blew me away as probably the most elegant, dark, subtle, historically detailed, and intellectual ""spy"" novel I'd ever encountered (I don't even like to describe it as a ""spy"" thriller because Night Soldiers is not genre fiction, but absolutely brilliant noir-historical WW2 literary fiction). I've read some others in the series, and loved them all (the last was #9, The Foreign Correspondent).I couldn't believe this book was written by Furst; some developments from #1 to #14:* all nuance has been obliterated in favor of simplistic moralizing and reeking explicitness* lyrical, well composed prose has given way to a direct, factual-reporting style* sex and nudity have been shoved in for purposes of titillation only, in ways that add nothing to the plot or characterizations* the realistic gritty-noir moody tone has been replaced by that of a commercial, superficial action-thriller One dimension I was not disappointed by was Furst's attention to historical detail and portrayal of aspects of WW2 I don't read much about in fiction (in this installment, the story is about the French resistance movement which helped stranded British pilots make it back to GB through an 'underground railroad' network).

A story that titillates and keeps the reader engaged through an atmosphere saturated with all the predictable pleasure-pain triggers: the devastation wrecked by tragedy; the ambiguity and uncertainty of love; the thirst for money and power; the journey into finding personal meaning in a chaotic, senseless world.The story begins with the crash of a small private jet; on board: two monied families (a media company exec and a financial giant), flight crew, security, and an artist, invited last-minute by one of the wives). All perish upon impact into the Atlantic except the artist and the 4-year old son of the media executive; through a series of coincidences (or good fortune, or luck, or fate) the artist, a former swimmer, is able to find their way back to land. He is hailed as hero (he saved the boy! he swam for miles in the dark!) or possibly a traitor or criminal (how did he escape? why was he on the plane?)Overall, Before the Fall is an entertaining read, a thriller in the vein of books that I definitely need once in a while to unwind from the demands of life and adulthood. It's also well written and much more thoughtful than others in the genre. Still, I did not always find this book compelling or interesting in any unique way. (Some thrillers that fall into the 4-to-5-star category for me are anything by Michael Crichton or Michael Connolly). As I tried thinking of ways to capture its essence for this , my overwhelming reaction was, just, ""eh."" It was definitely fun, but I didn’t care much about it while I was reading; it was analgesic in effect, not spurring any great emotions or excited realizations.Usually my s are born in some extreme passionate and personal reaction - I read as a form of meditation, and see s as a mirror into my/the er's heart, as much that at least as an appraisal of the work itself. This  is difficult to write because I have 0 feelings about Before the Fall-I am completely agnostic. Still, I know this isn't extremely (at all?) helpful to anyone reading this, so here’s an attempt at articulating some aspects that did not work for me:* I did not find the meta-structure of the novel to be cohesive; the story did not seem to be threaded in a narrative, holistic way. For example, we have an omniscient narrator; segments of the book jump randomly back and forth in time, and we know what people were doing and thinking before the crash, in a way that isn’t connected to anything going on in the present. Take Memento, the famous movie that popularized this unfurling backwards of a storyline- events in this case are connected through this guy's memory; in Before the Fall, there is no reason why we all of a sudden are presented with a past conversation-just random ""God"" moments.* There was an overabundance of pontification. 50% of this novel consists of Hawley’s omniscient narrator making philosophical proclamations such as: “Once anointed a hero by your fellow man, you lose the right to privacy. You become an object, stripped of some unquantifiable humanity, as if you have won a cosmic lottery and woke one day to find yourself a minor deity.” While I may agree on most of these insertions, I don’t much care for fiction books that predominately tell over showing.* Hawley’s world is not one I inhabit, or one I think or read much about-that of celebrities, financial gurus, artists, money, power and feel-good, fairy-tale endings. Basically, it felt a bit too Hollywood for my taste: all-ritzy/red-carpet/starving-artist-with-wealthy-patron/world-of-private-jets… (at times I couldn't help but wonder if this was written with the aim of a screenplay?)I received a copy from the publisher via Netgalley.

I studied Hebrew briefly some years back, and have returned to it recently after a long hiatus. It's such a different language than the Germanic (English) or Latin groups (French, Spanish, Romanian) I'm familiar with, that I can absolutely see how it may be incorrigibly butchered when rendered into English. I'm not sure if that's what happened here, or if it's just that Ben-David's writing lacks craft, skillfulness, and/or the ability to create dramatic tension.Basically, I did not feel I was reading a work of fiction, but rather a mission-report written by a field-operative. Details were 'factually' laid out (from the pov of our protagonist), and there was no element of story-telling involved, making this a very dry, non-compelling read. Language was not used in a 'literary' way, to induce curiosity and present insights, but in a technical way, aimed to inform. I also did not find the characterizations - and therefore, the characters, compelling. The protagonist himself seemed impossible from the start - a Mossad agent who didn't even think before moving in with a Russian woman and only notified the Agency much later? Doesn't ring true, or if it is, it makes for a very naive, novice spy.

They never think of the one thing the desert has more of - light. So much light.""Ben, a truck driver, delivers goods to hermits living up and down a lonely dead-end road in the arid Utah desert. His customers include two eccentric brothers, ranchers, a pregnant woman with unmatched cravings for butter brickle ice-cream, a preacher who repents by sporting a humongous cross on his back while traveling the highway, a cellist who 'plays' her instrument in the nude (without a stringed bow), and the aging owner of a never-open (yet functioning and registered) diner once of movie-fame. Mysterious occurrences arise; the past holds histories some would rather leave uncovered, and others that may yet bring salvation. There are mistakes that follow some to the end, snap judgments resulting in tragic consequences, misunderstandings that lead to unfortunate rifts, love that is returned, spurned, forsaken, and rekindled (not just between lovers, but between families and neighbors), and above all, there is the wisdom gained in contemplating the vastness and (seeming) emptiness of the desert.*swoon* / falls over / *fanning self and smelling the salts*Within moment of starting The Never-Open Desert Diner, I wanted to crawl up into its pages, to become fully overwhelmed and swallowed whole by the intoxicating world that Anderson brings into being. A world that is utterly raw, and vivid, and unflinchingly honest, even in its deceptiveness, and that felt more real for me than much of my conscious experience.  It would be difficult to overstate how much I loved this book. An absolutely brilliant, gritty-noir, rich, authentic rendering of unconquered frontiers, The Never-Open Desert Diner transported me elsewhere like few works of fiction ever have. Incidentally, 'the West' has been coming up some in my reading list recently (just finished an excellent history, The Rivers Ran Backward: The Civil War on the Middle Border and the Making of American Regionalism), so coming across this book now holds for me that aura of inevitability, or of a grander design, or at least of a little bit of magic(al coincidence..)The atmosphere alone would garner 5 stars from me, but I also happened to love the characterizations (and our protagonist, Ben, who is a quiet but kind, moral, beautiful human being), the pacing (thoughtful, deliberate, yet also suspenseful), and the insights imbuing each page (filled with profundity for those choosing to discern the meaning of Anderson's music). And, most of all, I love how Anderson managed all these effects with such subtlety. Bravo! Absolutely magnificent debut novel!A Note About the Rating:I have no illusions that my s are in any way 'objective' (there is no such thing). Still, most of the time I try to at least distance myself a bit from how I feel about a book and what I think about it and its merits, and so I've rated plenty of books I've disliked at 4 or 5 stars. With this , I'm leaning a bit the other direction -I'm writing this from the depths of my heart/soul/being/something other than my cognition. Which may be a good thing - an indication that Desert Diner gripped me in more than an intellectual way (which is how I usually make sense of life). Perhaps, in fact, I should add one more star, as this is a rare book that shocked me out of my analytical frame of mind into a dreamy, inspired one.Other Related Notes:- Anderson's flow is mostly unbroken, but the poeticism of his prose is not always consistent. His phrasing is never awkward, but at times, more melodious than others. Still, this is a minor point for a debut author of such skill in other domains.- This is a brooding, gritty, subtle character study - both of our human hermits and of the desert/ what it symbolizes. There are no bold declarations of feelings/love, not much talking even, there's no conventional endings, no action scenes, no neat resolutions, and the like. If you're in the mood for a 'mystery', for an action-packed Western, for witty dialogue, or for any number of things this book is not, you may not enjoy it.- I received a copy from the publisher via The Reading Room. But, it turns out that I had forgotten I entered this giveaway on RR, and so also purchased this book - I was that excited about it.

Ok, so it has been warned that underneath the seemingly idyllic pastoral landscape, a seething 20,000 tons of toxic waste percolates the earth. How this may be relevant, no one (wants) to guess, not even when the foundation of the new school sinks into an oily fetid pit. Undeterred, construction moves a few paces north, and the school opens in 1955.Fast forward a couple of decades. Women in the Love Canal community have been experiencing a dramatic rate of miscarriages (as high as 1/3 by some estimates). Children have been dying mysteriously from curable conditions after playing in public playgrounds. People's hair has been falling out. They've been developing cancer. Suicides are spiking. Many are anxious, angry, or depressed. Public consciousness that something is terribly wrong in Love Canal is growing, and residents are beginning to mobilize. In 1978, the Love Canal Homeowners Association (LCHA) is formed and immediately proceeds to file suit against Hooker Chemical (the prior owner of the property), the city of Niagara Falls, and the Federal Government. Journalists swarm into Love Canal, and explode the story of Love Canal's residents on the front pages of most national newspapers. The entire country is riveted. In the gripes of a contested election, President Jimmy Carter declares a national emergency on August 7, 1978. It is the first time such an emergency has been declared over anything other than a 'natural' disaster (floods, tornadoes, and the like). People in other parts of the United States begin to ask questions about their neighborhoods. Congress calls committees, agencies, and a string of hearings into being (including The Superfund and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) - providing cash & a structure for responding to environmental contamination by hazardous waste). As residents of Love Canal mobilize, the rest follow. The public's eyes are opened to toxic waste as a potential hazard; the budding environmental movement vigorously takes up the cause; researchers turn their efforts towards entirely new genres (toxic histories and deep histories of places); scientists begin conducting tests at thousands of national sites; Congress passes laws requiring sellers and landlords to disclose potential hazards. Yet, as we move only slightly towards the cusp of the 21st century, memory begins to fade. After Reagan is elected in a sweeping victory, he proceeds to diminish environmental protections (now, up to 25% of landfill waste can consist of liquids, up from naught). The Chemical Manufacturers Association throws its weights around a little and purchases good-will. Some progress is made with cleaning up Love Canal, and after two Republican presidential terms, Democrats are back in the game.In September 1988, now Health Commissioner David Axelrod announces that Love Canal will be resettled. Protest ensues, but this time it is not enough. By 1990s, ten families have moved into the new homes (acquired for 20% below market-price; not $1, for sure, but a steal in Niagara Fall's suburbs). By the end of the decade, the neighborhood is once again a model city, this time with a new name: ""Black Creek Village"". At the time of this publication, Black Creek Village residents are reporting birth defects, gastrointestinal and reproductive disorders, cancer, heart, and several other conditions. Testing is once again in progress. Citizens are mobilizing. What will we learn this time, and how long will we remember?-Love Canal is a sweeping ""deep history"" of the Niagara Falls suburb whose plight birthed public awareness of toxic waste as an environmental hazard. Newman's work is meticulously documented, highly engaging (though also academic), and breathtaking in scope. The rough outline above does not even begin to cover all the nuances that Newman addresses: - from the pre-history of Love Canal (back to its settlement and Native American protest and resistance)- to a detailed biography of Love, who initially built the canal as a future conduit for a river sourced by Niagara, and whose ambitions to build a ""model city"" failed miserably- to another biography, of chemical innovator and future giant Hooker, who deeply held to Dupont's Depression-era mantra, ""Better Living through Chemistry"", and who fashioned himself a progressive, even an environmentalist (but who dumped 20,000 tons of toxic waste without further consideration into Love's Canal)- to an exploration of the history of the chemical industry (and its alchemical mystique)- to a discussion on the role and predominance of women in the movement- to an analysis of race (the renters in Love Canal were mostly black while the owners were mostly white, and cleanup policies often favored the 'owners')- to an honorable mention of religious conservationists' efforts to modify prior trajectories of dominance over earth to stewardship of the earth in God's name and for his glory - to numerous asides about other interesting facets, such as philosophical foundations of humanity's will to conquer natureAn absolutely staggering, eye-opening book that will appeal even to those who have never thought about this issue before - it's the kind of work that will make one pay attention and care deeply, because it affects us all so profoundly. Living in the midst of chemicals and toxic waste is no less than a matter of life or premature death, disease, or debilitation. I found this book especially profound because I don't think much (at all? only fleetingly?) about this. Interestingly, Newman writes as if we all remember Love Canal. I personally was clueless to almost everything in this book before taking it up (my excuse is, I wasn't around at the time. Perhaps if you were, you can (in)validate his suggestion). So, I'm profoundly grateful to Newman for bringing our attention back/to this vitally important topic (one that it would have never occurred to me to consider otherwise).Bravo!

YeA man is born who is perhaps one of the most intelligent on the planet (if you believe in IQ scores and such quantitative measures of human worth). Yet he chooses to put this brilliance aside in order to live a ‘normal’ life as a mere English teacher. But then one day, this man is recruited by an old friend, now DARPA rep, to conduct an inspection of a field site in the desert where experiments are being conducted with some curious, mysterious effects.The Fold has an excellent premise and may be a fun romp, depending on your disposition. If you’re in the mood for an inventive storyline topped with some action and sprinkled with blood, booze, and sex, this book will not disappoint. If, however, you are looking for an insightful exploration of scientific concepts, or for masterful writing that leaves you pondering or dreaming, turn the other direction, walk back until The Fold disappears from your horizons, and start looking again then.First, I’ll admit that from the start, I didn’t like Clines’ tone. I was quite annoyed at Clines’ uber-technocratic quantitative framework (i.e. the premise that “IQ tests” accurately measure human ‘intelligence’ and offer a method for ranking people against each other, in hierarchical fashion, thus proving our protagonist, Mike, as the best man of all).- From within this framework, even life-long scientists, experts in their field, are cowered and shown to be much less able to solve their own problems than a super-genius with a high IQ and eidetic memory.- Also, in this world, it’s a cop-out to choose to teach high-school English. Genius is better used solving the world’s ‘true’ problems (as Mike confirms when he quits his teaching position).- Finally, Clines offers many underhanded jibes at ‘government workers’ (i.e.: “Your integrity’s safe. Or as safe as it can be for any government employee”). The digs don’t even make too much sense, because they most often come from the scientists who are directly funded by the government, leaving one to wonder why these moments were inserted – perhaps, just to fill up space, because that seems to be the ethos of most dialogue in the book.(Disclaimer: I’m a teacher, and therefore, a ‘government employee’, and I trained in math and engineering but I LOVE science and scientists…)Essentially, I felt Clines mocked scientists (strange, for science-fiction) and science (of which naught was explained or even sketched in broad terms, though Clines had an excuse for this glaring omission, relating to the stupidity of the scientists). And the language didn’t help: basically, all scientists had incredibly limited vocabularies, and did not seem to know or feel inclined to explain anything at all– fine, I may swallow that we can’ know about the tech and physics behind the device in question, but I can’t do this if I’m not convinced there is a foundation at least that the author is familiar with.(view spoiler)[The Fold is about the Multiverse theory, which is extremely controversial and on which I just started a book. I am at this time not inclined to buy any Multiverserian hypotheses, I see this theory as a cop-out, the modern ether to explain that which doesn't fit current models. But, we will see. I am trying to read Tegmark with an open mind. (hide spoiler)] Discordant notes were struck not just by our researchers’ lack of scientific credibility; dialogue was often empty of meaning, and rarely served as a mirror into the relationships between the engaged individuals. Mostly, I found it antagonistic – everyone always telling everyone else to ‘fuck off’ or calling them some kind of put-down – basically, this book fully subscribes to the overdone thriller ‘meme’, where everyone is incessantly busy proving themselves while mad at the world and at everyone else. Meanwhile, the remainder of the writing felt like generic, empty-of-significance typical pulp without pretensions to profundity or deeper messaging.Most disappointing of all, however, was the lack of science. I was truly intrigued by the premise (for which the book earns an additional star above 1 from me). But I didn’t realize I’d be reading a fantasy thriller, in which the science is a matter of hand-waving and worse, misrepresenting scientists and science. An example: anytime the tech in question is mentioned, the underlying physics is described as “an equation” or as “pages of equations”… ex: “It works. The equations work. The math works. The Door opens…” – this is as much as we learn from Clines about the universe he is creating. My personal beef (math-teacher pet-peeve) with this is that math is not about equations and cannot be described in these terms; there are often equations involved, yes, but they are, 99.999% of the time, just tools, not the ideas/structures of mathematics themselves.Overall, The Fold is a pulp fantasy thriller that might satisfy a lazy day in the sun (or a dreary one by a cozy fireplace), but without much depth–literary, scientific, or otherwise.I received a copy through Blogging4Books.

Alas, when I returned, as these things go, my Netgalley request for Dinosaurs on Other Planets, a beautiful debut short-story collection by a budding Irish author, was approved. Having just spent a few days imbibing the soulful atmosphere of Dublin and the melancholy of the fertile but sparsely inhabited countryside of County Cork, I was especially appreciative of McLaughlin’s portrait of Ireland in transition.The backdrop is a place still struggling from economic depression, and the overwhelming theme explored is human despair/alienation (driven by economic woes/inequality). A father desperately attempts to provide for his bipolar wife and child; a team of brothers engage in smuggling activities; a mink-farmer is ridden by debt. The most unsettling thread coursing through McLaughlin’s stories is her choice of setting: locations far removed from urban centers (long imprinted in human mythos as harbors of despair/inequality/strife).[image]Cliffs of Moher, IrelandAn example (and indulgence): I’ve always day-dreamed about my ideal of a peaceful life: roaming Romanian’s Carpathians as a shepherd- just me, the mountains, and sheep. And of course, in my fantasy, I’m also carrying a backpack full of books.[image]Piatra Craiului, a sub-range of the Carpathians in Transylvania, my soul-homeBut, this daydream is a purely romantic notion, born of a melancholy for simpler times, in which nature symbolizes peacefulness and beauty. Who knows if these times really existed? We tend to see the past through rose-colored glasses, yearning for an ‘Eden’ that lives purely in the imagination and is not supported by historical fact.[image]Piatra Craiului, RomaniaRealistically, if I was a Romanian shepherd, I wouldn’t be carrying around a backpack full of books (I wouldn’t have the means, or the education most likely). I’d be living in poverty, away from human companionship for long stretches at a time. And meanwhile, the world would go on, and I would know very little about it. On second thought, not so ideal, after all. In fact, a privileged self-indulgence: for I’m sure I wouldn’t be having this fantasy if I were still a child in Communist Romania. Ah, the view from my American land-of-plenty perch…McLaughlin brilliantly captures this dilemma of modern times: even in remote places, even in places bountifully given to nature, human despair persists, darkness still encroaches. There is no place where we can go to ‘escape’. Effectively, these stories demolish the notion of a fabled haven, of being able to somehow transcend the confines of our material situations (i.e. economics). Still, McLaughlin does not leave the reader with a complete sense of loss or inescapable existential ennui. For even within the bounds of our lives, her stories relate the ways in which we still have the ability to make meaning for ourselves. There is, at least, no cessation of movement: we are compelled forward, by our desire to understand. And, this desire is fundamentally a productive and positive force that propels action/life.Meanwhile, the choice is ours. Whether we decide to act, to seek out experiences, knowledge, wisdom - life sweeps us along in an ever-moving stream. Whatever happens, wherever we are, rivers don’t stop on our behalf. This sentiment is poignantly alluded to in the final story of the collection, in which a child wonders, could there be dinosaurs on other planets? Since they were wiped out on Earth by an asteroid, what about all those places that have not been hit? Even when a devastating realization, event, or act may wipe out all we hold dear, or may cause us to rethink all of our preconceptions, the world goes on, carrying us even as we may lie limp or try to fight against the current. Sobering, indeed.McLaughlin writes beautifully, her insights are penetrating, and her stories are easily relatable. Still, I wasn’t fully captured by the work. While I fully identified with the melancholic tone (the story of my being), these stories were a bit too... lethargic for my taste. Reading this short book induced some kind of torpor- it took me weeks to read, and then weeks more to write this .  I received my copy from the publisher via Netgalley.

It’s never occurred to me to question the Civil War as anything other than a binary phenomenon (slavery vs. abolitionism, North vs. South), so this was an incredibly fascinating read for me, opening me eyes to an entirely new layer of complexity I had been in ignorance of. While traditionally, the Ohio River has been imagined as a continuation of the Mason-Dixon line and has served as a border between North and South in popular reconstructions of the historical narrative of the War, Phillips shows that in fact, regional Western politics cannot be encapsulated in this dual manner. For example, Kentucky and Missouri were slave states, yet more white soldiers from those states fought for the Union than did for the Confederacy, with white soldiers from the free Western States also supporting both sides. Essentially, this is a book that challenges commonly accepted dualistic conceptions of WWII by exploring tensions underlying Western regionalism such as the struggle between collectivism and individualism (which are not the same, but seem at first to parallel the Southern traditionalism – Northern progressivism construction). Phillip shows how our Northern-Southern popular memory does not accurately depict the local particularities of the West, and makes a strong case that a Western perspective is needed in order for us to better understand conflicts and politics in the region today.A meticulously researched, well argued, enlightening perspective on the Civil War.

While teaching, she meets Tom, an official from the school district who has been exempted from serving in the armed forces because of his position. Meanwhile, Tom's friend Alastair enlists and is thrust into the horrors of battle. To complete the quartet, Cleave conjures Hilda, a friend of Mary, a more homely girl who is bitter and jealous of Mary's charm, beauty, and propensity for 'stealing' all of her (potential) boyfriends. A love quartet ensues, billed more as a triangle because poor Hilda is just thrown in for good measure and symmetry.This book will be (already is, pre-publication) a bit hit.  I can absolutely see it - the tender story that even in war, even as our worlds are transformed in unimaginable (and sometimes horrific) ways, we survive, and we persevere, in love. Our capacity to care for others and our relationships form the fabric of our experiences and give our lives meaning even as everything we've ever known falls apart around us. This is indeed a beautiful, powerful message, with which I do not disagree. Still, my reaction to this book was quite negative. This is of course influenced by my personal preferences - how much is that, and how much is the book itself, I can't tell, so I'll lay out some arguments and let you be the judge of whether this may be a book for you.This is not a WWII book. This is a war book. WWII is entirely incidental as a setting, Everyone Brave could have taken place during any war. Hitler is hinted at once, there is not one mention of Jews, or of politics, or of something broader than just the daily lives of people living in wartime. This didn't work for me at all - it makes this book no different than a dystopic fiction that asks about how we develop-and survive through-relationships in end-times... And there is nothing wrong with that, I love that genre! But I read this thinking it would be a WWII book, and I was disappointed on that count. The structure is episodic. We don't get a continuous flow of events, but rather snippets - one about Mary in June of one year, one about Alastair the next month, then we see Hilda and Mary two months later. This structure makes sense if one is attempting to cover a large stretch of time without writing the next Forsyte Saga, but not if one is exploring the development of relationships in all their complexity. For example, Mary's love for both men seemed too superficial - I didn't believe for one moment that she was in love with Tom, as much as protested it, and she falls in love with Alastair after only meeting him once, during a social evening out as part of the quartet.The tone is quite light. All the characters banter, trade witticisms, and engage in highly sarcastic dialogue non-stop. Maybe if this was the personality or style of a few characters, I would have bought into this lightening of mood more readily, and I do appreciate intelligent humor (which this was). Still, it seemed a bit too much - this was the mode of engagement between everyone in the book: Mary and her mother, Tom and Alastair, Alastair and fellow soldiers, Mary and her students, etc etc. I do appreciate the power of humor to create spaces of resistance in difficult times, and dark brooding humor is the primary reason I swoon over Russian literature. But Cleave's humor is much less powerful, imho, because he is such an optimist, and all ends well as it ends in love - yes many horrible things happen but mostly, the ending is definitely ""happy"". And I am pretty adamant in my belief that WWII is not a war that produced happy endings, and it isn't a war about love. So yeah, a bit put-off. But maybe I shouldn't be because like I said, this wasn't a book about WWII.Everyone Brave is beautifully written and the prose is engaging and intelligent. Cleave is absolutely a masterful writer- his wit is smart without being pretentious, and at times, he makes incredibly profound observations (even if I felt these observations were unsupported by evidence in the story, they were still accurate as applied to the human conditions- and hence, easily identifiable).Conclusion: A poetic, smart book about life during wartime and about the power of relationships to sustain us.

It is estimated that 7% of Haitians now carry the bacteria; over 8000 have died. Yet, the UN denies culpability (although Ban Ki Moon has indicated that he understands the origin of the disease) and continues to fight ""the most organized challenge to UN immunity yet"" (New York Times).Deadly River explores the history of the investigation into cholera by telling the story of French epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux, who was invited by the Haitian government to study the emerging infection. Frerichs worked closely with Piarroux as well as relying heavily on journalistic accounts and official documents in weaving this tale about the intersections of politics and science. From the moment that Piarroux's investigations began suggesting UN-troops as a cause, his efforts were obfuscated, thwarted, and misrepresented by politicians the world over, including some in Haiti, who were relying on UN-peacekeeping forces to maintain lawfulness during a contested election season. Frerichs's engaging story conducts itself like a thrilling mystery in which we follow Piarroux along the course of his investigations - to villages in Haiti, to France, to official hearings and boardrooms. I simply loved the ways in which Frerich brings out the exciting 'detecting' element of scientific research - he presents clues about the discovery of cholera's origin as they unfolded for Piarroux, offering a fascinating look into how a large-scale scientific exploration with political implications takes shape.But Deadly River is not just a scientific-research journey; Frerichs presents an abbreviated science of cholera and epidemiology of cholera pandemics, and focuses extensively on efforts by the UN, ambassadors from various countries, the US of course (including the CDC), etc - to politicize the science in order to protect their interventionist efforts. Ah, the eternal story of colonization: ""world powers"" settle into a region to ostensibly offer protection or support (or, not so long ago, to offer ""culture"" and ""civilization""), but end up sowing other forms of devastation in their wake. Deadly River is an excellent case-study into this sadly vast field.I have one complaint which brings my rating down to 4. Perhaps this is not a flaw as much as a misalignment of my expectations and Frerich's purpose and scope. Deadly River would more aptly be subtitled - ""One Doctor's Journey into Fighting Politics in the Name of Science - the Haitian Cholera Episode"". Because, as much as Frerichs does name other players, they are but tangential to Piarroux. And, as much as he purports to be writing in the name of justice for the people of Haiti, he's actually just writing in the name of science, for Piarroux, because he does not include accounts of actual Haitians, except as described fleetingly by foreign doctors, aid workers, and the like. What I'd love to read after this, and a needed companion, would be an oral history of cholera in Haiti (wish someone would recruit Svetlana Alexievich for this). While I understand that perhaps Haitian voices fell out of Frerich's scope, he does make pronouncements and conclusions as if his believes his work to be for justice. But how can you talk about justice when you haven't spoken with one person this crisis affected directly? That kind of imposed justice is no better in some ways than the UN's sincere efforts to help after the Haitian earthquake. It consists of decisions and appraisals from afar, by armchair experts who don't bother to consult the people on the ground, and it smacks of its own flavor of colonialism. Still, an engaging, scientifically and politically significant work that touches on an important but entirely overlooked (in US journalism at least) modern-day crisis caused by Western interventionist, colonial/imperial policies.I received a copy from the publisher through Netgalley.

David Dyer's impressive debut novel offers a plausible retelling of these events. Brimming with details from official reports, newspaper accounts, and other evidence, this meticulously researched novel not only offers us an account of what happened, but illustrates how conflicting psychologies, miscommunication, and misunderstanding may converge with tragic results.What Happened: The night of April 14-15, 1912, as the Titanic was sinking, it sent out eight white rockets, a known distress signal, to a ship it observed moored nearby (within 20 miles): the Californian. Meanwhile, on this other vessel, the second officer reported rocket sightings to his captain, who was below deck in his cabin. The captain gruffly replied that he wanted more information, then returned to bed, as the second officer considered his duty done, and took no further actions. And so, 1500 people that most agree could have been saved, died.Dyer's Approach: Dyer weaves a masterful story that maintains tension by focusing on characters' psychology; the essential question here is not, what happened, although that in itself is quite fascinating and accurately portrayed, but, why did it happen? WHY would a respected, resourceful, tested leader like the captain stay below deck as his second officer relayed spotting rockets? WHY would a second officer, so ardently passionate about his calling, capitulate to the situation without taking further action? WHY didn't somebody DO something? The answers The Midnight Watch offers (or plausible explanations in the very least) are profoundly complex and as old as the story of people. There are no villains here - not even the captain - rather, there are only conflicting personalities, born of different backgrounds, with diverging dispositions, who do not understand each other, who do not listen, who do not always think about potential catastrophic consequences to a moment's inaction. It is a sad story indeed, because it is all too common. Yes, in this instance, these men's momentary exhaustion, exasperation with each other, and unwillingness to listen led to consequences affecting the lives of 1500 people. But much more broadly than that, it seems like this is the story of humankind-both micro and macroscopic, period: conflicts born of misunderstandings, ill-will bred of miscommunication, hate and cowardice born of fear…Other good stuff: The writing is beautiful - not mind-blowingly creative, but moving, poignant, and not at all self-conscious or awkward. Also, I loved the angle and other historical details: chapters alternate between the Californian's crew (third person) and a journalist in NYC/Boston writing about the events (first person). In the process, we learn a bit about the publishing world, reporting, and about life in Boston and on a ship during that era. There's Morse, excitement over telegraphs, and even a bit about a zealous Congress eager to investigate.Conclusion: A mesmerizing tale, a masterful psychological inquiry and meticulously researched historical retelling. I liked pretty much everything about this book, and even loved parts of it (ah, the psychological explanation!). But I reserve 5 star ratings for books I find particularly genius, creative, masterpieces of their genre, or important in some other way. The Midnight Watch is excellent historical fiction, but I wouldn't necessarily put it on my list of books to absolutely insist that others read.* I received my copy via St. Martin's Press & Netgalley.

That’s as much positive as I can muster before the “BUTs…” begin spilling out. This is a very popular, highly-rated book, and you may enjoy it. I personally wavered between acceptance and true detestation. Perhaps I just don’t “get it”; feel free to tell me so in the comments. Anyways, here’s the deal: first and foremost, Hawkins’s story-telling style is infuriating, and not in a good way (for me). Every single  I’ve encountered mentions how “weird” this book is, and most ers seems to agree that nothing at all makes sense for the first 100 pages at least (I for one am not sure I ever got it, but then, it lost my interest long before the end, so perhaps I wasn’t paying attention). Well, I LOVE weird books, the truly bizarre setup, quirky characters, and the like; I thrive in the throes of productive confusion. There’s nothing more I’d rather be when reading a book than completely blown away by the surreal, the absurdly creative, the shattering of the mundane.The The Library does none of that. Confusion cannot be productive if you have absolutely no idea what is going on! And, it's not absurdity when everything can happen, because there are no rules, no internal validity. The Library is such a messy hodge-podge, it doesn't really inspire new understanding. Reading an interview with Scott Hawkins, my suspicions were confirmed. He writes:""Just about every mythology I could think of had already been tapped by someone more famous than me. I didn’t want to appear to be piggybacking... I needed to make up something entirely new. So I tried to capture the spirit of all these myths without really using any of the specifics.""(Source: FantasyLiterature.com interview) And that, for me, was the root of the problem. Hawkins’ “new” mythology is a random assortment of pretty much all mythologies that have ever been – from Buddhism to Christianity to the Greek Gods to Native American earth-religions to everything in between, with no clear specifics or references to anything we may be familiar with. Add to that he doesn’t explain anything as it’s happening (though some things are revealed in the last 100 of 380 pages)… for me, this led down a path of frustration and annoyance, far removed from semblances of enchantment and wonder, which I had expected to sweep me away in this book.Next, the world Hawkins creates does not have any boundaries or clear rules. Of course, fantasy bends the rules, but there are still internal patterns that cohere into a systemic whole! In The Library, it seems like anything can happen: (view spoiler)[people can come back from the dead, the sun can be plucked out of the sky, one can rewind time, memory can be erased-- (hide spoiler)] there are literally NO limits. This, for me, invalidates the entire purpose of dreaming a new world into being, which is to be able to ask “what if” questions from within another internally consistent, sensical universe.There are other aspects of the book that did nothing for me: the gratuitous violence, the detestable characters, etc. Also, this book is most definitely not about a “library”; as this enticing setting was the primary reason I picked up The Library, I feel duped (I mean, there is a library, but not our sense of it, and it’s only the setting for the last 100 pages or so).And: this is most decidedly not science fiction, although some praise it as such. As a math teacher and former engineer, I cannot do science-math mumbo-jumbo, like this explanation of a reissak: “Its essence is a mathematical construct, a self-referencing tautology, consecrated in the plane of regret…”. Ummm, no, stop right there. There wasn’t much of this, I’m pretty sure Hawkins knows he’s writing pure fantasy. But still, these quasi-pretend-mathematical descriptions were quite aggravating, especially seeing as they were not mathematically profound in any way- but rather, just random collections of mathy-sounding words. (Aaaarrrr! Math-teacher pet-peeve #1: Don’t BS the math! Of course I can tell!  Sigh. The story of my grading-life.)There’s also some good though. Hawkins writes well – I would describe his work as Gaiman-esque, with maybe a slightly more “pulpy” feel. The ways in which he weaves images together kept me reading even though I wanted to quit about every other page. The fact I finished this book at all is a testament to Hawkins’ vibrant, smart, direct way with words.And, despite my prior complaints about the foundations of Hawkins’ world, I did get the ultimate message about what happens when we allow ourselves to hide from the world in response to pain. If I just look at The Library as an allegory illustrating an important lesson about human reactions to injustice, violence and misfortune, I can see its value.Conclusion: I was not a fan, but a bit selfishly, I’d recommend it if only so that I can hear your thoughts. Plus a bunch of people love it – so don’t let this  deter you.*I received a finished copy from the ReadingRoom through the Advance Reading Program.

Usually I find that historical mysteries stray from politics, religion, and other ""controversial"" topics in order to broaden their appeal, but often this is a disservice to the era of their setting, because these issues are exactly what ""set the tone"" of the period. Fayes understands this, and does not shy away from depicting antebellum NYC in all its corrupt, political, zealous, squalid splendor.

I am only givinA naive perspective on the surveillance-state, written in the voice of a pompous, self-righteous, elite white liberal East-Coast male. I am only giving this 2 stars because Flanery does present some very important questions, and does also make a case for privacy (not a compelling one, to be sure, but still he brings it up, which is something, today).First, the writing: the voice of our protagonist is so stereotypical liberal privileged professor (no offense meant: I love academia, and I'm as liberal as they come). But, as a liberal academic (lover), I am especially appalled and repelled by vituperative, petulant, self-rationalizing, naive, artless acts of beating readers over the head with political pronouncements-especially when espoused be fellow liberals: we can do better. Basically, this book has the same tone as a Michael Moore film- the same vibe of an endless liberal rant, but even worse, because our protagonist spends at least 66.6% of the novel navel-gazing and feeling sorry for himself. [example: I am paraphrasing because this was an ARC - the protagonist begins the story by blaming his colleagues at Columbia for not awarding him tenure, and wines about being demoted to a ""lowly"" fellow/lecturer at Oxford, in one of the lesser colleges, with dumber students.. Um, yeah. Sorry, but I don't feel the swells of empathy rising within for this poor guy's terrible situation.]While I may have agreed with much of Flanery's politics, I cringed the entire time at the presentation, and if I'm half skimming because I'm embarrassed, I can't imagine this book reaching out those ""across the aisle.""Except, for, perhaps, the topic itself, which seems to appeal to subgroups of all persuasions in American politics - from libertarians to the most liberal democrat: privacy, and the ways in which a democratic society balances these concerns with those of national security. The premise of this novel is that we can be ""no one"", and still find ourselves caught in the web of surveillance and suspicion. This undoubtedly occurs, and I can only imagine, is a horrific situation. Still, that's not our professor's story.For, in fact, the now-lowly professor engages in a series of extremely naive and idiotic acts and makes compoundingly ridiculously reckless decisions that clearly land him in the situation he is in, under surveillance by the state. He is, in fact, not ""every wo/man"", he is, rather, a highly ""street-stupid"", blindly romantic, self-obsessed man who is unable to see anything outside his own bubble, and who is unable grow and learn from his absurd mistakes and transgressions. Certainly, if I was heading up Some Agency, I'd have this guy under surveillance, based on his paper trail - no question. Some examples: (view spoiler)[professor allows himself to be coerced into admitting to Oxford a student from a questionable Egyptian family related to Mubarak, allegedly ""for her safety""; he then begins affair with said student while serving as her advisor; after she conceives a baby, he proceeds to send money to her - all the while without having checked up on her affiliations, even knowing that her brother is now an Islamic militant... And it's not like he has no warning - there is plenty of indication throughout from others of what a sensible person would do - stay away from the a student with ties to a dictator, certainly, do not sleep with her, do not send her money, stop sending her money, etc... Um, so, YES I would say being the brother-in-law (or father of the baby-in law or whatever) of an Islamic militant, and sending money to his family on a regular basis, is pretty suspicious and not an ""every wo/man"" sort of behavior. This is not to say that the professor's actions are necessarily criminal (or at least I believe he had no criminal intent), but they are incredibly and almost unbelievably naive. I just can't imagine even getting close to being embroiled in such a situation - my god, how many lapses on the way to complete self-annihilation - not least of all the first and second steps, rigging the admissions game and sleeping with a student?! (hide spoiler)]So, by choosing the example he did for the character's background story, Flanery in effect cancels out his primary question and concern: can just about anyone turn up under surveillance by the state? If so, what is our recourse? My last point of contention with I Am No One is my personal stance on the issue, which I would rate as ""balanced"". I have no illusion of privacy, so I was consummately annoyed at our professor's naivete. I grew up on stolen phone calls with my father - he called when he could travel, hundreds of miles away from his new home in Maryland. Of course, the Securitate was listening in, just as they were blatantly opening our mail (at one point they stopped bothering about taping back already opened envelopes). Now that I've been living in the US over 2/3 of my lifetime, I haven't lost my cynical, but, also, I think, realistic view that there is no such thing as privacy. There's Amazon, who knew about my upcoming wedding before some of my relatives did (it pestered me to establish a wedding registry), there's my credit card records and a list of all my transactions somewhere - enough for AMEX to provide me with a full nutritional plan and counselling, I'm sure; there's my emails, sitting on google's servers.... it's all out there, and the only thing I can do is be sensible about my choices. It seems both evident and not unreasonable that some privacy is what we trade everyday we make a decision to consume or communicate in a way that is not face-to-face, or in cash. Even if the big bad government weren't watching us, somebody is, most likely with our permission. Anyway, these observations are perhaps just self-indulgence, and besides the point- I didn't like this book because it didn't thoughtfully consider the question of privacy and security balance, not because I don't agree with the author's perspective.* I received an ARC from the publisher and Reading Room in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,1,41,1,"Mar 08, 2016","Mar 14, 2016","Mar 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27209269-i-am-no-one

Of course, it's no coincidence, there is no such thing - only opportunities to learn, born of interest and active pursuit.New York has been on my mind recently, specifically 19th century NYC. I've been into an excellent historical fiction series on the founding of the police force (see Lyndsay Faye's Gods of Gotham) and have been watching Gotham on Netflix, although I am informed by others that the show has something to do with Batman, and that it's not set in NYC (well, whatever, I'm pop-culture illiterate but for me, it's a close enough approximation of Faye's aesthetic). In general I'm a big fan of the 19th century - it is the time period, after all, of not only the Civil War and women's suffrage but also of the industrial revolution, and of the ""birth"" of the modern era. Trains, Einstein, contemporary dance, modern ills and questions - all hail from that time. Additionally, I am as addicted to politics as one can be without actively being a politician or paid activist (you know, typical engaged citizen stuff, I vote, I go to rallies, I read the news 247, comment on Politico forums, donate to political campaigns, sign petitions, and the like). What I didn't realize before New York Exposed was how these three foci - NYC, politics, the 19th century - are inextricably linked in history and in the formation of our current political climate in the United States. Basically, this scholarly work details, through meticulous research, the birth of modern politics, current debates, accusations, psychoses, etc. It's a fascinating journey, brimming with real-life characters stranger than fiction will ever be, told in a lively, engaging way, for all audiences to enjoy (even though technically this is an academic book written by a real historian, not a ""pop-history"").I was blown away by this book, especially as I came to realize the complexity of issues that have been boiled down to mere slogans something like 200 years later. We make accusations today, for example, of voter fraud; the GOP insists we must protect against it, while Dems cry foul, because no proof of voter-fraud exists. But guess what? In 19th century NYC, in perhaps the most corrupt political era we have witnessed in American history, Democrats did commit massive voter fraud - offering fraudulent certificates of naturalization to immigrants in order to get their vote (sound like a familiar accusation?), encouraging people to vote more than once, counting ballots illegally, and the like. My Conclusion: both parties are at fault for not educating voters: YES, voter fraud did exist - here is its history; NO, there is no evidence it still does. BUT: here is the real story of the legend behind the asinine accusations we throw around without knowing what we are saying. Here is the context, because it's not that simple.*[Examples: yes, Dems engaged in voter fraud, but that was a different Democratic party. And it's not even as simple as saying the parties ""switched"", because, back then, the Dems supported immigrants while abolitionists were mostly Republican; today, obviously, large majorities of both immigrants and non-whites vote Democrat. Another: while Democrats were busy corrupting themselves into public office, it was a Christian minister, in his fight against corruption - the main character in Czitrom's story, whose actions evolved into the Progressive movement. Who would have thought - you know, ""Christian values"", now the mantra of the GOP.] This is why I love history: it explains pretty much everything, in such nuanced ways. Nothing is as simple as its distillation through time, and the journey into our collective memory always provides illumination for our current predicaments. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the modern political climate in the US, and would make it mandatory reading for all politicians if I could somehow do this.* Voter fraud is only one of MANY issues described and explained by Czitrom - I am using it as an example that struck me particularly, but this book is about MUCH, much more - think politics today as a whole - immigration, who gets to vote, what is the role of the state in providing for the less fortunate, you name it.** Thank you to Oxford University Press and Netgally for the ARC copy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 13, 2016","Mar 16, 2016","Mar 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26891229-new-york-exposed

I didn't enjoy this book at all, but it has, at least superficially, the elements of a good novel: beautiful language, poignant observations, an epic and historically vivid story... I received an ARC from the publisher through theReadingRoom. I'm definitely glad I had a chance to peruse this, because I hadn't even heard of Patrick Gale, but it turns out he's a prominent British novelist. So, I'm thankful that I got to sample his work, even if my conclusion is that I will probably not seek him out in the future.The synopsis is just as described: a saga of one (outcast) man emigrating to Canada during the western-colonization period (early 1900s). The tone and breadth reminds me of a Steinbeck novel, but without the underlying ... propulsion. There is something about East of Eden and Grapes of Wrath that thrusts the story forward that seemed lacking to me in A Place Called Winter -maybe something like fully realized characterizations, or a broader vision, or perhaps, passion. I forced myself to get through the first 150 pages, seeing that some s refer to the book ""picking up the pace"" after chapter 8. The problem is not so much the pace of events, but the pace of... The Whole. I've read plenty of books that were completely devoid of action, but were impossible to put down due to the author's creativity at manipulating language in a way that stimulates the reader's imagination. This book, for me, was just tedious, and I could not find enough reasons to put it down over the past few days. Finally, about 1/3 way through, I'm giving up.Still, I note that other ratings are quite high, and I'm thinking this may be a case in which my rating is based more on my personal disposition than the book's inherent value. I couldn't say with certainty at this point, especially since outside-evidence like the author's prolific body of successful work and success in Britain seem to contradict my appraisal. I'm not going to seek out Gale again, but if he comes up again in my reading travels, I'm certainly not writing him off. 3 stars.

And, despite having read s for months praising the oddity of All the Birds in the Sky, I still managed to be taken aback by the ways in which this book stands outside - or forges its own - tradition.First, the two broad strands that inform this work are (1) the tech-geek world and (2) nature-appreciating, ethically conservationist, justice seeking activist world. Anders speaks convincingly on both sides. There is Laurence, who, as a child, constructs his own supercomputer from scraps in his bedroom closet as he hides from engaging with the world, and Patricia, a witch, both 'healer' and 'trickster', who speaks with animals, summons natural forces, and spends her free time reaching out into the world, healing the sick. So All the Birds in the Sky is a parable of sorts that captures the now-classic 21st century dilemma: human conquest of nature through technology vs. the prioritization of the health and viability of The Whole (earth, other species, ecosystems, atmosphere, etc). In a thoughtfully balanced way, Anders paints a complex landscape free of traditional ""good-evil"" dualities. Characters on both sides have constructive and destructive instincts. Similarly, they are all flawed, well-meaning human beings who are passionate about their work, but also just want to be loved and find meaning through community. It comes down to a question of first principles: do we understand the world as constructed of distinct components, that can more or less be taken apart (the-world-as-machine, in the Newtonian tradition), or do we understand the world as a holistic emergence that is not only constituted by, but constitutes the parts? (the-world-as-organism). Laurence, our scientist, is of the former camp, and thus believes humans can just be extricated from a devastated Earth and shipped off to colonize distant planets (perhaps repeating the cycle - it's all about human survival). Patricia, our witch, sees humanity's travails as very much a part of the story of the decaying Earth, and seeks to heal both by mending their relationship.Loved the message, characterizations, questions, philosophy, and style of this book. Still, the emotional/maturity scale of Birds in the Sky never tipped beyond a YA novel - the characters speak as children throughout the story (into their young adulthood). Or rather, as adults, they speak as superhero-adult imaginings of children. As complex as the story was in other dimensions, relationships were presented in somewhat simplistic construction of long-known-but-suppressed-thwarted-by-circumstance-ya-angst-love. Probably, in my early 20s, this may have been a 6-star book, but a decade later, I feel no connection to the characters (although I did relate, emotionally, to the message).Still, overall, a beautifully written, thoughtful, quirky, weird, unique story about our relationship with nature and about our ethical responsibilities in an age of environmental devastation derived from human actions.

This book was written for me (And for you, too, especially if you teach or are interested in the education debates). A personal anecdote: Kids hang out in my room after school, including many I don't teach (they come with friends). Anyways, the other day, I had to kick everyone out due to a faculty morale-building activity (well so that wasn't the name of the event, but its purpose, close enough). When I told the students where I was going, one of the friends, looked at me and said, ""Why do the teachers need morale building? Is it because they feel so bad working with all the black children?""I think that's the first time I've experienced the phenomenon known as ""mouth gaping open"". I was just completely shocked, because the only reason I'm still here, 10 years later, despite all the bull bursting the seams of the system and despite the current atmosphere of teacher-demonization, is my kids. But, after thinking about it for a moment, the comment made sense: here we are, a staff of majority-white teachers, a 99%-black student body, and there's the news everyday, another black kid getting shot by authorities, droves of teachers leaving the cities (5-year turn-over rate in DC Public Schools where I teach), etc. & so on.My school is not quite like those Emdin describes, because we are an application school in not-quite-the-poorest part of DC. Teachers at my school have stuck around (not all, but a lot more than in the rest of our District). In Southeast DC, for example, there are some schools that have a turn-over rate of 1-2 years, meaning every other year, 100% new staff is in place. And, we've been making some progress on the issues Emdin describes, like truly engaging children on their own terms. Still, there's so much to learn here, and it saddens me that there really are schools (probably a majority of urban schools, I would not be surprised) where the situation is as bad as described by Emdin.The other aspect of this work that saddens me is that, read away from the academic world, it might even sound radical, when all it is is a reiteration of basic commonly accepted paradigms in the education-research world. Reminds me of my eternal struggle in grad school: the disconnect between academia and ""the real world"" (ever notice there are no people with education masters or PhDs making education policy decisions? Next time you wonder why there is an ""education crisis"" in the US, start here). Basically, the premise is the obvious fact that we have mostly white teachers imposing pedagogical methods and employing experiences born in privilege, teaching black and hispanic urban children. (Sigh, already I am imagining the hate-filled comments on a Hill or Politico forum if I were to post even just that sentence. Thank goodness this is GoodReads). The problem is even broader, because the entire system is constructed on a structure that privileges some over others (just take a look at American jails as an example). What this means in education is that it's not just white teachers who adopt these pedagogies of subjugation, but really, most teachers, because most have been taught to teach in ways that value obedience, physical rigidity, etc. Emdin employs the term neoindigenous to draw parallels between colonized indigenous groups and urban students in public schools, and frames urban pedagogy as an extension of Freirean critical pedagogy. Like Freire, who drew from a rich tradition of liberation theology, Emdin uses the black church as a model for implementing the ""Seven Cs"" of urban reality pedagogy: cogenerative dialogues, coteaching, cosmopolitanism, context, content, competition, and curation. After introducing the framework (25%), the remainder of the book is an exploration of the 7-Cs in practice, with some beautifully illustrated examples.I have one major complaint, but it's not detracting from my rating: Emdin should have done more to contextualize his research and to broaden its appeal. Sadly, much of the U.S. (judged by The Hill and Politico forums, which I sadly visit too frequently) isn't ready for this, as it stands. I was thinking the whole time, if I was some of the commentators I've seen on said forums, I would be denouncing this book as radical trash. But that just couldn't be farther from the truth: Emdin's research is really no great revolution, I mean, of course it's important, but it's in no way radical based on other prior research. It's just that that research never makes it public, so this may seem to come out of nowhere. I would have appreciated a chapter placing this work in a broader context, explaining it as a logical and natural extension of everything that has come before. That probably wouldn't convince those who believe academia is the spawn of the devil, but still, it'd do something.*I received a free copy through the GR giveaways program.

I was deeply touched, enlightened, profoundly depressed, and humbled by this work. Although I, as other Americans, are frequently exposed to statistics about poverty, these are but abstractions that only serve to reinforce the distance between the poor and the not (we can just make our donation to the Red Cross and feel like we've done our part). Unlike other academic books I've read on the subject, Desmond paints an intimate portrait of daily toils, constant crisis-mode, domestic violence, addiction, human dignity, familial and communal bonds, and other facets of poverty (in relation to evictions, homelessness, sub-standard housing). By presenting a human-focused perspective on poverty, Desmond's work adds depth to prior structural analyses, but more importantly, challenges current arguments that demonize the poor (i.e. ""the poor are lazy"" - not a statement I would have ever agreed with, but sadly, a common trope in current US political discourse).Chapters alternate between the trailer park and project housing, and include voices of both landlords and tenants, weaving a complex tapestry that is not limited by preconceptions (i.e. ""landlords are bad""). For the most part, Desmond tells these families' stories, but there is also much to learn here (for those of us not versed in the matter) on housing policy in the US, and on the ways in which housing problems are inextricable from poverty. Desmond makes a strong case that a stable home is (or should be considered as) a basic human right, for a home is ""the center of life, the wellspring of personhood"", the place where civic life begins, ""allowing us to plant roots and take ownership over our community, participate in local politics and reach out to neighbors"".I highly recommend this book to all Americans, especially those who have never experienced poverty. --[For me, the revelations presented by Desmond were a powerful punch in the gut. For the past 6 years, I was the only white person living in my section 8 development in DC (I was provided a unit due to the teacher-fire-fighter-police exemption - I wanted to live in my school's neighborhood). In retrospect, I deprived someone else of housing. In retrospect, when I called the cops on the man beating his girlfriend in the apartment above me, I could have been responsible for their eviction. In retrospect, I had virtually no clue about anything, because, outside of the roaches and rats and raccoons, the poverty didn't seep through my doorway. I'm now in the suburbs (because a house here is about the same price as a closet in DC)-and wishing that I had read this, or had some clue, many more years ago.]* I won this book through the Goodreads Giveaways program - and I am so very grateful that I did, because I don't think I would have made it a priority otherwise.

Alas, it was notFrom the blurbs/s, I was expecting a creative quirky story about time and human memory via a fantastical tale of reincarnation. Alas, it was not to be: The Forgetting Time is a mediocre book that does far too much ""telling"" and is in no way inventive in its structure or the ideas presented. Not only that, but instead of treating reincarnation as a fantastical/mythical allegory, Guskin seems to actually take reincarnation seriously as ""science"", quoting at length from Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives. Synopsis: A difficult young boy remembers a past life. A doctor who is nearing the end of his life meets the boy and sees in him a perfect case of ""reincarnation"". The boy, his mother, and the doctor seek the prior personality. They find this ""other family"" and help police to solve the disappearance case of this other (now passed) personality.The story is neither here nor there - I can see how it could have been good, in the hands of a more skilled, creative, skeptical writer. But, as it was, I just could not stomach the writing. Much of the time, it's not terrible, but sometimes, stuff like this happens:""Feel like I know u already. Weird?""""No!"" she texted. ""Same here!"" (Was this true? Maybe.) Should she xo? Or was that too forward? She settled for a single x. He responded immediately: ""XXX!""Oh! She felt a current of heat run through her body, as if she'd swum into a warm patch in a cold lake...So, yeah. Then, there's the writing style, which is 80% telling and almost as much telling about emotions. Basically, half the book is Guskin describing the feelings of her characters. In my opinion, this weakens the story tremendously: the point of fiction as I see it is to spur and inspire me to imagine beyond the written word, and Guskin leaves no space for that, because every single character's thought is dissected thoroughly, as the reader is exhorted to feel a particular way. That just doesn't work for me: telling me how someone feels won't make me feel it. SHOWING me the situations they are faced with has a much higher success rate in achieving this purpose.Lastly, Guskin's perspective, seemed, to me, a bit superficial, not least of all due to her focus on feelings. Now, I don't think there is anything wrong with feeling things, but I do believe, along Buddhist lines, that feelings are but a superficial mood layer we get caught up in. There is a clarity and depth one can gain by stepping back from the powerful influence of un-modulated feelings. This is why they say, ""think before you act"" (in the ""heat of the moment"" is implied). This is also how humans are able to live, more or less, in organized societies (i.e. most of us don't go around blurting out our true feelings to our boss, or don't let our feelings determine the outcome of research, etc. We know there are ""limits"" to how thoughtful we can be while mired in a torrent of ""feelings""). So, Guskin's characters, always caught up in a desperate, overwhelming, very needy whirlwind of emotions, did not appeal to me at all.I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1, because I do see why it may have broad appeal, especially to grieving (or non-grieving) mothers. This book is basically about one mother's hardships in raising a ""difficult"" child alone, and about another mother's grief at losing her son. The absolute gut-wrenching details of these difficult situations are described in depth. I am not a mother, but if I was, and if I had just lost my baby (or maybe if I was just afraid of losing my baby, i.e. if I was a mother) - this book may appeal to me on a much more ""emotional"", raw level. I can see myself, in that situation, crying through every page at the excruciating detail of other mothers' grief, and I can also see this book working to help me feel a little bit less alone. Perhaps, in that case, I would be rating this as a ""5"". ...more",Notes are private!,1,35,1,"Feb 28, 2016","Feb 29, 2016","Feb 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25527908-the-forgetting-time

Especially since I have this obsession with Antarctica and this other one with ballet/dance. A skeptic teacher grown-up perspective:This book is for ""middle-grade"" readers, but the language is just atrocious. It does stray pretty close to how 8-14 year olds talk - in all respects, including when adults are speaking (adults in this book talk like 14 year olds...). Old lady, apparently, speaking: I remember ""when I was young"", we used to read Tom Sawyer and The Three Fat Men (Yury Olesha). These works, while appealing to younger children as well as to adults, do not condescend to their audience while engaging in ""baby talk"". They present adults speaking as such and they illuminate landscapes from a broader perspective than that of a still growing child. In the process, they actually teach kids something about the world around them from new angles, not just those that a child can relate to in an emotional way, on her/his own terms.But then again, I also underwent my Nancy Drew and Sweet Valley High periods. No offense to these series, because clearly they spoke to me at a particular time. But yeah, rereading these as an adult, I cringe all the way through at the casual misogyny, racism, adherence to stereotypes, promulgation of an ethic of consumerism, etc, etc. Now, Up to This Pointe isn't so much of that as it is the 21st century version of this girly-pulp that appeals to emotionally questioning young ladies. Which is fine, for that purpose...

I almost want to give bonus points when that happens - skipping out on integrating functions so you can catch up on a book? GREAT! Who cares what it is? They are reading a book, and not texting! It's amazing, rarely happens. So of course I'm happy when the kids these days are reading anything. Also, I went through that phase, so who am I to judge?If you are an adult, I would caution you to NOT read this book, unless you want to experience the world through a superficial, woe-is-me, tween-angst veneer for a bit.If you are a young person, and this books' description, title, author, publisher, cover, cover blurb or whatever sounds appealing to you, read it!!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 29, 2016","Mar 02, 2016","Feb 25, 2016",,Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/25430623-up-to-this-pointe

Faye has and does it all: her language is fluid and melodious; her work's historical accuracy and her attention to detail are downright academic; the characters she creates are multi-dimensional and continue to grow throughout the novel; etc, etc. The setting is early 19th century antebellum New York City. I've read a bunch of scholarly studies on the era and region, and was absolutely blown-away by all the accurate details Faye managed to explore: women's entrance into the workforce (and piece-work, that kept many off the streets but in constant poverty), racism and racial-based violence, political battles between the Democrats and the Whigs, 19th century medical practices, the formation of a police force and the conflict this caused, a lot more, and most of all, a quite believable portrait of what 19th century New York was like to live in.I love, love, LOVE New York. It is my soul-city (after Paris of course). And I, as any reader probably, have often wondered what it would be like to have lived at some point past (or future?) - have been there, in fact, by reading. The Gods of Gotham is a complete immersion into a fully fleshed out, entirely plausible, compelling rendering of 19th century New York City. And it's absolutely fascinating, especially if you love that time period or the City: there are the rural locations east of 5th Ave, there are people in the streets pumping water, there are firemen brigades which basically rule the city like mafiosos (until the police force steps in, tentatively, during this period).The novel is not perfect: it's definitely ""genre"" fiction - it follows all the plot rules, and Faye takes no creative license beyond her absolutely beautiful use of language. But, this language is almost too poetic: it's a strange thing for me to say, because I value that above almost all else as I read, but at times it was hard to believe that all cops, madams, spinsters, dock-workers, etc, spoke in such exalted tongues.

Also, a most impressive creative rendering and inversion of H. P. Lovecraft's (racist & misogynist) work. Lovecraft Country blew me away. I can't remember the last time I read a book that was so complex and so ... connected-each theme, each arc, each character so compelling in their own right, but also so clearly coherent and related to others in the context of the whole. This book gives new meaning to the adage, ""the whole is larger than the sum of its parts"".First, the characters are so empathetically drawn. And I don't mean sympathetically, which would imply pity or some other emotion that would be akin to a patronizing tone. I mean, we are drawn into their experiences through poignant descriptions of external events, not through an analysis of the characters' emotions, in such a way that we are called on to imagine their emotions. And, of course, this is itself an emotive, not purely cognitive experience. A more concrete example: the novel opens with a man, Atticus, driving home. He is stopped and harassed by a cop. He has to use a restroom but he is turned away from public ones reserved for whites, and so he takes a moment on the highway in the bushes. He then worries about which roads to take, because on some, he will certainly meet violence. He consults a publication he hangs on to for dear life, ""The Safe Negro Travel Guide"", to locate a place he can sleep the night, otherwise he will have to do so in his car. No preaching from Ruff, no philosophizing, but still, the reader is right there with/ as Atticus, and one can't help but feel the absolute despair/ anger at the injustice/ compliance/ resistance/ silencing effect of the situation. He's just trying to get home, what the hell...Second, the structure of Lovecraft Country is brilliant and works so well to both convey the story and to mirror its message. The novel consists of interconnected stories, all featuring the same cast of (~12) characters, the ancestors of a black family and of their previous white ""owners"". Each of these stories is fascinating in its own right, and offers a ""twist"" on Lovecraftian lore- there is metamorphposis (a potion that can turn a black person white), time-travel (to distant planets, on which blacks have been exiled), hunted houses (with ghosts ""tamed"" and befriended by a determined black woman who moves in and refuses to be deterred by ghosts from the past), nightmares that reflect past horrors not experienced by the dreamer but by his ancestors (lynchings), and more. Throughout it all, it soon becomes clear that the ""monsters"" Ruff conjures are only mirrors or incarnations of racism -both ""personal"" and institutionalized.The broader arc that ties these narratives together is the relationship between the characters, especially that between the ancestors of the slave-owners and of the former slaves. In true Lovecraftian style, there are lodges of power-hungry whites eager to use the black family (who are in fact descendants of the slave-owners as well as those of slaves) for their own ends. And, although in each story, it seems as if the black family only comes out unscathed due to the protection of one of these white men, in the end it is their prioritization of family and relationships that prevails, even over their patronizing ""protector"". So, as each vignette is a reflection of the particulars and manifestations of racism, the grander arc is an indictment of systemic racism.HIGHLY Recommended!...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Feb 22, 2016","Feb 28, 2016","Feb 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25142937-lovecraft-country

Or me, or Sam, or even drugs. She didn't have reasons. She just wanted to see what was in the dark...""Cambodia Noir reads like a drug-induced frenzy, like falling into an abyss of human depravity, senselessness, unmoored emptiness and despair. Steely's voice as our protagonist, washed-out journalist Will, is mesmerizing, and offers - for the reader at least - a sobering portrait of how far any of us may fall through a combination of denial, repression, and addiction. Addiction not only to drugs, but to the next blood-curling experience, the next big score (in this case, the Pulitzer-worthy story).Will, in denial and repressing tragic memories of reporting in Afghanistan, comes to Cambodia to get lost (mostly from himself, he is not being literally hunted). He chases down stories about the corruption, political machinations, drug running and the like - all while fully saturated in a highly volatile concoction of drugs, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and whatever other substance he can get his hands on that will help his memories fade. And yet, as dark and violence-prone as his life already is, Will finds out it can get much worse on the day he is contacted by a wealthy Japanese American. This woman wants him to find her missing sister, who had interned at Will's paper. The story unfolds into a complex and nuanced plot involving American law enforcement, Japanese mafia, drug trade & policy, sex-trafficking, corrupt Cambodian police, Cambodia politics, international NGOs working in Cambodia, etc. I loved Seeley's style - he weaves an incredibly intricate tapestry, and his language perfectly renders the drugged-out-thrill-seeker who is running away from himself/the world. Yes, Will is a bit detestable, or perhaps just pathetic, or just a human who has allowed himself to fall - depending on your outlook - but to most he's probably not a sympathetic character. Still, Seeley draws us into Will's world in such a way that we can at least begin to understand it (as a horrific cautionary tale in the very least), even if we may not sympathize. So, excellent characterizations.There were a few detractors for me. One was the depiction of Cambodia as a dark, desperate, fringe place that no one would consider being unless they were in hiding (most of our characters are running away from something, and most are not Cambodian). I'm from Romania, and what annoyed me about Cambodia Noir is the same reason ""Dracula"" really gets on my nerves - some Irish guy decided to find the most ""back-water"" uncivilized place that ""no one had ever heard of"" and fabricate a story out of whole cloth devoid of any local history or lore. So I'm pretty sensitive when some Western man goes into what they deem a ""backwards"", or in this case, ultimately-bleak and depressing country, and weaves stories about its people from solely from their own point of view.Cambodia Noir is crippled not by Seeley's perspective - he gives every indication towards the end that he realizes his depiction of Cambodia is only the dream of some strung-up junkie. What goes wrong is that because he is writing from an addict's perspective, the narration is incredibly myopic - there's the next fix, be it drugs or action, but not much else other than darkness and dysfunction. To Seeley's credit, he does give one tinsy voice to a very minor character, who towards the end rebukes Will's offers to ""save her"" from her home: ""I am not a dream. I am real. I was born in a Khmer Rouge Camp. I grew up in the war. Now we have peace, and someone dies every day. But it is always my home""... Then later, Will understands that ""Cambo only existed through the lens of those places we created: a world built to reflect us back at ourselves, a world of poverty and deference..."" I wish there had been a bit more of this - if there were, I wouldn't be subtracting this from my rating...Which brings me to my second detractor. The ending was incredibly rushed, and to me ""the solution"" also felt a bit contrived. The entire novel, we are led through Will's life moment by moment, but yet the last couple chapters fly by in a rush, we are given only broad outlines about how Will finds the sister, and what she's up to didn't seem to follow from anything else that had happened.Overall, a unique, masterfully written, soul-wrenching debut that probes the depths of the darkness of human nature.But, it's probably not for everyone. There is a lot of violence, drugs obviously, other things we never speak about in ""polite"" company, and also frequent allusions to the child-sex trade. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Mar 27, 2016","Feb 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25814249-cambodia-noir

I am simply blown by the ways in which she strings words together- trulSamantha Hunt is a poet of the most insightful, lyrical, soul-wrenching order. I am simply blown by the ways in which she strings words together- truly, as one of her characters puts it at one point - challenging the ""tyranny of fiction"". I am no poet myself so I am not going to pretend that I can write an analysis or otherwise render Hunt's style. What I can say is that, as a practical-scientifically minded person who teaches math for a living, I absolutely crave the soulfulness, joy/melancholy, ecstasy, sensuousness of the artistic... spirit (?), embodied so holistically in this work. Of course, to me, math is art, but that's not usually how I practice it (ah, standardized testing, Common Core, etc, etc, inane quantitative measures of intangible things). So in my ""spare time"" such as it is during the school-year (no children yet, which is why I still have some), I try to inspire (inhale, motivate myself) what creative energy I can (usually by reading fiction). This is one of those books that amply and even overflowingly fills the well depleted by my profoundly non-artistic day-to-day existence. Reading Mr. Splitfoot, I am fully immersed in a chaotic but attuned, blunt and melodious, simple yet so profound soup/dance/game/orchestra of words. Words that, in their at times discordant ways, birth an illusion (reality?) that is more true than most things I encounter in my daily trudging. This book is a hauntingly resonating, masterfully written artistic masterpiece.But it is also so much more than that, for the perspectives it presents, for the setting and content. Or perhaps, this work is art because of the ways it approaches the eternal questions (what is meaning? death? being a mother? told through the fevered dream-like narrative of an ex-cult member/family). A critic somewhere wrote that Hunt writes ""from the margins"". Indeed - this is not a story that takes place from within the comfort of that which most of us take for granted: a caretaker (or mother), a home, a steady job/income, a more or less ""typical"" way of interaction with the world around us. It's the story of abandoned children, well-meaning but religiously deranged individuals, ""unnatural"" (unconventional) attachments, con-men, people doing everything to survive, and others trying to make meaning after deeply troubled childhoods.For me, the content and perspectives were much needed jolt out of my insanely undeserved comfortable existence (the job, the cats, the house, the car, the food supply, the safety and comfort). If you've seen Winter's Bone, the mood Hunt builds is a bit like that. Not quite the same, but I haven't read or encountered anything like Mr. Spitfoot before, so it's difficult to draw parallels. It's just so ... quintessentially out-the-mainstream, marginalized American (American gothic, according to critics). And yet, despite, or perhaps because of, the characters' outsider-status, Hunt's writing helps us understand our own quests, troubles, ghosts, desires so much more clearly than we would if we were observing our self-imposed system from the inside.I absolutely LOVED this book to pieces, but although I would highly recommend it to everyone for its educational and artistic power, I couldn't guarantee that you will enjoy this - I would only hold some kind of hope. A bit like how I wave my hands around excitedly about math in class; while I win some converts every year, to many more of my students I am probably just the crazy math teacher. This book is not for everyone, and you may find it frustrating, especially since, as I mentioned, it's not written in a conventional style (basically, a poem in narrative form), and in general challenges all conventions through its characters, the setting, perspectives, etc. If you like your stories to stand on solid ground, I am just the crazy person waving my hands around right now.

Her stories flow seamlessly and morph into unexpected shapes within the turn of a sentence. You come to think you're reading about an abandoned baby left at a monastery, but by then you're following the life of a laundress, getting lost in a library where books whisper and rustle in the night, and of course, there is also the beautiful garden covered in wild roses and the mountain that protects those who believe. But it's not just the stories-as-such that dance in these unpredictable kaleidoscopic forms. Oyeyemi's descriptions - of phenomena, people, relations - also defy conventions and rules. In introducing a character, Oyeyemi for example does not describe their appearance, needs, aspirations, or other standard fare, but rather reveals them more subtly, by telling us that this person ""wore a chain around her neck, [and] told people that she was fifty years old and gave them looks that dared them to say she was in good condition for her age"" (she was 35).Oyeyemi is, in other words, a poet. Her book has been described by more illustrious ers as ""fever-dream"" in quality (NY times book  cover blurb) - but really, this is no Timothy Leary; what this is, is vivid, completely lucid/sober and magnificently penetrating poetry. And, thankfully, through a character's research into the term bigarurre, Oyeyemi offers us a vital clue to unpacking her style, because the orchestra of images she conducts is precisely both ""a medley of sundry colors running together"" and/or ""a discourse running oddly and fantastically, from one matter to another.""Did I enjoy this book? Well, while I loved being swept off my feet and carried along on a surreal journey into creative genius, I can't say I enjoyed being pulled under by the currents. At times, I was drowning - I had absolutely no way to grasp either what was happening or the meaning behind a gesture, a character, the entire story. And I know that's the beauty of such genius - it leads you to ask your own questions. But still, at times I felt so unmoored I lost interest, and was not very compelled to continue- you could say I was bored. But, as any teacher knows, boredom is most often a symptom of incomprehension, for which scaffolding is critical! Which means, I suppose, that I need to start reading poetry (I should! I've been wanting to! I know it's so critical..). And perhaps some books on poetry. At some point after that, I will make plans to revisit this book.That said, I can absolutely see why this book is one which is raved about by the critics but maybe not as highly regarded by the rest of the public. I personally did not enjoy it, because put simply, this is top-tier mind-blowing poetry, and, as a novice poetry-reader, I didn't ""get"" much of it (my ultimate goal in life is to shed my scientific training and critical mindset and be able to fully appreciate art and poetry in their sensuous, embodied splendor. I am not even close to that now btw). Still, my rating, based on my appreciation of Oyeyemi as an artist, cannot be less than a 5. I highly recommend this if you like thoughtful books, and especially if you appreciate poetry!...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Apr 02, 2016","Apr 05, 2016","Feb 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25810500-what-is-not-yours-is-not-yours

Terrible injustice permeates human existence.But, there is hope: ""He heard them saying in the streets, 'Another world is possible,' and beneath his ribs broken and healed and twice broken and healed and thrice broken and healed, he shuddered and thought, God help us. We are mad with hope. Here we come."" And, for those who come together in such displays of hopeful protest, their collective action and standing together is how ""they hold the fear in their mouths and transform it into gold""...Ah, sweet, positive, forward-looking perspective. This book would have kindled a fierce will-to-action in my 20-year old starry-eyed bleeding-heart liberal optimistic soul. But now, as a 30s something fully disillusioned adult, what strikes me most about Yapa's message is its seemingly youthful naivete, its... untarnished romanticism. Even violence is presented as redeemable, ultimately conquerable. Everywhere, there is hope!I totally fell for that in 2008 and 2012. I used to be a most hopeless romantic. So perhaps this means that instead of focusing on why this book induced some major bouts of eye-rolling, I should instead ask, What HAPPENED to me?!?! Have I completed the full transformation into my Romanian-strength cynical parents? To be fair, Yapa's own understanding is much more nuanced than what I've let on so far. He does allude to protester's optimism as a quintessential American phenomenon, born in positions of privilege and sustained through the (white) ""savior complex"". Also, a Sri Lankan representative to the WTO meetings is invoked as part of the supporting cast, an offering of a perspective from the 'outside'. But, he is but a bit-player, an interlude to the action. And, in the end, this is not a story about the plight of colonized people, but one about ""hope"" - hope in our power to change 'the system' and to sustain each other, hope in the potency of protest and collective action, hope in our ability to 'make a difference', and so on and the like.Ok, so by now it's clear I'm fully a-romantic. I do believe in beauty/love/ideals/dreams, but I remain grounded as a first principle. Nothing really gets under my skin as the reek of explicit sappiness. And, while Yapa's words resonate deeply with the plight of being human, there are too many instances of this for my taste: ""The man who took her hand in his, not an effort of restraint, but holding her hand and looking into her face, and in his eyes she saw not the state, not institutionalized evil, not modern medicine and all its chemical compromises, not the death of human connection, not a servant of the state which built prisons for you at every turn, no, what she saw in his eyes, in his face, was nothing more than simple human concern, the sudden affection of one human being for another.""Yes, yes, it's all absolutely true, and beautifully written even, and I get it, but I do appreciate subtlety, and I'm not a fan of emotionally-manipulative writing. Especially when such writing depicts worlds I'm already in agreement with, that I already inhabit. I absolutely 100% agree with Yapa - YES workers are exploited, YES the era of agriculture that Monsanto is ushering in will be the death of us, YES big pharama's profiteering ways are the moral equivalent of experimentation on the less fortunate, YES of course cops are just people and we all have a potential to connect on a human level. But there's just something about this kind of open polemicism, even (especially) from my own 'side' of the political spectrum, that I do not digest well. Yapa doesn't rant, but he sure does pontificate. And explain. And muse, in detail. And then articulate some more.One last praise/complaint: Yapa's writing. A demonstration will serve. Staccato thoughts. Just scattered associations, really. Mostly, not sentences. At least, at first, and then after a bit of this, words begin to cohere into nebulous forms. Next, a full one presents: here is a subject, a predicate, and we are once again on solid ground. And then there may even come a truly beautiful and poignant sentence that vividly depicts some soul-wrenching order of the universe. Until the cycle degenerates into a stream of uninterrupted musings on global trade and the effects of colonization and did you know we are exploiting immigrant workers, they work on farms and don't get paid enough and we must protest because this is not even a sentence anymore but who cares because love and hope trump violence and despair and the tyranny of fiction, and we will persevere while making our own meaning as we tumble through all this feeling.[Repeat for 300 pages]This is Yapa's debut, and it gives every indication that he has the ear, the heart, and the lyricism to write glorious poetry. But at the moment, his poeticism seems a bit contrived; I probably could develop an algorithm that could gobble up the first few chapters and predict to the note the flow for the remainder of the book: staccato - phrases - full sentences - stream of consciousness - loop back. The style is especially jarring considering chapters alternate perspectives - a cop, a chief of police, various protesters, the guy from Sri Lanka. And yet they all think/talk the same way.Overall, though, I'm glad I read this - it's been popping up on so many lists, curiosity was overwhelming me, and now I know. Also, OK, OK I agree with it all! And it's beautiful and if I had read this when I was 20, I would have fallen in love...Disclaimer: Your Heart is a Muscle could very well be a 5-star-book, seeing as this  reflects more on my cynicism than on any other factor....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Apr 23, 2016","Apr 26, 2016","Feb 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25604513-your-heart-is-a-muscle-the-size-of-a-fist

My bed, desk, floor are strewn with books, while the new home now houses several ""libraries"" (yes, I even named them). I love books - and I do not mean, reading books, though I love that too, I mean books as physical objects. Fingering and smelling them fondly as I read, I am a sucker for the feel of a nice editions, serrated edges, the scents of freshly printed paper, and the like (which is why I don't do e-books). So now I'm having some kind of moral breakdown: I received this book via the GoodReads Giveaways program. My first couple reactions: ""I got a free book! I won (my first) book! I won something for the first time ever, and it's a book!"" Understatement to say I take this seriously, and that I am overjoyed. And this book will definitely find a home (in the ""mysteries and pulp"" library). Back to the moral breakdown: I am supposed to honestly  this book. On one hand, I'm so overjoyed at having received a free book (the feeling may fade with repeated ""wins"" but this is my first). On the other, if I were honest about the contents, this is terrible, the perfect example of the sophomoric, inane, vapid drivel that somehow garners mass success in today's a-literary world of publishing. I basically felt as if I was reading a 5th grader's attempt at a novel. I haven't read mysteries in a while, but I went through a period where that's all I read. I've gone through the entire Christie and Stout collections, most of Susanna Gregory and all of Mel Starr and C.J. Sansom (historical mysteries), with samplings from all the other ""greats"", and lots of newer pulps too. None of the authors I've read in this genre are artists (except C.J. Sansom, who is a bona-fide British academic historian and whose works are masterpieces)- but they all have this in common: their writing does not grate on the nerves. It's no poetry, but it's unobtrusive in a way that doesn't detract from the stories.Not so with Devonshire Scream, which is just badly, awfully, ghastly, terribly, [insert any other synonyms here for ""horribly""] written. I didn't care about anything that was happening, the characters, the setting, nothing at all had a chance against the wobbly foundation of discordant, badly mashed, cliched use of the English language. Conclusion: while I love swimming in books, and I won't say no to any new addition to my library, I'd certainly not recommend this to anyone. --------------------------------------------------------------------Post-Script: still - this series has obviously had some success, seeing as it's in 17th iteration.

I didn't love this (4/5), and the execution didn't always work terribly well (4/5), but, I'm going with 5 for Wray's sheer originality and ingenuity. Because what this book manages to do is somehow weave together questions about historical memory (i.e. how do we atone for the sins of our forbears? how are psychoses, beliefs, passions passed down through generations?), a challenge to Einstein's theory of relativity (!! synchronicity), a mind-bending structure that spirals inwards in time, a century's worth of events, and an intelligent, ingenious exploration of the ethics of science and of the nature of time. Above all, The Time Accidents is a story about time in all its dimensions: physical, experiential, historical, psychological, poetical, mathematical, etc. And who doesn't love/isn't intrigued/vexed/lost/beholden to/perplexed in/by time?!?! Time, the supposed 4th dimension, only moves in one direction (as we experience it). But, mathematically, if it is just another dimension, it should be traversable, like space (also, in physics, time is just another coordinate in the spacetime fabric). Physically, we're always in seemingly the same time. Yet time can pass slower or faster, depending on how we're feeling/what we are doing (same in physics, it turns out: the ""passing"" of time is related to an object's movement through space). If you think about time as coordinates (x,y,z,t), and take an object that is first located at coordinate A, and then at B, then time begins to look a lot like movement, the coordinate that describes motion. What does this even mean? I have no clear idea - it's virtually impossible, really, to capture time, though many have tried, in all disciplines. Then-what about dreams and memory? Memory can take us back in time. After all, isn't the world as we know it just our perception? And our memories are mental events, like anything else we process from experience. Is memory the ultimate time-travel? If so, what about historical memory? What about that which has been passed down through generations, what about concepts that have encrusted themselves with time that now seem ""given"", when in fact they are just artifacts of time and reenactment?The Time Accidents is one of those books that won't give you an answer (a definite plus from my perspective), but rather lead you in a journey of questions-not only those explicitly asked in the story, but also those the reader is inspired to imagine on their own. For me, this translated into a crazed book-buying binge about things like octopuses (they are radial creatures after all - how do they experience space, and thus time, since spacetime is one and the same). And, into furiously printing out a slew of articles about stuff like ""mathematical philosophy of time in Minkowskian space"" (I'm a math geek, as all math teachers should be). Your inspiration could take many other forms, depending on your interests - there's the Nazi question, the question about how science intersects with ethics, the question of familial guilt and psychosis, the question about the nature of dreams and memory, you name it, Wray's got you covered. The book is definitely an investment (of time, incidentally), a dense 500 pages. It's not perfect (for example, Wray's wittiness is at times self-conscious and somewhat awkward), but it's one of the most curiosity-inducing books I've ever read, and for that alone, I would HIGHLY recommend it!!...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 08, 2016","Feb 16, 2016","Feb 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25666067-the-lost-time-accidents

With missionary zeal, I left it around, poured over it in public, and otherwise found ways to practically shove it into people's faces. As I endlessly ranted about it to anyone who (pretended to?) listen, I met a surprising response: people actually cared, because most love the show! (I haven't seen it, but now I probably will).The Man in the High Castle is pure, unadulterated GENIUS. And that statement is not even based on the story itself, which as everyone knows is an alternate history of the world, had Axis Powers won WWII. Yes, the history portrayed is quite chilling and tremendously powerful as a tool for asking all sorts of Big Questions (i.e. ""how does individual responsibility manifest in the acts of nations""). These questions are fascinating, as is Dick's approach, which is not to answer, but to provide perspectives that may inform the reader's own further questioning.BUT, but, Dick's BRILLIANCE is much deeper than this transparent structure suggests (i.e. exploring Big Philosophical Questions in the context of an alternative history). Because, beneath this surface, The Man in the High Castle is really not an alternative history at all. Rather, it's a questioning of history: of historical memory, of interpretation, of personal appropriation, of collective perpetuation of certain ""truths"" that solidify as history.Huh? Yeah, that was my mood throughout much of this book. It's a bit like a Mobius Strip - and like the I-Ching (used as an oracle by many characters in The High Castle). The harder you try to grasp its meaning, the more likely you are to fail, because its meaning lies not in what can be explicitly said or perceived, but in a deeper, intuitive, embodied understanding. At first, it seems simple enough - ""what if Germany & Japan ruled the world""... Ok. Quite interesting. But then, there's a subtle yet seismic rift, and your perspective is jilted completely off its axis. Because people are reading this book, and in this book, the US and the Allies won the war. And everything about out world, today is described in this book... from the perspective of a world in which the Axis won the war. It's trippy. It's beyond weird. It's completely uncanny how true it could have been, or how ""true"" it could still become. This space-time-warping is insane enough in its physical/mathematical/metaphysical incarnations; add the historical dimension, and voila, a MASTERPIECE. (Note: this is not the only instance in which the reader is forced to shift perspective to a different dimension; merely, the first... and the ending is by FAR the BEST EVER insane mind-explosive of all time).History. Historicity. Truth. Reality. They converge, are the same, but are always subjective. They have no meaning outside of that which we create and bring forth into the world. Yet they are our world. Our world is created by us. Imaginally, not just concretely. We believe and live by tenets born in the throes of our ancestors' actions, and the relics, myths, stories we use to remind ourselves of our past. Meanwhile, we shape our own futures (generationally speaking as well as individually): collective consciousness becomes the future. We are all ultimately responsible. (Sidenote: PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO VOTE).There's so many twisting, n-th dimensional (n>3) ways in which Dick plays with these ideas in this work. There are characters with several identities. There are authentic (carrying ""historicity"") and fake American artifacts. There are at least two different timelines, possibly many realities. There is energy, yin and yang, and wu, and the like. Then, there is the Oracle, the I-Ching, which people use to determine the future, and the truth. There is a lot more, but I need some distancing and processing before finishing this . I needed to gush for a moment, but I'll be too dumbfounded to be fully coherent for a while, because this is such an incredible, supremely imaginative, vividly hallucinogenic, philosophically creative book!!!!!!!!!Recommended to: Everyone who enjoys thinking about things...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 04, 2016","Feb 08, 2016","Feb 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/216363.The_Man_in_the_High_Castle

Actually, it's not so much that - I'm pretty sure I would still hate a pulpy awfully written horror action-story about vampires destined for the screen, but that's not what I Am Legend is at all. So it would be more accurate to say that what's happened with my first Matheson novel is that I'm now compelled to consider that some books in this genre may impart meaningful messages, and that they're not all stereotyped characters, cliched formulas, mindless action and blood/sex.There are certainly ""vampires"" in this book (people infected with a bacteria), but that's not what I Am Legend is about: rather, it's a simple but profound story of isolation. How would you feel if you woke up one day and you were the only person left on Earth/as far as you could tell? How would the lack of human contact affect your mood, stability, purpose? What would it be like to never talk to another again, to never even hear your own voice? To not be able to share any of your burdens or joys? To wake up in a world of ""others"" (adapted vampires) and to realize, you are now the threat, the abnormality? Matheson doesn't philosophize much (not a complaint, my preference is for ""showing"" over ""telling"" in fiction), and he writes in a clear, direct, and simple voice. He's no literary scholar, but his prose also doesn't reek of the immature use of metaphors and sophomoric language frequently employed by today's ""best-selling"" pulp authors. If you're looking for an action-packed thriller, this isn't it. But if you are open to an introspective foray into some depressing existential questions, you will be pleasantly surprised....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 02, 2016","Feb 04, 2016","Feb 02, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14064.I_Am_Legend

Girl Through Glass was pre-ordered, and it's way off course from my usual hunting ground. In a way, I would describe it as an ""Oprah's book club"" type work (no offense intended, but emotional dramas are not my thing). And yet, despite the ease of translating this into a Lifetime Movie script (shudder, again, no offense, just not for un-romantic me), I was swept away by Wilson's lyricism, her profound observations, her wisdom, and of course, the passion and knowledge with which she described dancing.The most recent book I've read that reminds me of this one is Bel Canto (which I didn't like, but which was written in a similar style, and with similar passion, but from another artistic perspective: opera). Which makes me wonder how much of my absolute LOVE for this book comes from my love of everything dance. I was never a ""bunhead"" but I did dance/teach dance/was of that world in my younger days, and everything Wilson describes is spot-on (from the studio hierarchies in NYC to the diet of dancers to the feeling one has while immersed in the dance). Reading this I was back in my little world of my tweens-twenties, such a magical, creative, open, passionate place- a refreshing experience. I'm even more motivated now to get back to the studio - been starting up some modern dance classes this year, and now I may even go back ""home""- the barre, and ballet.But, even if you aren't passionate about dance, you might still love this book. It's beautifully written (I could barely believe this was a debut novel!), and it speaks with such depth and poignancy. Our heroine is the most developed character I've read in a while, and she is so wise. Also, the story addresses some pretty heavy issues ((view spoiler)[ such as rape, child abuse, anorexia, perpetuating abuse, adopted children in search of natural parents, etc (hide spoiler)]).I would recommend this to:* anyone who likes/reads dramas* anyone who loves dance...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 29, 2016","Feb 02, 2016","Jan 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25817032-girl-through-glass

The truth is, I probably only gaAll the while as I read this, I kept asking myself, ""what if I didn't know The Census Taker was written by Mieville?"" The truth is, I probably only gave the book a chance and left myself open to its ambiguity and sparsity because I'm madly in love with Mieville's mind. Within the context of having read some of his other work, this book makes sense and showcases another side of his obtuse brilliance; outside of that context, The Census Taker is so unclear that if this were a debut, I'd write it off and probably not give the author another thought.If you have not yet read Mieville yet, PLEASE start with something else - Bas-Lag, or The City & the City are epic.If you are already familiar with Mieville, you know he can put on many hats and write truly penetrating, profound stories that defy genres and that invite the reader on wild head-trips. This book falls into Mieville's cannon because it is so different- from other books but also from his own prior work, and it is Mieville's ethos after all to continually explore new realms.The Census Taker is basically a fairy-tale, a skeletal outline of happenings that, in their unfolding, reveal/mirror/convey a deeper, existential theme (in this case, the tension stemming from the the desire of humankind to know absolutely--in an ungraspable, infinite, chaotic world).Synopsis: A man is locked in a guarded tower, where he is observed as he counts, systematizes, and logs information (no, of course we have no idea why he's jailed and what he's counting exactly, remember this is Mieville). He's also writing a story about his childhood; he remembers his mother and father, who used to kill things (animals, then people, then most likely his own wife) and throw them down a bottomless cavernous hole in the mountain. The child appeals to the people in the village for help, but they can do nothing without proof, and the father claims his wife just left him of her own accord. Later, a census-taker comes to town, interviews the boy, goes down the hole using climbing equipment (don't expect Mieville to tell you what he sees there) and takes the boy away from his father to be his apprentice in counting things.What It All Means: The world is uncertain, ambiguous, mysterious, at times unexplainable; to conquer this state of uncertainty, we strive endlessly to catalogue, systematize, and sort information, to grasp the world's essence by quantifying that which we encounter. Still, we cannot hope to realize that which we have come to idealize as ""truth"" - there are only questions, and inferences to be drawn from that which can be observed. There is no Absolute Answer.The Census-Taker, as all of Mieville's work, embodies this thesis; M. does not insult his readers by ""telling"" (in fact some will probably be frustrated at how little he does explain). Rather, the ambiguity comes through in the ways in which M's world is familiar, but not quite right/as we know it, in the ways in which he sketches people's actions without analyzing motives, in the language he uses to give his characters voices.Overall: NOT recommended for non-Mieville fans. Or, only recommended after you've tried something else by him- unless you are already a highly open individual who isn't daunted by a lack of coherence/explication and by a leisurely, fazed pace....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 27, 2016","Jan 29, 2016","Jan 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489159-this-census-taker

So, although I realize based on other s that this is considered ""classic urban fiction"", for me, it was quite bizarre and different (a good thing). Moonheart has its flaws, and it probably won't appeal to many, but I give it a 4 for the intersection of (1) weird/made me think (2) well-written, if not ""literary"" (3) Native American/Celtic lore (4) Tamson House.The story weaves between real-world Ottawa and ""the Otherworld"", a land of myths in which legendary creatures and powers manifest. The cast of characters is lively, but not terribly well-developed. There is a battle (between good and evil of course), and there is much to learn about mysticism/the Way/tao/Native American & Celtic stories/inner silence/the like. Some of that is pretty hoakey (a la magic mushrooms & Timothy Leary), some probably horribly distorts Native American rituals (I, sadly, do not know enough to say - one thing is clear, though, that de Lint is absolutely smitten with Native American cultures, so if he misrepresents anything, it's done out of sincere admiration. Not that this excuses his work completely, but at least it's no Heidegger writing about Jews). Finally, perhaps my favorite aspect of this story, is the centrality of Tamson House, a magical and mysterious haven and character in Moonheart. I'm obsessed with ... dwellings, and I often daydream (and night-dream) about impossible, sprawling, crazy houses. So based on Tamson House alone, I'd rate this book as a 4/5 (I am not to be trusted).Not highly recommended, but definitely highly enjoyed....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 25, 2016","Jan 27, 2016","Jan 25, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/618174.Moonheart

So much gushing to do, but let's begin here: I hated  The Martian, and I formed an impression then that perhaps I just didn't like ""hard sci-fi"", as that supposed novel was described. But turns out, it's not hard sci-fi that I detest, it's people conveying the purpose of science as the struggle to engineer clever solutions. Compared to the brittleness of the theoretically deprived The Martian, The Three-Body Problem is platinum strength hardcore sci-fi, grounded firmly not only in the newest physics (from quantum to strings to particle theory), but in the philosophical foundations underlying the science (how is science like faith? how do ethics enter the world of scientific research, and where do these fields intersect? how is theory supported by experimentation? and on and on! If you've got a question about physics or the social, cultural, religious, political intersections of science and society, Cixin's got you covered). Some of his imagery is a bit... preposterous (i.e. a proton unfolded in two dimensions enveloping a planet), but technically not incorrect (it could be unfolded, theoretically, true, but I doubt we'd see it even if it were technologically possible). There's a lot more to love: Cixin presents significant amounts of historical detail into the Cultural Revolution, the pace of his story is impeccable, his characters are all too recognizably human (even as we may grow to detest them or to abhor their choices), and to top it all off, the novel's structure lends it a quite trippy vibe (there's people in a video game that isn't quite what it seems, there's world-wide conspiracies, secret messages being sent between worlds, chaotic-theory manifesting in strange ways, etc).I wouldn't say The Three-Body Problem is perfect - the translation was quite choppy (I would imagine Chinese is extremely challenging to translate to English - and I'm not sure we'd be better off with a translation that's more eloquent in English but that corresponds less with the Chinese). Some questions are not considered at all (for example, if we found ET lifeforms, the chances that they'd be like us would be incredibly small). The characters are not terribly developed.

This is the most misogynistic piece of crap I've ever read in my life, and I am left trembling mad, seriously horrified, utterly disgusted, and 100% turned off to whatever else Pynchon tried to do in this novel.  On a spectrum of dis/respecting women, here's where Pynchon lies (or at least, this particular work of his):  [image]How do I even begin? There's too much to cover, but let's start with the clueless, idiotic woman, Oedipa, wandering aimlessly through a man's world. (There are no other named women in this book; the handful of instances other women appear can be counted on one hand; and they are always ""the anonymous girl in a subservient position"", like the admin assistant). ""Somehow, Oedipa got lost. One minute, she was gazing at a mockup of a space capsule, safely surrounded by old, somnolent men; the next, alone in a great, fluorescent murmur of office activity. As far as she could see in every direction it was white or pastel: men's shirts, papers, drawing boards. All she could think of was to put on her shades for all this light, and to wait for somebody to rescue her"" (p. 66 in the Harper Perennial 2006 edition)Oedipa is an insecure, ""easy"" (his word, not mine) woman who is constantly looking for affirmation from men. She uses her sex to her advantage (""she rested her shades on her nose and batted her eyelashes, figuring to coquette her way"" [into something], p. 69). She can be ""tricked"" into having sex with men (p. 30). She is a woman who ""has no apparatus except gut fear and female cunning... she may fall back on superstition, or take up a useful hobby like embroidery, or go mad, or marry a disk jokey"" (p. 12). She is accused of acting like a ""lib, overeducated broad with the soft heads and bleeding hearts"" (p. 59).Worse, men are not to be held accountable for their violation of women. When Oedipa sits down between two men at a meeting, for example, their hands, ""alternately (as if their owners were asleep and the moled, freckled hands out roaming dream-scapes) kept falling onto her thighs (p. 65, because, you know, men's hands just do that sometimes).... Oh yeah, and that guy who ""tricked"" Oedipa into sex? Well, it's ok because she liked it and wants to keep doing it, just as she wants to continue relying on his support on her quest.Who is Pynchon kidding? Satire, MY ASS. You DON'T get to satire women into submissive, subservient roles of clueless, insecure, emotional messes who stumble through life while being used and molested by men.  I mean, you can, but don't expect this woman to take you seriously on any other matter. I was so aghast at what I was reading that I did a bit of research into Pynchon's life and it seems he was not a rabid right-winger (he's a postmodernist, after all!). Also, he wrote this in the 60s - for God's sake, the second wave of feminism was well underway! The Second Sex for example, appeared in 1949. Plus: only the entire raison d'etre of the post-modern, deconstructionist movement was to call into question ingrained layers of social constructs that we take for granted, but that are indeed, not inherent in our ""nature"", but just a product of how we've come to think about things given our historical past and its promulgation. So, Pynchon gets NO FREE PASS for the ""age"" he was writing in (+ misogyny doesn't ever get a pass from me, not even given historical context; sexism, well, that almost can't be avoided when going some time back).As a last point that may go in Pynchon's favor someday, if I ever reconsider his work, is that, despite the ways in which he portrays Oedipa, she is the main character, possibly ""heroine"" of this novel, and this is a satire. At this moment, however, I can not see how Pyncheon's misogyny can be excused as satire alone, because it's clear he wasn't truly conscious of his treatment of women as a whole in writing The Crying of Lot 49. // end rant Science/Thermo & Math/Information TheoryThe Crying of Lot 49 attempts a metaphorical deconstruction of the concept of dis/order, brought into focus through its mathematical and thermodynamic-science incarnations. Some preliminary discussions:Science: Most of us probably remember at least the term ""entropy"" from high-school physics - basically thermodynamic laws dictate that the entropy of a physical system increases over time (i.e. disorder increases. For example, if you put a bunch of multi-colored balls in a box, they tend to get mixed up over time; they do not tend to sort themselves by color. Maxwell, Plank et all ran experiments like this but on particles). Math: In info theory (which is distinct from physics because it refers to a purely abstract field of ""information""), another measure of entropy is defined, and it turns out its mathematical equation is virtually the same as that used by physicists (who would have thought, the concepts we come up to mathematically describe abstract situations are based on our real world experiences?). Theoretically information entropy measures the probability that we can predict the outcome. And, the more we know, it turns out, the less we can predict the outcome, because there's so many more possibilities to take into consideration (""The more you know, the more you realize you don't know"" type of thing).Maxwell's Demon is a supposed paradox about how a decrease in entropy/disorder could occur (no paradoxes exist in science or math; all is clear once one has adequate insight and knowledge). Theoretically, the thought experiment goes, we could have an invisible demon sitting there opening and closing a flap and thus magically guiding all red balls to one side of the box, and all blue balls to the other. In this case, disorder would decrease. Supposedly. Of course, it's quite easy to refute this paradox the moment you realize that the demon could not possibly exist as described, because a pure information decider would need to be embodied in some physical way. The moment you MAKE this demon out of physical materials, the moment this demon becomes incarnate, it's clear that the demon is part of the system and thus, while the disorder of the BOX might decrease, the laws of entropy are NOT violated by the NET system, including the demon.---I credit Pynchon for creatively satirizing this futile quest for ultimate Order/Truth. The ethos of modernity has been the search for Order/Absolute Truth - only, we have realized, in all fields, that the more we know, and the more we try to organize things, the more they slip out from under out control as net systems becomes increasingly chaotic. Just look at particle physics - in seeking to describe the ultimate nature of reality, physicists cooked up a veritable ""zoo"" of particles (their word, not mine), ever more ridiculous in its complexity (so much for the ""Grand Unified Theory"", which I consider a theoretically impossible quest, because of the laws of entropy). There's a lot to be examined here, but it's been done already (many other times, too but that's a good place to start), and I'm not in the mood to be kind. Perhaps I will update someday (the probability decreasing over time, of course, consistent with the laws of entropy)....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jan 06, 2016","Jan 11, 2016","Jan 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2794.The_Crying_of_Lot_49

(1) Privilege & History: I am highly indebted to Annalisa's  for pointing out this glaring deficiency. Bel Canto is really a book about opera/music/love of art and the power of art to sustain us through crisis. But there's a real story here, too. The story of a 1996 hostage attack on the home of the Japanese ambassador to Peru, and subsequent events (please read Annalisa's !). And the fact that Patchett not only excludes all politics from her telling, but also does not deem it necessary to bring attention to the historical context for her work and to the plight of the real-world people she describes, even in the epilogue or in ""author notes"", is, imho, dangerous for its omissions. This is a story of terrorism as can only be told by a privileged person who has never known oppression as experienced by those who truly suffer, and in remaking their story into a ode to opera, Patchett not only silences their voices, but minimizes their plight and in effect, colonizes the collective memory of the historical event.(2) Racism & Sexism: present themselves frequently throughout the pages of Bel Canto. There is the ""unnamed country"", of course, and the ""noble-savage"" tropes used in much older literature. It's a story we've encountered too many times before: savages from the mountain, fawning over soap and linen, with powerful white men aghast at having to cook their own dinners. Then there is the constant fawning over the Opera singer, who sustains the group through her heavenly singing, and who sends everyone into paroxysms of delight. Those are but two examples, there are plenty more instances of thinly veiled racist/sexist stereotyping.(3) Meandering Ode to Opera: This was probably one of the most boring books I've ever read, and one of the few I stayed up to finish in a day or so because I just couldn't wait for it to be over, to move on to the next thing. There's no reason for us to care about any of the hostages or terrorists, because we don't know them before the story starts; and while their stories unfold with the crisis, since there is no grander arc than ""look at this person, he has a history, a brother or mother whom he loves, he is a good person"", these interludes and backgrounds provide little satisfaction or enticement to continue reading. Too many times I wanted to just stop wasting my time and shelf this as ""unfinished"", but I plodded on for one reason alone: despite how turned off I was in every respect, I will allow that Patchett is a skilled writer, so I felt I owed this book at least a skim-through to the end (this is also the reason for the additional star above 1).There's a bunch of other reasons I didn't enjoy this, but I've already wasted too much time trying to finish both reading and writing any kind of , so I'll leave with this: (4) Implausibility: there's simply no reason to believe a true hostage scenario would unfold as Patchett describes. She certainly has no experience in the matter, and much of what occurs reads like a romanticized version of what an art/opera afficionado may dream into being - that, in the end, when faced with death, wo/mankind would choose art, and be saved by art, and realize that the only thing that matters is art and love. While I myself would love to believe this, I am not naive; if anything, this perspective only serves to underline Patchett's privilege, and the ways in which it blinds her to the realities of suffering as it actually occurs in the ""real"", historical world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 05, 2016","Jan 06, 2016","Jan 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2451840.Bel_Canto

Incidentally I just finished Cloud Atlas, a beautifully written if contrived exploration of what our world would look like under corporatist nationhood. Quite apropos the Amazon takeover of GR and the subsequent deletions and other acts of censorship, for I imagine a first step towards our (d)evolution would be the limiting of speech.I'm a bit embarrassed to have been a GR user since 2008 while remaining in complete isolation re: the Takeover and the morphing of GR into more or less just another marketplace. I knew about the buy-out of course (I do keep a google news tab open 247), and I wasn't terribly comfortable with the idea of Amazon owning all my GR data (I had migrated my ratings here several years before), but I remained complacent (I thought to myself I'd rather see book-ads than viagra or loan-consolidation ads, plus I use a pop-up blocker). The other side of the explanation is that I just never used GR how it's meant to be used (as I now understand it) - engaging in conversations, getting to know other readers, and otherwise participating in the building of a community. I'm that person born on the cusp of the ""tech"" revolution (1980) who can still remember what it's like to have my dial-in-connection disconnected by my mother picking up the landline in order to make a call. I wax wistfully about the times when we weren't always at the beck and call of others (ie. no cell phones - the times when, if you didn't pick up, you weren't home, and that was that). I know many users born around or before that time have adapted masterfully to social media, cell phones, and the like, but I hadn't - I used GR simply to log and rate the books I read, and connected with my real-live friends (few of whom read regularly). I stuck with classics I'd be sure to love, academic books, and the like, and didn't read breaking new work (unless it was by a vetted previously well-known author, ie a translation into English of Nobel Laureate Jose Saramago). Thus, I saw no status updates; I knew no people whose s were deleted; and I didn't encounter the allegedly subversive s, as I wasn't reading anything remotely controversial (no YA or self-published authors for me back then). I thus continued reading peacefully in my tiny GR bubble for years.Then, within the last half of 2015, I got over FB (I always knew it wasn't good for me, but life is like that and sometimes what's noxious is also most habit-forming), and found myself transferring all my social-media time to GR. Books had always been a solitary undertaking for me, especially as I've not know many in ""real life"" who are as avid as readers -- but this is around the time when I realized it doesn't have to be that way. Again, a bit late to the party, but I have some good years ahead so the realization is welcome-better late than never as they say.This is how, in slowly starting to expand my GR circle, I came across Off-Topic. What can I say that hasn't been said? Yes, it's just as Orwell, Huxley, Bradbury, Atwood, et all predicted. Censorship and panopticist observation are amongst the first steps in the construction of a totalitarian state (see Foucault). What heartened me, in the end, were the words of my fellow GoodReaders. From the perversely ironic to the fall-of-your-chair-hilarity to the well-supported academic posts, s and essays constituting Off-Topic, I am inspired by the community's collective action as well as by each individual in their acts of resistance.

The Eyre Affair falThere are perfectly nice people who are just not my people, and there are perfectly nice books that are just not my kind of books. The Eyre Affair falls into this latter category, though I tried, I really did. My efforts paid some dividends, for up until a year or so ago, I would either have rated this at 0/5 or I just would have never bothered to finish.First, I must get this out of the way, or I won't recall any of my positive thoughts about Fforde's work- this book is emphatically not science-fiction. Now, this is more a critique of the critics and organizers of shelves and tags, who frequently categorize The Eyre Affair as such. It's also a critique of The Wall Street Journal, which describes it as a blend of ""Monty Python, Harry Potter, Stephen Hawking, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer""... I highly doubt Hawking would agree with this statement if he came across it. In fact, I'm pretty certain he would shake his head in exasperation of what some lay-people take away from his work, for the ""science"" in The Eyre Affair is pure fantasy. There is actually NO ""science"" per se here at all. Yes, there are black holes and there is travel to alternative realities, but these are described in ways that are completely at odds with the laws of physics and would never in the history of the universe occur as drawn out by Fforde (i.e. time travel through a black hole, which one can enter without disintegrating).But, these are not points against Fforde - his work can be enjoyed as fantasy, and as far as I have gathered, he hasn't been going around claiming Hawking applauds his work as the best of science-fiction. So, let me try next to turn to that which I did enjoy, or at least that which I can appreciate. The Eyre Affair is well conceived, and I did love the idea of a world in which nothing is more important than books. It's fair to say, I'd visit Fforde's world in a heart-beat, for it's like a big orgiastic nirvana for book-lovers. In this version of England, we can jump into books, we can re-write endings, we have the entire city-state dedicated to the preservation of manuscripts and in general, of art, and our political conflicts are primarily over who wrote Midsummer's Dream and the like. I also appreciated learning quite a lot about classic British literature and its history (i.e. who was the genius behind Shakespeare)- I mostly felt that I was reading a big ""wink-wink""-inside-joke written for English-lit majors. Fforde doesn't explain much, but he brings up a lot, and if one is interested, information is only the click of a mouse away.Ultimately, what grated on my being more than even bad writing can, is the 100%-carefree attitude of both Fforde as human being, as well as of the worlds he portrays (and, by necessity, of his characters). Ok, maybe I should lighten up. So actually I know I have to lighten up. My idea of humor is Bulgakov's brilliantly twisted portrayal of the eastern-block-communist schizophrenic psyche, I don't do big retailers re: labor abuses & I boycott Chick-Fil-A even though I looove their chicken wraps because they sponsor hate-legislation against the LGBTQ community so, yeah, I know. Chalk it to ultimate existential incompatibility: Fforde and I are not even close to the same page.Pure lack of seriousness, however, outside of being a personal no-no, manifests as an artistic problem as well. When there is absolutely no seriousness, there is also no urgency, no stake, no propulsion. Eyre suffers severely in this regard. Some examples: Consider that at one point in the novel our heroine's aunt and uncle are kidnapped by a supremely evil man. What does Next do in the subsequent chapter? Go out on a date! And muse about lost loves and her non-existent love-life. Wha..? How are we supposed to take any of the characters seriously as people if they behave in such ways? Another illustration: the plot moves along due to contrivances alone. There is nothing propelling it forward other than the chase for The Evil Villain (& Fforde does not even pretend TEV is anything other than a caricature). And so much more. Basically, this is what I felt like I was reading: ""la la la [inside English-lit joke] tra-la-la [witty English-lit comment] *skipping along joyously* [wink, wink, Eyre-lovers], .... etc ad infinitum.""(I know, I know, I need to seriously chill.

Popa ne ia la o plimbare autentică prin sufletul unui copil de 10 ani în timpul primei generații de comunism. Scrie întradevar cu o voce absolut credibilă- protagonista este naivă si egoistă, dar inocentă și în sfârșit e clar că centrarea pe sine e o funcție de vârsta și nu de alte defecte.M-a interesat de asemenea să remarc diferența între copilaria din anii comuniști de la început, comparat cu anii '80 (cu care am experiență personală) - când nu te mai mirai aproape de nimic, sau cel puțin nu spuneai, și când și ca copii, știam să nu vorbim prea mult, să nu facem așa mare chestie de tabăra de vară sau alte prostii pe care le doream, știam că viața e mult mai grea decât fleacurile noastre (cel puțin așa a fost în familia mea - daca părinții spuneau că nu aveam bani, nu aveam bani și gata, nu era nici o vorba sa le dau în cap pâna spuneau că pot să mă duc). Dar astea nu sunt decât doua experiențe, sigur nu reprezintă situația complet.În sfârșit, mi-a fost destul de greu să termin, pentru că povestea mi s-a părut incredibil de plictisitoare. Ar fi trebuit numită ""Amintiri din copilaria comunistă după razboi"" sau așa ceva - povestea e constituita de câteva episoade banale de viața cotidiană - dusul la școala, la cumpărat borș, jucatul în curte cu prietenii - sigur, tot povestit intr-o voce autentică, și frumos, dar... nimic nu se întamplă, absolut de loc! Nu există nici un fel de tensiune literară, sau personală, nici un conflict nu este explorat.

As it stands,Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more were I to have read it at a time farther removed from Gaiman's Ocean at the End of the Lane. As it stands, I can't help drawing the obvious comparisons between these two offerings as differing takes on the fantastical imagination of children and the ways in which young ones seek escape and therapy in books/stories/fantasy. The major difference: this is a children's book, while Gaiman's is a magical rendering that is relevant at any age, and should probably be read periodically, for the lessons learned and insights drawn there are a function of time, age, experience, and memory.As a children's story, this book is pretty awesome. If/when I have a child, I would certainly encourage them to read this. Also, if I ever happen to run into a 6-17 year old who has lost a parent, whose parents have divorced, who is coping with jealousy from a younger sibling, or step sibling, etc - I will highly recommend they pick up The Book of Lost Things. But, as an adult, I can't say I found much edification here - it was an enjoyable few hours worth of escape, certainly, it wasn't badly written, but it's not like I drew some profound implications about my existential condition from reading this or anything. My rating is based mostly on my appreciation for Connolly's work as good for children/young adults, especially those going through a difficult time... as an adult, not only did I not find it compelling, but I also had the following issues:* The idea behind the novel is plagiarized straight out of The Neverending Story* I keep looking for books for adults that bring fairy tales to life in a relevant, cohesive, and seamless story-line, and it looks like I'll have to keep reading. Connolly's boy-in-a-story and fairy-tale-rehashings are not at all original, and at times, they seem quite artificial (i.e. boy is lost in a world of his own imagination, boy meets random characters out of fairy-tales, who then proceed to tell their own fairy-tales: there's nothing ...organic about how the stories fit together, it's more like a series of vignettes)* The 7 dwarfs are communists in Connolly's take. It's the strangest thing, here's this children's book and randomly, there's 7 communist dwarfs who rant about the oppression of the worker, the means of production, and the evils of capitalism. Um? K. It seemed like an ugly, unnecessary spoof. I'm no Marxist, but the man was right about one thing, and that's the oppression of the worker in a non-regulated market ""trickle down"" economy. This is not a political  so I won't say anymore, except that I was not happy with the mocking of workers' plight.* The whole ""young boy growing up into manhood by picking up a sword and learning how to fight"" plays too well into a misogynistic, alpha-masculine obsessed cultural narrative. The aspect of the main character's maleness was overemphasized to the extent that I wondered, how would I have read this as a young girl? I'm sure there's some way Connolly could have told the story to make it more relevant to both young girls and boys....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 19, 2015","Dec 20, 2015","Dec 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/69136.The_Book_of_Lost_Things

In this case, The Blizzard is the first that I've ever not appreciated/felt/enjoyed a Russian author. Russian (and Romanian, obviously, and in general Eastern European) literature molds, reflects, illuminates, and inspires my soul, because it is born in a unique landscape that was also my childhood, my source of personal myths and ways of looking at things. This nostalgia for childhood is nothing special; in my case, reading Russian/Eastern European lit is just how I ""go back"". So usually, I love it all (sticking to the Russians for now) - from Solzhenitsyn's systematic and descriptive analytics, to Dostoevsky's masterful psychoanalyses, to Bulgakov's absurd whimsical surrealism, to Petrushevskaya's heart-wrenching portraits of humanity in pain, to Tolstoy's romanticism. Within all this variety, there is a certain.. Russian-ness/Eastern European-ness spirit imbuing all these works. Which is what The Blizzard seemed, for me, to be missing, and which is why it didn't quite facilitate my ""going back"" - despite Sorokin's heavy use of Russian motifs such as the furious snowstorm, the vodka, the brilliant whimsy, etc.As I questioned my reaction, it didn't take me long to realize the essential ingredient that I value above all others, and that threads all the aforementioned works: the humor. You will not meet anyone more dead-pan than an Eastern-European, especially not one born in ""that era"". Some of us are basically living dead-pan, you really can't take anything we say seriously because we don't, ourselves (and yet, somehow, we are often taken most seriously of all). It's a bit like Communist Zen: one learns to detach and to view the whole fiasco from a distance. At which point, of course, it all looks absurd, and it's clear that nothing is ""real"". In The Blizzard, Sorokin seems to attempt this effect through cosmetics: introducing, for example, a quite bizarre world of tiny horses (the size of a partridge) and humongous men (the size of a three-story house). Still, these insertions of the absurd did not serve any purpose, did not give any broader meaning to the narrative, did not convey any particular mood, nor did they inspire contemplation. I'm not sure how to articulate properly at this point (more reflection needed)-for now: I felt I was reading an ""ideas-soup"" of ingredients picked up from ""The Greats"" that did not quite work out because the broth used fell apart/separated/otherwise ruined everything. But, perhaps I am wrong. I am very conflicted. Perhaps I misunderstood the whole thing. I should like, or probably more like love, Sorokin, if precedent is to be trusted.

I've followed the series since #1, and continue to be enchanted by Starr's depiction of ""real life"" during this historical period. There's so much to learn: from the daily diet of people (loaves, pottage, sometimes cheese or ""capon""-chicken) to medieval medicine (lettuce seeds as soporific, surgery as a ""lower trade"" than medicine, to be practiced by anyone with a knife), to the politics of local land ownership (lords could mete out punishment for non-capital offences; the difference between villeins and tenants, etc).The actual mystery in this installment is ok, just like the others, but it's not the reason to read these books. I see these rather as a chance to unwind and take a relaxing stroll through life in the medieval 14th century countryside. The story moves at a leisurely pace, as Starr describes every detail of the main character's (a surgeon and bailiff) life from morning to night. Aided by a bit of imagination, this series inspires a true awe and appreciation for a life far ""simpler"" and much more difficult than ours: imagine a time when nails are a luxury, when instead of loading up on gas, you pull up to a babbling brook to energize your palfrey, when most people spend the entirety of their lives moving about an area the size of a small modern neighborhood, and eat the same thing (pease pottage, mostly) day in and day out. Another aspect of this series that I love is that Starr uses medieval-ized English - it's not quite 14th century English, I'm sure that would be almost incomprehensible to the modern ""lay"" reader, it's modern English with a medieval... twang. (I would have no way of knowing if it's accurately representative of the times, as I am no medieval/English scholar, but it sounds plausible).Overall, loved the respite, and I look forward to Starr's next round, Lucifer's Harvest....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 16, 2015","Dec 19, 2015","Dec 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26175694-ashes-to-ashes

Also, I was a bit surprised, when, towards the end, I reached a chapter on ""The Way"" (the tao), because the rest of the book to that point had been clearly Buddhist in take, and from my readings of other mindfulness books as well as the Tao Te Ching, and from my understanding of history, these two traditions are quite distinct and do not always converge. It seemed like Singer was ""talking down"" to ""westerners"" unfamiliar with these ideas by concocting his own special ""eastern-vibe soup"" (with a sprinkling of Jesus as topping - there's some of that, too, in the last chapter). Finally, while I can agree that there are many ways in which mindfulness may help us live fuller lives, there are elements of Buddhist philosophy that just simply do not apply to modern life in the US. For example, Buddhist philosophy teaches the separation of mind and body- an enlightened soul is one who does not think or process information, but one that lets the world and experience pass through her/him in as the mind is released from ""worry"" or ""thoughts about"" things or ""stress"". YES, it's desirable to face problems and not to practice avoidance; YES it's useful to learn to face life with equanimity in the face of struggle; but NO, I absolutely do not think it's healthy to always be placid and ""in the moment"", just as it's not healthy to always be ""thinking about"" and not truly experiencing. In one chapter, Singer talks about a pendulum and extremes, and how we are most at peace, and we should strive for, the position in the center, when the pendulum ceases to swing. (1) Such peacefulness seems to me to be entire dearth of life (there is no more movement!) AND (2) Singer's position to simply BE while not worrying ever is just the other extreme, not a center.Overall, not a book I'd recommend to others, especially not those unfamiliar with Buddhism/mindfulness, but, if I could go back in time, I'd read it again - it certainly wasn't time wasted....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Dec 13, 2015","Dec 13, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1963638.The_Untethered_Soul

(*Irving when he was still brilliant, a la Owen Meany & Garp, not today's Irving of Widow lameness)But - not my favorite Gaiman by far. Having only recently climbed the Gaiman wagon, I'm glad in retrospect I began with Neverwhere, which is basically the most brilliant exploration of the question ""Is this all there is?"" that I've ever read manifested as fiction. And that I continued my journey with The Ocean at the End of the Lane, yet another mindblowing take on the illusory quality of adulthood, the clarity of childhood, the truth of age/memory/time. Next to these two works American Gods seems almost... ordinary. Well, perhaps not quite ordinary (this is Gaiman, after all, and he's still just as brilliant as always) - but definitely less creative, less magical. And it's because the satirical take on some aspect of modern society (and religion to boot- how cliche) - has been done, again and again. What Gaiman did best (and most uniquely imho) in the previously mentioned works is he didn't dwell on sociological/anthropological analyses of social problems, but dived deep into the psyche of his characters in a way that illuminated aspects of humanity and our experience of lived life.American Gods, in other words, tells the story from the point of view of ""the gods"": top down, in which each individual serves her purpose, acts and reacts in/to history and thus makes tiny dents in the fabric of the totality of reality. Neverwhere, on the other hand, was a view from the cage of the restless, seeking ego: a perspective I think that is much harder to capture, and that few authors do well (and those who do, don't usually write in this genre, not even close. Think Mario Vargas Llosa or Toni Morrison).All that said, the writing and setting are still ""classic"" Gaiman: a world of boundless possibilities mingling seamlessly with our own & the storytelling of a master folklorist.

Bravo, Valancourt Books!In order to convey the oddness and off-the-beaten-path nature of this work, it's necessary to explain why I even have it in my possession. I mean, it only has 12 ratings and 2 total s on Goodreads - not something I'd usually consider picking up. So, it all started with taking a chance on an Amazon recommendation of a ""rediscovered classic"" - The Elementals by Michael McDowell, and being intrigued by the actual edition I received - a new Valancourt run (it was such a beautiful book - one of those you love to hold in your hands and smell and just play with between your fingers as you read, and, of course, a good but totally strange story). Now, I'm a book snob, and the publishing house matters. But that doesn't mean I discount those I've never heard of - I just had to do a bit of research into Valancourt. I found myself impressed by their mission to hunt down and republish literary horror/sci-fi/fantasy works that have sadly been lost to time, and like I said, I loved the care and quality of the physical book. I even contacted them directly to buy some books up for sale on their website--they got back to me right away and were very nice and professional.So Nothing but the Night was delivered to my doorstep a few days later, along with a bunch of other McDowells. And, whoa, is it ODD. And I don't mean just the plot. The plot is strange, sure, and includes bit of quaint, outdated sci-fi, but it's more than that: it's the entire atmosphere and language, which seems to convey a ... Lynchian off-ness. I'm a bit at a loss for how to qualify this strangeness, other than drawing the analogy that this book is to mainstream horror what Twin Peaks is to mainstream detective shows.A summary won't really do the book justice, and a true summary would give too much away, but in short: there's a little girl in a hospital with puzzling symptoms, connected to a fellowship of rich philanthropists who run a home for abandoned children. Some of these rich people die in suspicious accidents. The little girl's mother, a triple murderer released from prison, visits her daughter in the hospital, and the attendant physician is later found with a hat-pin through his skull. The investigation takes off, and the resolution isn't at all what you may imagine.Absolutely recommend it if you're craving a chilling, gritty, dark, suspenseful ""what the heck did I just read"" type of book....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 10, 2015","Dec 12, 2015","Dec 10, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17655887-nothing-but-the-night

It can happen, and it can happen everywhere. ~ Primo LeviHow do you ""rate"" a book about genocide? On the merits of the reporting? On its ""balanced"" or ""just"" interpretation of history? On its tone or political slant? On the first-hand accounts presented? On your personal horror at both reading about what happened, and at probing the limits of your own ignorance? (How did I not know this?!)The 5 stars is first and foremost a Thank You to Gourevitch for writing such a well-documented, historically detailed, passionate account of the Rwandan genocide. After reading We Wish to Inform You, I am more than ashamed that I knew very little of the tragedies Rwandans suffered during the 1990s (and beyond, past and present). This book provides an excellent history, and contextualizes events enough to allow even those very poorly educated in the matters of African colonization like myself to grasp some kind of understanding (or informed incomprehension).I also appreciated hearing the voices of the Rwandans Gourevitch interviewed as part of his research and reporting. Both factions - Tutsis and Hutus - are represented, though the voices of the Tutsis are what shapes the narrative. These voices do not quite constitute an oral history, but offer the same effect: a nuanced and humanized perspective that is much more insightful into the human condition, imho, than traditional histories, which are fascinating of course, but which tend towards the abstract.I am not quite sure how to rate other aspects of the work, but I also figure, any flaws are minor compared to the overall appraisal, which is that I think everyone should read this book, because as humans, we should not be ignorant of such potentialities in our own natures. Usually when reading history, I am more critical (or at least, I try to be!) - but in this case, there is a dearth of written material on the subject, and general public awareness is also limited, if it exists at all. Also, the ""flaws"" I refer to may not even be flaws - one, for example, is that Gourevitch editorializes at times and does not always stick to the more detached journalistic voice. But... in this case - how can I blame him? Gourevitch is not a historian (plus historians editorialize all the time, if history is interpretation). And, as a child of Holocaust survivors, he is understandably passionately empathetic with the Tutsi's case (as probably we should all be, as human children).Content-wise, I would not do the work any justice if I attempted any kind of brief summary. But I will say this: one aspect that sadly did not surprise me, yet still angered me to tears, was the ""West's"" complicity in both turning a blind-eye to the Tutsi's plight, and in fomenting conflict in the region to begin with in the process of colonization and subsequent support for dictatorial puppets.

I am a bit obsessed with politics, and I compulsively follow the most local of stories (well, I’m in DC so local politics here is always fascinating, intersecting as it often does with national politics, and frequently mired in corruption scandals).This book may be particularly enjoyable for those who like to stay up to date on news from their city council, who don’t skip the articles in their local paper on topics like building codes and telecom monopolies, who turn on CSPAN during the morning commute. But, even if you’re not into that kind of thing, The Water Knife is not boring or dry, and may be enjoyed simply as a quite original dystopic sci-fi (the best I've read in a long time).Not only is (most) of The Water Knife a complex, well-paced political thriller, but Bacigalupi also writes his characters so insightfully, with such compassion. The story follows three main actors: a Pulitzer-winning journalist, an ex-con who does the dirty work of a ruthless politician, and a poor young Mexican immigrant who sells her body to pay rent to her slum-lord. All such vastly divergent characters, and yet we are brought into their lives so completely, we can identify with them fully, and understand their decisions and actions even when we may not see ourselves (re)acting in similar ways.The world itself is believable and consistent – but how we get there is not well articulated. For example, Bacigalupi does a wonderful job depicting how people act in extreme shortage situations. BUT, I simply did not see enough evidence to believe it a plausible situation that Nevadans would shoot Texan refugees on sight if they were caught crossing the border… (Warning: there’s quite a bit of Texas trashing in this book, and Cali is like the James Moriarty of this world). I mean, maybe this would happen if we really ran out of water, but I didn’t feel the point well-developed enough to convince me.The first 2/3 of The Water Knife was SO good, so much so that I was going to enthusiastically rate this at 5/5 stars…. but then I read the last 1/3. Which I could barely believe was written by the same author.UGH. For the last third or so of this book, the subtlety of the water politics so brilliantly detailed previously gives way to obscene violence, action, and sex. It’s like, all of a sudden the book turns into a James Bond extravaganza, and complexity gives way to inanity and crudity. And what makes this all the worst is that the shift towards an “action packed thriller” was just not necessary for the development of the plot and for bringing about a satisfying resolution. So why, why, why did Baciagalupi have to cheapen The Water Knife so? ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 05, 2015","Dec 09, 2015","Dec 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23209924-the-water-knife

Alas, it turned ouThis book sounds/looks amazing, and I was so excited to finally get around to it (it's been sitting on my shelves for a few years). Alas, it turned out to be a non-critical, awfully confused hodge-podge of random strands from various disciplines (ecology, history, anthropology, geography) strung loosely together into a knotted mess that made it clear that Crosby does not have adequate knowledge in ANY field, certainly not enough to write such an important work.Crosby engages in such tactics as quoting scripture to explicate historical events, making wild claims, i.e. nothing major happened between the domestication of horses ~5k years ago and the imperialism instigated by Europe in the 1000s,without offering any evidence or support for this claim (I wonder if Biblical, Greek, Sumerian, African, Chinese, etc etc historians would agree?), and frequently ""guessing"" or ""approximating"" major evolutionarily important dates. A glaring flaw of his work is that it is EXTREMELY NON-RIGOROUS (despite the citations, which, like I said, include biblical references).But, much worse, Crosby displays a complete lack of understanding of ALL social, psychological, critical perspectives on human behavior. He claims, for example, that ""culture is a system of storing and altering patterns of behavior not in the molecules of the genetic code but in the brain"". Now, Crosby might want to look up some cultural theorists, Foucault, Gramsci, Adorno, any feminist, whoever - I'm pretty sure he will find ZERO support for his definition of ""culture"" amongst this group. This sentence is thrown out there as the SOLE explication of ""culture"", while the concept is then summarily dismissed.Excluding cultural/critical perspectives, Crosby's work already cannot do what it sets out to: explain the ecological impact of imperialism, for imperialism is a ""critical"" concept. It is not a ""given"", but a pattern of human activity laden with significance, meaning, history, structures of thought, contradictions, violence, etc. etc. And you simply CANNOT write an supposedly-academic book about ecological imperialism while taking imperialism for granted.This tragically flawed foundation becomes apparent early on in the work, as it becomes abundantly clear that Crosby writes like a blindly privileged white man who takes Europe's ""superiority"" for granted (even as he claims to be writing about the awful impact of Europe's imperialism). For example, he asks himself ""why the New World was so tardily civilized?"" (of course, the meaning of civilization is left unexplored, it's just taken for granted that civilization is good, and that the ""new"" world was not civilized), ""why the American Neolithic revolution was so inferior to that in the Old World"", and the like. He also commits an endless stream of uncritical faux-pas, such as claiming animals are our ""servant species"" and writing that ""superman arrived on earth about 3000 years ago"" (wth has this guy not heard of Hitler's appropriations of Nietzsche?). Of course, there's just so much garbage here because Crosby has NO FOUNDATION on which to stand - he claims to be a scientist but quotes the Bible, he claims to be a historian but eschews critical perspectives, he claims to write about imperialism and culture but doesn't circumscribe either.

Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups"".I'm turning 35 this year. I also teach HS, so I'm quite adept at putting on my adult mask for my teenagers. Yet, often, when I get a moment to really think, I'm constantly surprised that I am, indeed, 34. It's not that things haven't changed: for instance, you'll find me in bed cozying up with a book on Thursday nights at 10pm, not primping to go out. It's that, at my students' age, I remember thinking 35 was old. But, I don't feel at all like what I expected 35 to feel like, something like a true certainty I assumed came with ""adulthood."" And the more I think about it the more I realize, I will never feel that way. I will be 80 year old (one can hope), sitting in my rocking chair, and the only thing that will be different is how people relate to me. Because, there is no such thing as the fabled ""togetherness"" of ""adulthood"".Ocean at the End of the Lane is profoundly insightful, and magnificently subtle. One may read it easily while remaining entirely oblivious to the nuance of our 7 year old narrator's words - for who truly listens to children? But if one approaches the work like their own personal ""Ocean""- and allows oneself to be submerged completely in the memory of childhood, one begins to realize the meanings extend infinitely beyond the page and offer truly, brilliantly penetrating observations about the nature of time, memory, and self-hood.My favorite example of this is the theme of wonder at the nature of reality - and the idea that it's not children who have a limited view due to lack of prior experience/knowledge, but that it's adults who have learned to see the world through a haze of conventions, habits, mindlessness, routine. As children (those of us who had the privilege of living in safety), we imagined an enchanted world brimming with possibility: as adults (those of us who aren't meditative gurus), we are often tired, dogged by ""responsibilities"", weighed by obligations and rules and patterns of thoughts, to the extent that we've forgotten how to penetrate the seeming banality of things. We've automated so much of what we've learned, that we rarely take the time to truly look. So in the end, it's not adults who are ""certain"" of the world - it's children (but of course as children we don't know this). I for one never felt more clear about myself as a person than when I was about 7 or 8, the age of our protagonist (which is another reason perhaps why I felt I was reading a metaphorical biography of myself). It was also around that time when events beyond my control first forced me to face the meaning of pain (for our protagonist, it was the arrival of an unpleasant, destructive ... force, let's call it; for me, it was my father's defection to the US and subsequent tribulations of being left behind in Ceausescu's Romania). And of course, we learned to cope the same way: BOOKS! Imagination! Fantasy! An escape? Perhaps, in some ways, but also, a productive reimagination of reality.""How can you be happy in this world? You have a hole in your heart. You have a gateway inside you to lands beyond the world you know. There can never be a time when you forget them, when you are not, in your heart, questing for something you cannot properly imagine..."" To this day I continue to seek that which may reenchant my perspective, may help me see beyond the layer of grime accumulated over the past 20 or so years of ""adulthood"", and I credit Gaiman's work for dusting off the largest cobwebs.

The Elementals was absolutely one of the most place-bound works I've ever read: I, who know nothing about Alabama, and just as little about Southern culture, people, traditions, etc, feel like I've just got back from a months-long trip mingling with my conservative fellow country-people. I, 100% liberal agnostic feminista, returned from this trip with a newfound appreciation/soft spot for/understanding of my conservative Christian Southern friends. This Southern Gothic classic is brilliant for one single reason: McDowell's evocative, sensuous, embodied depictions of Alabama. The unadulterated sand, the stifling heat, the sounds of the countryside, the tastes of the suffocating air - the reader experiences them all in synesthesic unity induced by McDowell's language. The characters are vividly portrayed, and sympathetically so, even as all their flaws are laid bare. McDowell has a knack for welcoming the reader to empathize with that which is human in all of us, to the extent that even a domineering asshole Christian right husband who vies for political power, a person I may hate on a Hill or Politico forum, becomes someone I can feel humanely, non-angrily, even empathetically towards.Though, there is some weirdness there. OK, a lot for this Yankee; what I'm talking about now is some REALLY strange/off weirdness, such as father and 13-year old daughter swimming naked together without the hint of sexual impropriety or abuse. Um. So yes. There's that. And just in general, the familial relationships portrayed are quite foreign to me (like family members calling each other by their first names instead of titles like ""Mom"", ""Dad"", father sharing drinks with 13 year old daughter, black servant - paid of course, but still, etc). The weirdness overall isn't bad, at least for me, because of course I read so much so that I can learn about other ways of being/thinking/living.The major detractor from my rating is the story, which rests on actual creatures/spirits/elementals. To me, the best horror (i.e. Shirley Jackson) is brilliant because it doesn't resort to literal scary incarnations of things, but relies fully on psychological suspense. I'm not a ""monsters"" person. There's already monsters all around: in each of us, in our collective endeavors, in the historical fabric - the craftiest writers imho don't have to manifest these as distinct creatures (with exceptions. But, I never accept violence as an acceptable exception, violence itself is usually a cop-out unless it relates to real-world actual violence, such as war or crime).Summary: Plot: 0/5, Characterization: 5/5, Atmosphere: 10+++/5Will update rating after this settles in for a while....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Dec 2015,"Dec 03, 2015","Dec 01, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22461751-the-elementals

But, a word of caution: wait until you're ready. Ready to fully accept, imbibe, enjoy a surreal journey into a fantastical play on worlds/words. I can see myself picking this up a year ago, when my thing was medieval historical fiction, and throwing The City & the City at a wall in extreme frustration, most likely postponing reading- hopefully not indefinitely. Here's why: from the very start we are immersed in an incomprehensible world explained through even less comprehensible language. Not to the Clockwork Orange extreme, but still possibly off-putting to those of us who aren't used to/don't read books peppered with concocted words which - this is the clincher - are used to describe a truly bizarre imaginary world (made even more bizarre by its proximity to our actual world. It's like, first you're in wacko Beszel and then Mieville mentions visitors to the country from Germany or Canada, and Beszel's involvement in WWII, and you're like WTF where am I?). Then there's the ways in which Mieville constructs sentences, even those with words fully ensconced in a Merriam-Webster, that are so profoundly... weird (so I also found, in my google travels, that there's an entire genre, ""weird fiction"", and that China Mieville is one of its gods). Like everyone is always in some kind of panic (each conversation starts with ""Fuck, ____, what the fuck are we going to do/we are fucking screwed/what the fuck is going on""), like there is an entire layer of implicit deliberation we are not privy to except through our own creative prowess.At first, it was incredibly hard to read this - until I wiki-ed ""what the fuck was going on"" and got a basic breakdown of Breach, breaching, alter, crosshatch, total areas, etc (I highly recommend this - it won't ""spoil"" the cities). After, I still had to practice letting go of a significant amount of control (VERY difficult as you may imagine) in order to enjoy The City & the city, for this book is really best read in a blank-state. Any preconceptions are sure to diminish the possibility of full immersion and appreciation. Openness is the best approach.  I detract 1 star for two reasons (had only one been at issue, I would have gone with 5). First, all the cursing :( I usually put a book down after a couple curse words, or make it through but never read the author again. Not because I'm morally offended, but because 99.9% of the time, it's a cop-out to curse in literature, and I'm a book snob. With Mieville, there's about 50 curse words/chapter (or maybe more), and EVERY single conversation includes at least ten fucks. Most of the time, it fit, and I was going to not even mention it. But really, by the end, it got a little ridiculous (""Fuck, fuck, what the fuck are we going to do, fuck!""). Had there been more like 48.5 curse words per chapter, I may have said no more. But Mieville let it spill a little over the threshold.The second reason is related to the resolution. MAJOR SPOILER FOLLOWS. (view spoiler)[The whole investigation becomes about the dangerous place between the two cities, Orciny. And I so hoped and wanted to know more about this in-between. It was incredibly sad to read that indeed, Orciny did not exist, that it was all a ploy run by businessmen to make profits, and that Breach was just other Breachers, who could not ""unsee"" what they had breached. There seemed so many more possibilities for philosophical exploration to indeed imagine a third space (perhaps that occupies both but is unseen by others - i.e. Breach is Orciny). I can also see the point made by the actual resolution - it usually IS about money, and there usually IS no more ""inherently evil"" other dimension controlling it all. But still. Personal preference only, but I wanted Breach to be Orciny. It's like, do you believe that the ""higher power"" controlling human behavior is greed, and that there is no other organized impulse beyond this greed? OR do you believe there's an entire class of people who see it ""as it is"" but impose restrictions and deploy propaganda to keep others in their rightful, subordinate place? For me, it's the latter - as an educator, it's become increasingly clear to me that what people lack is KNOWLEDGE. So many if not most of our ills degenerate from a lack of openness and understanding stemming from ignorance. So I liked the idea that Breach was a power that saw BOTH but deployed tactics of intimidation and gestapo-style leadership to keep everyone ignorant and in their place (also I am a child of communism so of course, this is my preferred question: how does one administer such control?)But, Mieville seems to prefer the greed explanation - and the much more simple solution that people willfully chose to keep themselves in place by acting the ""blind sheep"" (perhaps rightly so, and as a Brit who's only known life under capitalism first hand, this preference makes sense.)

Missing out is what I get for avoiding entire genres, i.e. fantasy. Well, since my adult snottiness settled in (""too mature for that nonsense"", ""too much real stuff I want to know about to have time for fantasy"", etc). But I used to LOVE fantasy - I learned English by reading the Narnia Chronicles when I was 9 after all (if you're wondering, it took an entire year with a dictionary, looking up every word, to get through Book 1 - after that, the pace increased exponentially). And R. L. Stine got me through the trauma of high school. Anyways, at some point when Harry Potter was all the rage, I decided I was too adult for wizard school, and I have barely touched any fantasy or sci-fi since. Until recently. And for the past few years, very gradually, I've been sampling a bit - Atwood here, Crichton there, some of the newer ones like Howey and St. John Mandel. I haven't liked some of what I've encountered (ugh, zombie girl book - The Girl with All the Gifts, ditto to the new rendition of Alice), but the fantasy-sci-fi that I've enjoyed, I've simply LOVED. And I'll be damned if Neverwhere isn't the wave that finally broke open the gates to any resistance I've been holding onto with respect to allowing myself to enjoy and learn from fantasy fiction. This book is perfect.Really, where to begin? The brilliance shines through every pore: in the casual and quirky flow of the words, through the lovable and hilarious caricatures masquerading as characters, through the vivid portrayal of our dream/subconscious dimension, and so on and so on. For me, Neverwhere clicked on a fundamental, Jungian, primal plane. It's like Gaiman and I have the same dreams. Like, tunnels leading to imaginary rooms on the way/running towards (or away from) something, all the while meeting surreal characters in a true Dali-esque awful but non-nightmarish dream (awful but still much more fascinating than bad)-all while still enmeshed in the supposedly ""real world"". Essentially, Neverwhere asks, ""is this all there is?"". The answer: yes & no. Yes - if you allow it to be so. No, if you dream and imagine your world into being, if you escape the confines of what you have been taught to see.A personal example to illustrate: moving to US-suburbia as a tween from the beautiful pastures of the Carpathians was quite a shock (ok - so, I lived in Bucharest as a child but we went out to the mountains and country-side a lot). Nature in the US is cordoned off, zoned for private use (even parks are manicured and managed - no chicken roaming the streets here, no picking apples fallen to the side of the road). I came to detest suburbia, and when I was finally out on my own, I moved to The City (that, I can handle; strip malls: not so much). As an established adult, I'm back in suburbia - a more relaxed, green, location - still close enough to where I was as a tween, though. BUT because I'm seeing it from a different angle (I live backing to a park; there's trees and farms all around, it's my own home this time), it's not the ugly suburbia of my youth, but a much livelier, friendlier, even at times beautiful place. And the strange thing is, I can now see it both ways: when I commute into the City for work, I can easily switch back and forth between the ""concrete-wasteland"" perspective to the ""rolling hills and beautiful"" perspective.  Neverwhere is a call to imagine the beauty, mystery, strangeness of the world beyond that which we have learned to accept - it is about re-enchanting perspectives that have gotten bogged down by conventions, norms, and habits.

On one hand, I enjoyed it somewhat while reading (because I LOVE the mythos around Alice), but that was with the understanding that all the gore, destruction, rape, murder, blood, and terror was leading  somewhere, that it was about learning to deal with trauma or something, that there was a moral to the story. There wasn't. I was pretty disturbed when I got to the end, and there was no closing (other than a shameless plug for a sequel).It ended up, in the end, just being the story of Christina Henry masturbating to women being murdered, mutilated, raped, and tortured. The needless violence was extreme, in the sense that being raped and owned and sold like cattle was the expectation for a girl's fate. And, without a moral or lessons learned, such violence read like a dark twisted fantasy of a twisted individual, and not anything a non-sick person may learn something from.Oh, and the other part of the story was that, along their way through this twisted universe, Alice and her companion killed people in their quest to kill an evil spirit (Jabberwoky). Did I mention the writing was pretty sophomoric, too?---- OLD REVIEW -----I am barely one page into the book, when this happens: ""Red running down the insides of her legs and blue marks on her thighs were fingers had been"" (sic). NOO! JUST NO, NO NO NO!!! Call me a snob, but sorry - if you don't catch that as a writer on the FIRST PAGE OF YOUR NOVEL, WTF. (And Penguin/Random House, really? Still, the buck stops with Henry).

His endearing aloofness and cynical yet amused detachment so typical of the Eastern-EuropeSo, I was in love with Arkady, but after this, I'm over it. His endearing aloofness and cynical yet amused detachment so typical of the Eastern-European psyche is almost demolished in Red Square, as Cruz Smith unnecessarily leads us into Arkady's tormented-lover's soul. Making things worse, the pov becomes so confused: most of the time, we're led to observe Arkady instead of being party to his feelings or thoughts... with one exception: when he's thinking about Irina, it's all gushy insecure rot.Also, the plot was incredibly complex and convoluted (I had to sketch a character-plot diagram to keep track of everyone's relationship and involvements), to the slight detriment of the story. Complexity is good but not when it strays in the realm of such obtuseness that you're asking yourself ""WTF is going on"" for a majority of reading-time. Still, one thing Cruz Smith does well in Red Square (as in the others in the series) is that he is SUBTLE (I tend to be repulsed by American ""pulp"" that bashes you over the head with what each character is thinking, feeling, and that comments extensively on all happenings). Overall though, Cruz Smith is a fabulous master of atmosphere, and it was as always, good to have the opportunity to immerse in the Europe of my youth. And to learn cool random things along the way, like about Russian painting and art smuggling post WW2, Radio Liberty, Chechnya, the Russian mafia, and the like....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Oct 29, 2015","Oct 29, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/647683.Red_Square
