At least I haven’t run across one yet.This tale of two girls and their friendship forged in the competitive, repressive environment of a Church-run musical conservatory makes it apparent that teenage passions may not change that much century to century or from one culture to another. I loved this beautifully written tale of music, magic, and finally, malevolence. Highborn Maddelena’s family has barely survived a serious scandal due to her mother’s indiscretions and it is up to her to rescue all of them from society’s condemnation by marrying well (no pressure!). Orphan Luisa, whom she befriends at the Ospedale della Pietà, has no family at all to worry about, only a burning desire to excel at the violin and to develop an exceptional talent, and music eventually empowers her in a way she never thought possible. A love triangle develops, with a woman scorned and treachery that brings a terrible revenge. When Maddalena first discovers the source of a magical power in her magical city, she knows the main questions it asks are: What do you want?, and  What will you pay?  Magic may be magic, but it isn't free....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 26, 2024","Mar 08, 2024","Feb 26, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61884841-maddalena-and-the-dark

Half thought it was weak in the plot area and worried that various parts did not hold together storyMy new book club was divided on this about 50/50. Half thought it was weak in the plot area and worried that various parts did not hold together story-wise, with disparate elements just sort of floating around. The rest of us, including me, appreciated the skillful prose and general mood of the book. I loved the language and saw what some called the disconnected portions as chances to flesh out the characters, their personalities, and enrich both the relationships between them and the environment in which they were moving. Not a page-turner, but I like to sink into a well-written literary narrative for the sake of more than the plot.Paris, 7 a.m.  story is a fictional episode in the life of poet Elizabeth Bishop that imagines her helping to rescue Jewish babies from the Nazis in the late 1930s and this story of anonymous parents giving up their children in order to save them is moving and evocative of other mother-daughter themes throughout the novel. The story also incorporates the historical fact that Bishop was separated when she was a small child from her own mother who was mentally ill and institutionalized. Weiland includes several real-life friends of Elizabeth Bishop, including poet Maryanne Moore, painter Margaret Miller, and Clara Eleanor Longworth de Chambrun, as characters. Clara is an older woman and French countess who had lost a grown daughter to illness in 1921 and the bond between Elizabeth and Clara in Paris, 7 a.m. further reflects the dynamics of mother-daughter relationships and the trauma of grief and loss when those relationships are severed. Author Liza Weiland is herself a poet and it shows. The language throughout the book is often beautiful and convincingly conveys the intellectual and emotional experience of Elizabeth, the predominant POV character.Present tense narration seems to be an unpopular device with some, but I usually like it when it’s chosen for appropriate works, and I liked it here.

She’s up for a career change, not because she doesn’t love teaching, but because she needs surgery and can’t afford it on the $40K a year she brings home from educating America’s youth. In Los Angeles, she hobnobs with Murphy and Randy, her two-man writing team, and attends industry parties with her agent Danielle, a great set-up for a broad satirical skewering of movie industry types and tropes and Southern California culture. Penelope’s own novel, also called American Mermaid, is interspersed in excerpts within this novel about Penelope’s experiences and introduces us to the titular character, Sylvia, who is rescued as an infant from the sea by a childless couple. Sylvia, being a mermaid, has superpowers, as we find out later, but on land she has been disabled. So Penelope’s story and Sylvia’s unfold in this parallel way. Working with professional screenwriters , Penelope is trying to preserve her original vision of Sylvia’s story, while Randy and Murphy, of course, want to radically alter it beyond recognition, and Penelope is fairly powerless to stop them. At a certain point, however, strange, inexplicable things start to happen in the script development process. As the writing team prepares to transition the story from book to film, Sylvia is undergoing some transitions of her own. Author Julia Langbein has a background in sketch, stand-up, and improv comedy and can really turn a phrase, packing page after page with fresh, surprising language that was really fun to read. Penelope’s fellow teacher and friend Derek, who comes to visit her in LA, is described thusly:Some people’s mouths are as simple as the slot in an alms box, but Derek’s has a whole complicated machinery that goes into gear when he smiles. There are ropes and pulleys in his jaw, under the skin, and his cheekbones sharpen and a dimple emerges, and the world sighs. I’ve kept the cleaning woman out for five days. There’s a whole pizza under the lid of the scanner, sticking out like a Muppet’s tongue. But Derek can’t take the boxes out of the building, because he doesn’t want Michaelangelo’s to know he never found a homeless shelter and he took all the pizza for himself, and the pizzeria is directly beside the building. Derek is a structure made unstable by the ungiving beams of principle that run through him at inconsistent and inconvenient angles: I believe he may eat seventy-five cold pizzas. I also really enjoyed Penelope’s nostalgic musings about the high school students she used to teach, and her recollections about their reactions to life and specific works of literature were hilarious while being relayed with great affection. Anyone who interacts with teenagers may get a kick out of these sections. I had a good time.

I’m hoping both of these books find their audience. It seems a shame for such interesting books to have ratings as low as they have on Goodreads (IMHO).

And sometimes you just get lucky, as was the case with this random find by an author I’d not heard of before.	 Jessi Jezewska Stevens’ The Exhibition of Persephone Q is billed as a “darkly witty satire.” It doesn’t seem to fit my own definition of satire, but that may be a generational thing. Set in NYC immediately after 9/11 and narrated by a 33-year-old freelance copywriter who admits she is “not all there,” this novel lacked the cynicism I associate with satire, although there was definitely an observant dry humor throughout. While it wasn’t LOL funny most of the time, I did erupt twice with a loud guffaw/chortle/snort that made me glad I was at home and not reading in a crowded public space; it was the kind of outburst that makes other patrons of the coffee shop stop their conversations and look around. 		 Percy has a psychic, a client she refers to only as “the self-help author,” and a new husband she loves, but is afraid she will kill while he sleeps, and the impulse to smother him shocks and frightens her. She takes to wandering the streets of Manhattan late at night to stay away from her slumbering hubby. She hasn’t yet told him she’s pregnant. 		 Years previous to the action, Percy had been engaged to an artist, “my fiancé."" When she receives an exhibition catalog in the mail for one of his shows, sent anonymously, she becomes convinced that the sleeping model in the pictures is her younger self, although no one else sees the resemblance and she cannot prove it. The catalog, tellingly, calls the exhibition “a profound exploration of privacy, memory, and the instability of truth.” Percy’s obsession with trying to establish her relationship with this artist’s representation explores not only the concept of identity in the modern digital age, but art itself, the dubious capacity for self-knowledge, and, as one er put it, “the process of becoming,” as she contemplates her future as a mother while remembering her own. 		 I loved her prose style.  “I emerged into the Garment District, turning down streets I had not walked in years. Glass buildings proliferated, as though a lid that had previously suppressed them had been lifted; they grew as diaphanous and out of place as orchids among weeks. I couldn’t remember what it had looked like before. As a girl, I only ever came to the city in winter, when it was too cold to look at anything beyond the rubber toes of my boots and the grip of my mother’s hand, which held mine fast as we sloshed through the snowy streets. She brought me to the ballet, for music, for jazz, plays I couldn’t understand but whose sense of menace I could feel. I wonder now if she was trying to acclimatize me to that menace, vaccinate me against it, so that, later on, when I found out much of life was a Pinter play with larger casts, worse dialogue—mere drafts of what we hoped to say—I would not be surprised. I was duped all the same.” “The avenue before me was deserted, abandoned to the dark and the mist that brews after rain. I walked the length of Morningside Park. The landscape rose out of the shadows, presenting luminous boulders, the flat of the pond. I ducked into a bodega for a jar of olives. Who could explain these cravings? They came to me and I obeyed. Back on the damp paths of the park, I braced the jar against a knee and wrestled with the lid. The safety seal would not budge. I tried again. In my fiancé’s exhibition I had seemed so powerfully serene. I was a veritable symbol, a woman immune to the passage of time. What a mythic force she was, that woman on the bed. And why it is always a woman, I wondered, who knows all but stands aside, indifferent as the Fates? I thought of my mother. I wrestled the jar. Perhaps I should have aspired to a life of more Homeric proportions. As things stood, it was nine o’clock, and I was on the street, in the mist, at war with a condiment.”Reviewer/blurb writer Hermione Hoby mentions Stevens’ depiction of all the “small, strange quiddities of being a body in a material and virtual world,” as well as the book’s “melancholy, humor, and perfect oddness.” Sometimes oddness, when done perfectly, can certainly be a plus....more",Notes are private!,2,3,1,"Oct 29, 2023","Nov 03, 2023","Oct 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45892266-the-exhibition-of-persephone-q

However, that also means there’s one less Edith Wharton book existing thWhat a treat to start a new Edith Wharton book that I have never read before. However, that also means there’s one less Edith Wharton book existing that is new to me. I wish great authors were immortal and keep churning them out forever. And if my edition’s Foreword by William Fiennes says that the 94-page Sanctuary’s prose does not rise to the level of House of Mirth or The Age of Innocence, my response is “So what?” That’s a pretty high bar and there’s hardly shame in not meeting that, even for Mrs. Wharton.  Sanctuary, like so much of Wharton’s work, deals with characters facing decisions about reconciling their private morality with the expediencies of their public lives, lives ruled by society’s demands. She examines the degree to which people are honest with themselves in making moral decisions, the role of their rationalizations and levels of self-awareness. Sanctuary is a short example of this, with some set-up in the first section that takes place two decades prior to the main action. In the second part, Kate Peyton follows her young architect son’s decision about an ethical issue while participating in a competition that can make or break his career and also determine whether he wins Clemence Verny, a calculating beauty Kate believes may be a pernicious influence. William Fiennes’ 2006 Foreword makes the odd claim that Kate, in Part One, turns her late husband’s dishonesty “into her tragedy, her spiritual crisis” in debating whether to marry him and that their son, Dick, in Part Two “exists only as an annex to his mother’s self-obsession.” These reservations are stated, even when Fiennes leads the essay off with Wharton’s quote from her autobiography A Backward Glance that “’the first duty’ for any member of the New York society of her youth was ‘to maintain a strict standard of uprightness in affairs’: what counted above all was ‘scrupulous probity’ in both business and private life.” Mr. Fiennes seems to be criticizing Kate’s “obsession.” But why wouldn’t a mother’s concern about her child’s moral development and commitment to a life of integrity be of special interest and a crisis for her, especially in light of her life-long wish to help him develop a moral compass? To see what type of value system her son, the person she loves most in the world, had developed under her tutelage, when this guidance she’d tried to give him had been her sole goal and aim in life. To know whether she has failed him in her life’s work of preparing him for a moral life, to know right from wrong and act accordingly, even when it’s not immediately advantageous? This worry seems to be to be a valid and serious expression of her maternal love and hardly the “self-obsession” of a woman who “hides her self-interest under the scarves of her moral scruples.” Fiennes seems to have a higher opinion of Clemence Verny for her “clear-sighted, pragmatic” views and her bold declarations about her “affection for the outward trappings of success.” Kate’s concerns are valid issues for a serious novel and, as a short and stripped-down example of Wharton’s themes, I found the story and characters interesting and compelling, even if it does not top my list of Wharton’s best novels.
