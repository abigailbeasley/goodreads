I felt like I was watching a toxic relationship unfold. The story is fundamentally basic (but with an Irish twist), and reading it makes you as self absorbed as its characters. In that sense although this novel appears light (romance between young college students) it sucks you into the depressive nature of it. I thought the writing was a bit basic but also emotionally provocative at times. The book is dialogue driven which makes sense for its commercial success via tv written by the same author.

I definitely liked this book more than milk and honey. Milk and honey focuses on healing journey and relationships and being happy with oneself. It was definitely read at a time when I needed it. This book had a variety of themes. I loved the theme on immigration. Loving our parents. Embracing accents and who we are. Couple of the love ones were too lovey or quite funny. Definitely were moments where I read a poem having no idea what it was about until I saw an erotic drawing and made the connections.
