Didn’t she deserve a bit more to end her story? Even just a quick mention would have gone a long way. Perhaps in the part about how the elephant forgot about her time in Baltese and the people of Baltese began to forget about the elephant? Drop in something about the countess there—viola! Another plot line ended.My other issue is about how long the magician spent in prison. It seemed to be that the plot in this book happened rather quickly. Boy gets fortune told re an elephant, elephant appears, boy sees elephant when she is being kept by the countess who lets anyone come see once per month—on the first month she did it, I think. Since the elephant was still the talk of the town when the countess procured her, it couldn’t have been that long. Yet the magician is scraggly-bearded in prison with crazy fingernails. You know what, it’s fine. I guess you might grow crazy fingernails in a few months…? I don’t really think it even WAS a few months, though, seemed way shorter, idk. Who cares, though.

The voice and characters are so vivid and my interest never waned. Even though it wasn’t hard to follow at all, when I was done, I went back to the beginning and read through the entire book again. I also love that this book made up for the type 1 diabetes inaccuracy that was in Bel Canto, which has the only occasion I can think of in a book where a character just has diabetes. She doesn’t die from it, it’s not the main thing about her, her getting diabetes isn’t even exactly a major plot point, beyond the people around here believing that Maeve’s loss of her mother had brought on the illness. The book mostly gets diabetes right. The only part where I didn’t think they exactly got it right was her going low at The Nutcracker, having a sugar of 38, eating glucose tablets and her eyes were clearing, and testing again and having a sugar of 42. Like, really? Glucose tabs brought her up 4 mg/dL and she’s feeling better? No way. Her sugar should have been, like, 72 when he tested her again. But whatever. It’s better than the musician in Bel Canto not having his insulin with him and letting himself die rather than taking the opportunity to go get the insulin then come back so he didn’t die, and instead dying what would have been a painful and horrific death. That was my least favorite part of Bel Canto. Dutch House was way better about diabetes and I’m curious what Ann Patchet’s experience with type 1 diabetes is.I only have two mild critiques. (view spoiler)[I didn’t like that, at the end when Danny is talking about his divorce from Celeste and how she didn’t want their house, that he reveals that he’d bought the house as a surprise gift for her, just like his father has bought the Dutch house for his mother, which was a wholly inappropriate gift for a woman who clearly believed that such largess was a sin, weighed against the poverty and suffering of others. How could Danny have made the exact same mistake? Yes, he’s like his father, but that was entirely too on-the-nose for me. And Danny, in his narration, fails to even put it together that this was the exact same thing his father did—how odd! Totally out of character. I also wish that we’d been given more with Andrea’s daughters and their relationship with Maeve so that the ending, when Bright is so thrilled to see Maeve again that she literally says something like, “I’ve missed you from the time you left until a few moments ago, when I saw you here.” I mean, that’s really intense. That’s some serious missing right there. Yes, Maeve was both kind to the girls and just a super cool person, but for me to buy that kind of missing, she would have had to fill some emotional need that Bright never got before and never got again. I didn’t see that, though. I just saw the old “cool babysitter/adoring kiddo” dynamic.  (hide spoiler)]Still, despite these small complaints that both came at the very end, great book.

I loved the CD version when it was first out, and for years after I used to play songs from it for others—especially “Wedding Song” and “Why Do We Build the Wall.” It’s been difficult to me to switch to thinking of it as a musical and to switch to the musical’s versions of the songs. But this book has helped me appreciate the transformation these songs underwent. I bought tickets to see the musical in SF and I couldn’t be more excited about it. Of course I’m glad so many more people now appreciate these songs and for it to be so successful, but it’s always a little weird when some lesser-known thing I’m super into gets huge. I still think the album version of “Wedding Song” with Justin Vernon is perfection—a beautiful romantic song that reminds me of a guy I used to know who charmed everyone with song and musicality and drifted though life by being that way. I don’t even know if that guy still makes music but he was the Orpheus-est motherfucker I ever met and I’ve known a lot of music types. I always imagined him singing the song, he also had the best voice song with an innate ability to play every instrument. Some people get all the gifts, I tell you.

To me, the opening where someone is talking directly to us, making observations about the people in town we’re seeing, is annoying and I don’t like it. It almost made me put the book down. Personally, I would have cut everything about the Baptists and Catholics fighting about gambling. It’s a long book and ultimately I don’t think any of that was necessary. I don’t hate the concept of the book, but I find King’s approach to be cartoonish and overly cinematic, like “This would be good for when they make this into a movie.” Have they made this one into a movie yet? Probably, idk. Sometimes Leland Gaunt would be literally tapping his fingers together, laughing an evil laugh, and plotting to himself—what a cartoon! Omg. So… the book was not for me. It’s also easy for me to look back at this book that came out in 1991 and be totally disgusted by the way King throws rape around as some kind of humorous metaphor and makes the women disgusting, slavishly fighting over who gets to fuck Elvis Presley all day, shit like that. A lot has changed these past 30 years, including, I’ll bet, Stephen King himself. When you know better, you do better. I also recognize that much of what I view as cartoonish cliché was, in fact, made that way by King’s popularizing it so successfully. So I’m not putting the book down (literally or metaphorically), I’m just saying, it wasn’t for me. Props to him for killing the dog, though. I love dogs but I hate this modern idea that it’s not okay to kill the dog in a story. Everyone is fair game for murder, I say. To me, killing a chicken is equally as bad.

This is may be a me problem. I often think that about critically acclaimed short stories. I feel like I should understand what the fuck that story was about after I’m done, and I rarely do. Now I shall begin the spoiler portion of my .(view spoiler)[For instance, in the last story, “A Better Place”—does Urzula kill Jarek Joskolka, or doesn’t she? Presumably, she is, in fact, a human from Earth, but then why did she know that name? Is it so wrong for me to feel cheated out of not ever learning what’s so bad about this man and what happens at the end? Is this a flaw on my part, being disappointed with not knowing? Also, why did the man in the car in “The Locked Room” stop and yell at the narrator to climb back into the room? Who was that? What business of his was it? What was the point of this story? What was the point of any of these stories? And in “The Beach Boy,” what happened at the end? The beach boy had some kind of magical aura or some shit? Why and so what? Had Marcia actually gotten on with a beach boy? I seriously doubt it, don’t you? Maybe it wasn’t even a beach boy, who knows? Maybe it was the tour guide, or a waiter or something. Why on earth would John assume it was a beach boy? I was really hoping there’d be some resolution, something to either let us and John find out what actually happened, or, idk, just something. In real life he’d likely not ever find out, but I didn’t get the bit at the end with the drunkenness and the almost-drowning. Was it that John wanted the company of a beach boy and couldn’t get it, or something? I really have no clue.  (hide spoiler)]I’m going to flip third this book and reread/skim it and see if I can make sense of anything. I’m probably just an idiot who doesn’t actually understand short stories. Maybe this is why I’ve never won a short story contest and also I’ve only had flash fiction short stories accepted into publication. Maybe I should give up writing literary work at all because I’m too stupid and don’t understand it and am usually unsatisfied by it. Then again, there are short stories I don’t don’t feel that way about. I love Carmen Maria Machado’s book of short stories. I enjoyed James McBride’s short story book, though not as much as his novels at all. Maybe it’s a certain oblique modern style that’s favored these days but not THE ONLY WAY. I really did enjoy the stories, I just was disappointed at the end of every single one. I’m always looking for a goddamned point, does that make me small-minded and narrow?

I also thought it seemed just so over-the-top for Freda to have left her kid in a toy by herself for 2+ hours. When she didn’t absolutely have to. I understand that shit happens, but I just can’t imagine any mom doing such a thing. There’s no way she wouldn’t know that kid would be completely hysterical in 15 minutes. That said, of course that doesn’t mean she should lose custody of her kid in such an extreme way. To not even be allowed visits. Wow. What a travesty. I kinda wish Freda’s “very bad day” had been a little more bad. Basically, she needed to get something from work, but she also decided to enjoy a leisurely child-free afternoon while her kid was at home stuck in what I think is, like, a walker toy—and one she’s too big for. Maybe she’d do a thing like that if something truly awful happened, but she was just stressed and overworked. Which, you know, I hear that! Moms need breaks!!! But since she also had an active co-parent with her ex, I mean, she DID get breaks, right? Anyway, I’ll stop dwelling on that and just say that I’m glad that in real life, at least currently, it’s hard to strip parental rights from people unless they’re convicted of abuse—and even then, they tend to get supervised visitation. In real life, the court wouldn’t take away parenting rights when the other parent was begging them not to. However, there are some SICK, messed up rules that do tear families apart and that are unforgivable. I always think about the kids whose foster “parents” murdered them by driving into the sea, one of whom was the little boy who went viral for crying and hugging a cop and people were like “See, look, black kid hugging white cop, world peace man” but actually that kid was horribly abused and eventually murdered. Anyway, that kid and his siblings’ aunt lost custody of them because she allowed the kids’ actual mother to babysit them while she went to work. What a joke. What a horrible, disgusting intrusion that led to all those kids’ deaths. Not that it wouldn’t be tragic if the kids hadn’t been murdered. It’s wrong wrong wrong to not allow families to stay together and to give children to be raised by non-related people if it isn’t absolutely necessary. I still liked the book. I felt for Freda and for all the other mothers at the school. Horrific. I kept wondering, did they ever put a “good” mother into those classes to see if they’d pass? Seems like no one could possibly pass.Also, dig. I wasn’t expecting this book to take place in Philadelphia. It often referenced exactly the neighborhood where I lived.

Could barely pull his head out of it.So I got the book from the library and guess what. The first, roughly, 1/3 of it, I too could not stop reading.

When I was 18, I came home from college and my little brother, learning I’d never seen any Star Wars movies (at that time, there were only 3) showed me the first one. “I like the talking parts,” I told him. “All these fights are boring.” “No one has ever said that before in the history of the world,” he told me.Nothing big was wrong with this book, I liked it. Especially the beginning. But it’s not really for me, I suppose? I really like mainstream literary fiction. Perhaps I’ll go read a Kazuo Ishiguro book to cleanse my pallet....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 10, 2021","Nov 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51171377-axiom-s-end

This one, unlike those others, has a lead character who likes herself just fine, doesn’t feel incomplete, and it also takes a lighter touch. The part that I think will stick with me for a long time is how Keiko is so happy to receive from the convenience store, when she first starts working there, a manual for behavior that even explains what kinds of facial expressions are appropriate. I wonder if there are books for people on the spectrum that are just, like, behavior guides. Between reading this and watching Love on the Spectrum, it definitely seems like there ought to be manuals of this nature, for people who want them, that cover everything from how to act in the different classes in school as well as at lunch, recess, etc, to how to act on dates, to job interviews, to parties, etc etc etc. That would be useful for lots of people.

I’ve spent quite a bit of time in North Philly because, for some reason, just across Front Street from Kensington, Fishtown was the ultimate hipster neighborhood during the aughts when I was in my 20’s. It was not a nice area. One time a bunch of little kids beat the hell out of a guy I dated in front of his row home. Also, my true best friend grew up in Kensington and she has family who resemble the narrator’s family quite a bit.

I was soooo drawn in. I love the way it made me feel right there in the room during complex emotional interactions, and the way they're explained in detail that feels similar to how we experience reality. I couldn't put this book down. I only got interested during the part at the beginning when Tommy apologizes to Kathy for accidentally hitting her. But then I read this pretty much straight through. Ultimately, though, I think the book couldn't quite deal with how these kids really felt about being used the way they would be used, so it just didn't, and it really kind of had to, imo. Because that's really the core question I had as a reader--why don't these kids rebel? But this is literary fiction and it's not trying to explore social issues, it's trying to explore emotional issues, and it does a GD fantastic job of that. Yet, part of me can't let go (get it!?) of the questions about why these kids participate so willingly. And the way that, at the end, (view spoiler)[ Miss Emily and Madam explain why the world couldn't stop exploiting people like the Kathy and Tommy now, not when the world had gotten used to cancer being cured (hide spoiler)], that made it feel even more like there ought to have been further exploration of how the doners felt about being doners. I wish Ishiguro had found some way to reveal things without (view spoiler)[ just being told them by Miss Emily and Madam (hide spoiler)] at the end. That made it feel like there could have been this whole other, bigger, more political story in the book that we got cheated out of.Yet, the tension in that scene I'm complaining about and my eagerness to read it never waned. Somehow, Ishiguro made these small intimate scenes downright riveting.I seriously loved this book. So much that I instantly rented the movie, then turned it off a third of the way into it because it's horrible and it instantly ruins any mystery in the book for people who watch the movie first and that upset me a lot. I know it's such a little thing but the film actually gave me nausea, with how much it ruins a wonderful book. If you like the movie, don't tell me, it'll make me think less of you, I don't want to know.Anyway, I'm giving it four stars even though I five star loved it, because I loved it with reservations....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 27, 2021","Sep 28, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go

That’s why this needed one more chapter that said “Even after you’ve done all this, you’ll probably still get rejected over and over because people’s tastes are just different.” I have never tried to query an agent, I’ve only ever submitted short stories to literary magazines and short story contests. I make it to the final round of contests, occasionally shortlist, but have never won. That’s why the “be tough” chapter is so important. I guess I was kinda hoping for a little secret sauce—why are my stories, with all their clean, evocative prose, strong clear-cut characters, and plots that resolve satisfyingly always rejected? I suspect that literary magazines don’t want stories with resolutions or endings. Maybe it’s because I’m a reader of novels, but personally, I hate that. I get very frustrated reading the often-pointless short stories that make it. But of course I also find stories I think are wonderful, especially in places like The New Yorker or the other best-of-the-best publications. There’s a story that was in Granta that I’m obsessed with and that makes me think I’ll never be good enough.

She’s so funny, relatable, and smart, and I can’t imagine anyone reading this book or hearing her podcast and not wishing she was your best friend. This book, despite having some heavy topics, is a quick & enjoyable read. I love how she points out both the ways her mother & grandmother failed her and the ways they served her. The grandmother is one of those true life characters who, if she hadn’t raised a granddaughter who happened to become a writer, the world would have missed out on meeting and it would have been a shame. I also really want to plug her podcast, I Saw What You Did. The author and the cohost Millie pick really interesting movies and talk about them in a way that makes me desperate to see each one. I’ve watched tons of films it would have never occurred to me to watch because of it. But they also talk about some of my favorite films, which makes me think, WOW THESE WOMEN ARE SO COOL.

It’s excellent, but mostly I say that because it agrees with the method I figured out for myself entirely on my own for the last 20 years. My method has long been to test often and treat accordingly. I’ve long micro-bolused, long stacked insulin for high carb/fat meals, long been able to feel very small blood sugar changes and tested repeatedly to watch trends. I’ve long believed that carb counting is not effective, and that insulin needs are not based strictly on carb counts. I’ve long learned to dose for foods I enjoy eating by experimenting and figuring it out for next time. I can eat an Impossible Whopper from Burger King without going high if I want! So I took to this pump/CGM lifestyle very well. I definitely glance at the CGM 25 times per day or more, like this author does as well. So, I’m happy to have my methods echoed back to me, which makes me feel good about myself. And there are a few new things I got from this book. One is the idea of having a phantom high sugar. I forget what he calls it. I believe that having treated phantom highs have caused many lows in my life. I never realized it until this book explained it. As a type 1 diabetic of 30+ years, I recommend this book to other people with type 1 diabetes & their caretakers. It is smart. It’s really the way to manage diabetes. If you understand The lessons in this book, you can eat the food you want to eat. I did this without a pump or CGM for years and kept an a1c of 5.5, though likely with too frequent of low. Now I have a pump & CGM and barely ever go low and if I do it’s like 68 for a couple minutes, since the CGM alerts me I’m dropping before that, so it never has the chance to sit low. But it also rarely goes above 120, though it may go as high as 180 sometimes. So I suspect that my a1c will be just as low of not lower now that I have the pump & CGM, even without the lows. And I don’t eat low carb and never will. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Apr 30, 2021","Apr 30, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27418180-sugar-surfing

The first was about people being given an article that said WMD had been found in Iraq, though they hadn't, and then a second article that corrected the first. Yet the conservatives still wrongly believed WMD had been found in Iraq. Then it was about conservatives insisting Barack Obama wasn't born in the US, even after being presented with irrefutable evidence that he was. So, are we SURE this is a fallacy EVERYONE engages in, or might some types of people be more susceptible to it than others? Because I've believed stuff, then read something that changed my mind about it quite often. The closest examples this book gives to people on the left doing the same thing was that it says that liberals were more likely to believe that Monica Lewinsky was a liar than conservatives were. But I don't think that's true. At some point, it was clear she told the truth. There was the blue dress and everything. People on the left may not have thought this was a wrongdoing worthy of impeaching the president, but they didn't hold to claiming she didn't tell the truth because that would be, well, stupid. It would involve ignoring the facts that were plain in front of our faces.And then it also gave some example about how the evidence about the effects of spanking children was mixed. I'm really not sure what the point of that bit was. I can see people on either side of that debate learning that studies have shown that spanking will get a kid to do what you want them to do if they're under the age of 7 and not changing their mind as a result. As far as I'm concerned, that's reasonable. I wouldn't say that evidence proves much either way.I'm just saying, this phenomenon of not being moved by facts is mostly an aspect of right wing brains. People on the left are greatly swayed by facts for the most part. There are exceptions, of course. Like, how many of you fucking imbeciles still refuse to go vegan or even mostly vegan despite the overwhelming evidence that it's essential for the survival of the planet? Too many. However, let's be honest--there are way more leftist vegans than right wing ones.

As soon as I heard about it, I wanted to read it because being able to relive my life without making the same mistakes is pretty much my ideal fantasy. It’s literally what I think about to comfort myself into falling asleep at night. So I was pretty excited to read this book. It wasn’t for me, though. I found it a little annoying. I didn’t like that when the main character went to her different timelines, she didn’t know what had happened in them. I would have preferred if she was both her original self and the new one at the same time, and as she’d think back on things, she’d remembered them. Imo, that would have made for a better book, less tiresome, without this fake, pointless tension of her not remembering. But that’s just my opinion. I also didn’t like A Man Called Ove and this was that sort of book—feel good, fairy tale-esque, super obvious. But other people like that sort of book and respect, I totally get it because *I* like that sort of *movie*. If this had been some high concept movie, I’d have loved it because I pretty much always enjoy such movies, even if they’re utter garbage. I mean that. Like, to me, What Men Want was an enjoyable film because, hey! She could hear men’s thoughts, wild! Shenanigans ensued! Know what I mean? In film form, I’m far more forgiving. I’m not saying I didn’t like this, it was fine. It just wasn’t exactly what I wanted. I’ve thought about this concept often, and felt irritated that no fiction where someone gets a special power is allowed to end in any way except them realizing they really wanted what they had at the start all along. Somehow, somehow, there has to be some fiction that’s different. I can only think of one movie like that, which I can’t remember the name of, but it was this 80’s movie where a misogynistic man gets magically turned into a woman and has to learn to deal. But then at the end, he remains a woman, happily. I wish I could tell you the name of that film because I actually love it. Other than that, high concept fun always ends with “And then I learned to appreciate the life I had at the start of this story.” Structurally, I get it—it’s easy, it’s crowd-pleasing. But I dunno, someone do something different, PLEASE?

Filled with vivid characters who are easy to fall in love with, it’s super funny and narratively satisfying.

Except, he doesn’t remember having done it and he doesn’t really think he did. Literally everyone is after him—both for having shot the young man and because his late wife Hettie died without telling anyone where the church’s Christmas money was hidden. But he manages to slip through everyone’s fingers time and again, all while drinking his favorite drink, the home-brewed King Kong his friend makes. Meanwhile, the head of the Italian mob who also lives in the Cause neighborhood of Brooklyn, is searching for a small item around the church as well, and he also gets caught up with Sportscoat.

I knew they were related, but it honestly didn’t occur to me that Maverick in this book is Starr’s dad from the other one. And it didn’t matter. This book can be read and enjoyed entirely in its own. I was really, really happy to see this book was going to be released because it has come to my attention that almost all modern “issues” novels for young adults have girls as the main character. I’m not saying boys can’t or shouldn’t read books about girls, and I acknowledge fully that girls have long been expected to read books about boys. Thinking back through my years in school, I can’t recall a single book I was assigned that was about a girl. My father read me Charlotte’s Web when I was 6 or younger, but it wasn’t assigned reading and really the main character of that book is Wilbur. So don’t come at me about how boys should read books about girls the way girls always have read books about girls. The issue is that boys simply AREN’T reading, and especially aren’t reading issues books. They may read other genres, but I don’t want male experiences left out of this genre. It’s self-reinforcing. Boys read less and don’t read issues books, so publishers don’t release books about boys’ experiences, so boys don’t read issues books, so publishers... etc etc etc. It takes a proven successful author like Angie Thomas to have the track record to be able to release an issues book about a boy.And we couldn’t ask for a more capable author for the task. I flippin’ loved this book, and when I realized it was about Starr’s dad I was like DUH and also I loved it even more, knowing what happened to the two babies 17 year-old Maverick has in Concrete Rose. He was so freaking cute with baby Seven, I was melting at how cute he was. He really had some bad luck. Do you know how often someone has sex using a condom and it DOESN’T break and if it does how often people DON’T get pregnant? Do you know how common it is to not get pregnant when having unprotected sex one time AND pulling out? Not that I recommend it or anything, but damn. Bad luck, kid. Or maybe... good luck? (view spoiler)[Because the babies ultimately caused him to choose to step away from gang life? (hide spoiler)]I may reread The Hate U Give now. I’m officially an Angie Thomas superfan.

The book made me laugh. Especially the latter part of the book because the early parts have all been used before. When I was a kid, we had a mass market paperback of Seinfeld bits lying around and I read it and laughed when I was literally like 8 years old, and that stuff sticks with you, the stuff you read when you’re a kid. And then later I watched the show and those bits were repeated. And now they’re repeated again in this book and lots of it is pretty played out. But, uncool as it may make me, I liked the new stuff I hadn’t heard yet. It’s relatively lighthearted and pretty clean. The dirtiest thing in it was maybe what made me laugh hardest and it was about the weirdness of a certain gay celebrity making his boyfriend look more like himself.

I didn’t actually realize it was horror at the start. I thought it was just, like, general fiction. And I was impressed because I’ve read another of Alyssa Cole’s books, and it’s a romance. A romance I liked very much, and I’m picky about them. I was like, “Wow, she genre hops!” Realizing the book is horror actually doesn’t change that one bit—it’s still genre-hopping. Which, in this publishing world, is mighty impressive. The romance elements of this book were really well done, imo. The horror, like all the best horror, takes the common every-day horrors of society and multiplies them, taking them to their furthest possible conclusions. The reason I say it’s imperfect is because it’s kinda slow at first and then really really fast at the end. There are some things that happen at the end that I think could have been spread out, happening earlier in an effective way. It would require some changing around, obviously, which is way easier said than done. The end felt a tiny bit deus ex machina but not completely. There has been SOME appearance of what saves them in the end. Good social commentary, though. I dig that kind of thing.

I saw the cover on a list of new releases and reserved it purely because I liked the cover, it looked like other books I like. And it is a good book, but this book is hella harrowing. The opening scene tried to warn me it wouldn’t be a light coming-of-age book. And then as soon as they introduced the Korey Fields character I was like, oh damn. This is going to be some R Kelly stuff. And I honestly considered not reading it because I cannot handle thinking about all the real life girls whose enormous talent drew a monster to them, and then got them stuck under his thumb, and the damage he did to them. I didn’t want it to happen to Enchanted. But I kept reading, and of course the things I didn’t want to happen did happen. The book handles the topic with care and sensitivity, with special attention paid to the important notion that we need to believe Black women and girls, and stop trying to convince them they’re crazy when they come forward with totally believable and usually pretty easily proven accusations against men. It’s a good book, and I recommend it, but I guess I’m just in no mood for it. The horror, the horror. What I really want to read is Ready Player Two, that was released today and it will no doubt make me feel mindless enjoyment. This book got me all weepy and sick-feeling while I made cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. I should have read it next year, maybe after January 20 when Trump leaves office. I am suffering from too much existential dread. None of that is this book’s fault.

Thus, he became the only known volunteer for the posthumous fate of anthropomorphic bibliophagy.Anyway, cool book, pick it up if you are interested in medical history or just, like, weird true stuff....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Nov 04, 2020","Nov 04, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50403464-dark-archives

It’s about trying and failing to create characters that feel real, how the details elude you (“hands are hard”), and how when you write a character people like, as an author you can still see all the ways that character has been left unformed. It’s about how, in a competitive writing atmosphere, your peers may want to absorb your talents into themselves, and/or destroy you. It’s about creating darling after dealing, only to kill them each in turn until one finally works.

Who is Novella Carpenter trying to convince, exactly? Not me, certainly. I suspect herself.You know, when *I* was 16, like Carpenter, I also was a failed vegetarian. Ate veg for maybe a year, then on a road trip decided to make an exception for fish, soon vegetarianism faded away. Like her, I subsisted on crap. She says she ate cheese sandwiches. My guess is that it was on white bread. I think back then I was eating mostly sugar cereal and pb&j sandwiches (yep, with white bread). But, unlike Novella, a fellow white transplant to Oakland who quit vegetarianism at age 16, I grew into an adult curious enough to really explore how to eat healthfully and sustainably. I became vegan 7.5 years ago at the time of this writing. At first, I switched only my diet, after watching Forks Over Knives. I’d been eating mostly vegan before that, keeping no non-vegan items in my home except eggs, which I enjoyed eating fried with toast (somehow I’d gotten the memo by then to switch to 100% whole wheat bread, probably from having read What to Eat by Marion Nestle). I also would eat meat given to me, available at a party, and if I went out to eat, I pretty much always ordered meat. But once I started learning how unnecessary those foods are for health, how calorie-dense and detrimental to overall health, I went plant-based. A few weeks later, I saw a video online of a family killing a small pig in Cuba. So, not a factory farm, a small family farm. I listened to how the pig screamed. It sounded like a human baby. My heart went out to it, and for the first time, the moral depravity of killing animals to eat unhealthy food really struck me. Honestly, I do think it shows a moral weakness to eat meat. It proves that you’re willing to put your own moment of pleasure above what is healthy for society, for your body, and for another creature’s life. I’m not saying that makes you a bad person. We all have moral weaknesses. And I understand that capitalism has created a world for us where we are so enmeshed in working and true pleasures are more and more difficult to afford, but capitalism has filled that void by making small pleasures somewhat affordable—like eating unhealthy food. Too many people have bought into the notion that life is short, we should enjoy our food. But life is short BECAUSE OF the unhealthy food, and having an addiction to extreme food pleasures makes the space between those moments of stuffing ourselves with fat, salt, and sugar less tolerable, as with any repetitive extreme pleasures addiction. And as with any addiction, when your body finally gets accustomed to not being exposed to the deadening highs, you start to notice all the complexity of flavors in every herb, every shallot, each loquat picked from a neighbor’s tree, a tomato grown in a container on the sunniest spot on your balcony. You seek out the brightest fruits and veggies and a ripe plum tastes heavenly and you’re feeling great and just...happier. I noticed that Carpenter didn’t extoll the particularly delicious flavor of her home-grown produce. She was too focused on eating animals to notice. Only her watermelon caught her attention, and she never got to eat it. Which is kind of apropos of this book. I’m very interested in homesteading, and I do recognize that in a smallish garden like the one Carpenter started, it would be nigh on impossible to grow enough beans and grains to give her the protein and carbohydrates she would need. That’s why it’s kind of good we have industrial scale farming for certain items, like grains and beans. If she was really attempting to feed herself entirely, which she—foolishly, in my opinion—attempted to do for 1 month, I can understand why she found raising/killing animal necessary. After all, animals have a lot of calories and can eat scraps humans tend to waste. But the fact was, even with the addition of animal calories, this poor author was starved of carbohydrates, and went on a desperate search for them. It seemed pretty irresponsible to engage in this arbitrary experiment when I think she knew full well she couldn’t properly feed herself from her garden alone. Why NOT eat from the dumpsters? Why did she decide to make that exclusion? What point did it prove for her to exclude it? This is treating diet like a game instead of as a serious matter. And it is a serious matter. I’m all for growing food everywhere possible. I dream of having a garden. I lived in a place only a couple blocks from where this book takes place that had a garden space that the house’s owner, my housemate, was only getting started working on, with a newly-planted fig tree and almond tree, a couple newly-build raised beds, and a fenced-off compost pile in the far corner. There was a large, mature lemon tree that produced a lot and also an incredible bramble of spiky blackberry bushes that were lush with fruit. I used to go outside wearing rubber gloves and pick a pint every day and eat it. I’ll bet that garden is even better now, years later. There is SO MUCH that can be grown in Oakland. Then you can buy dried beans and whole grains in bulk and have them delivered to you in the mail. There is no reason for complete self-sufficiency. Collaboration in key areas is beneficial to all. There’s no reason to get fish slop from Chinatown dumpsters every day to bring to pigs which you then put another massive amount of food miles to travel to a butcher to slaughter the pigs for you, only to find out that—oh, boo boo and what a shocker!—the butcher is, like, kind of a bad person.

I mean, it’s so weird there are two major fictional releases about them—how did that happen? I liked The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek better because the voice felt more authentic than it did in this one, IMO. Jojo Moyes is British and honestly, I picture her as Bridget Jones for some reason. Sure, the main character in this book, Alice, is also British, but I’m just saying that none of it evoked a sensation of historicity. Plus, it was a let-down plot-wise.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!For instance, Bennet tells Alice that he can’t hang out with her because he’s got “guy things” to do. I mean, he literally said “guy things” in his dialogue with her. I don’t think people talked that way during the depression. They probably said something like, “We men have business that wouldn’t be of interest to a lady” or some such bullshit like that. And, like, wasn’t Bennet gay? He must have been gay, right? But that was never revealed, and he never got his moment of character growth. Neither did Sophia, the lone black librarian. She was only there to be a token, and not given a real story, unlike the lone black librarian in Book Woman, who made it out of Kentucky at the end, only to find Philadelphia wasn’t exactly a heaven for black Americans either. And oy vey, the murder story. So, who DID murder the dude who was murdered? I was hoping it would be revealed at the end, like in Where the Crawdad’s Sing.And every woman in this book was modern as hell.

I read most of the literary bestsellers, popular fiction, books people are talking about, that kind of thing.I decided to read Whispers, in particular, because I recently read a writing craft book that used it as an example, and it sounded scary, and that intrigued me because I don’t really get scared by reading books, unless it infects me with ideas that fill me with existential dread, like how our entire mysterious universe is probably one of countless simulations a smarter alien than us created, and how inevitably we’ll build our own simulations, and create countless more universes. That kind of thing scares me. But murder books? No. They don’t really scare me.So, entering this book, I really didn’t know the precise genre of the book because I was really just that ignorant of Dean Koontz. I knew he was a big author, but I couldn’t remember which section we put his books when I worked at Borders. Mystery? Horror? The horror section was tiny compared with Mystery. Not SciFi, I didn’t think. Same with, say, John Grisham. Where did we put those, Mystery? I know because of movies those are courtroom books so, I don’t know. This Koontz book could have been something with supernatural elements or it might be straight mystery. From my point of view, it was Schrodinger’s book—both things at once. And that really added to my enjoyment, honestly. This is why I try not to watch movie trailers. Anyway, I loved it, kinda. It was very scary and pretty readable despite being super long. It genuinely surprised me a number of times. To me, it feels distinctly different from the modern style of writing, but it may just be that I’m unaccustomed to the style expectations in genre fiction. To me, a lot of the backstory laid out right on the page should have been relegated to the author’s notes. He should have used them to inform the character, write them with authenticity, but not included it in the finished novel. I’m not sure we needed to know that the woman working in a hotel that our male main character, Tony, a cop, interviewed used to be a band groupie and is looking for a way to get rich, and feels used and spit out, etc. We got elaborate backstory for a number of minor characters! And that lady wasn’t even being interviewed about the case the book is really about, she’s part of the other case that Tony is investigating at the start. BUT I have to admit it was fun to read it, so it’s fine. I can sit here and be like “This is how I’d edit this book” but I’m some rando person with her own flaws and blind spots. I mean, I’d also remove the little random Boomer bits of political philosophy that comes down to “government is bad except cops and also all the other things that help me but get the government out of my business they’re nothing but trouble.” On one hand, I’m like, “Why does EVERY CHARACTER have this SAME political philosophy?” On the other hand, maybe because yep, that’s the standard Boomer philosophy and this book was published in 1980. So perhaps that was accurate. My sensibilities, though, incline me to want characters’ philosophies in books to vary as much as they do in real life. I suspect they didn’t in this book mostly because it was Koontz’s own personal philosophy and he wasn’t able to allow himself to give the light of day to opposing viewpoints. BELIEVE ME, I know that temptation, as a naturally opinionated person myself, and I forgive it. It’s fine. Authors don’t need to agree with me philosophically on everything if they write a good book. I must say that the ending of this was not predictable and I literally gasped at parts. Then there was an afterward by the author in the Kindle edition I got from the library. It was a really funny afterward. I mean, I loled at parts. This wasn’t a lol part, but in it, he said he regretted some of the Freudian stuff because he thinks it’s bunk now, but ultimately, he weaved a good yarn. He’s right, IMO. Good yarn.

They know they enjoyed reading all of it, even parts 2 and 3 they complain about. Might it have been better if Scalzi hadn’t basically switched worlds for the last two sections? Maybe. But if he hadn’t done that, it could change the whole meaning of the book, and I, for one, loved seeing the meaning I took from it dramatized in a novel.The book begins as a send-up of classic Star Trek, but it’s soon clear, the world these characters live in isn’t...quite as good as the ones on Trek. And soon, something that appeared to be just campy fun poking at a cultural touchstone turns into more of a treatise on the immorality of creating bad fiction.Even if the characters don’t literally show up begging you to give their lives and death meaning, if you fail to do that for characters you create, what is the point? It doesn’t matter if it keeps you working, ultimately, it’s garbage. You wasted both your own time and the time of anyone who encounters it by creating that character.Now I’m not saying that’s the ultimate truth.

The setup in the first scene had dramatic potential—our good girl protagonist is assigned by the principal to reform the bad boy, with the reward of getting a judge’s recommendation for her Harvard application. Let the hijinks begin, right? There could have been some cute stuff with him convincing her to be more bad, and her convincing him to be more good. But nope. Instead, they fall for each other for no reason (especially him for her—I kept wanting to know why he likes her so much) and he’s actually not bad at all, not even a little, and the assignment from the principal disappears. Even when there is an encounter with the judge at the end, there’s not so much as one reference to the fact that she sure as heck didn’t get that judge’s recommendation. I mean, this author actually writes pretty well. Her prose is clear and she uses plenty of strong verbs. But the neat and tidy plot setup that draws readers in at the start gets no payoff.

I’m impressed with the sheer number of details I’d retained from these books, as well as with the things I forgot. Here are a few things I remembered before re reading these:1. There is no 19th story.2. The attaché case people.3. Dead rats live in the basement. Mrs. Jules hates dead rats.4. The last sentence of each book is always “Everybody...” and a word is or rhymes with “booed.” 5. Louis the yard teacher, Mrs. Jules, Mrs. Gorf, Miss Zarves (there is no Miss Zarves).6. Write your name under the word “discipline.”7. That one student always got in trouble and even though he didn’t do anything. Here are some of the things that, incredibly, I’d forgotten:1. Joe learning to count and then knowing how many hairs he had on his head.2. Goozack/the existence of Mr. Kidswatter3. Miss Mush4. BenJAmin NUSHmut. Or was that BENjaMIN NushMUT?5.

I read it out loud to my younger sister and brother, and I remembered tons of details from it without having read in some 25 years. Like, I remembered that Bradley was good at cutting but bad at taping. And that his haircut took a frustratingly long time, with the barber seeming to cut tiny bits at a time. And that the counselor's name was Carla, and she gets the outcast Bradley to a point where he's invited to a girl's birthday party, and that the girl has a dog named Chicken. But I forgot about the whole existence of Jeff Fishkin, the whole ""Give me a dollar or I'll spit on you"" thing, and how Bradley made his animal figurines talk to him and each other. Revisiting it comforted me. Felt like coming home.This is a great book for kids, and it's not a bad book for adults, though my adult self does have issues with it that I didn't when I was a child. For instance, Bradley's parents are fine, his home life is fine. Why is he such an entitled, nasty little liar at the beginning? Had no one before Carla ever attempted positive reinforcement and unconditional love on him? It seems like his mother is firmly on that train, so I guess I find him unbelievable at the start of the book. Also, kids were never as nice as the ones in his class are when I was a kid. They forgive Bradley so quickly. He goes to one birthday party and a girl already has a crush on him! Not realistic.

One might guess that a book that doesn’t contain a single period might be hard to follow, but it’s not. It flows. One might think that a book that focuses on a different character each section might have some sections that bore, but it doesn’t. Every single person gets a fascinating story, and every girl, woman, & other’s story feels vital. Like all great authors, Evaristo makes us empathize with each person, even if we don’t agree with them. I wanted to stay with each character for longer. Any one of them could have stared in their own book. But I think the author made the right choice in giving each person only a section, and revisiting many of them at the end because, well, the book is perfection. It couldn’t be improved.

I seriously love her first two records and the Girlysound tapes and there are even a couple songs off her third album that I like. One time I talked to her after a concert she was co-headlining with the awful Jason Mraz—I went to her bus while he played—and my partner at the time, whose Liz Phair fandom ran even deeper than my own, asked her if she’d please play the guitar on her next record and she promised she would. But he and I were both disappointed, of course. The fact is, the old Liz Phair will never come back. She can’t. That Liz was born out of Guyville, and a desperate need to escape it. She didn’t know how to play the guitar the “right” way back then, so her chords were weird and difficult to imitate, stylistically, if you know how to play guitar correctly (though that has not stopped my ex, who I am still friends with, from trying in his own songwriting). She wasn’t a trained singer and her singing was super low and weird and often fucking amazing in its way, IMO. Now she knows how to play the guitar correctly and she uses boring normal chords and she sings the right way and I have zero hope she’ll make another good record ever again.But she did write a good book. And if there’s one thing I love as much as I love music, it’s books. This book jumps around, telling random stories about her life at different times, and the stories are Exile In Guyville-level honest. They’re often deep, always thoughtful, never shying away from her own flaws. I’d read anything Liz Phair wrote at this point. I wish she’d become a novelist or an essayist instead of a musician. I honestly can’t believe that making music can be all that profitable for her, but what do I know?Is Liz a bit bratty? Yeah, she is, and that’s okay by me. She is who she is. She’s been pretty honest about herself since the beginning, explaining that it’s nice to be liked but it’s better by far to get paid. She’s always admitted that “doing it backwards” is just fine with her because that way she can fuck and watch TV. So I dunno, don’t expect her to be 100% heartwarming and/or sentimental. That’s an absurd expectation for her. She’s not always likable, but she is an envelope-pusher, a deeply flawed person with a huge heart, and a seeker of meaningful relationships. You don’t have to like her, but don’t saddle her with misplaced expectations....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Dec 06, 2019","Dec 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44525549-horror-stories

I started reading romances less than two years ago in an attempt to learn them well enoughThis is the first romance novel I can honestly say I loved. I started reading romances less than two years ago in an attempt to learn them well enough to write them. And for the most part, I’ve thought, “I can definitely write something as good as this.” But this book is on another level. It was the first time I felt that I really wanted the leads to be together, it was the first time I actually found a male lead appealing, it was the first time I couldn’t put the book down, and most of all, it was the VERY FIRST TIME and, I think, probably the last, that a romance made me cry buckets. I mean buckets. I rarely cry at books. I shed a tear of happiness at the end of The Music Shop (look, the ending was touching as hell), but that was almost 100 books ago that I read that. And I recall crying all night in college after reading Bastard Out of Carolina but that book is a whole other level of sad (the betrayal! The betrayal!!!). This is a romance, and it made me cry big huge tears. So, damn. That’s an accomplishment.I’ll admit, I didn’t want the book to end precisely how it did, and I can understand taking issue with it, but I personally don’t have a problem with it for these huge reasons:1. This is a popular trope in romance (I can think of one other romance I read that had this same thing happen) and you don’t fuck with the popular tropes in romance if you want to have super fans. You just don’t. Don’t like popular tropes? Don’t read romance. Period.2. It pulled off the trope in the least offensive way possible.3. I agree with the author 100% when she says in her note that the female main character’s problem was not a physical one, but an emotional one. This is an essential part of fiction writing in general. The true flaw of a character can NEVER be one that is medical in nature, or anything else the character can not control to fix. It has to be one that can be fixed by personal growth, and in the case of romance, through the power of love.Whatever, haters....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2019","Oct 25, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/41945163-the-friend-zone

Here’s the thing: writing fiction is difficult, and this is Coates’s first novel, and it’s solid, but it’s not great. And that’s okay. The characterizations are often thin, and the narration, while often lovely, reads like an alien wrote it. Hiram came off like he was from another planet to me. Perhaps that was intentional, in which case, great job! I will say this for the book—it ended in a satisfying way, and that’s great. It lets me know that Coates’s next novel will be better. When/if he writes another one, I hope he makes it a contemporary story. I suspect his voice and story-telling chops will really show in a modern book.

Although none of the three sources make this claim, I will make it: women should be in charge of more things. Women make better cops, and if more women were police officers, we’d have fewer issues with police. Women should be in all levels of leadership. Women should be president, they should be the majority of senators, and they should be the majority of the House of Representatives. Could male cops have done the job that these two female officers did? Sure. But did they? Nope. Men almost fucked up the whole thing. All in all, though, this is an unusually redeeming story about police work. Even the Linwood police department, who railroaded poor Marie into making a false confession, causing her to lose everything and not receive the support she needed after surviving a violent rape, when confronted with irrefutable evidence that she had been telling the truth, rather than making excuses or denying culpability, took total responsibility for their actions. Please someone tell the horrible cops and prosecutors of the NY police department and DA office who still don’t admit that they railroaded the young men who became known as “The Central Park Five” that THIS is how you do it.

It surprised me that I enjoyed it as much as I did.I went to the University of Pittsburgh, where these characters attend school (the author is a professor there, though he was not in my day, as we’re the same age) and there are a bunch of reference that will give any past or present Pitt students lols. The sombrero man, the shop on Atwood selling low-quality pizza to students for giveaway prices (it was $4 for a whole cheese pizza in my day), the Cathedral being called “the drunk man’s beacon.” Good stuff. But even if you didn’t go to Pitt, it doesn’t hurt the book. Laboon uses such details to really enrich a story that, I suspect, has the main intention of teaching people about how cryptocurrency works, as well as both its benefits and pitfalls. Even with that kind of dry (to some—including me) background intention, the book manages to be something of a thrill ride!The characterization is excellent, and there are a number of interesting side characters who really fill the book in. The funniest is Violet, a freshman who adopts new political philosophies every day she spends meeting new people in college—she goes from Marxist to Anarchist to monarchist over the course of a few days.

It had many good points and overall, I agree with his assessments. But it also had some issues. For instance, it held things up as facts that are actually much more complicated than he realizes. In other words, he seems to believe he’s an expert on some things he’s not an expert on. Most notably, eggs. He keeps using egg consumption as an example, claiming that first doctors advised against eggs because of their cholesterol, then, he claims, people died of other diseases because of what they replaced eggs with. That’s really simplistic and not quite accurate because:1) people kept eating eggs2) people kept dying from heart attacks and strokes, and3) the ones who “replaced” eggs with sugar and processed foods are demonstrably different from those who replaced it with, say, oatmeal. Repeatedly throughout this book, the author claims that now doctors agree that eggs are “safe.” First, “safe” is very different from “healthy.” Egg producers are still not allowed to claim that eggs are “healthy” because there is no evidence supporting the claim. According to research, you do not get any health benefits from eggs, it’s only that it’s possible that eggs won’t kill you any faster than any of the other unhealthy shit people eat. So, yeah dude. Please don’t repeat unscientific myths in your book that’s partially about the proliferation of myths.Next, re: higher education. It’s true that grades are inflated, but I saw so many people flunk out of the math and chemistry classes I took at a community college 3 years ago. I’m not saying the author is wrong, just that the customer isn’t ALWAYS right. Maybe the standards at community colleges are actually more rigorous than the ones at middling institutions desperate for students. I need to give this a little more thought, but I’m pretty sure I think that all middling institutions should be community colleges. No one should live on campus. College shouldn’t be student playtime. I see my peers starting to send their kids off to college (my peers who had kids before they were 20, that is) and I think “Your kid is an idiot and should not be in college. She clearly is there only for social reasons, not for an education.” But community college isn’t like that at all. The people there are determined to work and learn—no one goes to CC because it’s a place to party. Last, I hate it when people say, “The US is a republic, not a democracy,” because idiots believe this is some kind of an indictment of the Democratic Party, and makes the Republicans better. But the US is a democratic republic. We elect leaders to make decisions. Is this so hard to say? Does the author just want to give fodder to dumbasses? Then again, stupid people don’t read books, so I guess, like, whatever man....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 10, 2019","Sep 10, 2019",,Pocket Book,view (with text),/book/show/26720949-the-death-of-expertise

Literally, I couldn’t watch it, I had to turn it off. But I remembered liking the book a lot in 8th grade, so I took it from the library.Far better than the film, I’ll tell you that much! I’m even more impressed with the author for having written it so young now than I was as a kid and I believed writing wasn’t all that difficult (now I know—yes it is. That’s why I’ve stopped giving books bad ratings, because I feel too guilty, as writing is super hard). It’s a pretty good book. I can’t believe I was given this book with so much cigarette smoking in it to read in middle school. I wonder if kids are still assigned it. I kinda think they probably aren’t. I can act like reading and liking this book didn’t influence me to become a smoker, but I don’t know if that’s true. What I DO know is true is this:-I thought smoking was cool (tuff??)-I started smoking as soon as I could-I liked this book a lot and had a Marxist dislike of all Soc types-There are other things I’m pretty sure now I took from this book, such as calling cops “the fuzz” and saying “You dig?”.Not that I can blame my smoking on this book alone, but I have to wonder. Note: I’ve been cigarette-free for like 7 years or something.One other thing. It’s so funny when the kids in this book yearn for a place where there are no Greasers and Soces and where people are just people because, you know, there is a place like that. EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD EXCEPT WHERE THEY LIVED. I mean, even when this book was written, I don’t think those particular sub-groups were everywhere, right? I know that’s not really what they mean, it’s more of a “Can’t we all just get along?” (in the words of Rodney King) or a “People are people so why should it be you and I should get along so awfully” (in the words of Depeche Mode) kind of thing, but still, it’s a bit humorous. Especially in the film, where everything sounds so absurd, and I think they left off the part about everyone just being people, so it’s even funnier.

Maybe not EXACTLY what will happen, but I expect it to hit certain beats and deliver what I expect.Not this book. It took me in a completely different direction than I thought it would at the beginning. It went from being interesting to being riveting. I can honestly say there were a couple points in it that shocked me to the extent that I was left momentarily breathless. I won’t tell you anything about the book. Don’t read the description. Let the surprise wash over you like it did for me. It was the kind of thing where I said, “I’ll go to bed after this chapter,” and then at the end of the chapter I was like “HOLY SHIT, WHAT THE HELL?” And then I’d read another chapter.Was the book perfect? No, I guess not. It’s probably more of a 4.5 star book. My biggest complaint is that I wanted more of an afterward than I got. But that complaint is A) exactly the kind of thing people say about really good books (“I wanted more!”) and B) soooo me. When I was a kid, my older sister would sometimes, if I asked her, make up new endings to things that either ended with me wanting to know more or that ended so sadly I couldn’t bear it. She wouldn’t change what was there, she’d just add more for me, so I could sleep at night. Maybe I can get her to read this book so she could do that for me. In any case, I suspect this issue is mine and not the book’s, so I gave it its 5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"May 09, 2019","May 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39010828-famous-adopted-people
