To make ourselves feel better we belittle others, and we build walls around ourselves so that our own self-worth is not threatened. But each of us is simply trying make sense of the world and live as best we can.Through his story, Charlie shows us the reality of this facade. His demise makes us feel sad for what is lost. But this is not just Charlie's story - it is the tragedy we all share. We all begin as simple creatures, slowly building upon our ignorance and growing steadily stronger and wiser. But eventually, in death or slow decay we too will lose everything we have gained and worked for. So what did we learn from Charlie? What gives us happiness? What fulfills us and makes us complete? Is it the need for self-improvement and achievement, or do we gain from a simple life, lived with kindness and respect for others? Is it better to have had and lost, or does the losing destroy the value of ever having once had? Is ignorance, in fact, bliss? There are no answers here, just very good questions.

Yet there is no scientific grounding for his assertion that dreams are coherent narratives that are created by the subconscious to express hidden desires and intentions. Nor is there any rigour in his methodology for dream interpretation - it's astrological in its subjectivity. I'm not a psychologist, but I can imagine there could be some utility to dream interpretation, in the same way it might be insightful to interpret a piece of literature, or a film, or music, or to undertake a Rorschach test, in that the interpretation reveals something about the interpreter. This is perhaps even more true of dreams, in that the dreamer has an acute sense of identifying with the dream, which is not usually the case with other art. But none of this requires Jung's strange metaphysical claims. Similarly, the Jungian archetypes, and the idea of the Collective Unconscious are compelling from an anthropological, or metaphorical perspective, but are completely unfounded as a method for understanding psychological phenomena....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Mar 21, 2021","Jul 09, 2021","Mar 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/393363.Man_and_His_Symbols

The stories are very short - only a few pages each, on average, but I was generally impressed with the quality of the writing, which exceeded my expectations for a self-published book*. The prose is polished, and the stories themselves possess a lot of originality and cover a range of diverse subjects, mostly about ordinary Australian life, but sometimes delving into sci-fi or speculative territory. My main criticism is that the style is very geared towards short story writing competitions, and has a close adherence to that distinctive voice and prose style that seems so coveted by judges and writing workshops. It would be interesting to see where this author could go with a little more emphasis on finding a unique and independent voice.* Edited: It's not self-published....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 03, 2021","Mar 13, 2021","Feb 25, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/50973387-dead-people-don-t-make-jam

From its perfect opening sentence, Alexis is written in an captivating, intense, elegant style. It is an epistolary novel comprised of a single letter: a confession. Its manner of treating matters of homosexuality are perhaps too subtle and understated by today's standards, but must have been groundbreaking when the novel was published in the 1920s.

Throughout the book tThere is more to Gulliver's Travels than you might expect based on the numerous adaptations we have all seen in popular culture. Throughout the book there is a progression from the familiar, jaunty adventure to more serious satire and criticism. The first two parts of the book (Lilliput and Brobdingnag) are most recognisable, most straightforward in their premises, and are perhaps the most entertaining of the four parts in terms of their storytelling. By the third part, something has developed akin to modern science-fiction. The premises become more detailed and complex, allowing Swift to isolate, highlight and contrast various aspects of culture, politics, science and technology, history and anthropology. The relevance of many of these analyses is diminished by the passage of time, but they are nonetheless thoughtful and trenchant. The fourth section is most surprising in its tone and in the degree of its pessimism. It presents a bleak portrayal of humanity as irredeemable by its very nature, and therefore purposeless in its striving. All of this makes Gulliver's Travels quite a strange yet compelling mix of styles and themes. It is perhaps itself like an adventure into unknown territory: it begins in search of one thing and ends up discovering something else entirely....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jan 22, 2020","Jan 28, 2020","Jan 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7733.Gulliver_s_Travels

In retrospect, 2020 was perhaps not the best year for this undertaking, given the kind of year it turned out to be. After COVID sent us into lock-down I started working from home, where I have remained since March. Working from home has been wonderful, as I've been able to spend more time with my family and less time commuting. However the loss of my long (4 hour) daily commute has resulted in the loss of my dedicated allotment of time for reading, so I have had to carve out time elsewhere. In spite of this I managed to stay on track until about September, when issues at work suddenly increased my workload to include weekends and evenings, leaving no time at all for reading (or Goodreads) and preventing me from reaching Proust before the end of the year. Despite the disappointment of not reaching my goal, looking back on the year I am fairly proud of how far I managed to progress in the face of 2020. These are the books I read this year:1532, Gargantua and Pantagruel, François Rabelais ☆☆☆☆1615, Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ☆☆☆☆☆1726, Gulliver's Travels, Jonathan Swift ☆☆☆1749, The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling, Henry Fielding ☆☆☆☆☆1759, Tristram Shandy, Laurence Sterne ☆☆☆☆☆1782, Dangerous Liaisons, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos ☆☆☆☆1785, The 120 Days of Sodom, or The School of Libertinage, Marquis de Sade☆☆1785, Jacques the Fatalist, Denis Diderot ☆☆☆1813, Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen ☆☆☆1818, Frankenstein, Mary Shelley ☆☆☆☆1833, Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse, Alexander Pushkin ☆☆☆☆1842, Dead Souls, Nikolai Gogol ☆☆☆1847, Jane Eyre, Charlotte Brontë ☆☆☆☆☆1847, Wuthering Heights, Emily Brontë ☆☆☆☆1848, Vanity Fair, William Makepeace Thackeray ☆☆☆1857, Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert ☆☆☆☆1860, The Mill on the Floss, George Eliot ☆☆☆☆1860, First Love, Ivan Turgenev ☆☆☆☆☆1862, Les Misérables, Victor Hugo ☆☆☆☆☆1866, Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoyevsky ☆☆☆☆☆1867, War and Peace, Leo Tolstoy ☆☆☆☆☆1869, The Idiot, Fyodor Dostoyevsky ☆☆☆☆1871, Middlemarch, George Eliot ☆☆☆This list is of course, highly idiosyncratic, and was based initially on books I owned but had not yet read, and then filled out with a little research. There are many notable authors who were missed from the list, and for various reasons I chose to skip for now, including Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allen Poe, Alexandre Dumas, Elizabeth Gaskell and Nathaniel Hawthorne among others. Of the books I read this year, Les Misérables was by far my favourite, perhaps followed by War and Peace (though with significant reservations).So, at the end of the year I managed to get as far as the year 1871, with 14 more novels to go before reaching Proust. But I don't intend to continue with the tour just yet. I am feeling a bit burned out by the Nineteenth Century, and I could not bear to pick up another Dostoyevsky just yet.

He covers the basics before moving on to some quite interesting and esoteric concepts, many of which were new to me. He makes reference extensively to examples within literature, and was able to reframe or cast in a new light several novels I have already read, as well as enticing me towards several new ones.From the first letter - the somewhat disturbing “Parable of the Tapeworm” - Vargas Llosa characterises writing as a serious and consuming endeavour; symbiotic in nature, not unlike the relationship between a parasite and its host. There is no expectation that this book will teach an aspiring novelist how to write: it attempts only to illustrate the depth and breadth of what is possible through literature, and perhaps provide a couple of pointers in the right direction. Vargas Llosa has an abundance of wisdom and experience, both as a writer and as a devotee of literature, and this is a resource for writers and readers both.

These scrolls were presumed lost during the storming of the Bastille, only to be rediscovered and published for the first time in the 20th Century. The novel's structure is a sort of twisted Decameron, set in a remote castle during the months of November to February, with each day delivering increasing levels of degradation and depravity (""increasing"" here being perhaps a little misleading, for the novel begins with allusions to murder, abduction and child-rape, but it does indeed manage to escalate considerably even from this starting point). Understandably, given the conditions of its composition, The 120 Days of Sodom is an incomplete work. There are only 30 or so fully fledged days, with the remainder presented only in outline (as they are stated directly without context, some of these outlines are actually quite hilarious. I had considered quoting some of them here, but have decided to spare you). Even the ""completed"" sections are unfinished, containing many marginal notes, abbreviations and grammatical inconsistencies. The novel as it exists today was intended to be a draft for a much longer work, which was never completed (it is said that the Marquis cried tears of blood upon learning his manuscript was lost). I doubt, however that the completed version of this novel would have been the comprehensive encyclopaedia of sexuality that the Marquis may have envisioned; so fixated was he on his own proclivities - those of sodomy,  violence and manipulation of bodily discharges - that the work consistently hits only a few tones, disturbing as those tones may be. The four hundred extant pages are more than enough for the reader to get the idea.So why read these ramblings of a deranged mind, and why lend them literary importance? Ted Bundy, who killed 30 or more women, would perform sexual acts with the corpses and severed body parts of his victims. It is difficult to comprehend what could drive someone kill and mutilate another person (let alone do it repeatedly), but this confusion evaporates when you realise that his motive, as is so often the case, was sexual. John Wayne Gacy, after his first murder (which he claimed to be accidental) described experiencing a mind-numbing orgasm as he killed the boy, which likely encouraged him to subsequent acts. If these figures seem extreme in comparison to the Marquis, know that their acts are in fact described and exceeded in The 120 Days of Sodom.Such is the power of sexual desire that it has the capability to overpower all other natural tendencies. What's fascinating is that human sexuality is composed along such a wide and multi-dimensional spectrum, by which the same natural tendency in one case may lead to stable and normal family relationships - the very perpetuation of life  - and in others can lead to atrocities such as those referred to above, and described in this novel. I suspect the number of people living with sexual proclivities that may impel them to do harm to others is much higher than might be imagined; these people prevented from acting by their own moral inhibition, or fear of legal or social repercussions, or perhaps solely due to lack of opportunity. For examples perhaps less extreme than Bundy and Gacy, we need look no further for evidence than the recent examples of Geoffrey Epstein or Harvey Weinstein, whose power over others was for a time able to shield them from accountability. It may therefore be the case that power does not corrupt, it simply overcomes the barriers and inhibitions one faces, facilitating the actualisation of one's existing proclivities. Those who are able to control themselves against their instincts are pitiable in a different way: they are condemned to a life of dissatisfaction and self-loathing. We should indeed be thankful for this self-sacrifice. The existence of people who are driven to criminal behaviour by their sexual preferences - take even your garden-variety pedophiles, sadists and zoophiles - is a reminder of our own moral luck in not having been born with such desires. While condemning their actions, we must also remember that, ""there but for the grace of God go I"", or in the Marquis' own words (p41):""All these things depend upon our constitution, our organs, the manner in which these react, and we are no more able to command our tastes to change in this than we are to vary the shape of our bodies"" It is important not to overlook the horror of the crimes described in this novel (that would be a failure to imagine the totality of the scenes being depicted), or dismiss them as idle fantasy (the Marquis was able to act on some of them, and there have been others to later take up his mantle), or to romanticise the Marquis de Sade as some sort of enlightened sexual adventurer. He was a deranged man whose education, wealth and position afforded him the freedom to act upon his desires with some success. His offences were not limited to upsetting the delicate mores and moral sensibilities of his time: he was unequivocally a rapist, and likely a murderer. His sexual preferences are today classified in the DSM as a mental condition which bears his name (sexual sadism disorder). He is certainly not a man to be admired. And yet The 120 Days of Sodom has a place in literature as a rare, comprehensive and unfiltered account of this dark part of the range of human experience. It is a reminder of what the human mind is sometimes capable. And what is perhaps most unsettling, is that though our proclivities may differ, we all share with the Marquis this same underlying sexual impulse, and occupy points within a common spectrum of sexual desire....more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Feb 28, 2020","Mar 05, 2020","Nov 22, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29776923-the-120-days-of-sodom-or-the-school-of-libertinage

And so I decided to close My plan for 2020 is to explore the history of the novel by returning to its origins, beginning with Rabelais and Cervantes. And so I decided to close this year with The Decameron as a sort of introduction to the project, in order to be able to better recognise the stylistic innovations introduced by those later writings. I don't think I would have read it otherwise.In all honesty, The Decameron offers very little to a modern reader. It is very much of its time, filled with witty references to local people and places, which would have been easily understood and considered very clever at the time, but which are more or less lost on us today, even with the benefit of footnotes. Its themes are not universal. It is concerned, on the whole, with trifling subjects, witty turns of phrase, and bawdy adventures. While the stories can be entertaining, they lack the sort of substance we have come to expect today. But is difficult to criticise the book on this basis given its place in history. It was certainly outstanding in its own historical context, as is apparent in its influence on literature for many hundreds of years.One thing I found notable about the book is its high cynicism; its lack of reverence for political and religious figures, as well as a lack of credence for religious ideas in general. There is rarely a moral element to these stories, which focus instead on material and corporeal concerns. This is contrary to what I had expected, given the position and authority of the Church at the time.This is as good a time as any to note that the rating system doesn't really hold for books like The Decameron, and others I intend to read next year. The Decameron doesn't deserve anything less than five stars given its historical importance. But I feel that automatically giving the maximum rating to the ""classics"" is not all that helpful an indication as to whether a book is still relevant and worth reading today. So I will try find a balance in my rating between historical context and my own reaction as seems appropriate. ...more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Dec 08, 2019","Dec 21, 2019","Nov 15, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51799.The_Decameron

The book is filled with a multitude of attempts, each with its own character, its own aims in conveying some element of the original, and each differing significantly in style, language and emotion. There is a seemingly infinite linguistic freedom and complexity in the translation of even a poem of just 60 words, between languages that are virtual siblings. By comparison, Eugene Onegin is a poetic novel consisting of over 200 pages, which utilises a ""poetry of grammar"" completely alien to English understanding. What is left, then, must be regarded as a vague ghost of the original, and it would be pure folly to attempt an earnest . Perhaps all that survives the distortion of translation are the most salient and immutable elements: the captivating story itself; Pushkin's playful genius; and his eclectic passion and enthusiasm. As for the rest, I will leave that to the judgement of the great Russian writers, who have universally regarded Onegin as one of the singular works of Russian literature....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Mar 21, 2020","Mar 24, 2020","Nov 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/441200.Eugene_Onegin

The novel is as comprehensive a work as is imaginable. Digressions, essays and asides make up a large percentage of the word count, and nothing seems omitted for the sake of narrative pacing. The first fifty or so pages are devoted almost entirely to the detailed personal history of a priest. Later, there are sections of comparable length containing a detailed account of the battle of Waterloo, a series of essays on the clergy, an editorial on street urchins, accounts of French history and the reigns of monarchs, even a lengthy description of Paris's sewer system. But the novel is far better for their inclusion, than if they had been edited out. While these digressions may sound indulgent, in fact there is very little that is truly extraneous. Hugo's asides provide an essential framework through which the story weaves. Rather than disrupting the narrative flow, they immerse the reader in this turbulent period of French history, frame the characters and locations, and in fact serve to elevate the stakes, when the action resumes.The story itself is utterly compelling, and brilliantly composed. Les Misérables is an epic moral drama, in which characters are at once the embodiment of societal forces, while being themselves simultaneously subject to those same external forces. This creates a sort of circular philosophical perspective, a reciprocal resonance between the individual and the society he inhabits. Hugo exposes the corrupt contradictions inherent in the morality of his age; the moral inversion that is brought about by the inequitable economic system. One really feels the true horror of industrial-era poverty, the way it subverts humanity and eliminates moral choice. But beyond any analysis of the novel's plot or themes, what I must emphasise here, and what I cannot overstate, is the experience I had reading this novel, which was one of the most intense and satisfying in memory.

However there is an abrupt change of tone and thematic direction in the third book, which re-frames the novel as a love story: a choice that perhaps could have been made to work were it not handled in such a haphazard and confused manner. In particular the character of Stephen Guest, introduced in this final book, seems better suited to a trashy romance, and stands at odds with the authenticity of the rest of the novel (his inclusion is so bewildering, the publisher felt it necessary to include an explanatory postscript). Nonetheless, even accepting the new narrative direction, one's expectation of an earned, satisfying resolution is denied by a tacked-on, incongruous conclusion, which sacrifices everything for a few poignant scraps.

These discordant elements are present here, though Le Guin's writing is good enough to mitigate the incongruity, or at least allow it to be overlooked (I do wish writers of the genre would find a more elegant way to handle this problem). Though much of The Left Hand of Darkness is concerned with sexuality and love, the invention of an ambisexual society seems to stem more from a desire to re-evaluate the implications of gender on societal roles and expectations. Much of this derives from the responsibility of bearing children, but there is also an examination of the discrete elements of masculinity and femininity, and how these may counterbalance each other when expressed in a single individual. Interestingly, the novel seems to accept certain traits as being intrinsically either masculine or feminine, independent of any cultural influence.

The influence of Don Quixote is apparent, and it retains much of that Quixotic flavour. But Tom Jones is far more polished and cohesive than its predecessor.

While there are certainly many outstanding elements in its compelling, comical characters and satirical reflections on Russian life in the early Nineteenth Century, I found the majority of the writing - particularly in the business negotiations that form the backbone of the novel - to be fairly repetitive, tiresome and drawn out. The prose ranges from tight, beautiful and perceptive moments, to pages of rambling dialogue and description. The entire work is uneven, lacking focus, direction and unity of style. There is no logic to it: it just seems to shift tone, pace and direction at random. Sometimes that can be a calculated artistic choice, but I don't think it was intentional in this case.

The story seems not to be driving anywhere in particular, but it drives on regardless, and the driver enjoys nothing more than tediously pointing out each minute element of the scenery passed along the way. This is a novel built on comic wit and satire, which, I've come to realise, aren't really my thing, especially when coupled with Nineteenth Century concerns and sensibilities and packaged in bland realism. Give me a metaphor now and then, or something! Of the mostly unappealing and forgettable cast of characters, Becky was the one I felt least indifferent too, and she represents almost all of what I enjoyed about this novel. I found myself frequently tuning out when she wasn't around, barely expending the effort to keep track of which Crawley was which, or who was married to whom, or in which park did each now happen to take their walks of an afternoon (as compared to last week), and who enjoys a little claret with their meals now and then, and is tonight's veal to their liking? - all for very little payoff.

It is unfortunate that so much of the linguistic inventiveness is obscured by the need for translation, as well as forgotten references and changes in meaning and pronunciation over time. However the translator did an excellent job of conveying the spirit of Rabelais’ original words in contemporary English. The edition I read is the newer Screech translation, containing all five books appearing in published order (a departure from the conventional order, where Gargantua appears first), as well as several supplemental almanacs and prognostications, which provide some interesting context but are by no means integral to the experience. If you are looking to read the whole of Gargantua and Pantagruel, research the edition - another one I came across in a bookshop did not contain all five books (I've found these Penguin Classic editions to be fantastic in general, offering a lot of additional information and commentary).Of the five books, I enjoyed the first two the most. They have more of a roguish and irreverent tone, which at times feels surprisingly contemporary. Book three is concerned almost entirely with arguments for or against Panurge’s marriage, and books four and five (this last having disputed authorship) detail the naval voyages of Pantagruel. Some episodes are interesting; others not. But the chapters are short, so one is not stuck in one place for very long. I found the extensive philosophical musings which featured more heavily in the later books (especially the third) to be quite tedious, framed as they are in biblical and historical authority, and concerned with questions that are no longer pertinent. All of which makes Gargantua and Pantagruel something of a mixed bag as a reading experience.

At its centre is the familiar comical farce of a delusional hidalgo and his squire, from which foundation Cervantes finds room for a multitude of philosophical and psychological digressions, uncovering themes and implications so wide-ranging as to defy concise encapsulation. Foremost is the likable character of Don Quixote himself, whose blend of intellect and delusion is something familiar to us. Don Quixote speaks to the power of fantasy, and we are sympathetic towards his desire to do good and to strive for something greater than himself. But his character also hints at the potentially damaging capacity of self-deception as an isolating container for ideology, and an engine for misguided action. There is something of David Foster Wallace in Cervantes' conflicted esteem and criticism of this double-edged potential of entertainment (the analogy of chivalry romances being the TV of their time being hopefully not too much of a stretch).I was surprised at how quickly I was drawn into Don Quixote, though after the first few episodes I was skeptical that the simple premise would be able to sustain such a lengthy work without becoming tiresome or repetitive. But I believe maintaining the engagement of the reader was at the forefront of Cervantes's mind, as he is constantly playful and inventive, moving first in the direction of more complex and involved plots, then to deeper explorations of his characters, and to wider societal and philosophical considerations. Surprisingly, through much of the latter half of the First Part, Don Quixote himself is largely absent from or tangential to the plot. But perhaps the most striking and unexpectedly progressive element of the novel is its meta-fictional aspect: the way it plays with perspective and authorship, and blends and contrasts fact and fiction. Don Quixote, which depicts a fictional world, is acknowledged also as an artifact of the real world, which is then inserted back into the fictional world - all of which has strange implications for those living in both. As described within the novel, authorship is split between the narrator (presumably Cervantes) and at least three other authors, in addition to a fifth author of an alternative, ""unauthorised"" version of the Second Part of Don Quixote. Though the first three are understood as fictional, the last is in fact real, and the alternative Second Part was actually published in Cervantes' lifetime, and is likely to have motivated him to write the ""official"" version. The implications of ""true"" and ""false"" versions of fictional narratives is brilliantly and humourously explored throughout the Second Part. The novel itself never relinquishes its own veracity. However in my opinion, the Second Part's preoccupation with meta-fiction detracted from its storytelling. While the plot of the First Part had moved progressively towards a ""novelistic"" structure containing an overarching narrative with subplots, the Second Part regressed to a more traditional, episodic format. Additionally, the plot of the Second Part relied heavily on deceptions created by other characters who were, like the reader, ""in on the joke"", in order to provoke amusing responses from Quixote and Sancho. I felt something was lost of the purity and authenticity of their adventures through these contrived manipulations. The consistency and realism also suffered in the Second Part, as certain actions of characters became noticeably incongruous to their personalities. Sancho's wisdom in governance, for example, is amusing in its irony when contrasted with his ordinary foolishness, but it is out of place with his character and undermines any serious analysis of his development. Though Don Quixote is generally recognised as the first ""great novel"", I'm not convinced it is correct to call it a novel (the precise definition of which I am finding difficult to pin down). It certainly does not feel like a modern novel. Character development is not its driving force so much as humour and satire, and despite some moves towards a narrative arc, it retains a meandering, episodic structure which does not seek resolution. These elements seem to align Don Quixote more with literature's past than its future, though it is clearly a work which strives to free itself from tradition, and succeeds in breaking a lot of new ground....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Jan 03, 2020","Jan 23, 2020","Sep 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23717085-don-quixote

What is the purpose of this retrospective examination of one's life? Is it to reconcile old grievances; to come to terms with one's own faults (or attribute blame to others); to better understand one's own character, or current place in the world? It may be that life moves so gradually, and so persistently, without clear delineation, that one is only vaguely aware of having developed a past of any significance, until the sheer accumulation of minute disparate events - so many loves, shames, hopes, regrets - simply cries out and demands attention.The exercise of looking back is by necessity one of revision - the fallibility of memory being a fact frequently acknowledged here by Knausgård, and one that I think puts to rest any real question of whether this book should be considered a biography or a work of fiction. I am reminded of Ted Chiang's The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling which i read again recently. A Death in the Family seems to me to represent the Truth of Feeling side of the dichotomy, and to focus on the veracity of factual elements is to miss the emotional and human truth being told.What is so refreshing and captivating about this book is its honesty and lack of pretension. And the question of why it should be captivating at all is a pertinent one, given the amount of extraneous detail presented here. The writing is not always perfect, and the scenes are not always immediately compelling. This is not a book that grips you in the manner of a thriller: it grips you in the manner of life itself - by holding your feet to the fire; by forcing you to face the world in all its horrendous glory. Knausgård's lays out a life that is as mundane and as tragic as any average life. There is an acknowledgement that life is more about the tedium and loose ends than it is about the big events, and it is in these little snatches - these microcosms - that we find an analogue to the constituents of our own lives.

Some chaI'm surprised by some of the low and middling ratings this book and its three stories (City of Glass, Ghosts, The Locked Room) have received. Some characterise the stories as boring, derivative, simplistic, pretentious, or pointless. But for me, this is exactly the kind of book I love to stumble upon: one that surprises, and that seeks new and unconventional paths to expression. To me the writing suggests Calvino, Kafka, Borges, perhaps even Beckett and Sartre, without being derivative. This is not to say that The New York Trilogy stands beside Beckett’s trilogy in terms of literary achievement - indeed much of the ground it treads has already been broken - but I believe that novels should be judged on their own merits, on the basis their own peculiar mix of intentions, constraints and products, without necessarily having to justify their existence by comparison to other works. I think this novel stands as an exceptional work in its own right. The New York Trilogy consists of three stories, which are distinct from each other but interact in direct and indirect, linear and nonlinear ways. There is a lot of thematic overlap between the stories, and even a fair amount of repetition. Each story could be thought of as a parallel retelling of the same story, or perhaps an examination of the same set of questions from a related viewpoint. At the core of the stories is a questioning of identity. What does it mean to exist as an individual, separate from others? What does it mean to be oneself and not someone else? What, if anything, can it mean to live a meaningful life? There is an examination of the limitations of literature and the written record. The novel compares accounts of real and fictitious lives, and demonstrates more similarity than difference between the two, revealing a reflective quality to what is real and not real, a determination based more on perception than objective truth. It's an interesting perspective. The stories develop so as to always avoid the next logical narrative step. There is a subversion of purpose, of cause and effect, and loss of natural sequence (which I expect is a cause of frustration for some readers). Yet in this absence of narrative logic, these stories latch on to something else, a more intuitive and direct kind of logic. I would characterise them less as coherent narratives than as meditations. The experience is one of detached observation and interpretation, like allowing one's thoughts to arise and pass, or dropping a pebble into a pond and watching the ways the ripples distort the reflection. The prose is direct and unspectacular, which supports this kind of reading, as do the dark and ambiguous thematic implications; the lack of resolution or redemption.I was surprised by this novel - it was not at all what I had expected - and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. At the very least it inspired me to finally pick up a copy of Don Quixote and add it to my reading list....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,"Sep 02, 2019","Sep 05, 2019","Aug 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31840554-the-new-york-trilogy

I found it to be not only highly engaging but also surprisingly complex and thematically richJane Eyre has saved me from a string of disappointments. I found it to be not only highly engaging but also surprisingly complex and thematically rich, despite its framing as a simple love story. On the surface one may criticise certain contrivances of plot, improbability of occurrences, and strangeness of characters (many are typical of the novels of this time), but one cannot fault the telling: Jane's voice, her passion and perceptiveness, and her deep morality, which is grounded not in religion or idealism, but in her own experiences and her own humanity. Her experience of hardship never devolves into pathos-evoking melodrama, and her response to adversity is refreshing. She is a confident and strong-willed person, but she is also humble, hard-working and is never selfish or vindictive. Though she does not lack in courage or strength, she always takes a stance of forgiveness and reconciliation toward her persecutors - a very Christian ideal.Jane's and Rochester's romantic, brooding love, is of a questionable nature. Built on an unclear and seemingly arbitrary basis, it is yet held, quite unreasonably, in the face of extreme adversity. Both Rochester and Jane are described as physically unattractive, and certain aspects of Rochester's manner make his character similarly unattractive to the reader (his actions and motives are at all times highly suspect). Something of the basis for the primary characters' mutual attraction is conveyed in their interactions. There is a way that each tempers the other, and their love seems built upon a sort of taming, of mutual dependence and reciprocal control. There is a sense that they are each at once both dominant and submissive toward each other. This is, I suppose, a form of equality - possibly even a revolutionary one in the Victorian Era - but it does not seem to me to be a healthy or stable condition. Yet there is a forcefulness and honesty in this depiction that speaks directly to a desperate human need for deep connection. This is an earnest passion, elemental in nature, quite unlike the detached, superficial affections of Pride & Prejudice.The later section of the novel featuring St. John Rivers invokes a sort of spiritual conflict, which, though awkwardly handled at times, creates a fascinating contrast to the passions of Rochester. Here is the real crux of the novel, as Jane is required to choose between the conflicting elements of her own nature. In choosing passion over servitude, self-determination over duty, she acknowledges and rejects the false morality of the religious path, in favour of her own convictions. While I'm not entirely won over by the character of Rochester or the nature of their relationship, I'm struck by Jane's courage and the implications of her decision. It is an argument in favour of equality and self-determination, and in support of intelligence and reason, while simultaneously acknowledging that passion is essential to human happiness. It affirms the Christian virtues of equality, fairness and acceptance, while rejecting its coldness and lack of humanity, and hints at the possibility of a humanistic, rather than divine basis for morality....more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Apr 28, 2020","May 06, 2020","Jul 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/706973.Jane_Eyre

The premises are ridiculous, but they're not administered in a single, hard-to-swallow pill. So, by the time I realised what was happening I was already well and truly invested in the story, and was happy to go along for the ride. The experience brought to mind what I’ve heard about Scientology: you turn up with an open mind, expecting a personality test, and before you know it you are fully immersed in a world of Operating Thetans and an intergalactic dictator called Xenu.

I nearly doubled my target while still reading several big and challenging books, and managed to exceed my personal benchmark by almost 7,000 pages. I was able to finally get around to so many books that I've been trying to get to for years: Catch-22, The Savage Detectives, Love in the Time of Cholera, Cloud Atlas, Kafka on the Shore, The Corrections, The Bonfire of the Vanities, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Skippy Dies, Lanark, and Middlesex. I am beginning to feel like I'm finally getting on top of my ""To Read"" list.There were so many books worth mentioning, but here are the ones I gave 5 stars to: The Karamazov Brothers (Fyodor Dostoyevsky), my first book of the year, a brilliant, disordered monster of a novel; Life and Fate (Vasily Grossman), a dark, intense account of the battle of Stalingrad; The Periodic Table (Primo Levi), a love letter to chemistry; The Third Reich (Roberto Bolaño), one of his lesser works perhaps, but one that left me with a strange, inexplicable feeling;  The Savage Detectives (Roberto Bolaño), a rich, complex puzzle of a novel; Terra Nostra (Carlos Fuentes), a surreal and mystical adventure which examines the very nature of existence; Love in the Time of Cholera (Gabriel García Márquez), a brilliant twist on a familiar genre; Kafka on the Shore (Haruki Murakami), a strange and captivating open-ended metaphor; Crash (J.G. Ballard), a bizarre, flamboyant journey into a strange and violent fetish; The Corrections (Jonathan Franzen), with some of the best prose-writing I have ever read; A Naked Singularity (Sergio de la Pava), which gives me hope that the age of original and significant literature is not yet over; The New York trilogy (Paul Auster), an ephemeral novel exploring themes of being and identity; Lanark (Alisdair Gray), an autobiography built into a dreamscape; The Fermata (Nicholson Baker), a hilarious, sex-obsessed, and incredibly enjoyable novel; and finally, Satantango (László Krasznahorkai), a dense and complex work with tentacular reach. For 2020 I am doing something a little different, exploring the history of the novel from its origins, up to the early 20th Century, beginning with Gargantua and Pantagruel and Don Quixote, and working my way more or less chronologically, with the intention of starting Remembrance of Things Past by the end of the year.

Yes, Middlemarch is a wonderful and subtle account of the realities of middle-class life (what struck me in particular was its mature handling of the subject of unhappiness, not as a dramatic device, but as an earnest exploration of often overlooked human realities, so uncommon for its time period), yet the reality of this novel is page after page of overdrawn descriptions and inconsequential dialogue, all directed towards bringing to life the Reform era, a period I did not find of much interest either politically or in terms of its societal attributes. The problem rests mostly with me: I simply can't stand this level of sustained, pure realism. It's just not what I enjoy about literature, whose power lies in its ability to transcend the mundane, not simply to put it into words. I'm a patient reader, and I live for the occasional moments of transcendence that interrupt the inevitable tedium of very long books. One may equally criticise other novels, such as Moby-Dick, War and Peace, The Brothers Karamazov, Don Quixote and Les Misérables for their length, but I feel each of these contains something singular and fundamentally important about the human condition, such that one would be lessened in some small measure by not having read them. I do not feel this way about Middlemarch. What is so tediously revealed here is not rare, but is captured elsewhere in fiction - if not more effectively, then at least far more concisely. ...more",Notes are private!,1,40,1,"Sep 17, 2020","Dec 22, 2020","Dec 24, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17932831-middlemarch

It’s often described as chick-lit for men, but it’s also a sort of YA for people approaching middle age. It’s full of a kind of cynical, self-deprecating humour; a self-indulgent wallowing in one’s own inadequacies, which at times can become a little overbearing. But there is a lot of honesty too, and a fair amount in here that resonates with my own experiences. I did end up being charmed by this novel. Music is one of those things that can make you want to fuck up your life, especially when you are young. It feels so much more real, more important than ordinary life. It makes you want to drop out of the mainstream, start a band, or open a record shop. As someone who has often fantasised about just these things (as well as writing novels, opening a second-hand book store, the list of alternative realities goes on), I’ve always been fascinated and envious of people who have the courage to go where their heart leads them, even if it leads to something as mundane as a second-hand record store. I have always been one to favour safety and security, and take the certain rather than the unknown road. Maybe that’s why I have a soft spot for these characters. Or maybe I’m romanticising something that isn’t all that romantic to begin with. I suppose the grass is always greener. This would probably make a pretty good movie (I know there is one, but I haven’t seen it)....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jul 14, 2019","Jul 15, 2019","Dec 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1168081.High_Fidelity

Most notably absent in these impulsive, impressionistic sketches are the cohesiveness of the later novel's vision, it's immediacy, the earnest poetry of its prose, and its relentless focus, all of which serve to underline the patent absurdity of its depictions of violent sexuality, and in turn that of the culture it seeks to ridicule.

Han Kang depicts Korean society as being strongly gendered, with women clearly subservient and beholden to the expectations of their husbands and families. This is reflected in the structure of the novel itself, in which Yeong-hye is treated as a passive bystander to her own story, which is recounted almost entirely from the perspective of others. From the male perspectives, her own wishes and desires are never considered; she is rarely more than a slave, a useful ornament, a source of shame or an object of desire. Her persistent decision to cease eating meat is in this case a subversive act, unfathomable to those around her, the response to which is authoritarian, violent and abusive, leading eventually to abandonment and marginalisation.There is a fascinating play on words in the title, which represents not only Yeong-hye’s aversion to meat, but her slow transition to a vegetative state, a state of silent acquiescence, in which her hands are bound to the earth and her legs open and “flowering” towards the sun - a striking image, and perhaps a troubling metaphor for societal expectations of women....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Nov 30, 2019","Dec 03, 2019","Oct 21, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27191166-the-vegetarian

The subject is perhaps DFW's most incongruous since Signifying Rappers, but you have to give him credit for the commitment: this is a thoroughly researched book, and the effort needed to put this together must have been immense, especially for a non-expert. But the problem here is that the author's writing style is totally at odds with the subject matter. DFW as a nonfiction writer is at his most compelling when exploring hidden facets of mundane things. He uses frequent digressions and footnotes to create complexity, and he uses complex language to frame simple concepts. This creates a sort of fervent energy, which (since there is no risk of losing the reader on the subject matter) allows him to generate interest on the strength of his voice alone. While this approach works well when writing about something as quotidian as a concert or sporting event, it is misapplied to the already very complex subjects tackled in Everything And More. DFW tries earnestly to explain each concept, but he constantly gets in his own way, offering branching digressions where they are not needed, and serving only to obscure the core narrative or point, making the whole thing more difficult to understand, and less enjoyable. What he needed to do is rein himself in; simplify; focus on clarity and the logical organisation of his ideas....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Dec 24, 2020",Jan 2021,"Jul 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1626679.Everything_and_More_

A plDom Casmurro was at first striking to me for its unique setting: Brazil in the mid-19th Century, a place which seems at once familiar and exotic. A place where slavery has not yet been abolished; deeply Catholic, yet modern and European in its sensibilities.The synopses of this novel tend to focus on the theme of jealousy, but this is not the whole story. For me, the novel is a study of human failings, of our tendency towards self-destruction; the ways in which we are slaves to our nature. There is a kind of amorality, or at least a sense of pessimistic resignation that as humans we inevitably impose on ourselves these subtle tragedies, and though we may feel we can and must rise above them, in fact we cannot help but repeat these same mistakes - we are simply drawn to them by our nature. And it is not that we are evil, only that our passions inherently contain an opposing counterpart – in the case of love, that counterpart is jealousy, which is not love’s antithesis, but is in fact an inseparable component of love itself. Along with our failings we have been given an incredible capacity for rationalisation, an ability to re-frame and reconcile ourselves to any personal wrongdoing. As Bentinho looks back on his life, we are never really sure which of his reminiscences are fact, and which are a product of this rationalisation. But it is the quality of his experience that is salient, rather than the question of truth. Though we cannot confirm it, we suspect that certain pieces of the narrative have been distorted, and we see exemplified in Bentinho that very human trait - the complete inability to sacrifice the ego. We see what fragile and tragic creatures we are, who are unable to face the fact of who we are in reality; who must instead twist the narratives of our lives so that they can compare tolerably when held up against the ideal self, which we believe ourselves, falsely, to embody....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Mar 10, 2019","Mar 13, 2019","Apr 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34391370-dom-casmurro

The world of Besźel and Ul Qoma is alien and strange, yet its underscoring of the powerful human aptitude for compartmentalisation rings true. Its complex rules are fascinating. They are at once absurd, yet so logically consistent and congruent with human psychology that the strange premise feels somewhat plausible. The City & the City is also a powerful metaphor. I think about the ways in which we live overlapping but divided lives in our cities, and intellectually in the ways we separate along ideological lines, selective in what we choose to see and “unsee.”Apart from the premise, there is the story, which is a police procedural centred around a murder case. Neither the novel’s characters nor the details of the case itself, along with potential conspiracies and mysteries being revealed, are in themselves particularly noteworthy, except when they further build upon or test the rules of the world they inhabit.

It is historically important as it provides much of the background to Dante’s life, especially his relationship with his distant love and muse, Beatrice.My attempt to brush up on my Italian with this dual-language edition of the book was a bit of a failure. While the language has remained incredibly static over the past 700 years, Dante’s Italian is different enough to be a challenge to my moderate abilities. Additionally, his prose style is quite complex, employing long sentences with cascading dependent clauses, and his poetry takes many freedoms with the language, such as inversion of word order and a lot of elided letters, all of which make it difficult to follow. I would, however, still recommend this dual-language edition to anyone reading La Vita Nuova, even if they have no understanding of Italian. The poems must be read in Italian, even if one relies on the English translations for the meaning. Italian is a language that is made for poetry. Of course the gendering and inflection allow rhymes to flow much more easily than in English, but simply the sound, the cadence of Dante’s metre (which I always naturally read with a lowering of pitch on the final syllable), takes on this wonderful, lugubrious tone, which you just can’t get in English....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Mar 04, 2018","Mar 05, 2018","Mar 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/189546.The_New_Life_La_Vita_Nuova

After an incredibly rewarding 2017, where I challenged myself to read only long and difficult novels, I was eager for something simpler. I switched to short novels, and completed my 2018 Reading Challenge of 50 books in exactly 3 months, after which I was feeling a little burnt out. I picked up a couple of long non-fiction books for a change of scenery, then mellowed the pace a bit, finishing only 28 more books in the remaining 9 months of the year. Looking back over this year's books, I try not to be overly preoccupied with my ratings, though I find that the books I enjoyed most at the time are not always the books I remember most vividly or fondly at the end of the year.The absolute highlights for me this year were Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (Douglas R. Hofstadter), which is almost a sort of love letter to the universe; a wild and boisterous exploration of science, art and philosophy, Moby-Dick (Herman Melville), an immense work which has only grown in my imagination since finishing it, and Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels (1, 2, 3, 4), which are unparalleled in their depth and breadth of storytelling, and apprehension of the human experience.Here are some other standouts, which apart from my initial enjoyment have all remained with me in some way during the year:- The Mezzanine(Nicholson Baker)- Post Office(Charles Bukowsi)- The Waves(Virginia Woolf)- The Abortion: An Historical Romance 1966 (Richard Brautigan)- Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?(Raymond Carver)- The Days of Abandonment (Elena Ferrante)- Invitation to a Beheading (Vladimir Nabokov)- The Pale King (David Foster Wallace)- Augustus (John Williams)- Under the Skin (Michel Faber)This year, I find myself wanting to return once more to longer novels. The experience of reading the Neapolitan series has reminded me how satisfying that level of intensity and immersion can be. So I am starting the year with The Karamazov Brothers, and I'll see how I go from there. I make no commitments.

I enjoyed the hell out of this smutty little book. Perhaps it’s only modesty and some form of self-conscious restraint that prevent me from awarding it the final star. The structure and dialogue reminded me of Richard Linklater’s Beyond Sunrise. Both have this awkward, yet somehow too-perfectly scripted flow, but nevertheless possess an endearing, unashamed honesty, which, despite the unrealistic nature of the fantasy, manages to capture something essentially sweet and human – in this case the simple need to talk, and to make an honest personal connection. Both Linklater and Baker wonderfully capture those anxious, beautiful moments of connecting profoundly and unexpectedly with someone for the first time. Maybe I’m just a softie, but this kind of thing just makes me effusively happy (Oh, and the sex stuff was pretty good too)....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Feb 27, 2018","Feb 27, 2018","Feb 22, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1267512.Vox

Certainly it is highly original, both in style and content, though it is precisely these unique elements that make it a difficult novel to enjoy directly. There is a distance created, an intentional confusion, a layer of obfuscation shrouding the characters; a sort of fragmentation strongly reminiscent of Faulkner. All of this makes the first half of the novel quite challenging, though the reward is claimed in the second half, after enough clues have been left for the reader to finally understand the perspective from which the narrative originates. The novel reveals itself as being not about Lincoln at all, but about the losses and regrets faced by all people, which are rendered irrevocable in death. Lincoln in the Bardo is a wonderful novel, though perhaps mostly so in hindsight....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Nov 07, 2019","Nov 09, 2019","Jan 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33290527-lincoln-in-the-bardo

Aside from the execution, the artistic merit of such works is also questionable, the conceit being either an overly obvious and trite metaphor, or so abstract as to be meaningless (critics of themystery.doc will be with me so far). And yet, sometimes such a loose and abstract work can draw together just the right combination of elements to trigger something in the mind of beholder - something of an entirely different character to the experience created by more linear forms of art. To grossly oversimplify what I'm getting at: there is art that is, i.e.: art that is inherently beautiful and masterful in its execution, and there is art that does, i.e: art that has little aesthetic value, but has the capacity to manifest something powerful and surprising in the mind of the beholder. I place themystery.doc in the latter category. And so there is little point writing about what the novel is, because what it is, is not that impressive, per se. In terms of form, style, structure, plot and character, it is a mess. But personally, I enjoyed the wonderfully unique experience of reading the novel. I enjoyed the ambiguity, the randomness, the juxtaposed elements, the puzzle of the thing. Even the ostentatious use of 1650 printed pages, many of which are blank or filled with a single image, or gibberish - yet there is no denying that the experience of hurtling through this mass of pages at such speed, being inundated with loose images and fragments, being required as a reader to actually generate a narrative - this creates a valuable and unique sensation, and one that shares many parallels with the way we experience the world. This is in no way a guarantee that your experience will be the same as mine (refer to the many other s for evidence). The novel is not really about the dozen or so little stories, snippets of which are woven throughout, nor is it about the brief scenes created by still images - rather it’s about the experience of the novel itself, the drawing together the sum total of its implications. But experiences are personal, and either the experience of themystery.doc will captivate you, or the novel won’t make a whole lot of sense....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Sep 07, 2018","Sep 11, 2018","Jan 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34129245-themystery-doc

I'In 2121, around this time of year, I read three books that left me feeling utterly burnt-out, which resulted in my two-year absence from Goodreads. I'm sure the pandemic (with its high stress-levels and disruption of the rhythms of life) also had a lot to do with it. But as I'm now finding myself developing a renewed attraction to the titles on my bookshelf, I feel it's finally time to clear my inbox of these three unfinished s, and make a fresh start.The Combinations felt like a book that was written for me. Specifically, for its themes centred around chess, music, literature and cinema; and more generally: because literature is the only art form that can utilise words to their maximal extent, and my favourite kinds of novels are those that achieve what cannot be expressed thorough any other medium. This is writing for the love of words; the expression of ideas and emotions by implication and allusion: cohesion and plot be damned. All style, no substance? Wrong, the freedom to break the cage of realism, to not tell a story, allows for a kind of expression that simply cannot be found anywhere else. The Goodreads summary describes the novel as “Kafka’s The Trial meets Robert Musil’s The Man Without Qualities”, which is entirely accurate. I remember being absolutely enchanted by the first two-hundred pages, then becoming progressively frustrated by the novel's absurdity; its failure to resolve even a single element of plot, whilst simultaneously being enraptured by the prose and the possibilities of expression that were being laid out on the page.I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone.

It’s certainly elegant, Contrary to most ers, I wasn’t all that impressed by the prose; in fact it may have been a point of distraction for me. It’s certainly elegant, but it feels overwrought and lacking in character. Banville frequently sacrifices clarity of meaning for the sake of an offbeat word or original turn of phrase (I recall one awkward instance of the word “twelvemonth”, meaning year). I don’t ordinarily have a problem with this kind of writing – in fact it often appeals to me – except in this case it didn’t seem all that capably brought about. There were so many shoehorned adjectives and adverbs, an over-description of mundane and recognisable items, a certain overused anthropomorphism of natural and inanimate occurrences, such as imbuing the chiming of a clock or the beating of the sun with emotional intent: it all felt like an attempt to instil a sense of movement and vitality into an otherwise very flat, very small story. There were indeed some lovely sentences, but I felt the most personally affected when the interjection of an occasional loose or course phrase broke apart the monotony. The novel itself is a perceptive study of a flawed character, exploring some interesting aspects of this time of reflection. There were many elements I enjoyed: of the narrator grappling with grief, his complex relationship with his wife, and the retrospective examination of the ways in which feelings and ambitions can be moulded, and change throughout the course of one’s life (or perhaps this constitutes less a change than an acknowledgement of earlier self-deception). I found the climax of the story (if it can be so-called) to be uninspired and not really credible in the context of the world that the novel had established. In fact it seemed somewhat superfluous, and came across to me as a last-ditch effort to make a mark, and leave the reader with a plot point by which to recall and justify the novel. The fact is, if all the disparate relationships and events described up to that point had not been sufficient to give overall significance and purpose to the novel, a final surprise plot twist certainly wasn't going to do it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Sep 24, 2019","Sep 27, 2019","Jan 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/236072.The_Sea

I don’t think it’s fair to dismiss this simply as a novel about an unhingedThis novel is a powerful account of the emotional stresses of abandonment. I don’t think it’s fair to dismiss this simply as a novel about an unhinged woman. Though at times extreme, the essence of Olga’s experience is genuine, and speaks to the complex and absorbing nature of that emotional state. When I was young, I saw my mother go through something similar. What Days of Abandonment captures so effectively is the extent to which an experience like this can collapse the tower of neatly stacked assumptions upon which one’s entire self-definition is predicated. Statements such as “my husband loves me, and is faithful” turn out to be fundamental and axiomatic, and when discovered to be untrue, can overturn broad, long-standing beliefs about meaning and self-worth, which take a long time to rebuild. The disruption can be overwhelming, and permeate even mundane aspects of daily life. Underlying Olga’s experience is the framework of gender roles within society. Her experience, though universal, is almost exclusively female (by which I men face quite a different set of challenges). Implicit in her experience are the cultural expectations that limit her choices, for example with respect to her children, and her standing among friends and peers. But there is be both vulnerability and power inherent in her position.While there are certainly points of imperfection in this novel, I was convinced by the intensity and honesty of Ferrante’s portrayal of Olga’s breakdown. The language and the narrative is confused and erratic, but intentionally so. I have not yet read Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, but I look forward to reading them soon, and hope they can offer some of the same depth of understanding about emotional states, as she exhibits here....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Feb 27, 2018",Mar 2018,"Dec 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77810.The_Days_of_Abandonment

But I did love the depiction of the emotional turbulence of high-school life, which vividly brought me back to my own experience in quite a disturbing way. There is such vitality and fervour inherent in that time of life, but navigating the social and personal complexities can be like a high-wire balancing act, with a misstep in either direction having potentially life-changing consequences. It really is a wonder any of us makes it out alive.Thematically, the novel centres around loss, and the ways in which we try to come to terms with it. The most salient example is Skippy’s own death, but there is also the breakdown of various relationships, the impending loss of a parent, the loss of one character’s promising sporting future due to injury, and the loss of another’s scientific hopes, among many other examples. There is often a corresponding loss of self-identity, which can trigger misguided or self-destructive behaviour, and there is a very interesting comparison drawn between personal loss and the cultural loss of history, and of our connection to the past.In exploring these themes the novel incorporates references to String and M-Theory, as well as pagan religion and mysticism. The connections drawn are sometimes overstated and don’t always hit their mark, but what does come through is the sense that we are indebted to each other to provide meaning in our lives. We are each the sum of our relationships; the result of the complex network of cause-and-effect that makes up the web of our lives. If we do in fact live on after death, if not in some inter-dimensional or spiritual sense, we do so in the memory of others, in the ways we have affected their lives, and in the stories that we tell about the past. The novel preaches the importance of retaining our history and our connection to the past. In some ways, the act of neglecting history, of misrepresenting or forgetting the lives and deeds of others is an act more tragic, and a loss more final than death itself....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Sep 15, 2019","Sep 24, 2019","Dec 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10409954-skippy-dies

While Meursault's character was of course a little unreal - exaggerated - it seemed to represent elements of something authentic, namely a profound and sympathetic apathy and isolation. Juan Pablo Castel (The Tunnel's narrator and protagonist), on the other hand, has very little that is human in him. And by that, I don't mean he's ""inhuman"" - unfeeling, psychopathic, or cold blooded - I mean that he is lacking identifiable human attributes. None of his motives seem sincere. None of his actions make sense. Of course, the mind of a deranged murderer may not appear normal or rational, but this goes beyond that. The characterisation of Castel was a simplistic, unsubtle caricature of a jealous and obsessive man. Neither he, nor anyone he interacts with ever behave like any actual human being would. I never felt like I was in the mind of an impassioned killer, but in an absurdist melodrama that lacked any connection to the real world.Certainly there are elements that are effective - the way that Castel latches onto Maria's noticing of a detail in his painting - this is powerfully representative of a search to be understood, to connect, and it also demonstrates how obsession can build from a trivial thing, amplified to become the central feature of the obsession's target. But the rest of the novel does not follow from this insight. Maybe the point here was to create something wholly absurd. Fine, The Tunnel works as a dark, absurdist piece. But I then I can't really take seriously what it appears to be saying in earnest, about obsession, and paranoia - these seem built upon an insecure foundation. I do understand that realism isn't the point here, but what seems to masquerade as ""existentialism"" seems to me mostly a poor representation of human motives and interactions....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jan 08, 2018","Jan 12, 2018","Nov 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9574908-the-tunnel

But mostly it just left me underwhelmed and bored. Robbins is much too obsessed with his quirky, idealised characters, who frankly are not that interesting. The vast majority of the novel is essentially a drawn-out setup to the promised climax in the final act, which, when it finally arrives, falls completely flat. For a book marketed as a philosophical novel, its philosophy is pretty shallow. Most of the time I just felt the author was bullshitting me, and in the moments he seemed to express himself earnestly, there wasn’t a whole lot of substance to the ideas. Maybe it's because I’ve seen these same ideas expressed in more intelligent ways. Or maybe this is just a book for younger, less cynical people. I can certainly understand why someone might be enchanted by Tom Robbins’ voice; his whimsical outlook and style, but sadly it’s not for me....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 29, 2019","Nov 04, 2019","Oct 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9570.Another_Roadside_Attraction

It's not really a story with This was much better than I had expected, based on other s, and I think expectation is everything with this novel. It's not really a story with a plot, and the characters experience little in the way of change or development. And it’s not quite a stream of consciousness, either. It’s kind of a mix of impressions and dialogue; the world seen through the mind of its young protagonist. The experience reminded me a bit of Gaddis’s JR, and I think the best way to read this kind of impressionistic narrative is quickly and loosely, without giving too much attention to keeping track of the characters, just sort of letting the thing wash over you.The way Doyle captures the spirit of childhood is spot-on, and through its sequence of vignettes the novel paints a vivid picture of Ireland somewhere around the middle of last Century. The narrative voice feels authentic, and avoids many of the common cliches and tropes of child narrators, like false innocence, or using the child to emotionally manipulate the reader. It is an intelligent perspective. There is a kind of raw humanity at play in these children, untempered by the refinements of adulthood. They are sharp, ruthless, and amoral. They children have an expectation of order and certainty in the adult world, which is challenged as those around them fall prey to weakness and failure. Between the lines of happy play we can see the repression, the frustration and the violence of the child’s world, elements which are paralleled in the adult word, which is equally beset, though perhaps in more complex and insoluble ways. There is a sense of the cyclical nature of these problems; the ways they inevitably propagate from one generation to the next. But there is also the small hope that comes in recognising these failings, and striving in oneself to do a little better. * * * * * * *My copy of the novel, which I purchased second-hand, has the following written in the title page:Darling Timmie,My third Christmas with (you? - word omitted)is as lovely as the first.thankyou for making my 1993 so special. I lookforward to an even betteryear for youloveme xox.It's fascinating to come across these kinds of notes in second-hand books. I wonder, where did these people live, and what was their relationship? It's too intimate to be just a friend, and the ""third Christmas"" statement doesn't make sense in a family context. So they must have been in a close relationship of some sort. Did it work out between them? Were they happy together, and did it last? The note is now a quarter of a century old, and a lot can happen in that time. I wonder about their story. How did this book become a small part of their lives for a period of time, what changes did their lives undergo, and what were the circumstances that caused the book to be given away or sold, for it to eventually make its way into the charity shop, where I noticed it and bought it for a dollar, and placed it on my bookshelf for two years, before finally reading it and writing this . I wonder, what will be the rest of this book's story?...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Sep 23, 2019","Sep 24, 2019","Oct 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2393203.Paddy_Clarke_Ha_Ha_Ha

The writing is incredible, and the story built on complex, interconnecting and layered metaphors and recurring themes. But the expression of these ideas can be challenging, and the conspiratorial subject matter becomes dense and difficult to parse.For me personally, there was something about the cadence of the narrative voice that made it difficult for me to fall into a natural flow. I felt distracted, unable to really maintain focus and become involved. I felt disconnected from the characters, and struggled to sustain interest in the intricacies of the plot (though I managed not to lose the narrative thread, thanks to the novel's use of repetition).

The novel provides ample criticism of both atheism and the failures of religion, with its charlatan proponents and misguided adherents.

Whereas that novel was thematically rich, infused with a sense of profound, elemental mystery, An Adultery is relentlessly realistic, even mundane. And while Theroux’s language still sings, his subject prevents his words from delivering the same power.What An Adultery does offer is a deep examination of a flawed relationship; a look at how love can shadow perception, and make fools of us all. In this way the novel’s message is deeply anti-romantic. Unfortunately, the blurb and cover give away the entire arc of the story from the outset, so there remains only a drudging sense of inevitability, and very little surprise in how the relationship eventually develops. There is not much beyond the prose itself to propel the reader through the pages. Still, the language is brilliant, and the extraordinarily detailed emotional accounts are richly drawn and remarkably insightful.

Emigrants are strange people. Having grown up among them, I've noticed a high incidence of eccentric, charismatic and strong-minded people. I'm not sure if this is cultural (perhaps Romanians are simply like that), or because fleeing one's home requires that a person be to some extent unhinged, or at least restless, lacking the contentedness to simply accept the life one has been given. In this novel I felt a connection with Maika, who as a young person growing up in an emigrant family is affected in a different way, initially feeling alienated from her cultural heritage and those who represent it, but eventually coming to understand and derive a personal importance from it. The novel explores these specific experiences in the context of more universal ones. The Funeral Party is about how our relationships with others come to define our lives, and how the finality of death lends these relationships a special richness and significance. It is a sad book, but also a hopeful one. There are things that survive beyond death: our children, the works we create, and our actions in life, as remembered by those we love....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jan 23, 2018","Jan 24, 2018","Aug 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1276445.The_Funeral_Party

But So Long, See You Tomorrow is less about the murder than it is about examining the enduring and unforeseen consequences of our decisions - both in action and inaction - and how these can haunt us, and damage the lives of others in profound ways. Some such choices are seemingly insignificant: the way the narrator antagonises over a mundane action taken decades ago, imbuing it with weight and significance, is so typical of the way we misunderstand each other daily in our lives, and the way our memories can warp the past. Sometimes it's hard to discern what our choices are from amongst the consequences of the choices of others. Is loving someone a choice? Then what choices are left to those hurt by love?

His obsessively analytical and verbose stream of consciousness creates a world rich in idiosyncratic detail, which despite being in many ways absurd, manages to feel entirely relatable. The writing is original and refreshing. It’s very accessible – a breeze to read despite its length, and fun as hell. Sure, it gets silly and unbelievable at times – maybe most of the time - but tell me, was Gravity’s Rainbow believable? How about Infinite Jest?The lightness of the narration belies some pretty dark and heavy themes. The novel explores the relationships and ambiguous boundaries between what we call genius, charisma, greatness, fanaticism, terrorism and righteousness. These are tensions that have existed in leaders like Caesar, Christ, Napoleon, but also those like Hitler, Manson and Koresh. The line that defines how posterity will regard these charismatic leaders is not always a clear or a moral one. Usually, it is a case of rationalising competing moral positions, with a lot of political and historical realities thrown into the calculus. In The Instructions, Gurion’s charismatic pull is powerfully felt, and through the escalation of the “wars”, the reader is forced to examine their own allegiances, and perhaps participate in these same kinds of rationalisation processes. The moral issues that are implied here are fascinating, but to my disappointment the book too often takes the easy way out on these questions. Levin seems reluctant to directly confront the implications of these darker themes, opting instead for the fantastical and fun. While this affected my feelings towards the book after having finished it, it did not detract from the pleasure while reading it - I can't overstate how much fun this book is.I can understand why this book would not resonate with everyone, but I found it just hit all the right notes.

The Gold Bug Variations takes a different approach. Compare it to Gravity’s Rainbow (to which it is on the back cover): Gravity’s Rainbow never spells out its central metaphor; it remains elusive and unbounded, allowed to permeate the novel in unexpected ways. By contrast, Powers never misses an opportunity to break down his metaphors, to dissect, draw together and expound on the connections. They are never allowed room to breathe. The puzzle is almost delivered in its completed form. And yet the novel succeeds brilliantly, in part because the puzzle in question is so complex and all-encompassing; it has no definite solution. The Gold Bug Variations is driven instead by the author’s irresistible enthusiasm and the richness of its themes, which intersect biology, information science, language and music – subjects with endless permutations, possessing the ability to illuminate all aspects of life, from morality to ontology, to the common search for a life worth living. This is a novel that was written on the precipice of the information age. Some of the depictions of computer systems, as well as the concerns about the future seem quaint and anachronistic – they have now become part of our quotidian reality; while others of these concerns seem prescient (the difficulty in parsing an overload of information is a troubling reality in the era of fake news). Powers writes in such an peculiarly ornate and idiosyncratic style, that I almost don’t believe he is American. There’s just something very English about the way he writes. His primary characters are very attractive (particularly the lead character, a librarian), and contribute to much of the appeal of the book. At times the relationships and actions of the characters test credulity, but they are always approached with a genuine earnestness and respect that lends authenticity to the emotions and interactions. The exploration of love and change is powerful and poignant. This is a difficult novel, one that expects the applicant to arrive qualified with a working knowledge of a wide range of subjects. A moderate understanding of evolution and cell biology is mandatory. Some background in music and computer science is highly recommended. There were many references I managed to pick up that I think would be lost on many people, and I’m sure there were many more that were lost on me. The Gold Bug Variations can be information-dense and heavy handed at times, but it is a wonderful book.

There are tales nested within tales, dreTerra Nostra is a dreamscape, an elaborate allegory, infused with mysticism, symbolism, numerology, theology. There are tales nested within tales, dreams within dreams, a mirror of our world distorted beyond reason, but not recognition. The linear is discarded in favour of the circular, the finite arc of human life replaced by an endless cycle of repetition. In this view of history as a singularity there is no Old World or New, no past or future, only man and his own fractal nature, which is at all times and places equally perverse and equally transcendent. The facets comprising the kaleidoscope of diverse cultural, religious and historical perspectives differ only arbitrarily, and from these arise repeated patterns that converge into a picture of a singular, essential human nature that transcends time and place. From this perspective the individual is reduced to archetype, one aspect of a super-organism which devours itself, growing larger only in order to devour itself still more. In its nature can be found the many ironies of existence: In the act of creation one must destroy; in conquest one becomes subjugated; in piety one is most corrupted. The thesis is encapsulated in the novel’s opening lines:Incredible the first animal that dreamed of another animal. Monstrous the first vertebrae that succeeded in standing on two feet and thus spread terror among the beasts still normally and happily crawling close to the ground through the slime of creation. Astounding the first telephone call, the first boiling water, the first song, the first loincloth.Existence itself is seen as the primary cause of suffering. The nature of creation is such that to thrive is to destroy, and to prosper, obliterate. God becomes the ultimate destroyer: the twin of the creator god, to whom he is united by this fundamental contradiction. In the religion of Christianity it is not Adam who has committed the original sin, but God himself, in whose nature sin resides as an inseparable part of His virtue; a sin He commits by the very act of creation. Man too creates, and the crimes of man are a continuation of this shared nature, the dark half of the realisation of his destiny (though let us not forget that there is also a light half). It is perhaps no more enlightening to enquire as to why mankind seeks to commit acts of evil, than it is to ask why the waves seek to erode the shore.But the novel is not a nihilistic apology of conquest and colonialism, merely an examination of the nature that has caused this repeated fact of history, and the complex moral questions that arise from it. How can we exist as a moral species if the nature of life itself is that for one to rise, many more must fall? What forgotten price have others paid for our telephone calls, boiling water, songs and loincloths, and how can we but expect this cost to be paid again and again by the unlucky in perpetuity, as we proceed unchecked along this path? The example of thousands of years of human history does not point to a gradual abandonment of this modus operandi, but shows rather a species relentlessly striving to perfect it.

Instead, Hourglass is cryptic; often impenetrable, especially at first. You are never quite certain of what is going on, of the significance of people and events, of where it is all leading. Only when the story is nearing completion do the elements begin to fall into focus and the picture become clear. It is impossible not to draw parallels between this experience of uncertainty, and that of European Jews of this time. Hourglass portrays the minor humiliations, which pass almost unnoticed; the subtle, creeping systemic dehumanisation; and the powerful human denial that made it possible to live such a confused and subdued existence, not realising what it was all leading to, until it was too late....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Mar 07, 2021","Mar 20, 2021","Jul 13, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/217985.Hourglass

Because of this simple fact, I will never have to face an opposing army with a pistol pointed at me from behind, to die in machine-gun fire, or be standing in the wrong place when a bomb is dropped. I won't be killed in a gas chamber, my body searched for gold and burned, or be made to lie on a pile of dead bodies awaiting a bullet to my head, or be sent to prison camp, subjected to beatings and forced into hard labour. I will never have to endure real hunger, have my family or my property taken away from me, to live in fear of being denounced. I will not be treated as subhuman because of my race. What separates the world today from the horrors of that time? There is greater economic prosperity, more education, perhaps more compassion and tolerance. We have the wisdom of recent memory to remind us what we must avoid. But these are differences in external conditions; our underlying human nature remains unchanged. What would it take to find ourselves once again in 1942: a clash between major powers, a global climate catastrophe, growing inequality, religious violence, overpopulation, economic turmoil caused by automation or artificial intelligence? The seeds are visible. The challenges of this century may be even greater than the last, and the way we continually respond to these challenges defines the kind of society we will live in. We must never complacently believe that history is complete, something that has been accomplished for the benefit of those lucky enough to be living today. We continue to live in history and shape the world of the future. A novel like Life and Fate is a powerful reminder of the evil we can inflict upon ourselves, of how impossibly far we are capable of falling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Feb 04, 2019","Feb 18, 2019","Jul 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1340992.Life_and_Fate

I do enjoy her unique writing style, whose incongruity with the subject matter lends her novels a quality not often found in the genre. There is a childish playfulness, even innocence to the characters and their interactions, with occasional glimpses into a strange psychology. There are moments – what comes to my mind is a short passage in which Eleanor marvels at the way her “self” occupies her body – that seem to hint at a deeper disturbance, and knowing a little about Jackson’s own personal mental battles, it is difficult to know whether these are merely characterisations, or in fact manifestations of the author’s own habits of thought. Perhaps the fact that the two seem to complement each other so well helps to explain how this little novel with its relatively cheerful, upbeat mood manages to covey such a intangibly dark undertone....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Aug 10, 2018","Aug 13, 2018","Jul 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6393407-the-haunting-of-hill-house

Henry Chinaski is a heavy drinker, gambler and philanderer. His actions are often crass and immoral, and his behaviour gets quite sketchy at times, but despite all this, it's hard not to identify and sympathise with him. For the reader, there is a guilty sense of vicarious liberation that comes from living in his shoes. He acts reflexively according to his desires, with little concern for the long term. His voice is irreverent, offensive, funny, and very refreshing. But Post Office is not an entirely frivolous affair. Henry is in many ways a sad and lonely figure, and his story is filled with moments of deep melancholy. He has a heart. His story is outrageous, yet authentic. Coarse, yet deeply sensitive.

He does not rely on consistency of form; each novel seems somehow to be approached from a different angle. And though I have enjoyed almost all I have read, my expectations for The Third Reich were nonetheless low, due to its reputation as a lesser work as well as the critical endorsements printed on the covers of the book itself, which ordinarily so unashamed in their praise in this case appear to downplay the novel as one for his die-hard fans only. But after finishing The Third Reich I am left wondering if those critics and I had read the same book. I found the novel to be an almost physical experience. From the beginning there builds a pervasive and relentless sense of dread, of unease; a dark undercurrent that seems to induce a nearly palpable vibration. So powerful was this sensation, I felt it seeping into my ordinary waking life. I could not shake it, I felt it even in my dreams, and today I felt the need to reach the end of the novel before it somehow consumed me.

It is composed of 56 short fragments (each the length of a single paragraph) of disjointed, surreal, prose-poetry, which tell a strange and complex story through the implied connections between these impressionistic images.This was Bolaño's first novel, which he tinkered with for twenty years before publishing. It is almost like a key to his work, a framework for what would come later. It features Bolaño's obsession with sexual violence, but there is something much deeper here: a recurring questioning; a relentless search for meaning and purpose. The writing is darkly comedic, full of strange quips and asides, which seem to exist outside the universe of the novel. This is the genesis of Bolaño as a writer. It is deeply personal. Bolaño himself exists inside the novel, and the novel as much as it is about any one thing, is really about his being born and defined as a writer. It's clear that not everyone would enjoy this this kind of thing, and I'm cautious about turning the wrong type of reader onto this novel, and so I present the below passage, which is ""chapter"" 2 in its entirety:Twin highways flung across the evening, when everything seems to indicate that memory and finer feelings are kaput, like the rental car of a tourist who unknowingly ventures into war zones and never returns, at least not by car, a man who speeds down highways strung across a zone that his mind refuses to accept as a barrier, vanishing point (the transparent dragon), and in the news Sophie Podolski is kaput in Belgium, the girl from the Montfaucon Research Center (a smell unbefitting a woman), and the lips say ""I see waiters, hired for the summer, walking along a deserted beach at eight o'clock at night"" ... ""Slow movements, real or unreal I don't know"" ... ""A sandswept group"" ... ""For an instant, a fat eleven-year-old girl lit up the public pool""...""So is Colan Yar after you too?"" ... ""The highway, a black-topped strip of prairie?"" ... The man sits at one of the cafes in the hypothetical ghetto. He writes postcards because breathing prevents him from writing the poems he'd like to write. I mean: free poems, no extra tax. His eyes retain a vision of naked bodies coming slowly out of the sea. Then all that's left is emptiness. ""Waiters walking along the beach"" ... ""The evening light dismantles our sense of the wind""...If the above makes you furrow your brow and scratch your head in bewilderment, then you are probably right to give this one a miss. However if you are a fan of Bolaño and this kind of writing lights your brain on fire as it did mine, then do not skip over this lesser-known of his works....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Dec 30, 2017",Jan 2018,"Jun 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14790707-antwerp

Apart from some structural elements that don’t seem fully realised, and a strange choice in character perspective, there’s little to fault in this novel, and much to praise. Gilbert reveals depth, connectedness and universality in his themes, and his prose style is attractive, if occasionally too ambitious. Perhaps the novel’s greatest sin is its quietness; its subtlety.

It’s not until the conclusion that you can really appreciate what has been put to paper. Much more than a simple story of two parallel lives, the Neapolitan novels present a depiction of life not in isolation, but as something deeply intertwined, with each interaction becoming at once cause and effect within a complex web, the pieces reacting almost chemically to produce repeating structures across generations. The interesting thing about this story is that it seems without beginning and without end; it merely operates within two chosen points on a continuum. As with life, these stories do not follow neat narrative arcs, and do not resolve even with death, which retains one's memory in life's connective tissue.As in life, here no one is blameless. Everyone at times acts in ways that are naive, petty or self-interested. As in life, much remains mysterious and elusive. Throughout the novels certain characters remain opaque to each other, and even the hard-fought wisdom of experience cannot shine a light on all things. In these novels uniquely there is a further meta-mystery, that of the boundaries between fact and fiction, in the identity of the author and her place in the world she has described. There are these universals, and there is also the specific – the story of Naples, of these wonderful characters, of the tension between this closed community and the opening up of the world in the second half of the last century. These many stories are are intertwined by Ferrante with unparalleled narrative skill. Though there are certainly some lesser moments one could point to, the consistency of this series is remarkable, especially for a work of 1700 pages - one which manages to be entirely compelling from start to finish.  * * * * * NB: I notice that this is my 300th  on Goodreads, and so I thought I’d write something in acknowledgment of that milestone. What started as a few little notes to myself has grown unexpectedly into something much larger. According to the library export function, I’ve written just under 75,000 words in my s so far – that’s a decent sized novel, and a number of which I am both proud and slightly horrified. But though I shrink at the thought of how much time I’ve spent here, and though I am still unsure for whom I really write these s, and for what purpose, I am very grateful for the way that this site has motivated me to keep reading and writing so much over the past few years. That has undeniably been a benefit.

Their outlooks, interests and motivations, the way they approach problems and interact with others – these elements develop in subtle, compounding ways to reflect characters’ experiences and education. Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay is no longer a coming of age story, but a story about living as an adult, of facing adult challenges, of coming to terms with or undoing the choices of a younger self, built as they often are on naïve assumptions and motivations that no longer seem important. Ferrante’s talent in capturing the complex inner lives of people seems only to expand with each novel in this series.I don’t think I’ve ever read anything that leaves me so pessimistic about marriage – even Raymond Carver sometimes hints at some possibility of equilibrium – here there is only turmoil and despair. I am anxious for the fate of the new relationship that is formed at the end of this novel. But I’m also wary of a clean, convenient resolution in the final novel.

Frustration is the underlying motivation for each character, manifesting in different ways for tThe Story of a New Name is a novel about frustration. Frustration is the underlying motivation for each character, manifesting in different ways for the individuals, but in repetitive and self-reinforcing patterns that in turn create a chain of similar outcomes within the community: violence, broken marriages, and suffocating, unhappy lives.At the centre of the novel, though viewed from a somewhat removed position is Lila’s frustration, her failure of self-actualisation arising from her early marriage and truncated education. For much of this novel she is a thoroughly unlikable character who can be seen as the cause of much misery and suffering. But she is also the victim of her own circumstances, the pressures of her environment and her own ignorance. If there is a societal lesson that can be learned from this story it is of the importance of education. The violence of the neighbourhood and its culture of vindictiveness seem to stem from a general ignorance of the wider world, an inability to act with empathy and see past petty concerns. Elena’s own path to education seems impossibly difficult, threatened not only by envious attempts at sabotage but by the passive friction of expectation and ignorance even of the possibilities that life can offer. This is a difficult cycle to break.Driving the plot are several love triangles that at one time become so convoluted and incestuous as to border on absurdity. However even as the story threatens to descend into soap-opera territory, there is always an unexpected development or insight that rescues it. It becomes evident towards the end of the book that what we are reading is likely to be far more autobiographical than fictitious. Perhaps it is this basis in reality that repels the cliches that would otherwise arise so naturally if we were witnessing the contrived development of fictional characters rather than the messy lives of real people. It is also this knowledge that lends weight to the suffering these characters endure. The incidents of sexual and domestic violence, of fear and heartbreak, of personal resignation to lead eternally unfulfilling lives - these are no longer hypothetical, and become all the more tragic and disturbing....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Nov 29, 2018","Dec 06, 2018","Jun 03, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18393091-the-story-of-a-new-name

Their relationships to each other are equally complex: loves and friendships are fundamentally imbalanced, built on competition, and fraught with uncertainty and self-doubt. She captures wonderfully the ignorant confusion of childhood and adolescence, the struggle to find one’s way, the overwhelming influence of environment, and the difficulty in seeing beyond one's circumstances – constraints which are made starkly apparent though the senseless violence of a culture driven by honour and retributive justice. There is so much about the human condition generally and this stage of life particularly that she captures perfectly.My Beautiful Friend has the flavour of an introduction to a larger story.

One gets the sense of a writer simply exploring a premise with great freedom and a lack of embarrassment. Saramago allows himself to follow a line of thought to its logical conclusion, even if that conclusion is absurd to the point of ridiculousness. What makes this work is that he does not expect you to suspend disbelief. This is an exercise in conjecture, not realism. Where there are nonsensical contradictions, he is the first to point them out and laugh along with you. Saramago begins Death at Intervals with very broad strokes. He is poking around, trying to kick up a worthy subject from under the dust, and it is clear from this haphazard approach that he really has no idea of the direction the novel will take. The scope narrows suddenly and dramatically in the second half of the novel, as he latches onto the single, salient figure that this rummaging has found for him. The entire thing is as absurd as it is refreshing. The surprising strangeness of the second half of the novel justifies the meanderings of the first. But with Saramagos’s writing, it’s very much about the journey, not the destination. The author leaves no stone unturned, no question unasked, as he takes us on this strange trip. The characters themselves guide his writing, and they are allowed to roam unbounded within his imagination. There are so many surprising turns, so many dark corners of human experience that are uncovered in this free exploration, that are not acknowledged by any other writer. Death at Intervals is strange and flawed, but Saramago’s approach is just so unusual, and his imagination so free – it really is a wonderfully unique experience....more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Mar 14, 2018","Mar 17, 2018","May 24, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1456607.Death_at_Intervals

Dejima, a place largely forgotten by the world, is an apt distillation of the insularity and xenophobMitchell chose a perfect location for his novel. Dejima, a place largely forgotten by the world, is an apt distillation of the insularity and xenophobia of the “Cloistered Empire”, fearful of external influence and resistant to change (This attitude would later see an abrupt reversal, leading eventually to Japan’s imperial aspirations in the 20th Century, culminating in the atomic explosion over almost this exact location. I’m sure this is not a coincidence - the seeds of necessity which precipitate this later drive to modernity are planted here, in this story). The time and place are wonderfully evoked, as is the interplay between the two cultures.The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet is slow to start, only really opening up as the story of Orito Aibagawa develops, around half way through. But the second half of the novel is a wonderful experience, exploring ideas of love, honour and duty as well as the decay and death of the old world. Throughout, the focus remains on the personal, the cultural differences highlighting the universals of human experience. In both cultures we see the same hypocrisies beneath the professed values of duty and honour. These are often a façade, a tool which can be utilised by those in power. Human history is messy, and the striving for even simple pleasures is often interrupted, or rendered impossible by one’s relationship with power. The interactions between people are never to be taken at face value, and true motives are often hidden. In this novel, the fraught nature of human relationships is frequently contrasted against the simplicity of a game of Go: If only, Shiroyama dreams, human beings were not masks behind masks. If only this world was a clean board of lines and intersections. If only time was a sequence of considered moves and not a chaos of slippages and blunders.My main criticism of the novel is stylistic - I find such extensive use of dialogue to be quite draining. But this is a personal preference. Mitchell’s use of language is otherwise excellent, and the story is lush, enchanting and surprising....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jun 11, 2019","Jun 20, 2019","May 17, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8720194-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet

I understand this interpretation ignores historical context, but it is hard to take seriously the ennui suffered by princes and counts who glide comfortably above much deeper and more significant suffering. It may have been easier to overlook these problems were not any significant mention, let alone thoughtful treatment of the subject entirely absent from this novel. That is not to say that there is nothing of significance in the characters and the story of War and Peace, just that apart from its length, it is not particularly distinguished among the novels of its period, and if that were all there was to it, I would have been disappointed. WarThe sections concerning the Napoleonic wars are alone worth the price of admission. Tolstoy's thesis of a chaotic human history - one whose direction is defined not by the grand actions of great figures, but by cumulative accidents and the mysterious chaos of the mob - these ideas are most compelling. Tolstoy examines the ethereal nature of Napoleon's genius, and the narrative that surrounds it. He questions the importance of military tactics in determining the outcome of battles, acknowledging that so much is determined by the accumulation of factors that are hidden in the minds of individuals, which pass, fleeting and unnoticed. These questions probe deep into human psychology: the myriad heuristics and biases we unconsciously employ in order to impose a logical causal sequence; a coherent narrative, across essentially chaotic events. Tolstoy argues that power and control are in many ways an illusion we are compelled to create. Taking the example of Napoleon, historians are in retrospect able to build a narrative arc of a rise - defined by genius - and a fall - precipitated by a loss of genius. Yet in which direction does the causal arrow fly: did Napoleon's genius win him Austerlitz, or was the victory at Austerlitz simply attributed to genius after the fact?The perspective that these ideas engender is not limited to the battlefield, but can be applied to all areas of human endeavour. One can see it in political movements, or in the corporate world (where I spend most of my time): there is a natural human inclination to elevate, to create narratives of leadership and power, to attribute success to individuals, where it is more correctly attributable to groups, or in many cases, simply to luck and circumstance. Aside from bulwarking against the potentially catastrophic outcomes of such tendencies (the creation of dictators and despots, for example), we must understand that there is a critical tension here: these tendencies are in fact necessary for stable human societies to function in the way they always have. Why else would we agree to follow others, or cooperate in groups, if not for our compulsion to build and accept the stories we invent about ourselves, our cultures and our leaders?

It explores and critiques a wide range of cultural themes, such as loyalty, race and ethnicity, isolation and segmentation, the justice system and the media. The interesting thing about the way these elements are portrayed, is that you are never really sure whose side Wolfe is taking. The novel seems to attack on all sides (the apparent lack of narrow political motive is refreshing), but it does so with a certain level of care and understanding towards its characters and the social positions they represent, so that one often feels simultaneously drawn to and repulsed by them. These characters, while archetypical, are well-formed and believable. With one or two exceptions, the plot seems to develop naturally and logically from the underlying motives of the characters and tensions within the system, rather than from an obvious desire to parody.

I like being surprised, and I enjoy the process of discovery, especially for those books that take a novel approach, or sidestep literary conventions. However, I feel that in the case of Europe Central, I could have used a brief introduction or primer. Some prior exposure would have helped me reach an understanding and appreciation of this novel more quickly. Like many readers I struggled early on, and seriously contemplated abandoning it. I think the reason for this initial resistance arose to some degree from my own misaligned expectations and lack of patience, but more substantially from an inability to form a conception of the novel’s shape and intent. Throughout the first several chapters, I wasn’t really sure what I was reading: perhaps a loose collection of short stories, or could there be a narrative though-line forming, or maybe the concept is more impressionistic? Without something firm to grasp, I felt a growing friction with the novel. I was unable to form a connection, or differentiate its central narratives from its peripheral (which is important for a novel of this length).The opening is strong. Steel In Motion is fluid, intriguing and enigmatic, introducing the metaphor of the telephone, the centre of operations that is “Europe Central”, which is a recurring motif throughout the novel. The seven chapters following are presented essentially as standalone short stories. Some are powerful and moving; others are less compelling. Some bear only a tangential connection to the events of the Second World War. Opus 40 introduces Shostakovich, whose character rather than being another fleeting presence, turns out to be the backbone of the novel (though I wasn’t aware of this at the time). I admit that I found the early Shostakovich chapters quite dull. Of what significance were the private life, artistic desires and sexual relations of this Russian composer in the context of a conflict in which people were dying horribly in their millions? I found the parallels being drawn between the features of his compositions and his personal and political life to be extremely tenuous and unconvincing, not to mention excessive.I was drawn in when the action moved closer to the military conflict itself. The Sleepwalker places us into the mind of Hitler. Breakout, The Last Field-Marshal and Clean Hands explore questions of culpability within the military command structure, in an environment where moral responsibilities are at direct odds with unquestioning loyalty. These chapters were perhaps the turning point for me; the moment of connection. From here, the novel moves from strength to strength. Ecstacy is a short yet beautiful expression of unrequited love, which though forming part of the Shostakovich narrative, could just as easily be read as a standalone piece (Something about the use of a book as a vicarious proxy for oneself was reminiscent of scenes in The Magic Mountain). The surprising Airlift Idylls is an intense piece of surrealist prose, which for me was a return to the promise of the novel’s opening.As the various characters and motifs are referenced, reprised and recombined in later chapters, the novel begins to realise a sort of thematic unity, despite the seeming lack of connectedness between some of the stories. I regretted my earlier dismissal of the Shostakovich story, which is the centrepiece of the novel, the point around which its themes spin and coalesce. The gestalt of the novel is built not on a singular narrative, but rather on the products of these associations.In the lengthy Opus 110 and the final few chapters, we reach the resolution of the Shostakovich narrative. Though I’m still not entirely convinced by the musical analysis, which implies something all too conscious about the composition, the second movement of his Opus 110 is certainly something remarkable (listen to it!), and I am certain that it does in fact contain all that Vollmann attributes it.Throughout the novel I was troubled by the question of historical accuracy. The novel relies almost entirely on actual events and real historical figures. These are extensively researched (with sources cited), but the truth is treated very lightly. Even being aware of this I still retained some apprehension and found it difficult to abandon myself entirely. I understand there is always a balance to be struck in historical novels between accuracy and literary license, but the fact is that a novel like this can slot imperceptibly into one’s own recollection of learned history making it difficult to later tease apart what was fact and what was fiction. So while I understand that historical accuracy was not the author’s intention here, I am not entirely comfortable with the outcome.As you can imagine I'm conflicted about this rating. My experience with the novel was less than wonderful at times, yet in many ways I feel it deserves the maximum score nonetheless. So take the rating with all of the above as caveat. I found Europe Central to be an extremely rewarding experience, but it needs to be approached with patience, and the right expectations....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Jan 21, 2019","Feb 05, 2019","Apr 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12398.Europe_Central

While the comparison is amusingly excessive, it is true that this book is in fact, the real deal.What’s incredible is that this novel was written by an actual, real-life New York public defender. That’s incredible because: a) the novel is not what you’d expect from someone writing about his profession – sure, it reflects a intimate relationship with the job and is deeply entrenched in its inner workings, but it’s not a procedural – it constantly breaks out of itself to explore the wider universe, in the way that all truly great novels do (in this, I am myself reminded of Melville, as well as Mann); and b) Sergio de la Pava can really write - not just competent sentences, but hold together such an sprawling, expansive, encompassing narrative, a true melting pot of literary influences, highly original and creative, so full of passion and intertextuality. Yes, there are times that the writing style is slightly odd, and one could argue that the dialogue on the whole is not congruent to how real people speak to each other. But these are superficial criticisms. What comes through in this work is – and contrast this with the majority of works in the PoMo category - an overwhelming sense of honesty and sincerity. It’s the spirit of someone who loves to dream, who takes pleasure in the act of creation, who is not self-servingly seeking the heights of literary form, but merely searching for sincere self-expression. Arguably, A Naked Singularity is not as polished as many of the works it can be compared to, and from which it clearly draws influence: the DeLillos and DFWs of the world. Compared to these it is something of a rough diamond.

But finding the time for that has proved difficult. And while I think the film is important for a full appreciation of The Last Samurai, the novel does provide enough context for it to be understood alone.The novel itself is an original, highly innovative work, making bold and unexpected decisions in terms of its structure, narrative, viewpoints, and plot. Despite fairly static conditions in the first half, and some fairly dry topics covered, the novel manages to be highly engaging and entertaining (I finished these 500 pages in less than a week). The close view into Ludo’s mind during his learning and development, filled with detailed discussions about art, language and science, were a pleasure to read. The experiences of Ludo and his family provide a nuanced framework for the examination of the interplay between genius, ambition and success, as well as an exploration of family and its influence on personal identity.My only criticism of the novel is that the second half is comparatively underdeveloped. There is a repetitive structure that mirrors Seven Samurai, and it felt as though the author was afraid that the repetition would become tedious, and so the final few chapters, including the culmination of Ludo’s paternal search, felt somewhat truncated. Which is a pity, as some of these latter dialogues are high points for the novel, and I feel that there was potential to explore the themes that had been established much more deeply in these later stages....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Oct 26, 2018","Nov 06, 2018","Apr 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/190381.The_Last_Samurai

What follows does not deliver to the promise of this opening: Fire - The Descent abandons the external world, turning inwards to the tortured mind of the declining Virgil. In this dark, furious dreamscape, we stand upon ever shifting terrain, never in control, unable to separate the real from the imagined. From this foundation rises Earth - The Expectation, which in the dialogue with Augustus - one that discusses the nature of art, power, death, glory and duty - that forms the heart of the novel, returns us to the world of the real, though the fantastic is close at hand. Finally, in Air - The Homecoming, all fetters are removed, and the mind soars where it may. For all its ambition, much of The Death of Virgil is undeniably dense, abstruse, and difficult to follow. Its philosophy, though rich, is loosely articulated and hidden in language that tends to obscure meaning in ambiguity and tautology. What really elevates this novel is its aspiration, its experimentation, its history: the echo of the experience of Broch's flight from the Nazis with his own manuscript is ever-present, lending the work an additional gravity that roots it deeply in the dark truths of the modern world, even when the narrative seems to have lost all grip on reality. Though it is inconsistent, and difficult, this late work of modernism is notable for what it strives to be, for what it challenges, and for the potentials it reveals in the literary form. The breadth of its ideas and the corresponding lack of structure make for a challenging read, but a rich source for contemplation....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Jul 06, 2018","Jul 28, 2018","Mar 10, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1799255.The_Death_of_Virgil

Perhaps in this case its accolades are working against it, having won the National Book Award, Pulitzer Prize, and recommendations from Oprah and Barack Obama. It’s reasonable to question whether it’s really deserving of these, though I have come around to the fact that prizes and endorsements are not necessarily indicators of quality. I personally enjoyed the novel, though not unreservedly. The Underground Railroad is essentially an adventure story; one that maintains a reasonable pace and degree of engagement. The choice to depict a literal underground railroad is an interesting one, as it introduces a fantasy element, which is expanded upon in the imagined political and social “character” of each state that Cora passes through during her flight; each built as microcosms of various types of historical prejudices and oppressions borne by African Americans. But this literary device is not without its problems. It could be argued that this fantasticised portrayal of events mythologises and detracts from the real experiences of slavery.  The novel attempts a wide-ranging examination of themes relating to race-relations that projects from the time of slavery through to the present day. However I felt in general that its treatment was fairly light, and its implications weren't terribly profound or surprising. In fact the momentum tended to falter when the novel strayed from the adventure narrative, as it frequently did, suspending the action to provide backstory or commentary. These digressions tended to expose the weaknesses of the novel: its mediocre characterisation and dialogue, and its lack of substance. The best that can be said about The Underground Railroad (which is also a criticism given what should be fairly weighty subject matter) is that it’s a generally undemanding and diverting read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Dec 06, 2019","Dec 09, 2019","Mar 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34018954-the-underground-railroad

The idea of a story that becomes progressively morMay contain minor spoilersI'm not sure what the author intends the reader to find in A Little Life. The idea of a story that becomes progressively more hopeless, without any salvation, is an interesting one. But is that all this novel has to offer? There seems to be very little underlying this series of escalating misfortunes, interspersed with depictions of self-harm, beyond the spectacle of the misery itself. The novel’s main driving force is the slow revelation of Jude’s tragic past, and perhaps some lingering hope for future redemption. If the intention was to instill a kind of pity or sympathy, the novel fails in its absolute excess, in its relentless layering of tragedy on top of tragedy, pushing the story well beyond the realm of plausibility. By the later stages of the novel all I could do is roll my eyes and shake my head as yet another improbable misfortune befell poor Jude. The characters are poorly developed and unbelievable. Jude, who comes across to me as a very unlikable character, is somehow adored by everyone he comes into contact with. Despite his emotional distance, his failure to reciprocate friendship, and his inability to engage with anyone on an intimate or personal level, he receives nothing but dedication and support. An older couple is so taken by him that they adopt him as their adult son. Even his supposedly straight best friend falls in love with him and initiates a career-limiting gay relationship with him (about which there is tension with his other, gay friend, who of course is already in love with Jude!) Yet there is nothing that comes across in his personality or actions which seems to justify this level of charm – it's simply stated and we are supposed to just believe it. On top of this there is Jude’s consistently poor behaviour towards everyone around him: his constant lying and shutting them out. It is true that friendship can hold people together through such times, but it is unclear what actually holds these friends together; what commonalities or shared experiences would be enough to overcome thse constant challenges.Jude's character is inconsistent and changes when convenient for the narrative. When Jude, who is so meek, apologetic and self-sacrificing, so expecting of betrayal and abuse, has his feelings momentarily injured by a friend, JB, who is going through his own deep personal problems, who is under the influence of drugs, and who later begs and pleads Jude for forgiveness for his action in a moment of sickness – Jude, rather than supporting this close friend who has always supported him, declines to forgive him, and instead cuts him out of his life and causes him to be ostracised from the group. What a shitty move. Instead of feeling sympathy for Jude, I found myself hoping that his friends would finally stop torturing themselves on his behalf, and just move on with their own lives.Despite Jude’s clear psychological issues, his inability to understand and be a part of normal human relationships, he is somehow extremely successful in his career (as are all his friends, who are each, improbably, at the top of their own respective fields). How can we believe that this orphan, who spent his life bouncing from abuse to abuse, managed to find a string of abusers who were so committed to providing him with such a full and rounded education? Jude is conversant in multiple languages, can play the piano, and has extensive knowledge of arts and sciences. Despite remaining separate from the education system his whole life, he has no problems going to college, and in fact is more successful there than his friends.There are many other problems with this novel and its characters, as well as its portrayals specifically of sex, sexuality and mental illness. There was one point in the novel that caused me nearly to choke in disbelief: Willem is speaking to Jude’s doctor, Andy, after Jude, who has a decades-long history of attempted suicide, trauma and self-harm, has effectively set his arm on fire and given himself third degree burns in an attempt to go longer than a week without cutting himself with razor blades. Willem asks Andy whether he thinks that perhaps Jude suffers from mental illness. Andy replies that no, he does not believe that Jude has a mental illness, he believes his problems are not in his brain but in the world. Andy, you are a shitty doctor.As for the writing, it’s generally characterised by loose, rambling descriptions and narrative dead ends. The beginning of the book is the best, and it is clear that it was the most carefully written and reworked. As the novel progresses the writing becomes increasingly sloppy and repetitive. It feels like several rounds of revision were skipped due to time constraints. There is a repeated confused mixing of past and present tenses, and new character traits that are conveniently inserted when called for by the plot, and then never spoken of again. Some passages, especially towards the end, seem hastily typed and incomplete. It's a pity as the beginning of the novel did hold a lot of promise. Its shifting of perspective between the group of friends seemed like it would lead to a rich exploration of their lives and thier developing friendships. But at some point the author made a decision to fixate solely on Jude and his misery. Jude’s character is one that had a lot of potential: the themes of abuse and mental illness are important, and I think that on a less extreme level most people can identify with elements of his insecurity and anxiety. The novel could have explored these commonalities and built something meaningful. Instead, what we have is a long, dull, farcical, shallow horror show of suffering....more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Jul 24, 2019","Aug 02, 2019","Feb 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25334922-a-little-life

The characters are amiable and the tone is uplifting. Steinbeck writes with humanity and optimism, showing us that life can be joyous and meaningful under any conditions.For some reason I was compelled to visualise the characters in Cannery Row as their counterparts from the TV series Deadwood, despite the dissimilarity of the settings. In my imagination, Lee Chong was Mr Wu, Doc was Doc Cochran, and the others were an amalgam of various other inhabitants of the frontier town: workers, vagrants, and prostitutes. There are certainly passing similarities in some of the character traits, but perhaps there is also something else that compelled me to make the connection - something shared in the cultural composition of a slum and a frontier town, in the paradox that both a ruthless entrepreneurial spirit and an unbreakable sense of fellowship are needed to survive and thrive in the face of collective adversity....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Feb 25, 2018","Feb 26, 2018","Feb 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11984259-cannery-row

What the stranger brings is Jesus, and the family immediately accepts Him, and the book clearly wants you to accept Him too. This goes beyond being a story about religious people - the novel is trying to proselytize. So much so that I kept checking the covers to make sure there wasn't a hidden ""Scripture Union"" (another memory from my childhood) stamp somewhere. This is the book an evangelical pastor might give to that kid from the rough part of town, to show him that it's cool to believe in God, and that Jesus loves even the poor and the stupid.

The narrative is extremely granular, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but when one is not engaged in the detail of the plot or characters, it can become quite tedious. The story is full of symbolism, with certain characters directly evoking obvious archetypes, and though this helped establish the novel’s mythical atmosphere, I ultimately found the comparisons (and often the characters themselves) to be a little too shallow and a little too blatant, traits which were often exposed by the level of narrative detail. As its driving force, the novel seems to rely on the urgency and drama of the war itself – something that unfortunately I never came to feel through these pages. Too often it just felt like a sequence of minor events; one small thing of no consequence after another (I admit to reading the later battle scenes much less attentively than I could have). Reading through other s, it appears that what I found to be the novel’s weaknesses, others have seen as strengths. What can I say? Who really knows why we enjoy one thing and not another? Sometimes there is a feeling, and other times that feeling is not there. Perhaps that’s really all there is to it, and the rest is just rationalisation....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,Apr 2019,"Apr 16, 2019","Feb 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17449222-the-war-of-the-end-of-the-world

In fact, I struggled with this novel for hundreds of pages before I started to enjoy it. I dislike the particular style the book parodies and resembles, and found the plot and characters to be overtly silly, the adventures unbelievable. It took a long time for me to suspend my cynicism and allow myself just to roll with the punches. While the style never really stopped feeling like a chore to read, what won me over was simply the incredible story , whose endless twists and turns cannot but eventually ensnare and immerse even a resistant reader. By the end I was cheering for poor Ebenezer, and hoping for neat and satisfying conclusion to his misadventures. I ended up enjoying The Sot-Weed Factor despite myself, but was left with the feeling that the enjoyment was mostly superficial. The book does present some matter for contemplation, but on the whole there are not too many layers to tease apart. In this regard I think the novel is limited by its adherence to Seventeenth Century literary styles, which though charming in themselves, are perhaps not as nuanced or flexible as modern ones.

I am apprehensive because it feels like a performance, a distraction. It leads me to wonder what the author is hiding. In the case of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, what is being hidden are characters who are quite shallow, usually defined by one or two tropes (this one is a nerdy virgin, this one is preternaturally beautiful, this one unbelievably sadistic). Everything is taken to the extreme, and the novel is driven by the unlikely and the unbelievable. I suppose this is where the Magical Realism label is applied to the story, but this is very different from García Márquez’s prototype, the hallmark of which is the direct, understated account of the fantastical; by contrast Díaz’s narrator is constantly drawing attention to miracles and curses, always taking the tone of, “you’ll never believe this, but…”. And the result is that I really didn’t believe any of it. I rarely felt like the characters were in any way real, or that their story was meaningful (of course the characters in One Hundred Years of Solitude were not realistic either, but the world of that novel was far more subtly profound and compelling). And yet, despite my lack of engagement in the first half of the novel, I was drawn in by the end. It seems there is something to be said for a charming narrative voice, after all. Though I never lost my cynicism, I did feel invested in the story once the several strands of narrative started to form a clear direction, rather than feeling like repeated exposition. I enjoyed the lessons in Dominican Republic history above all (though I don’t know which parts were real and which were made up – the whole thing seems so crazy). Overall, this is one of the better recent major prize-winners I’ve read. By the end, I was fairly engrossed, though not entirely satisfied. ...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Nov 02, 2018","Nov 13, 2018","Jan 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4961778-the-brief-wondrous-life-of-oscar-wao

Chabon’s prose is good (maybe not as good as I’d heard), though the writing felt more flashy than substantive, leaning heavily on action and zany scenarios.

I managed 19 novels (with an average of 871 pages each), which was considerably more than the one-book-a-month goal I had set for myself.As there are so few books this year, here they are ranked from best to worst†, each with a short blurb (links are to my s):1. Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace ☆☆☆☆☆Easily my favourite book of the year, possibly ever.2. Darconville’s Cat, Alexander Theroux ☆☆☆☆☆The prose, the prose, the prose! Just the most perfect writing I've ever read, all the way through. The novel gets weird at times, and some later developments might be questioned, but never mind about that when you have prose like this.3. The Instructions, Adam Levin ☆☆☆☆☆Comparatively light, and possibly too high up on the list, but I enjoyed the hell out of this, damn it. 4. The Magic Mountain, Thomas Mann ☆☆☆☆☆Wonderfully immersive, deeply sensitive and romantic. Beautifully depicts love's subtle victories and crippling defeats.5. Ulysses, James Joyce ☆☆☆☆☆Joyce experiments with twelve diverse literary styles and masters every one of them. 6. The Recognitions, William Gaddis ☆☆☆☆☆The prose is constructed like scaffolding, building level upon level of metaphor. Beautiful, difficult, powerful.7. The Gold Bug Variations, Richard Powers ☆☆☆☆☆An intricate exploration of scientific themes, beautifully woven around a deeply human story. A criminally underappreciated novel.8. 2666, Roberto Bolaño ☆☆☆☆☆An enigmatic novel, lacking in polish, but that's part of its charm.9. The Man Without Qualities, Robert Musil ☆☆☆☆☆A complex, meandering, richly philosophical novel. OK, it's a bit long.10. JR, William Gaddis ☆☆☆☆Unlike any other novel, which is both a good and a bad thing. Wonderfully constructed, but perhaps a bit lacking in impact.11. A Book of Memories , Péter Nádas ☆☆☆☆Intense, beautiful, and personal. Captures something deeply sorrowful about the human experience. Also quite a challenging novel.12. A Suitable Boy, Vikram Seth ☆☆☆☆Slightly bloated, with mediocre prose. But still a rich and captivating cultural journey. A very enjoyable read.13. The Sot-Weed Factor, John Barth ☆☆☆☆Well written and well plotted, but often just plain frivolous - I think this book is given much more credit for being somehow profound, than it deserves. A real struggle for me at first due to the style, however I enjoyed it more as it went on.14. House of Leaves, Mark Z. Danielewski ☆☆☆Fun and original, though not as mind-blowing as people say it is.15. Gravity's Rainbow, Thomas Pynchon ☆☆☆I regret that I didn't enjoy this more given its reputation, but it was all too wild and silly for me.16. Finnegans Wake, James Joyce ☆☆☆Let's be honest about what this is: the unintelligible scratchings of an unhinged genius. Objectively brilliant (and for that it deserves credit), but regardless of your chosen mode of appreciation, not at all a satisfying experience.17. The Tunnel, William H. Gass ☆☆☆Incredibly well-written, but an absolute bastard to read.18. Underworld, Don DeLillo ☆☆☆I wonder if the fact that I'm not American had something to do with my not connecting with this book. Not unenjoyable, but dull.19. Parallel Stories, Péter Nádas ☆☆Many brilliant sections, overshadowed by general tediousness and excess. Reading big and difficult books was a positive experience. It trained me to be more patient, and not to be intimidated. I didn't give up on any books, and while that meant I sometimes had to endure large bouts of tediousness, I was never defeated by difficulty. Reading big books is different to reading short ones - they can be far more immersive, varied and deep. According to the stats, I enjoyed reading more this year: my average rating was 4.1 (compared to 3.6 the previous two years), and I rated nine books at 5 stars, which meant I spent nearly six months of the year reading them.But this approach to reading wasn't without its downsides. The result of reading so few books (and continuing to buy so many!) is that my To Read list is growing ever longer, and is starting to reach anxiety-inducing levels. Also, sticking to the self-imposed rules meant denying myself some books I really wanted to read. I don't have any specific reading goals for 2018 (apart from continuing to read a lot), but I'm looking forward to the freedom of reading whatever I feel like at the time, and I'm especially looking forward to reading some, really, really short books.Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to read my s this year. It has been a pleasure reading all of yours and engaging in discussions with you.All the best for 2018!------------------------------------†Whatever that means.

For many years that copy has languished on the shelf, its pages gradually yellowing between pristine covers and intact spine. Occasionally, when browsing the shelves I would retrieve it and examine the picture on the cover - an incredibly drab monochrome image of some bridges reflected over a river (Dublin, presumably) - and from this I would attempt to deduce what the novel might be about. The picture evokes old world stagnation, depression and despair, without a hint of romanticism. I imagined grim faces of men enduring hard times, the bitter stink of stale beer in old pubs, a depressing general decay and death. I read random snippets of text - I recall there was mention of a funeral, but otherwise it was mostly confusing passages from which nothing concrete could be gleaned. In all I could not conceive how such a book could sustain itself for over nine hundred pages, let alone stand as the pinnacle of anything. And so each time the book would be returned to the shelf unread. I began to doubt the literary credentials of my acquaintance. But over the years this reputation has only been further reinforced. I learned more about the book - its central theme, its structure, and its author. Eventually, I began to avoid it no longer from indifference but from intimidation. Could I even read and understand such a great and difficult work? In 2015 I read both Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and did not love either - I realised later that I had made the mistake of reading them too soon (one needs exposure and experience to develop appreciation). So I decided to wait another year before reading Ulysses. I'm glad I did. I won't pretend that I understood even a significant percentage of all the subtle references and stylistic allusions, or that Ulysses was perfectly enthralling all the way through, but it does undoubtedly deserve the high position it enjoys in the literary pantheon. Joyce has taken the concept of the novel, shattered it and recomposed it in eighteen different ways. Is it incredibly pretentious? Yes! Is it sometimes long winded, or boring? Yes! Does it always work, or even make sense? No! But it is at all times thoroughly a work of genius, of limitless ambition, written by someone with supreme ability and complete control over his vision. Its influence has been immense - I can see the precursors of Faulkner, McCarthy, Beckett, Eliot, even Nabokov, refracted in its prism.What is striking about Ulysses is that both because of - and despite - its fragmented nature, it manages to depict characters who are at once transcendent, legendary, but also personal, fragile, and yet who remain entirely coherent. These are characters who are deeply human, and whose ugly natures both in body and mind are on full display. Joyce doesn't shy away from anything - I was aware that the book had been banned on grounds of profanity, but I was still surprised that the book was so unabashedly dirty, and it was not simply a prudish overreaction (as an example, there is, hilariously, a character called Cunty Kate!) Having said that, I am amused by the thought of kids toiling through Ulysses in search of the occasional lewd passage (teenage boys today will never understand the the struggle of previous generations). Personally, I would be quite happy if random obscenities were retrospectively inserted into all kinds of books, if it would help to get people reading literature again.Unfortunately, the fact that people are no longer reading literature makes it harder for a novel like Ulysses to endure. The political concerns of 1904 have faded, and the cultural link with classical Western culture has been all but completely severed in the modern world. Ulysses draws references from mythical Greece, through ancient Rome, and various English literary traditions. It contains passages in at least six languages. It is crammed with obscure meanings, and all these connections are impossible for a modern reader to appreciate in any deep or meaningful way (even a guide which identifies them cannot replace a reading of the source material). And so the barrier to entry for Ulysses will continue to rise.

Its central theme deals with the implications of imperialism, but this examination creates a much wider array of harmonic overtones, which concern human nature in a broader sense. It illustrates the thinness of civilisation, its vulnerability, the eternal fear (and strangely corrupting attraction) of the seeming inevitability of its fall and rebirth, borne out time again by the cycles of history. On a more personal, human level, we see in the Magistrate the simple shame of old age, with its accompanying loss of virility and strength. This is an allegory in itself, these attributes being so central to the perpetuation of hegemony. Gender plays an important yet perhaps overlooked function in the novel: its quintessential roles are a metaphor, and serve to isolate and differentiate the aspects of human nature that define and control behaviour in these political and social contexts.The true costs of civilisation are often borne by outsiders whose suffering is hidden, or worse - ignored. The dehumanised ""barbarians"" of the novel exemplify the fear of the ""other"", which comes so naturally to groups, and is so often easily exploited both as a means of control, and a justification for cruelty, subject to the petty motivations of individuals. In these methods one notices the stirrings of totalitarianism, and disturbingly, echoes of our own world....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jan 19, 2018","Jan 23, 2018","Dec 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11139430-waiting-for-the-barbarians

He is obsessed with bodily functions, and with the mechanics of sex. The fluids, the friction, and all the nasty odours and secretions are described in sensory detail. He has a particular penchant for describing the attributes of the foreskin: its present position as being either relaxed or painfully retracted behind the bulb, its state of cleanliness, its odour, the colour and composition of the substances that inhabit it or emanate from its vicinity; his characters’ preoccupation with the above, and its effect on their cognitive and emotional state. If you have ever wondered about such things, this is the book for you.Though the writing can be uncomfortably descriptive, the unabashed honesty with which he writes is refreshing. Indeed, these are aspects of life which are rarely written about, but which do frequently occupy our thoughts, and are in fact an important part of our experience. For the extent that they figure in our minds – in our memories and imaginations – they are seldom committed to print. For this unique examination of these hidden elements of life, Nádas must be commended.But unfortunately Nádas has a tendency to overindulge these proclivities. The descriptions of sex are often drawn-out, tedious and unnecessary (though to be fair, much of this is limited to the earlier parts of the novel). Indeed a similar criticism can be applied to the totality of Nádas’s writing: even when not depicting sex it is excessive and indulgent. Much of the time he appears to be writing without purpose, with no real narrative direction. His scenes are over-described, and go nowhere. He creates elaborate histories for his characters that have little bearing on their actions or relationships. A novel does not need to have a plot, but it does need be written with a purpose that is not purely to indulge the author.Nádas’s prose is a mixed bag. It is sometimes elegant, but more often it is awkward and clichéd (however it’s difficult to know how much of this should be blamed on the author, and how much on the translation and quirks of the original language). His scenes are deeply introspective. He regularly wanders away from the narrative into history, memory and imagination. This has the effect of distending time, and causing scenes to take on a strange, still, static quality. I’m not certain that this is an intentional or particularly desirable feature, but the effect is unique and memorable nonetheless. Nádas’s style is characterised by frequent, sudden and unexplained shifts in time and perspective. These are often difficult to follow, and this lends the novel a puzzle-like quality. Whereas I generally enjoy this kind of invitation to active participation, in this case I did not feel compelled to play along. I simply did not trust that Nádas was doing anything particularly creative or clever. It felt like a trick, like he was attempting to use these techniques to as a proxy for profundity, to imply layers that were simply not there. As I began reading Parallel Stories, I would keep a note of characters’ names, settings and relationships, in order to help follow the convolutions and draw connections between the various stories. But eventually I abandoned this practice as it became apparent that Nádas was not driving towards any sort of strong unification of the narrative. Parallel Stories is characterised by a succession of minutely detailed scenes, which do capture something profound yet fleeting about the human experience, but which often lack any wider purpose in the context of the novel. Eventually, I began reading the chapters simply as vignettes, and allowed the connections to fall where they may. I will concede that there is every chance that my own cynicism and impatience was at play here, and it’s possible that I have not given Nádas sufficient credit for his narrative style and structure. Parallel Stories, is difficult to read without a detailed knowledge of Hungarian culture, history and politics. So much of the novel is about capturing the Hungarian condition and experience. Nádas has clearly written for a Hungarian audience, and though some context has been added in the translation footnotes, there remains a lot of history and lived experience that is assumed of the reader, which most non-Hungarians would not possess. I suspect that the novel is filled with countless points of resonance that would be implicitly understood and felt by Hungarian readers, but lacking this context I personally had difficulty connecting with many of its foundational themes. This was perhaps the biggest difficulty for me to overcome.When ing a novel of this size and complexity, one simply cannot encapsulate it entirely, and therefore I must stress that my comments in this  are generalities, which cannot be applied uniformly to the whole work. I say this only because I feel that I am being unfair in some of my criticisms, in that they absolutely do not apply in all cases. Indeed, there are several sections of the novel that I felt were outstanding. Péter Nádas has much to recommend him as a writer, and perhaps Parallel Stories is a better novel than I am giving it credit for. However I can only provide my own opinions and impressions, constrained as they are by my own context and preferences, and the time I’ve allowed myself to write this . My overall impression of the novel is positive, but on balance, not overwhelmingly so.

To these hallmarks of Mann, Proust and Musil, Nádas adds a proclivity for endless digression: a stream of consciousness that is coherent, yet nonlinear: it drifts at will through time and space, often channeling third-person perspectives directly through the first-person narrator - all of which make this book both an engaging and challenging read.But the defining feature of A Book of Memories is its intense romanticism; its profound sensitivity and sensuality. Its fictional author has an obsessive, almost indiscriminate desire to achieve deep emotional intimacy with another human being – a search which speaks to the beauty of love, but also to its futility - the barriers which can never be overcome. As such, A Book of Memories is both exceedingly romantic and overwhelmingly lonely. We see romance as the counterbalance to the violence of the era. The desire to connect becomes urgent, necessary, and ultimately hopeless.

We strive for happiness without really understanding what will make us happy. As we grow olderTime, instead of healing wounds, can often deepen them. We strive for happiness without really understanding what will make us happy. As we grow older, we grow to understand the significance of missed moments, lapsed opportuninities. We look back and realise the richness of what we had, and how much more we could have had. In A Month in the Country, Tom Birkin looks back to an earlier time with both longing and regret. He warns us that life is fleeting, and instructs us to ""snatch at happiness as it flies"". But in this we must forever fail, since we are so blinded to the elements of our own happiness. How can we seize that which we cannot see until it's too late?A Month in the Country is barely a story. It is instead a study of mortality, a reflection on the transience of life, the indelible impact of our actions within our lifetime, and the irrelevance of these questions in the long march of time. Just as Birkin considers his own past, he uncovers the story of a forgotten artist, dead for half a millennium. What does a struggle for fulfillment even mean when life is so ephemeral, and death so permanent. It is not long before we are all dust, senseless subjects to the flow of eternity.

By examining human history, one might argue that such behaviour is not exceptional, and in fact our species may actually be defined by our repeated commission of such acts.Han Kang makes some unconventional perspectival choices in her writing, which, though intriguing, have the effect of fragmenting the narrative, distancing the characters and detracting from the overall impact of the stories.

It was really a year of exploration, as I tried to read widely from as many authors as possible. It was my year with McCarthy - I read 11 of his books this year - but I also spent a lot of time with Shakespeare, Beckett and Kafka, amongst others. I think I've grown a lot in my taste and appreciation for good books, and there were several books I rated highly early in the year that I may not rate so highly if I had read them for the first time today.My five absolute favourite books of the year were:- Heart of Darkness- One Hundred Years of Solitude- To the Lighthouse- The Sense of an Ending- Child of GodLooking back through my list, these were the books that stand out above all others, but there were many other books I enjoyed almost as much. Here are some of the the highlights of the year:- Disgrace- No Country for Old Men- Butcher's Crossing- Lonesome Dove- As I Lay Dying - Suttree- Homo Faber- The Remains of the Day- Nausea- Darkness at Noon - The Fifth Child- Blood MeridianI began the year with about 100 books on my to-read list (these are books I physically own, which are sitting unread on my bookshelf), and my aim was to read as many as possible in order to be left with a more manageable number. I achieved my goal and read 130 books, and yet my to-read list has somehow managed to increase to 150 books! But this is what the site is all about: each book opens up new areas to explore, and the s and recommendations are continually leading me towards new discoveries, for which I am grateful.I've come to terms with the fact that reading is a lifelong endeavour, and though there are so many books I want to read, I know I will never ""catch-up"" and read every single one of them. Actually, this is a good thing, and so I have stopped worrying about the size of my to-read list. Therefore my plan for 2017 is to read just as much, but let myself read far fewer books by tackling all the long and more difficult books that I have wanted to read, but have put off because of my reading challenge. 2017 will be the year I read Ulysses, Gravity's Rainbow, Infinite Jest, The Man Without Qualities, Underworld, 2666, The Recognitions and Finnegans Wake, among others. In many ways this will be even more challenging, but I'm really looking forward to really diving deep into these.A big thank you to all my friends who have taken the time to read and comment on my s, and for writing all the amazing s you have posted.

I read The Messiah of Stockholm as a standalone work of fiction, and therefore am evaluating it as such.The prose is modern and accomplished, though there were sometimes odd little phrases that felt out of place. Actually, I had assumed while reading the novel that it had been written in another language, and these were attempts at literal translations that didn't quite work in English, but knowing now that the novel was actually written in English, I'm not sure what to make of these (sorry, I didn't highlight any examples). I suppose you could say that the writing is sometimes a little quirky. I enjoyed the development of Lars's character, and his interactions with Heidi, in which many themes were explored: identity, cultural loss, belonging, art and imitation (echoes of The Recognitions here). This early part of the novel was quite good. There is an element of mystery and a hint perhaps of something sinister, which propels the plot. The resolution was not what I was expecting, and to be honest I found parts of it odd and somewhat disappointing, though I understand the resonances it could have with the historical context that the novel sets up.

Literature being so diverse, it usually takes a little time to connect with an author’s particular style and voice, and there is something of an act of persuasion as the author slowly reveals themselves and coaxes you around to his or her point of view. Not so with Disgrace, which immediately gripped me in its raw power and honest depiction of the decline and fall of David Lurie. In his portrayal of Lurie, Coetzee is able to create sympathy for the unlikable character by exposing his peculiar sense of morality and the logic of his mind. Though his actions are not admirable, one cannot help but respect a person who demonstrates such resilience in the face of hardship.The central theme - disgrace – is in itself emotionally powerful. A disgraced person becomes the focus of total and enduring moral derision, the effect of which is social isolation and deep, personal shame. Issues of morality, responsibility, dignity, blame and regret come to the fore, and these issues permeate the novel, which intertwines these with issues of poverty and race relations in South Africa. The novel is in many ways about the inevitable and inherent failings of man (or more precisely, male-ness), which appears to be the underlying cause of much of the damage. The differences between male and female nature are contrasted here, both in their role as the cause of, and reaction to the various disgraces depicted. The questions of responsibility, dignity and respect, are paralleled again in man’s treatment of animals, and indeed in man’s animal nature. The overwhelming feeling is one of powerlessness: the unavoidable prices that must be paid – or perhaps it is only stubbornness: the refusal to pay the price (in this question, is dignity considered a value or a vice?). This is a book of remarkable depth, especially considering its length. Coetzee absolutely explodes the central theme of disgrace, and leaves it to the reader to work through the mess. ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Dec 14, 2016","Dec 17, 2016","Sep 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/749626.Disgrace

The novel feels like a push-back, a response to the status-quo, an attempt to embody some form of modernity. I felt I lacked context; I found it difficult to meaningfully relate to this narrow, obsolete zeitgeist. The second reason, is that I could not connect deeply enough to the characters - especially to the three women - to feel involved in their minds and the inner workings of their relationships. Or perhaps I connected sufficiently, but just wasn't moved. I would say this is a consequence of the distance created by the writing style. T.S. Eliot says in the preface that the novel needs to be read twice to be appreciated.

When We Were Orphans explores a wide array of political and personal themes, but its main focus is on memory, nostalgia, and the luxury of innocence. In the final sequence, the novel veers away from strict realism, into somewhat surreal, dreamlike territory. I felt the novel really reaching for something interesting here, and though it seemed to try a few ideas on, it didn't really settle on anything altogether concrete. Yet the surprising, unsettling quality of this latter section was my favourite part of the novel.

As a novel it is striking (especially for its time) in the way it subverts the traditional format, by connecting an epistolary structure with an overarching narrative from an unnamed ""editor"". The language is so wonderfully romantic and personal, one really is made to feel as Werther felt throughout his ordeal.I especially loved the novel for its examination of romantic love as an almost diseased state of being: one that consumes and transforms, causing the overwhelming focus of one's life to be directed at the object of love, and all future concerns to hinge upon the question of reciprocation. This virulent nature is epitomised in the following passage, in which Werther discusses with his rival Albert the consuming power of despair:Woe to him who could look on and say, ""Foolish girl! Had she waited, had she let time have its effect, despair would surely have abated, and surely someone else would have come forward to comfort her."" Just as if one should say, ""What a fool to die of fever! Had he waited until his powers had recovered, his life forces improved, the tumult of his blood abated, then all would have gone well, and he would be alive today!""Certainly this was not the first time in history that sorrow caused by unrequited love was likened to physical illness, but the acknowledgement that it can consume with such inevitability, beyond the control of will alone, is striking in its likeness to modern notions of depression and mental illness. For me, this examination raised intriguing questions around free will and the nature of the mind: to what extent are we in control of ourselves, when a simple thing like love can transform us so? What fascinates me is the reduction of such complex and powerful thoughts and emotions to the modern, almost binary perspective, where some thoughts may be considered normal and well, and other entire categories of thought are considered malignant and requiring treatment. Werther may have suffered from mental illness by modern definitions, but had he sought treatment for his condition and overcome it, would this somehow have diminished the love he felt for Lotte, and thereby also have reduced a very real part of himself? Here the distinction between the two types of illnesses compared in Werther's quote becomes apparent: unlike the fever, Werther's illness arose from himself - it was a result of his own genuine thoughts and desires, and its treatment would imply at some level a loss of agency, even a loss of self.

However in the classic Dostoyevsky style, The Idiot is less a subtle and cohesive social commentary than it is an intense, frenzied explosion of absurd plots, eccentric characters and loose philosophical associations. The novel is truly a mess, structurally. But with Dostoyevsky you have to take the good with the bad.

Cioran writes with an almost theatrical degree of cynicism: his commitment to persistently wrenching the most pessimistic conclusion from any proposition is often hilarious in its melodramatic absurdity. His philosophy is one of absolute futility, in which suicide is the most noble act, and any motion towards civilisation, culture or the pursuit of knowledge is entirely misguided. While I enjoyed his acerbic commentaries on Christianity, on the whole I cannot follow Cioran into the depths of such profound nihilism. Most of his ideas are too esoteric or crippled by his slanted perspective to be credible except in a poetic sense. And yet, reading A Short History of Decay is still a worthwhile endeavour.

But it won't appear to be, for the simple reason that I am the teller. Told by me, it won't seem like that. Although, in fact, it's the story of a terrible crime.I do not know enough about Mexican history to really grasp the ""terrible crime"" that is the focus of this story, or its implications on the Mexican memory (though I have read a little since finishing the book). Amulet is an attempt to come to terms with this crime - the Tlatelolco massacre - which resulted in hundreds of students being killed at the hands of military and police. Thematically, the novel feels very close to Slaughterhouse 5, and even employs time as a device in a similar way. Though her power to do so is perhaps more poetic than Billy Pilgrim's, like him, Auxilio Lacouture moves freely between past, present and distant future, as a means of rationalising and contextualising the traumatic event within the context of the greater arc of history. Lacouture is the embodiment of the artistic sensibility: she is powerful, captivating, and yet she is damaged. She is the ideal witness to this literary search for meaning. At a high point near the end of the novel, she reveals a prophecy, which at once epitomises both the transience of art and its enduring nature. There is a bittersweet kind of hope expressed in these passages, which are the culmination of the novel: the acceptance of the inevitability of decay, alongside a solemn prayer for renewal, and redemption.A love of poetry and literature permeates this a beautifully-crafted little novel.

The plot (which is quite intricate for a novel of this length) is told from a narrative viewpoint that rotates between three characters. This device is interesting as it illuminates the characters and events from different perspectives, but it is not entirely successful. Sometimes it has the effect of getting in the way, of clouding and over-complicating the story. The voices are difficult to differentiate initially, but one gets the hang of it before long.

Between these elemental forces there is conflict and contrast, darkness and light. But this frame creates diverse subjective experiences; it affects us all in different ways. Jón Kalman explores the inner world of his characters individually and successively, in a manner that reminded me somewhat of Woolf's The Waves. The epic tone is diminished a little in the second half of the novel, but what remains is an unflinching seriousness towards the profound challenges of life, death and change.

It beautifully and poetically captures the experience of living and growing throughout one's life, from the slow gathering of consciousness in childhood, and the formation of identity, to the energy and wild optimism of young adulthood, to the eventual bitterness, desperation and regret (and perhaps clarity) of later life. The novel blurs the lines between the individual and the collective experience, acknowledging the importance of others in constructing our sense of self, bringing out our ambitions and setting the very course of our lives. The six voices are distinct, but interact and combine, complement and destroy, like the ripples created by pebbles thrown into a pond – the individual can be perceived as a fragment of a chaotic system. We define others, and are in turn shaped by others’ perception of us. This process of self-definition provides purpose and direction, but also limits our choices. If we say that we are like this and not like that, or we imagine that certain actions can only be taken by certain kinds of people, then we restrict ourselves to the path of expectation, and it is not until later that we realise that other paths were open to us also.Unlike a lot of experimental writing, the structure of The Waves does not get in the way. In fact it harmonises wonderfully with themes of the novel in ways that complement and amplify them. The metaphor of waves is far-reaching and creates a grand thematic unity. The voices of the characters come in waves, as the relentless beating of waves on the shore, as the arc of our lives, as the rise and fall of the sun, the waves of successive days, months, years, generations, the cycle of life and death, as the respiration of breath itself. By depicting life in brief, intense snatches, the novel emphasises life's transience, the compounding effects of actions, and the extent to which it can be out of our control. The Waves is a rare achievement. It's messy and experimental, yet possesses a beautiful simplicity, and conveys a vast wisdom of experience....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Jan 23, 2018","Jan 29, 2018","Sep 08, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/863767.The_Waves

The Adolf Hitler portrayed in this book is a very likable fellow. He is presented as a lens of rationality through which we perceive afresh the absurdities of the modern world. I think this moral conflict is really what the author is aiming to create by presenting this particular subject in this way. When I found myself smiling at Hitler's witticisms, I kept having to remind myself of the small matter of the tens of millions killed on the battlefield and in the gas chambers. But then again, this book is not going to change that one way or another, so it's probably not worth taking all that seriously. I enjoyed the little ironies, the absurdities, and the witty observations about technology and modern life. Hitler's antics were amusing, and his voice was very charming and sympathetic (remembering of course that it is not the real Hitler, as much as he would like you to think it is), but there's not much more to this book. As satire, it's not particularly incisive or original. Ultimately, despite the heavy subject, this is a fairly light and fun fish-out-of-water story.

Flaubert is courageous in his treatment of female maritalFor one of the most influential novels ever written, Madame Bovary is an understated affair. Flaubert is courageous in his treatment of female marital dissatisfaction, though I wish his Emma were able to act with a little more intelligence. Her dissatisfaction and desire for emotional fulfillment are perfectly understandable given her societal and personal circumstances, but her selfishness, recklessness and stupidity erase much of the sympathy one might have for her. Her husband is a pathetic character; a man who is constant and dedicated to a marital ideal, while neglecting the reality of his wife as a living, breathing person. I really did feel for him in the end. Though neither character is particularly admirable, the culpability lies less in their personal failings than in the norms of sexual separation and emotional repression that thrust Charles and Emma unprepared into each other's lives.

Unlike, say, Macbeth, which largely revolves around the actions (and their repercussions) of the titular characters, the various supporting characters in King Lear seem to possess more independence, depth and agency. Each has their own complex motives and weaknesses, and they appear to wield real influence over the story, rather than simply being locked into some fixed tragic arc. This is a play I would really like to see performed; it is difficult to appreciate the full expression of these characters on the page.Due to its complexity, I felt that the play was also a little loose and unfocused.

Of the two the latter book is superior, being more precise and nuanced in its analysis. However this book by Oakley Hall is more comprehensive, though really it's little more than a detailed overview of the subject. Hall chooses examples for his analysis from literary fiction, which I appreciate. This is not a ""how to write a bestseller in X days"" type book. Hall does really attempt to break down the components of good writing, using the greats as his references.It's easy to criticise books like this for for their reductionist approach, their use of overly simple rules to solve very complex problems, and the offensive implication that there is only one ""correct"" way to write fiction. As an example, in the very first chapter, Hall advocates for specificity rather than abstraction in writing. To this end he suggests rewriting this sentence:The man walked across the floor.As this:The burly security man hastened across the black and white tiles.To me, this epitomises what's wrong with this kind of analysis. The second sentence reads as so laboured and contrived. Why should we care about the man's build and the colour of the tiles? Does substituting ""walked"" with ""hastened"" really add anything? Should good writers fill their prose with such unnecessary detail for the sake of specificity? I would argue that in almost any context, the problem with the first sentence is that it is entirely superfluous. A good writer should be able to analyse their writing, and try to find the best way to express what they are trying to say, not simply search for synonyms and throw in some extra adjectives. It would be a real mistake for an aspiring writer to take Hall's suggestion literally and to use it as the basis for revising their work, but that's not to say that this book is not worth reading. How Fiction Works succeeds in providing an overview of important ideas and techniques, which, generally speaking are reasonably sound. What is important is that the writer develops an ability to analyse their work, consider different perspectives and different viewpoints, and apply what they know to their writing.

More a work of philosophy than fiction, the Socratic interactions of its two dozen or so characters provide the framework for Musil's philosophical investigations. These conversations, deep and varied in scope, are the fat formed about the scant bones of the ineffectual Parallel Campaign. The philosophical musings are usually quite abstract and esoteric, though sometimes a little (understandably) absorbed in the specific concerns of the time. Nonetheless, this is a masterful work, and well worth reading.However, The Man Without Qualities is not a polished or consistent book. Musil's approach to the novel is haphazard, full of diversions and distractions, and a disregard for conventional narrative structure. Even the Parallel Campaign, which is at the core of the novel, is abandoned for long intervals, and is rarely developed in any significant way. All this gives the impression that a completed Man Without Qualities would have to be several times longer than the already dense, 1100 pages of this unfinished version.

Is it any wonder this book is so beloved by writers?Much has already been written of the brilliant poetic style, and the trenchant and memorable aphorisms, so I will instead write about what is not so often discussed: though this work is idealised by many, there is much here to be conflicted about. Pessoa (or Soares, if you prefer, though I suspect the name is less an adopted persona than a thin, disinhibiting mask), writes from a position of such inhuman remoteness, that only through a charitable reading of his philosophy may one discover truths that are morally defensible. Surely if one takes seriously his views, for example on political disengagement (one should quietly submit even to unjust rule), on living apart from humanity (""you are only free if you can withdraw from men""), life and death (""death is liberation because to die is to need no one else""), et cetera - there are a multitude of other examples which I unfortunately cannot provide due to my ineptitude at gathering quotes as I read - surely as incongruous as these views are to non-misanthropes, they cannot be held up as valid moral axioms, and can only be admired in the abstract, on the assumption that they are not opinions sincerely held, but merely a form of poetic expression, which is understood to be romantically overstated, so that in its diminution and its dilution with the banal and the commonplace, some profound ideal may be glimpsed. And there is real value in what can be discovered in The Book of Disquiet, but one must take care not to romanticise Soares's detachment and remoteness, or mistake the actualisation of these as one's aim, for there are better ways to perceive the world.The Book of Disquiet got me thinking about the relationship between suffering and art. While it's true that suffering is not a prerequisite for great art - one must be talented, but is not required to be unhappy in order to pen a great symphony, or create a masterful sculpture - I wonder if the same holds true for great literature, which is so much more a direct expression of the artist's mind, lacking as it does the interstitial abstraction of other artistic mediums. I suppose one cannot make a blanket statement about such things, but I suspect that to write something like The Book of Disquiet, one needs to contain in one's self, more than a just a sliver of Soares. ...more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Sep 08, 2016","Sep 15, 2016","Jul 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6897011-the-book-of-disquiet

OnThis is what Brett Easton Ellis has to say about House of Leaves (as printed on the back cover):…it renders most other fiction meaningless. One can imagine Thomas Pynchon, J.G. Ballard, Stephen King, and David Foster Wallace bowing at Danielewski’s feet, choking with astonishment, surprise, laughter, awe. Renders most other fiction meaningless! Wallace, Pynchon, literally choking with astonishment! Calm down, Brett. House of Leaves is a fine book, but it’s not this good:[image]My main criticism of House of Leaves is that it could have been so much better. Ellis’s statement bothers me because a concept like this in the hands of someone like Pynchon or Wallace could have been incredible. I know this is an unfair statement – after all, this was Danielewski’s idea and work, not Wallace’s or Pynchon’s – but the central idea of this novel is really strong, and the execution fell short of its potential.Surprisingly (given its reputation), House of Leaves is not a particularly challenging book, and I wish it were. Despite the fragmented and convoluted structure, the stories essentially develop linearly. Danielewsk does suppress information to keep the reader guessing at the full story, but this is not terribly unique - it’s more or less standard for books in the mystery and thriller genres. And all the relevant information is revealed eventually - by the end there is very little mystery left. The execution could have been a lot tighter - I would have liked to see Danielewski challenge the reader, maybe by cleverly setting up false expectations, forcing the reader to dig into the notes, follow the twists and turns, and actively work to put the pieces together. Can you imagine what a twisted web Pynchon might have weaved?At times I felt like Danielewski was cheating. The notes contain a lot of extraneous information, such as fake bibliographies, and long lists of names that are intended to be skipped over. There is a section of the book with very strange formatting, and I was excited to get to this part to see what it was all about, but was disappointed to find that most of the content was meaningless gibberish. Most of the appendices offer little in the way of development, and while their inclusion adds to the authenticity of the book as sort or loose collection of journals and artifacts, there is not much else to justify their inclusion (the letters from Johnny’s mother are an exception). There are also instances where information that would have provided definitive information as to the nature of the house is conveniently missing –this is such a lazy and transparent way for the author to avoid committing to detail. There are so many missed opportunities here; sometimes I felt that Danielewski was in too much of a hurry to finish.Then there’s Johnny – a character who is shallow, poorly conceived, and perhaps designed entirely to appeal to a certain demographic. He feels like a character from another, much shittier book. His ramblings are out of place against the events of the Navidson house, and shatter the atmosphere these events seek to create. His voice is strange, and there are weird inconsistencies in his style and grammar. He possesses a wide vocabulary, but uses clichés and makes basis mistakes like writing “could of” instead of ""could have"" (I assume this is the author's clumsy way of signalling Johnny's level of education, but it's not internally consistent). On two occasions Johnny writes “heal” where the correct word should be “heel”, and Zampano later makes the same mistake. There are some possible interesting implications here, which raise possibilities about the nature of the house and its effects on people, or possibly even call into question the very existence of certain characters... but honestly I’m not sure I trust Danielewski's control and subtlety enough to attribute these to anything more than inconsistent writing. This  has turned out much more negative than I intended. I think the Ellis quote set me off. I actually did really enjoy this book, but based on the rave s, I was expecting a lot more.

While Hamlet was driven by a desire for vengeance and Macbeth by a lust for power, Othello's characters are dominated by jealousy. Man's jealous nature is of course the weakness that Iago is able to exploit so adroitly. It is what impels the pliable Roderigo to murder a man he does not hate, and it is what drives Othello to kill the woman he loves and with whom he has found perfect happiness. But it is also jealousy of the successful outsider and his foreign lieutenant that fuels Iago's own bitter crusade. Iago is not simply malicious, he is the embodiment of jealousy, both in nature and in deed. He is there in every scene, manufacturing evidence, undermining trust, and forcing characters to sabotage their own causes. In some ways he could be viewed as a symbol - a proxy for jealousy itself- or simply as a catalyst, for jealousy once allowed to take hold needs no man to feed it, nor any concordance with reality to confirm it.There is an interesting way in which Othello mirrors Macbeth: both foreshadow the play's core theme in an ironic way in the scene which introduces the title character. At the beginning of the latter, Macbeth defeats the traitor Macdonwald, only to be later consumed by the same desire for power and himself become a traitor. In Othello's opening scenes Othello is unjustly accused by the possessive Brabantio, and is similarly cast in the opposite position at the play's conclusion. Indeed, Othello, for its contrivances and occasional melodramatic tone, is an incredibly subtle play, full of symbolism, and much more depth than this brief analysis would suggest....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 21, 2016","Jul 29, 2016","Jul 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/448988.Othello

Indeed, there is very little in the ending that comes as a surprise given Macbeth is a relatively straightforward story, at least compared to Hamlet. Indeed, there is very little in the ending that comes as a surprise given the prophecy that is revealed early on. Even so, there is a remarkable amount of tension that runs through the play. There is an interesting interplay between fate and choice - how knowledge of the prophecy affected the actions of the characters and catalysed its own fulfillment, even when characters believed themselves to be working against it. Nowadays, this is a bit of an overused trope, but you can see its origin here, and Shakespeare treats it well.The overarching theme in Macbeth is the corruptibility of power. It appears almost as a character in itself; an unseen spectre who transfers at the beginning of the play to Macbeth from the defeated traitor Macdonwald. Even later we see in the reluctance of Malcolm to accept the crown, a fear that he too will be corrupted, and that his own evil will overshadow even Macbeth's. In fact, the play is only really tragic if we acknowledge this corruptible nature to be so consuming and intractable that it mitigates the culpability of the characters in their own actions. If instead we believe that Macbeth and Lady Macbeth acted honestly and in accordance with their moral character, then the outcome is justice to evildoers, not tragedy. Shakespeare suggests the former assessment by characterizing the corruption thus, and by exposing the Macbeths' extreme guilt and remorse. They are clearly not wholly unrepentant psychopaths, and the tragedy here is not in their demise, but in the eternal and inexorable weakness of humanity - its inability to resist its desirous nature. The language of Macbeth is particularly poetic, full of little rhyming couplets and clever turns of phrase that had me smiling.

It's certainly a lot easier to read as an adult than as a teenager. The language seemed a lot less cryptic, and it's fairly straightforward to follow with a little concentration. But what I found most interesting is how messy and unfinished the structure and the dialogue is. Somehow, reading Shakespeare when I was younger I felt that I was reading something permanent and authoritative, but actually the versions we have today are not definitive - they vary based on the interpretation of the copyists who reproduced the manuscripts, as well as the versions of the manuscript that were copied (plays being living documents that are duplicated, revised and developed throughout rehearsals). Acknowledging this fact changed my reading of Hamlet. The play took on a sort of draft quality - the narrative possesses an unpolished linear nature that somehow exposes Shakespeare's thought process - you can almost picture him with quill in hand scrawling the lines as they come to him, crossing out some but leaving most untouched. Even so, his use of language is stunningly rich and wildly inventive... but to say any more on Shakespeare's literary mastery would be redundant; it's almost axiomatic at this point.However, there are certainly criticisms that can be leveled at Hamlet. The play lacks some amount of subtlety (although not in the prose itself), the plot is awkward at many points, the characters are often lacking in plausibility and consistency, and their actions are sometimes irrational and bewildering. This is not a play that is highly internally consistent or dramatically robust by any modern standard. These shortcomings are sometimes glaring to the reader, but do not even come close to diminishing the brilliance of the play. And indeed I suppose that kind of criticism is unfair - Shakespeare was writing to entertain the public of his time, not pretentious snobs scrutinising his work four hundred years later....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 11, 2016","Jul 15, 2016","Jul 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33186.Hamlet_Prince_of_Denmark

When I read Borges' Fictions at the beginning of this yearSo much of how we react to the books we read is determined by circumstance and expectation. When I read Borges' Fictions at the beginning of this year, I had heard a lot about the author and had very high expectations. I did enjoy Fictions, but in all honesty it didn't quite match my expectations, and I didn't appreciate it as much as I should have.Now, reading The Book of Sand and Shakespeare's Memory, the circumstances are different. After having consumed so much Beckett, with his abstract intentions and long and rambling paragraphs, this collection of short stories with its direct and simple structure is so welcome and refreshing. This time, my expectations have been tempered, and as a result have been vastly exceeded. Although The Book of Sand and Shakespeare's Memory is generally considered a lesser work, I enjoyed this much more than Fictions (which of course I will now need to reread).Borges writes such interesting stories. He is not afraid to transport the reader to distant locations in both time and place, and although he frequently distorts reality into fantasy, the stories always feel very grounded and authentic. The prose feels light -not at all dense - and yet he fits so much into so few pages. It's interesting that he writes here almost exclusively in the first person, often with himself (or someone who shares his name) as the protagonist. Some of these stories are deeply personal, like The Other, and August 25, 1983. Others are more abstract, fantastical and allegorical, like The Mirror and the Mask, and Blue Tigers. All are wonderful. The Borges who wrote these stories was a man approaching the end of a long and full life. It's difficult to ignore this fact when assessing these stories, just as it is easy to overstate its significance. There is a sadness to the stories, a sense of something lost or undiscovered, but there is also an expression of reverence and wonder for the great possibilities of the world. Maybe the point is that these are not necessarily distinct and opposing perspectives....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jul 05, 2016","Jul 07, 2016","Jul 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25176385-the-book-of-sand-and-shakespeare-s-memory

At first glance the topic appears to be a re-tread of Misquoting Jesus, but actually the main focus is on overall attribution of the books of the New Testament (and other extra-biblical writings), not the ways in which the initial texts became corrupted through the years. It's interesting to see which of the books in the NT were actually written by those to whom they are attributed. It should not come as a surprise that many of them are not, especially those whose ""authors"" were in fact illiterate. The real answer is even more surprising: virtually only the letters of Paul were likely written by their supposed author, and in fact even several of these are forgeries. In Forged, Ehrman works through each piece of writing, and presents the evidence for who wrote it and why. What interests me most in the analysis are the ways in which the disputes of the early church are clearly visible in the writings, with authors often writing pseudonymously to gain authority for their own views. This explains why the bible can be so contradictory - why do the views espoused in one of Paul's letters contradict the views in another? Because they were not both written by the same person. Through history, the effects of these forgeries have been very damaging, especially with respect to justifying the treatment of Jews and women by the church. It's important to keep in mind that all this is not just one man's opinion. Ehrman is not some lone crackpot with a keyboard and a few wacky ideas. He is a serious and recognised scholar in his field, and his views usually represent a consensus opinion or are at least widely-held and defensible in scholarly circles. Of course, the difference between what scholars and historians have established about the bible, and what your average Christian believes, is startling to consider....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jun 25, 2016","Jun 28, 2016","Jun 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8713068-forged

Inevitably, any rational person will approach a novel with the expectation that certain narrative conventions will apply: that there will be a logical progression from A to B to C; that there will be events that make sense in the context of the story; that it will contain characters that are solid and persistent; and that despite the bewildering complexity, the multitude of loose threads will eventually be gathered up and drawn into some sort of conclusion. Applying this kind of reasoning to Beckett only leads to frustration. The material is constantly shifting and changing form; it's like trying to erect scaffolding around a cloud. At some point I came up with a sort of working model that allowed me to let go of the frustration and simply enjoy the book on its own terms. What I think Beckett is trying to do is to mirror the randomness of conscious experience. Malone's internal monologue is aimless and garbled, and because it's devoid of context it makes very little sense to an observer. However at times, it can also be strikingly coherent and profound. In Molloy and Malone Dies, Beckett chooses names for his protagonists that are similar: Molloy, Moran and Malone. These characters seem sometimes to share traits and histories, to the point that one might confuse them for the same person - and in some ways they might as well be the same person. To what extent is the meandering, random internal conscious experience of one person distinguishable from another, from the perspective of an observer who lacks their personal context? To what extent can one person really understand another on the basis of their mess of unfiltered thoughts? This, I think, is the question that Beckett is exploring here. If for a period of time you were somehow able to write down your own thoughts as they arise, without first organising or editing them, would they not somehow resemble Malone's in their character?Now, it's very likely that this analysis may be obvious, simplistic, reductive or flat out miss the point (and by no means am I saying that's all there is to it), but in any case I found that the trick to enjoying Beckett is in letting go and embracing the style as an intentionally purposeless and random experience, without form, direction or destination. What we have here is something close to Beckett's own stream of consciousness, unbounded by form or narrative convention. His skill, I think, was to liberate his thoughts and allow his pen to wander where it may. The result is messy, inconsistent, and difficult, but Beckett's genius shines through. Despite the limitations that the style imposes, the execution is quite brilliant. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 23, 2016","Jun 28, 2016","Jun 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54042.Malone_Dies

These are the opening lines to the 1972 cartoon movie Fritz the Cat - a movie I was drawn to decades later when I discovered it in my late teens. For me it was a window to a more exciting time, an era narrowly missed, a world that was only just waking up, when to be young meant to live freely and love easily, and to seize the day and change the world required no more than to step outside one's own front door. Well, that's how I saw it at the time, but of course things weren't really like that. The fires of change were fueled by deep turmoil and conflict. The cultural, sexual and racial oppression was heavy, and the wild desire for freedom was in many ways the direct response. In Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the mood of the times is captured beautifully in Didion's soaring and perceptive prose. It's there in the bitter, spiteful conservatism of the woman she meets in the store, who simply cannot come to terms with the audacity of a woman who would wear a bikini. You can sense it in the gloomy countenance of the teens, burned out on psychedelics, for whom any notion of a future has been so annihilated that the mere concept of a thirty year old is barely comprehensible.

It turns out that's not quite true, and there's no avoiding the fact that the fledgling nation of Australia was built in significant part by hardened criminals. Of course the story is complicated, and The Fatal Shore tells that story of the first 100 years or so of settlement in vivid detail. The book focuses on the penal settlements in and around Sydney, Norfolk Island and Van Diemen's Land, and especially on the convicts themselves, who often led hellish lives at the hands of sadistic overseers. Australia in the early days was a really nasty place to be if you were a convict - or indeed a native. Reading these accounts of early Australia, I'm struck by just how recent it all was. I'm amazed that mere decades after the end of transportation, Australia was able to develop a national identity and the political will to achieve Federation, implement a stable system of government, and eventually grow into a prosperous and law-abiding nation.

The brilliancI can understand the low ratings this book tends to receive; I can't imagine it would particularly appeal to people who don't have kids. The brilliance of The Fifth Child is in its profound portrayal and examination of all the little anxieties (often unspoken or hidden) that constantly worry the minds of parents. These anxieties are made manifest in such a surreal and powerful way through Ben. He is terrifying, his presence is malignant; he is the incarnation of parental fear. A creepy, uneasy undercurrent runs though the entire book.The Fifth Child also explores some interesting philosophical questions around nature and judgement. Ben's life is like a destructive force that destroys the family, but neither the parents nor the child are really to blame for the way things turn out. Every person born into the world is a roll of the dice, the genes that produce us are combined at random, and there is always the possibility of something not going to plan. It's fascinating that the experts consider Ben to be within the range of normal human physiology and behaviour, and yet all acknowledge that there's something not quite right about him. It's interesting also to contemplate how wide a net human behaviour is - consider the range of traits that have been beneficial at one time or another in humanity's past - of violence, cruelty and depravity. These traits did not simply disappear - they are still within the range of human behaviour.

It is a work that deserves to stand with Camus and I had never heard of this book, or of its author, but boy am I glad I decided to buy it on a whim. It is a work that deserves to stand with Camus and Sartre in its penetration of the modern condition; an understanding of which is in each case elucidated through the perspective of a misanthrope. The protagonist, Faber, is an engineer, who is characterised by certain stereotypically male traits: he lacks empathy, and is logical and analytical to the point of inhumanity. He treats significant events - even those of life and death - more or less with apathy, and purely as the culmination of probabilistic forces. His world is at the precipice of technological rebirth. There is a hint of wonders to come: the arrival of computers, and the ease of travel and communication. On an allegorical level, Faber himself embodies this human potential. The title, Homo Faber, is a play on words that could be seen to bear multiple meanings. The phrase itself is Latin, and means ""Man the Maker"", signifying man's potential for shaping the future. The second meaning is simply the direct identification of the protagonist: Homo Faber; or, Faber, the man, who is prototypically male, yet whose experience and condition is no greater than that of any ordinary man. I see a third meaning, which is that of a taxonomic designation - Homo Faber, as contrasted with Homo Sapiens. If Homo Sapiens is the wise man, then Homo Faber is the species which has substituted its wisdom for deed, and acts without concern for the repercussions. These themes stand quite aside from the central story of the novel, and yet are woven subtly throughout. There is much here for the reader to grapple with. Unfortunately to say any more would be to spoil the story - the gradual revelation of its enormity, and the questions around the complicity of the characters represent the greatest pleasure this book has to offer. ""Homo faber suae quisque fortunae""? To what extent does this hold true for the three central characters?

There's something elusive about it: at times it's a somewhat heavy-handed commentary on class division and the nature of modern life; at other times it seems simply to unashamedly revel in filth and gore and human depravity. Ultimately I think it's an expression of base human nature, and the atavistic desire to revert to some primal state if given even the slightest excuse. Things begin to decline almost immediately for the inhabitants of the high-rise, very quickly going from bad to worse, and eventually deteriorating into the downright macabre. What is interesting is that the residents are complicit in all of this. They absolutely crave the destruction of the mundane social order; they hasten its downfall and they conspire to conceal it from the outside world. This silent complicity is the brilliant surrealistic key to the whole thing. It breaks with reality but it allows the high-rise to develop independently - a microcosm - without the need of a contrived plot point to isolate it from the rest of civilisation.High-Rise does have its flaws, especially if the reader insists on realism (I'm sure many will constantly be asking, ""why don't they just leave?"" - but this is missing the point).

I believe that people see layers and meaning in his writing that simply aren't there. They give him way too much credit. The Castle is not some grand metaphor about some larger, elusive and ethereal concepts (let the academics debate what exactly these may be). His writing is clear, simple and unremarkable. In The Castle (and also The Trial and The Metamorphosis), Kafka begins with an interesting premise, and then challenges himself to continue the story. He writes according to whim; he records what momentarily entertains him; he writes without constraint, but he clearly writes for the amusement of himself -the writer - and not with any consideration for the reader or the finished product. He loves to write, but he loves only the immediate experience of writing - the act of discovery and creation itself. There is no destination, no larger point, no overarching parable. There is only frantic exploration on the micro level. People go to great lengths to explain away the flaws of this book, in order to proclaim it a work of genius, but I'm just not buying it. Kafka asked for this novel destroyed after his death, and with good reason: it's more of a creative writing exercise than a novel. There's a common misconception that Kafka's death prevented him from finishing The Castle, and if he had only held out a bit longer, he would have been able to finish it, and it would have been one of the greatest books of all time.

I believe that his real skill is not only in the telling, but in knowing what to leave out: he never exposes his characters' inner lives (desires, motivations, fears), but instead lets you simply observe them and draw your own conclusions.

Now that I've read a bit more of his writing, I really feel that people over-analyse Kafka: they read meaning and metaphor and parable in everything. To me, The Metamorphosis reads like a straightforward account of a fantastical situation. This is simply a writer who gets pleasure out of imagination and exploration. He asks the question, ""I wonder what would happen if one day I woke up as an insect?"", and he allows his pen to elaborate the answer. Of course the question itself (not to mention the nature of the characters' reactions) undeniably reveals something about Kafka's nature - his anxieties and fears, his feelings of alienation and inadequacy which were motivated by his relationship with his father - these all come through in the writing.

Imagine how much suffering could have been prevented, if not for the acceptance of the false comfort of holy justice and reward in heaven. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 03, 2016","May 08, 2016","May 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13214.I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings

I mean, the language is clear and it's easy enough to follow, yet I found it so infuriating and frustrating and tedious that it actually left me with a headache. There is the feeling that one encounters in nightmares, of being trapped in a suffocating loop which one is forced to endure and from which there can be no escape: this feeling is captured perfectly in The Trial. My emotional experience while reading this felt so congruous to the experience of the protagonist that I'm almost tempted to agree with the common consensus and proclaim this to be a work of utmost genius. However I'm genuinely unsure whether this was intentional on the part of the writer, or a result of overwhelming dullness. So how do you rate a book that so perfectly captures and expresses the emotional state of its protagonist, but is absolutely painful to read?The story is imaginative - it's essentially an allegory, and it absolutely does reveal some interesting truths, both superficially about the absurdity of bureaucracy and of chaos in the world, and more profoundly about the struggle for meaning and order within our own lives. There is a certain humour to the writing - a delight in the fantastic and the absurd - but one gets the impression that at some point (in honesty, fairly early on) the metaphor is well and truly exhausted and the absurd is exploited simply as there is nothing really left to say. The fact is that absurd situations within the context of an allegory can generate the mirage of hidden depth which is not really there - the profundity and significance of this book has been deeply overstated in my opinion. I believe there is a fine short story here, but did we really need the metaphor to be run so thoroughly into the ground?The Trial: A kernel of brilliance, wrapped in layer upon layer of tedium....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"May 02, 2016","May 05, 2016","May 02, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/822733.The_Trial

Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley - Wallace reminisces aA collection of seven non-fiction essays on diverse, but traditionally Wallacian subjects: 1. Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley - Wallace reminisces about his childhood playing tennis in tornado alley. A short, fairly unremarkable essay, except in its structure, which culminates short-story style in fulfillment of its earlier themes, in something resembling a literary epiphany. Wallace considered himself a fiction rather than non-fiction writer, and this piece is a good example of how his natural disposition influenced his non-fiction writing.2. E Unibus Pluram - A lengthy exploration of TV's influence on literature and modern culture. Wallace is clearly conflicted, as someone who both appreciates TV's positive aspects, but who sees the average 6-hour daily American intake as something inherently disastrous (these are of course ideas that Wallace explores more thoroughly in Infinite Jest). Times have certainly changed in the 28 years since this essay was written, and the influence of TV has waned considerably, but if anything mass addiction to entertainment has only increased, though the media of delivery have diversified substantially. Whether Wallace would have been pleased or concerned by the direction we have moved is an interesting question to consider.3. Getting Away from Already Being Pretty Much Away from It All - Wallace is commissioned by a magazine to report on a Midwestern agricultural fair: a pretty mundane assignment, but he makes the most of it. Wallace's skill is in people-watching. He categorises them into types, describing ordinary people as if they were alien creatures or museum exhibits. Of course, some exaggeration is necessary to add colour, but I felt that Wallace often crossed a line into uncomfortably callous cynicism, coming off as unkind and elitist in these usually unflattering accounts of normal people living normal lives.4. Greatly Exaggerated - A very short discourse on literary criticism, and whether work is best interpreted textually, or in the context of authorial intent. It's interesting, though brief, an the references are largely esoteric (for me, anyway).5. David Lynch Keeps His Head - In which Wallace loiters extensively on the set of a David Lynch movie, without ever actually interacting with the director. Wallace describes the experience of being on set (his characteristic people-watching skills come to the fore), as well as deconstructing Lynch's oeuvre, and defining a place for his art in the context of his contemporaries. Lynch is a director who I've perhaps unfairly suspected of being overrated, yet I found this piece very entertaining and insightful.6. Tennis Player Michael Joyce's Professional Artistry as Paradigm of Certain Stuff about Choice, Freedom, Discipline, Joy, Grotesquerie, and Human Completeness - I love tennis. I play every week, and it's one of the few sports I can watch others play with any interest. So for me, Wallace's explanations of the game of tennis by analogy to baseball and basketball didn't hit the right notes. Also, the vicissitudes of the 1995 pro tour, despite inciting feelings of resounding nostalgia (this specific year for reasons of my age and upbringing I consider to be something of a golden age of tennis) seem in the current year wildly out-of-date and inconsequential. I did enjoy the strategic analysis of certain players, and the exploration of the mental aspects of the game and competition in general (those being the ones listed in the title of the essay). 7. A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again - At nearly a hundred pages, this is the longest essay here. It's essentially a sequel to the State Fair piece, carrying the same fish-out-of-water vibe, and is another vehicle for Wallace's witty and humorous observations. There are echoes here, too, of Infinite Jest, as Wallace contemplates the fleeting and relative nature of happiness. The piece is certainly entertaining - Wallace is a likable and erudite guy - but I think I prefer his analyses of more serious topics, to his people-watching. Wallace's writing as always offers a unique and compelling perspective, but the gulf between something like this and Infinite Jest is vast.

From “Call me Ishmael”, one is immediately taken by the character of the novel’s narrator (nebulous though that role may be, as the novel frequently breaks narrative structure). There is something in the voice – a naive enthusiasm or idealism; a deep sensitivity – that is apparent in the writing but difficult to define. The first one hundred or so pages (before we board The Pequod) are especially endearing. I say that it’s no accident that we remember only the beginning and the end of the novel, because the intervening pages that form the bulk of the work are so inscrutable. The plot develops ploddingly, interspersed with frequent digressions about all conceivable details related to whales and whaling (on the removal of the blubber: “Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so it is stripped of the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.”, p264; on whales’ milk: “the milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.”, p337). Most of these digressions are entirely extraneous and dull, while the others are also extraneous, but unexpectedly fascinating. The digressions accumulate, so much so that they eventually appear more frequently than the plot itself, and so it is difficult to state definitively whether the novel is actually ""about"" its own plot. If Moby Dick is taken (as it is generally purported to be) as a metaphor for obsession, as told through the character of Ahab (here, the second famous line referred to above: “From Hell’s heart I stab at thee”), then only the final thirty or so pages are pertinent to its meaning. If we instead take the whole novel into account, then Moby Dick can be interpreted as a meditation on the world, with the minutiae of Nineteenth Century whaling as its framework. As strange and narrow as this may sound, the approach has its merits: have you ever thought about how a ship of this era, running as it was on sail power and without the benefit of mechanical devices, went about capturing and carrying such intimidating wild creatures? I certainly hadn’t. Moby Dick portrays the pursuit like a mighty struggle, a test of skill and courage requiring the full extent of the knowledge, resources and organisation that mankind has accumulated over millennia. Importantly, throughout the novel, the narrator never treats the whales themselves like a dumb animal – they are given the utmost respect and reverence, with perhaps even the acknowledgment that what is being hunted and killed is a creature greater than ourselves. The fact that these talents are brought to bear - the carnage and tragedy of thousands of these animals killed - merely to supply an ordinary commodity at a modest profit – perhaps there is no better exemplification of mundane human cruelty than this....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Sep 15, 2018","Oct 10, 2018","Apr 23, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3167670-moby-dick

The illustration features a confident, self-assured young lady, who is casually deflecting with her umbrella rain (in the form of musical notes) that falls from dark clouds overhead. Her expression seems to announce, ""Oh I see you, dark clouds and rain, but you can't hurt me, for I am a confident and self-assured person who is ready to take on the world!"" I open to the first page - the story begins with a woman (presumably the one pictured on the cover), applying yellow eye-shadow while another woman is audibly urinating in the next stall. Flicking through the book, I can see that one chapter near the end consists of 80 consecutive pages of PowerPoint presentations...Look, these things may tick all the right boxes for you - and if they do, that's lovely - I'm not here to disparage your literary tastes. But for me, these are generally telltale signs that I am not in the book's target market. However, despite all these warning signs, I still decided to read A Visit From The Goon Squad, for the one and only reason that it had the words ""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction"" printed on the cover. I mean, the Pulitzer? Maybe you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.Well, surprisingly, within a few pages, despite myself (and possibly aided by my low expectations), I found myself really enjoying the book. The characters seemed interesting, and the writing actually carried some substance. The writing style itself was a little strained and lacked something in the way of subtlety, but overall the quality was higher than expected, and I was genuinely looking forward to seeing how the story would develop. But after only a few chapters the book seemed to just lose itself, like it simply ran out of anything meaningful or substantive to say. The structure of barely interconnected relationships seemed contrived, and prevented any real development of characters. Some of the stories (like the one about the PR representative, the dictator and the starlet) just seemed over the top and unbelievable, and in fact destroyed any goodwill the book had built up early on. Every subsequent chapter just had to show off something new and different - it all felt so forced, and it threw all sense of reality out the window. By the time the time the book was nearing the end it was already running on vapour, and the penultimate PowerPoint chapter, rather than being creative and unique, just seemed like a gimmick on top of a contrivance - it was unnecessary, irrelevant to the story and not particularly interesting. The final chapter drew together many of the strands and tied a neat bow around the whole package, but by that point I just wasn't buying it.I am disappointed that the book didn't follow through on its early promise. It wasn't a terrible book by any means - there was something there, it just wasn't fully realised. I do give the author points for courage and creativity in trying something new, but I felt like she was trying to do too much - to be too original or too clever, where a simpler telling of the story with fewer diversions and tricks and more focus on character and storytelling would have yielded more satisfying results.

This was a good refresher and helped to solidify these concepts in my mind, as well as reminding me of a few things I'd forgotten over the years.I enjoyed the rest of the book less, for a number of reasons. Firstly, the science around String and M theories is much less settled, and is more speculative. As a lay person with only very light exposure to developments in the field, it is impossible for me to determine what is accepted science and what is hopeful conjecture. Greene obviously has a dog in this fight, and so I'm not entirely comfortable with taking his opinion as fact. Also, this book was written in 1999, and surely the field has developed significantly since then. So I took the the whole section around String and M theory with a massive grain of salt. And honestly the approach to explanation in this section is not as good as early in the book - he focuses more on his personal involvement and the work of his colleagues, rather than on exploring the underlying concepts in detail. On an aesthetic level, there is something about these theories - actually much of the standard model, especially supersymmetry - that I find unconvincing, and although I accept that the scientific nature of reality does not hinge on aesthetics, it's difficult for me to ignore this personal bias. The theoretical components seem so piecemeal and inelegant, like the model has been squeezed and distorted in order to fit the experimental data, and the result is just a mess, with good predictive but little real explanatory power. It may work mathematically, but it seems strange for such a generally elegant and orderly universe to be based on such arbitrary principles. A good comparison would be with orbital epicycles, which were adequate predictive models, but are messy and inelegant and were eventually replaced by Newton's simpler and far more elegant solution to the problem - Newton's paradigmatic innovation being to consider elliptical orbits rather than circular ones. It seems as though we are at a similar stage with the current state of the Standard Model - inventing patches and workarounds to fit with the experimental data, and waiting for a paradigm shift for the pieces to fall into place. String and M theory go some way toward trying to address this, but even if they were experimentally validated, the model is still not satisfying and it's difficult not to imagine that there is still some deeper understanding that is eluding us....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 13, 2016","Apr 21, 2016","Apr 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/771.The_Elegant_Universe

Additionally, reading a screenplay like The Counselor is not the natural way to absorb it, as so much of the intended artistic content is visual and left in the hands of the director. Regardless of these caveats, I don't think The Counselor is as strong even as McCarthy's other dramatic works. It has a very contemporary feel, it dabbles with modern technology, and it is at times highly sexual - all these feel somehow unnatural and uncomfortable for McCarthy, and there are parts of this screenplay that really don't work, at least on the page (I have yet to see the film). In some ways The Counselor is standard McCarthy, in that you can expect depravity, grotesque violence and the sense of inevitable destruction.

I haven't seen this performed, so I'm evaluating it more or less as a written piece only. There are some interesting dramatic elements, like the lead character, Ben, narrating his dialogue from a separate area of the stage (his character's representation in the drama is a mute ""double""). I'm not sure how this would come across when performed, but the idea is interesting enough. Here is an extract from the stage directions, which explains the use of the double - I enjoyed McCarthy's little philosophical asides here:""What must be kept in mind is that the performance consists of two separate presentations. One is the staged drama. The other is the monologue - or - chautauqua - which Ben delivers from the podium. And while it is true that Ben at his podium is at times speaking for - or through - his silent double on stage, it is nevertheless a crucial feature of the play that there be no suggestion of communication between these worlds. In this sense it would not even be incorrect to assume that Ben is unaware of the staged drama. Above all we must resist the temptation to see the drama as something being presented by the speaker at his lectern, for to do so is to defraud the drama of its right autonomy. One could say that the play is an artifact of history to which the audience is made privy, yet if the speaker at his podium apostrophizes the figures in that history it is only as they reside in his memory. It is this which dictates the use of the podium. It locates Ben in a separate space and isolates that space from the world of the drama on stage. The speaker has an agenda which centers upon his own exoneration, his own salvation. The events which unfold upon the stage will not at all times support him. The audience may perhaps be also a jury. And now we can begin. As the mathematician Gauss said to his contemporaries: Go forward and faith will come to you.""The play deals with themes like death, purpose, loss, pride, family, self-destruction and redemption, with which readers of McCarthy's other works will be familiar. These central ideas are elusive enough that they can be contemplated, but not cleanly resolved at the play's completion....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jan 10, 2018","Jan 11, 2018","Apr 10, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/383602.The_Stonemason

What fasciThis was published in 1968, only three years after The Orchard Keeper, but holy shit, what an absolute leap in terms of form and execution. What fascinates me so much about McCarthy's writing is how, despite his trademark style, each book is so vastly different from each other. Outer Dark was unexpected - it is not at all like his other work. Ostensibly it's set in the American South sometime in the late 19th or early 20th Century, but in fact I'm not certain it's really set in any actual place or time that exists in this universe. There is an undercurrent of unease and mysticism, and biblical or even supernatural elements (although these are never overtly expressed). The writing is unsettling in its reality and in its unreality and the result is an uncanny valley where the world feels somehow not quite right, like there is a sense of some impending, twisted calamity. Even 15 pages from the end I had absolutely no idea where the story was going, but I did not expect such a disturbing and powerful conclusion. And that final chapter, which I read with my mouth open: the beautiful and dark writing, dripping with metaphor and poetry until the last sentence hits like a tangible thing and you are left to ask yourself, what the hell does it all mean? Is the whole thing a parable; an allegory? Is it a perversion of the Bible or was it a religious expression? Maybe it's a warning; a cautionary tale. I doubt even the author knows.

There has been a real movement from the verbosHaving now read McCarthy's first novel, it's interesting to see the overall progression in his writing. There has been a real movement from the verbose and mysterious to the plainspoken and bare. Just two novels later McCarthy writes Child of God, which is miles removed in terms of style and mood, being much more compact, tense, and compelling (indeed brilliant). The comparisons to Faulkner never made sense to me before based on McCarthy's later works, but it's impossible to read The Orchard Keeper without constantly comparing the style to Faulkner - in the use of language, in even the formatting (using italics to as a device), in the trick of intentionally hiding the plot from the reader, and of course in the setting itself - the deep American South. I am honestly torn in my feelings towards this book. As I have mentioned, McCarthy's style seems much more elaborate here than in later writing. It really feels like he is writing with something to prove. You can tell he has agonised over every word. While in his later work he usually hits the mark perfectly, coming up with original phrases that are both unique and poignant, here his descriptions often seem overwrought, as though he's trying too hard to come up with a new and dramatic way to describe something. It's also overbearing in that he tries to describe too much. There is endless description and metaphor concerning the landscape. It's good writing, but it's exhausting.Every Cormac McCarthy novel demands attention. He is not in the habit of giving things away, and the style of his writing forces the reader to actively think about what is happening in order for it to make sense (incidentally this is another commonality with Faulkner). Despite this, I felt here that he was trying to be too clever, too overly abstruse. There are chapters that are simply incomprehensible. No matter how many times you read them there is just not enough information there to understand what is going on. Often characters are not named, or pronouns are used to represent multiple characters so it is impossible to tell who is doing what to whom. For me, I felt this to be a nearly identical experience to reading The Sound and the Fury. The only way to read this style is to simply accept that it will not make immediate sense, try to pick up clues where possible and trust that the author will bring it together in the end. He does bring it together, and the disparate threads of story are really woven together in a satisfying way in the final pages. But there was just something about this approach I found troubling . Maybe it seems like too much of a trick, or maybe just too derivative of Faulkner.The Orchard Keeper is a very good book, although one I feel is entirely too reminiscent of a certain other Southern author. It is by a young writer of great talent, who is trying to carve a place for himself in the literary world. It is both great and flawed - I wouldn't say in equal parts (there is more good than bad), but this is certainly not as seamless as his later work....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 29, 2016","Apr 04, 2016","Mar 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6502771-the-orchard-keeper

And in service of what are such carefully-chosen words employed? Human violence. The depravity of power. This book drives like a spear to the heart of the dark side of humanity. That hidden but very real side of humanity. It is on free and open display here, and the reader is asked to look - not just to glance momentarily and then look away, but to stare and stare again and to stare repeatedly and again still - to be confronted with and to see and acknowledge the truth of what is real and what is within us all and will be always....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Apr 08, 2016","Apr 15, 2016","Mar 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6773145-blood-meridian

Augustus was such an instrumental figure in Roman history, though he is often overlooked in popular memory in favour of the more turbulent and often shocking times that came before and after his reign of relative stability. But his story is truly remarkable: how did this unknown boy of nineteen, with little more than the promise of a name, manage to rise and overcome men with far more power and experience? I think what makes this period of history so compelling is how well it encapsulates the human struggle. On display is the worst of human vice and depravity: the desire for wealth, power, glory, excess, violence – balanced by concerns of duty, order, honour, family, and love. The history of Rome plays out like the struggle of man against his own nature, and the rise of Rome itself represents in many ways the triumph of civilization over barbarism (flawed though this interpretation may be). By studying Roman politics we can understand something about the nature of power and the uncertain foundations on which it is built. The fall of the Roman republic forces us to question the stability of democratic systems and acknowledge the tendency for power to consolidate. This tendency had been a visible feature of Roman politics since Marius and Sulla, but the weakness was becoming apparent even in the Punic era with the elevation of figures like Scipio Africanus to a status above their peers. So, was Augustus a legendary figure who against all odds established an empire that would last for half a millennium, or was he simply playing his role in expediting the inevitable? It is true that he did provide stability and prosperity during his long reign, but it is questionable whether the survival of the Principate through the disastrous Julio-Claudian dynasty and the phases of extreme instability and corruption of the later empire were a result of the foundations laid by Augustus or simply the natural needs of the administration of such a vast and wealthy empire. Regardless, Augustus gives us a glimpse into the mind of an undeniably fascinating figure. Though most of the story is told from the perspective of his family, friends and enemies, the final section of the novel is “authored” by Augustus himself. These final reflections were for me the most interesting part of the novel, as the simple questions of meaning and purpose - of how we live and how we relate to one another and the world - are as immediate, and the answers equally elusive for one who has lived as an Emperor, as they are for the rest of us....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Jul 27, 2018",Aug 2018,"Mar 29, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19072449-augustus

In the early chapters, Ehrman steps a little outside his main area of expertise and explores the Jewish and Roman cultural environments, which surrounded the genesis and dissemination of the early Christian church. I found the second chapter about early Judaism particularly interesting - I would love to read a book (I don't know of any that exists, and I'm open to recommendations) devoted to examining the development of the early Jewish religion from henotheism to monotheism (as an aside, it always strikes me as interesting, just how compelled in general humans seem to be in the opposite direction. Even in the ostensibly monotheistic religions there is always a multitude of other deities, even if they are not acknowledged as such - Satan, saints, prophets, angels, demons, djinns - something resembling polytheism seems always to evolve. Given the range of lesser deities, the actual theological distinction between a presumed monotheism like Christianity and an explicit polytheistic religion is quite difficult to define).After the first couple of chapters, Ehrman returns to the familiar world of New Testament textual analysis, and the history of the early church. He does retread some old paths here, but his overall thesis of the likely means of Jesus' exultation to God is credible and interesting.

But to convince us how fallacious this reasoning is, we need only consider that the will being here consider'd as a cause, has no more a discoverable connexion with its effects, than any material cause has with its proper effect.... In short, the actions of the mind are, in this respect, the same with those of matter. We perceive only their constant conjunction; nor can we ever reason beyond it. No internal impression has an apparent energy, more than external objects have.""- David Hume, 1739I find the most convincing argument against free will goes something like this: We live in a deterministic universe; that is, one where actions are strictly dictated by cause and effect. If force is exerted on an object, the object moves in consistent and predictable ways (these, we colloquially describe as the ""laws"" of the universe). For any action, cause and effect can be observed to be either strictly predictable (i.e.: the same outcome will be observed through multiple repetitions) or probabilistic (i.e.: the effect is partially random, so the outcome cannot be exactly predicted, but falls within a predictable range). But what is not possible is for an object to move in a way other than that described by the universal ""laws"". A single atom hurtling through space does not have the option of stopping at will, however its speed and direction will be affected by external factors, such as collisions with other particles, its proximity to large gravitational bodies, and so on. The atom's movement through space is deterministic: it always moves in strict adherence with the rules of cause and effect, and it cannot do otherwise. Our minds are solely the result of physical processes within our brains and bodies, which are in turn comprised of exactly that same matter (the atom hurtling through space) which is governed by physical processes. Therefore, each electron in our brain strictly follows the same deterministic rules of cause and effect as does all matter. There is no electron which, when acted on by processes inside the brain, can take an action other than that which is has been naturally caused. Therefore the mind is a complex material system that operates as the aggregate sum of its physical state and external influences. Regardless of how complex this system may become, what it can never do is ""reach back"" into itself and change the course of any single electron beyond what has been naturally caused, and if there is no way to deviate from a predefined natural course, there can be no free will. (Note: the above is not a new or radical idea - it's the same sort of thing that Hume was getting at 280 years ago, in the quote at the top of this )This logical argument has been enough to convince me, and I think it's really the foundation of any convincing argument against free will. However authors like Dennett (I can see why he loves this book) shun this core challenge to free will, sometimes even taking the position that it is obvious and already generally accepted. They prefer instead to examine other definitions of free will which are compatible with determinism and are meaningful philosophically and ethically. While I don't generally disagree with these definitions and approaches, I also agree with Sam Harris in a belief that there is something very significant in the simple concept of the absence of ""pure"" free will that deserves to be clearly stated and understood, and I strongly believe that most ordinary people aren't familiar with this concept at all (let alone accept it), though it may be fairly mundane in some academic circles.And so, I think the key failing of this book, The Illusion of Conscious Will in largely ignoring ""pure"" free will, is that it does not present a clear or convincing enough argument for its thesis. I cannot imagine that a reader who is not already convinced that conscious will is an illusion, would be moved to that position by this book. What the book does well, however, for a reader who already accepts the axiom, is to explain in detail the ways in which illusory will is compatible with experimental evidence and our everyday experiences of free will. He breaks down what constitutes our perception of actions being ""willed"", and shows how these do not always correlate with actions that we cause; he examines actions of which we are just as much the author, but for which we do not experience the feeling of ""will""; he examines the ways in which perception and memory can be fallible, even imposing a sense of will after the fact; he demonstrates the ways in which our definition of the ""self"" can be malleable in ways which further render incoherent the idea of personal will; and finally, he briefly attempts to tackle the implications of all this on how we live our lives. All of this is a fascinating and worthwhile examination in itself, but the problem with using this approach as a basis for an overall argument against the existence of free will, is that the evidence is too loose, the science far from settled. Scientific understanding of the human brain is in its infancy - we do not have anything approaching an accurate and complete model of the brain - and therefore much of what is presented can be interpreted ambiguously, and the case made is far from ironclad....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Aug 30, 2018","Sep 08, 2018","Mar 20, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/315583.The_Illusion_of_Conscious_Will

Dominating the first fifty or so pages, there is the clunky, procedural writer, who feels the need to narrate and describe in unnecessary detail every room that the protagonist happens to enter (why should we care that there is a table in the corner with a lamp on it!), and the features and clothing of each character whom he happens to meet. This writer also likes to interrupt dialogue with unnecessary descriptions of things that are going on in the background, like people placing drinks on the table, or lighting cigarettes. This type of writing is really poor and had me questioning why Williams is so highly regarded. Fortunately a second style of writing begins to appear after a few chapters, and this expands so as to dominate the later parts of the book. This second writer speaks eloquently about characters, emotions, and ideas. While the first writer draws fine detail with a pencil, the second one paints grand vistas in oil with broad strokes of colour.

Unfortunately Dennett’s view seems to be simply that the universe is deterministic, but at the level of complex creatures, evolution has driven the interactions within the brain and in relation to the external environment to generate a kind of will that is intentional and beneficial, and that for all intents and purposes (legal, moral, etc), this can be considered “free” will, or at least “a kind of free will worth having.” But even Dennett acknowledges that this kind of will is not really free from constraints, and is still deterministic (though, like a coin-flip, the outcome is dependent on so many factors that it cannot be reliably predicted).This secondary argument of evolved “free” will seems to have developed to provide a safety net for people who are convinced by the primary argument for determinism and would otherwise throw up their hands and scream, “then what’s the point!” - these are people who grasp determinism but have not thought about the subject any further. In this respect his arguments for evolved free will (though they are largely informal and often not logically argued) do provide some perspective for such people and may cushion the blow, or at least promote further thought. What I do respect about the work is that it is (for once!) philosophy that is grounded in science, not simply speculation. Dennett draws from examples in psychology and neuroscience, and while his conclusions are sometimes tenuous and often speculative, they are at least grounded in physical fact.For me though, the ideas presented are not really that profound. The conclusions are often pushed past the point that they have been established through the argumentation, and to the extent that they have been demonstrated, they are often fairly obvious. The ideas and examples given can often be found elsewhere in his own work and the work of popular authors like Richard Dawkins. I would therefore only recommend this to someone with an interest, but who has not read many other works on these topics....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 11, 2016","Mar 22, 2016","Mar 11, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2071.Freedom_Evolves

So at this point I'm convinced that he is an outstanding writer - the only point I'm undecided on is whether The Crossing gets 4 stars or 5 stars. I did feel that the storyline was a little loose when compared to All The Pretty Horses. A few times the story felt like it completey wrapped up, but then it kind of kept going, awkwardly finding a new direction. The book really reads like three separate stories about a single character, wrapped up with some overarching themes and ideas. This format felt a little odd when reading it, but I don't necessarily want to hold this structure against the book - it's not important that a novel fits a standard format or structure. And by the end you get an idea of what McCarthy may be trying to do with the format. After all, a person's life doesn't really fit a neat narrative structure - it can have many phases which may not have very much to do with each other except for distant cause and effect and the fact that they are tied to that person. I think that McCarthy likes to play with these kinds of reflections about the nature of life.Despite the meandering, I never felt bored with this book. I get the feeling that McCarthy could write a story about anything and it would be totally real and compelling. Really, the writing is about as good as writing gets. You don't have to read for very long before coming across a subtly wonderful phrase, or a tense scene, or a interesting moral choice, or a piece of writing that succinctly illuminates an aspect of the human condition. And it's all wrapped up in such direct language - we don't get inside the characters' heads - we just see them act and hear the words they speak and through their words and deeds we get to know them and understand them and understand ourselves and the world.I think I've talked myself into a rating....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 13, 2016","Feb 29, 2016","Feb 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7069817-the-crossing

If you are looking for a thorough analysis and exploration of what Wittgenstein's Mistress is about, read the excellent afterword by David Foster Wallace - I won't attempt anything like that here as his essay is already more erudite and trenchant than can be reasonably expected of a human being. For me, this book is a celebration of Western civilization: thought, culture and art; and in some ways it seems to be an elegy lamenting its loss. It is also an exploration of the mind, of loneliness and of the random, rambling, confused mess that is consciousness. The writing is superficially direct and simple, yet intricately and expertly layered - a ball of loose ends, false starts and half-connected ideas from which the reader is expected to weave his own tapestry. Wittgenstein's Mistress is not for everyone. In fact it's probably not for very many people at all: it is avant-garde, inscrutable, rambling, repetitive, pretentious, and uneventful. But it is also a thoroughly unique and engrossing experience of the kind that some (admittedly somewhat peculiar) readers will find absolutely irresistible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 20, 2016","May 24, 2016","Jan 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51506.Wittgenstein_s_Mistress

Through a series of disjointed vignettes, Rilke opens a window into the soul of his protagonist, but the view is as from a moving vehicle: the scenery is constantly changing, and one can only glimpse at the detail. The Notebooks blend the mythic with the mundane, combining obscure ancient tales and anecdotes about everyday life, in a manner that appears haphazard, but which taken together produce a complex portrait of Rilke himself: expressing the accumulated aspirations and anxieties of the young poet in a foreign land. He is concerned with history (both his own and that of the world) as a power to influence and to motivate, but also as baggage; a force to be fought and overcome. Above all he is concerned with death, not as an end, but as a thing intertwined with life itself - a surrealism that emphasizes a powerful truth.What a strange and beautiful novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Sep 28, 2016","Oct 02, 2016","Jan 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3347848-the-notebooks-of-malte-laurids-brigge

This kind of writing is all syle - the characters are there to make witty observations and snappy one liners; the plot is ad-hoc, difficult to follow and largely irrelevant: it moves forward simply to introduce new settings for the protagonist to describe in droll detail, and new characters to have marvelously witty exchanges with each other.

Bioy creates a haunting, lonely, mysterious story, with creepy undertones, that compels you to read on. There are certain parts of the story I just couldn't buy as literal - nor could they be passed-off as surreal - so I think the book is best interpreted as something of an allegory; a contemplation of mortality and a kind of idealised love. I didn't find the philosophical and metaphysical implications of the eventual revelations to be entirely convincing. It has something of the arrested profundity of an episode of original series Star Trek, by which I mean that it's intriguing but not entirely coherent when you really think about it (the date of the novel's publishing is a mitigating factor here).

This novel is clearly Bolaño's attempt at the latter, from a writer who knew that in all likelihood it would be his last. The novel is unfinished, though not so much in the sense of being incomplete, but it lacks polish, as if Bolaño did not have sufficient time for revision before he died. It is beautifully paced. At times it is supremely immersive, at times exceedingly dull. It is written in a simple, direct style, with an occasional roughness that resonates with its general indeterminacy. A vague sense of unease permeates the novel.But 2666 celebrates its imperfection: it is loose and sprawling; it makes no attempt to generate a tidy narrative; its general thesis is elusive, as is even the meaning of its title. The reader is constantly forced to engage with the author to question every aspect of the novel. What is Bolaño trying to do here? What is the purpose of this or that digression? Why does he describe all of the Santa Teresa killings in such graphic, yet tedious detail? Is he comparing (or contrasting) this with other killings in the book? Is he implying something about the way that the nature of murder can change with circumstance, or is he arguing the opposite? Perhaps this is a commentary about the value of women, or the state of the Mexican nation, or of Mexican culture? The novel allows a wide interpretation of each of the multitudes of questions it raises. 2666 is a search; a question unanswered. Bolaño uses endless ambiguity to force the reader to personally confront every question directly. As a novel its nature and meaning are elusive, but it reveals something rare and indefinable. Bolaño has succeeded in creating a novel that does what a great novel should: it provides a framework; a muse for the contemplation of the struggle for meaning in a complex world....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Jul 09, 2017","Jul 30, 2017","Jan 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3115359-2666

It is about the tension between the differences that keep us apart, and the lonelinessThe Heart is a Lonely Hunter is about the dreams that drive us. It is about the tension between the differences that keep us apart, and the loneliness that brings us together. Each of McCullers' characters is in some way closed off from other people. The dreams that define their purposes so clearly to themselves are essentially dismissed and misunderstood by others. Through Singer they find a sympathetic ""ear"", someone who understands and lends legitimacy to their aspirations. But what they see is only a false reflection. The tragedy is compounded by Singer's own obliviousness, and his mislaid devotion to his friend who is himself oblivious in turn. In this regression there is a message of inescapable human disconnection - the inability of people to truly understand each other, consumed as they are by their own private desires, unable to see others except through the prism of their own perspective. Even Blount and Copeland, who share similar values and aspirations, are driven apart by their petty differences. This is all the more tragic because what motivates them both is love, and a desire to liberate those they see being exploited. The story reveals both the supreme power of our innate desires (they can define, drive, and ultimately destroy) but surprisingly, also a certain impotence. The desires that are so powerful within us can be simply cast aside, as when Mick takes a job knowing that she doesn't need to, and knowing that doing so means giving up her musical ambitions. Despite her absolute obsession with music, she performs this act almost causally. She understands on some level that growing up requires acceptance of this inevitable abandonment of self - it is at this moment she realises she has become an adult.For someone with the empathy and sensitivity of McCullers, the era in which the book was written must have felt explosive. Issues of race and gender oppression, the extreme poverty of the depression, imminent war and the horrors of fascism - all were visibly simmering and set to erupt over the coming years. In many ways, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a political novel - a reaction to the problems of the age. But McCullers writes with a compassion and desire for social justice that was well ahead of her time. She treats race and sexuality with a deep honesty and empathy, and accepts her characters' human shortcomings (some of which may be uncomfortable even for readers today) with nothing but compassion; and entirely without moral condemnation. It is an incredible achievement, especially for someone so young....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Dec 05, 2016","Dec 15, 2016","Dec 22, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37381.The_Heart_Is_a_Lonely_Hunter

While the story stands on its own, perhaps the most intriguing thing about it, is what it is not, and what it is not is Lolita . The story is of course beautifully written, but what's missing here is the sublimely creepy character of Humbert Humbert, who (unreliably) narrates Lolita in the first person, allowing the prose to elevate to such lofty heights in describing his profound lust, while holding his depravity a degree removed from the subject, thus affording the reader a fog of protective uncertainty, against what would otherwise be a depiction of a clearly vile scenario. Whereas conversely the protagonist (who is never named) of The Enchanter is not given the opportunity to cloud the situation by presenting his side of the story. The third person narrator, although operating fairly close to the character, is forced to lay bare the events in a way that removes any capacity for compassion on the part of the reader and forces (view spoiler)[the inevitability of his eventual demise. (hide spoiler)] Given that this story follows so closely many of the major plot points of Lolita, it is almost impossible to evaluate this as a completely separate work. But where it does deviate significantly and in fact holds its own against its more famous cousin is in the final ten pages, where we see the protagonist presented with The Chance He Has Been Waiting For, but is not afforded the same good fortune as Humbert is later to receive. This scene brims with tension and suspense, and is handled every bit with the virtuosity and mastery of language that one can expect of Vladimir Nabokov....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 19, 2015","Dec 22, 2015","Dec 19, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6797751-the-enchanter

The Original of Laura should be evaluated for what it is: an artifact, providing insight into the mind of a genius, and a man at the brink of death. Death, erasure and annihilation are major themes here (to such extent that themes can be gleaned from such a short and disjointed work), and the writing seems to shift at times directly to Nabokov's own voice rather than any story involving Laura (or Flora, or Cora). Despite the number of pages, this book takes less than an hour to read from cover to cover, but again its value is not of a linear narrative that should be read straight up in this manner. What the book provides is an opportunity to look inside Nabokov's writing process by examining its early stages; to pick apart how this man was able to construct a narrative from its barest scaffolding. By examining the cards, the reader is left to speculate on the words that have been redacted, on what was meant to follow when a trail of thought suddenly ends, on what Nabokov could have build had he been allowed the time to complete.

He gives the narration this cocky, sarcastic tone, as if he is boasting the entire time in order to impress a room full of fourteen-year-olds. I could not separate his voice from the intended voice of the story's protagonist, and so I found myself really disliking the tone and style of the narration.Overall this book explored its premise in a fairly thorough and interesting way, and there are some deeper themes of identity that permeate both the story and the writing style itself. But there is a lot that I didn't enjoy about the book. The structure was basically a police procedural, which I don't think is a good way to explore the world in which this takes place. By choosing this format, the story is forced into twists and turns of varying degrees of complexity and believability in order to generate a compelling plot. This takes the premise away from what could be an interesting examination of people living in fairly unique and extreme conditions, and pushes it into the domain of farce. The characters become little more than engines to drive forward the convoluted plot. The protagonists arrive inevitably at their conclusion, following a tortuous path of seemingly arbitrary occurrences, lucky coincidences and stretches of logical deduction (and often credulity). Scalzi makes some pretty boring and cliched choices in his characters. The main character is a billionaire (who unbelievably is also an FBI agent) and one of the most famous people in the world, which conveniently gives him access to virtually infinite resources and puts him in contact with very powerful people, who just so happen to be the very people that play important roles in the case he is investigating. This is some Dan Brown level bullshit. For some reason this guy decides to move into a share house with people he doesn't know, which doesn't really make any sense but I guess is an easy way to introduce a bunch of new characters. Other characters include the surly partner with a mysterious past, whose personal issues later turn out to be rooted in an experience that directly pertains to the case at hand (how lucky)! There are a host of other cardboard characters - the father who is an amalgamation of Michael Jordan and Warren Buffett, the genius programmer whom our heroes just happen to know, the poor retarded Native American kid who becomes a pawn in a much larger plot, but heroically (view spoiler)[sacrifices himself for the greater good. (hide spoiler)]One of the biggest problems with this book is the fact that it is written almost entirely as dialogue, with smatterings of first person narration. Everything happens through the dialogue. There is endless exposition with characters explaining what is going on to other characters (who one would expect should already be aware). This further destroys any remaining trace of reality that the characters may have had. I get the feeling that Scalzi started with a strong premise and back story, then setup the structure based on what might generate the highest likelihood of a movie deal. Which is fine, the movie when it inevitably gets made may be good, but this is not the kind of writing that makes for great reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 16, 2015","Dec 23, 2015","Dec 16, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21418013-lock-in

The character of Bolívar is one of flaws and contradictions: a great yet humble man, ambitious in his aims, though not desirous of personal glory. He died in relatively modest conditions, having rejected political power and exhausted his vast fortune. It was perhaps his virtues as much as his faults that hindered unification, and instead left behind a foundation of uncertainty and instability for these nations to build upon. I wish I'd had a greater prior familiarity with the figures, places and events of this novel; unfortunately so much of the historical detail was lost on me. But the novel is also about personal decline, about success and failure as seen in the frame of the finality of death. All this conveyed, of course, though García Márquez's masterful prose, which moves with such gentle, understated ease between the present and the remembered past, constantly shifting between the internal and external, yet arriving at each consecutive point in the narrative in a way that feels entirely natural and consequential. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Apr 29, 2019","May 07, 2019","Dec 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/602387.The_General_in_His_Labyrinth

Such connections are there for the reader to discover throughout the novel, which deals not only in dichotomies, but in ambiguities (such fertile ground for contemplation). But what makes The Magic Mountain a pleasure to read is the extraordinary sensitivity to the human condition that is evident throughout. Mann portrays the relationships between the characters in sublime detail, filled with subtle emotional interplay (of uncertainty, desire and conflict), which characterize the complex and segregated internal nature of real human relationships; an insight that is rarely conveyed so well in literature. The Magic Mountain is long and challenging, but depth of the writing and the consistent beauty of the prose are such that it was rarely boring. There's so much here that I feel it's impossible to absorb entirely in a single reading.

I have found in my experience, and from reading the s of others, that having enjoyed one Bolaño novel is no guarantee that you will enjoy the next. In fact, given the range of styles and approaches he employs, perhaps a correspondingly wide range of responses is also to be expected. So in a way when we talk about a shared appreciation of Bolaño’s writing, it may be the case that we are all talking about different things. If there is such a thing as a Rosetta Stone for Bolaño, it is this novel: The Savage Detectives seems to compress and showcase many of the diverse features of his writing. The first and last sections of the novel employ the direct, journalistic structure of The Third Reich, while the lengthy central section utilises the multi-viewpoint oral history structure of The Skating Rink, which reveals the story gradually, almost incidentally, while building a larger universe (perhaps more accurately: a multitude of universes that bump and coalesce to form a volatile broth). The novel contains in one of its chapters the entire summarised plot of Amulet, and its major themes concerning literature as a fundamental component of life recalls Last Evenings on Earth. The entire central section of the novel is a relentless variation on a theme – also one of Bolano’s hallmarks - which is reminiscent of Nazi Literature in the Americas and the much-despised fourth part of 2666. These chapters are rich, though difficult, and here one must be prepared to become the Detective of the novel, uncover the story piece by piece, while accepting that it is impossible to reveal all the connections.  All of these things make The Savage Detectives a fairly challenging read, especially if you are someone unfamiliar with Bolaño’. If you have read this novel and felt mixed reactions, this is perfectly reasonable, and I hope the preceding paragraph can help indicate which of his other novels you may enjoy more, and which to avoid. For me, I appreciated the synthesis of The Savage Detectives, which encompassed my favourite aspects of Bolaño, while transcending those I enjoy less. This is the eighth Bolaño novel I’ve read and perhaps the last I will read for some time. It felt like a culmination, an apotheosis, and (strangely, given it is actually one of his earlier novels) something of a resolution....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Mar 03, 2019","Mar 11, 2019","Dec 09, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3303801-the-savage-detectives

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this book threw me, initially; It took a few stories before I could mentally synchronise with it. The style is quite dense, economical. A lot of meaning and intent is condensed in few words. The subjects and themes range from personal vendetta, to philosophy, even to mathematics. Much is cryptic to me, crammed with esoteric philosophical allusions, or references to people and places contemporary and local to Borges. He is imaginative: the structure is certainly unique and unlike any other short story collection I've read (when reading, one gets the impression that accounts are being told third-hand; that Borges is personally recounting a story he has read in another book, rather than a traditional detached narrative where the author is absent), and each story really gives the reader something to think about- whether it is an interesting construction, a philosophical idea, a search for meaning overlooked, or simply an unexpected twist. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 05, 2016","Jan 11, 2016","Dec 09, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24215964-fictions

When a person remains within the familiar confines of school and family life, these questions are safely contained, rendered benign by their abstractness. But when that person is freed; when the invisible bell jar is lifted for the first time and they are exposed - as Esther was during her time in New York City - one is forced to confront the realities of the world. Esther is of a certain type for whom this confrontation is particularly difficult. Having been allowed only a narrow window into the world, she was certain of the constancy of her desires and aspirations though never having been granted the space to really explore herself. Despite the privileges of her upbringing and education, she is stifled by society, repressed sexually, and expected to discard her ambitions and adopt those of society: to become a loving wife to a handsome and successful husband, and a mother to a litter of children. During her stay in New York her emotional foundation collapses, and she is left to release pieces of herself, as the contents of her wardrobe, to wheresoever the wind may carry them. She has lost all ambition, and she discards the conventions of society. She drifts from institution to institution, and in her detachment acquiesces to her confinement and her treatments, with her mother all the while imploring her to just be normal again and to fit in, as if it were that simple.What makes Ether's decline so compelling is its complete logic, and her eminent reasonableness and cogency of thought throughout the ordeal. Despite being technically insane, she acts rationally within the framework of her experience. Her dereliction of agency may not be productive, but it is understandable and it is difficult not to be sympathetic. Had she lived in a later time, Esther (and I suppose Sylvia Plath herself) may have found in the world a freedom that did not exist in their own time. Perhaps this freedom would have been enough to allow them each to follow a different path. I hope so.
