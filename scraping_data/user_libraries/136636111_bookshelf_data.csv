This 5th year Delta Gamma sorority girl becomes bewitched with the power of killing men. Until she meets this one guy she actually kinda likes and has to balance her evil with some romance. I really don’t have much to say about this one. It’s just crazy bingeable… an all around good time. Our main character often feels like a caricature whose one quirk is her murderous tendencies, but I didn’t really mind that. Actually, most of the characters leaned into caricatures of themselves… I think that was solely because of the short length of the book. There was probably depth to them, but that depth was something our narrator didn’t really care to disclose… if that makes sense? What I’m trying to say is that this book is story driven. Lol…that took me a while to get there. There was one Easter egg that could have been explored more deeply… I won’t let on if any of you want to read. It was dropped in the first 100 pages and the reveal was pretty unsatisfying. Once again, I didn’t really care. This book was a comfort read for a psychopath. I guess I could see the societal message that was teased out throughout the novel but it was nowhere near the highlight of the book. The true highlight was the romp of it all.

Her short choppy sentences serve a bit of a different purpose—while her past works have centered around a central protagonist, this one feels a bit more like an ensemble cast. Set in medieval times, our (kinda) main character Marek is a shepherd’s son who kills his best friend either out of accident or out of jealousy. Just his luck, his best friend is the son of the town lord, and this lord chooses to take Marek in as a replacement son. This book tackles themes of purity, Christianity, suffering, class, and so much more in a spanning yet succinct length. I’m honestly shocked at how Moshfegh was able to kill so many birds with one stone. Someone online called this book a parable, and that’s the only best way to describe it.It can get gross and dirty. It seems like Moshfegh tried to fit every disgusting and depraved thing a human could possibly do, so be forewarned!!!

One commenter, a proclaimed fan of Cleo & Frank, went on a paragraphs-long rampage in my comment section about how I was just so so wrong. So these here are my so so wrong ideas…We start off promising! Cleo & Frank meet. She’s much younger than him, also British, also in need of a visa. Their relationship accelerates into a marriage after a few months despite them not quite knowing each other well enough to be making that decision anyway. Their love tries to tape over every broken part of their relationship, but every crack reaches its critical point of inevitable breakage!!!!I liked this premise. Nothing wrong with the premise or themes here at all okay? The author’s (Coco Mellors) technique is just so elementary it’s palpable. With chapters switching third-person-limited perspectives from one character to another, Mellors pinpoints their every emotion with sharp clarity. Too clear, I’d say. Instead of telling me… maybe… that Cleo is hyperventilating or something, she just says that she’s anxious. No problem with that at all! Except when it’s every single time Mellors conveys emotion. Sooo much telling. Not enough showing!!!! Next up on the chopping block are these meandering side character chapters. So random and rare that I wonder why I’m even in these people’s heads. Why am I getting their perspective. It does not fit in the story. But an exception, I must admit, is character Eleanor’s chapters. Honestly beautiful… Mellors showcased her talent there and then forgot it existed in the rest of the book apparently. Because snooze fest in the latter half of the book.

Her level of honesty in this book sets it apart from others, leaving me wondering how she felt so comfortable with revealing everything to what turned out to be a massive audience. What particularly stuck with me was her conflicting feelings for her mother -- judging from the title, I was expecting McCurdy to despise her. Yet, she disclosed these complex feelings of love, betrayal, adoration, and resentment all at once. A girl's relationship with her mother may never be perfect, but we always hope for it to be.

God damn, that's a long time, and I don't think I'd be able to do it myself but nonetheless.... When the two first meet at the age of 14, Kate is awestruck by how cool Tully is. She knows what clothes to wear and what kids to talk to so that the crown of popularity can grace her head within the first few days of moving to her town. While it's true Tully is cool, she's not exactly content with her life. Seeing her new neighbor Kate and family eating dinner every night all happy together makes her feelings of inadequacy toward having a stoner mom exacerbated. But after a rough night, Tully opens up to Kate and befriends her. Their story unfolds from there.Of course, the dichotomy between the two girls did not just disappear when they vowed to stay friends forever -- rather, it manifests in quite harmful ways. Although the two internally care for each other, many writers would argue that one of the hallmarks of female friendship is this simultaneous presence of love and resentment. TullyandKate toe the line like it's the only thing they know how to do. After all, it is one of the only character traits they have in common. I am truly at a lack of words trying to express how wonderful this book was. As we travel through time and grow up with the girls, the book metamorphoses. At first, it takes one form we grow to become familiar with, but so seamlessly, it melds into another. Without even noticing, you've reached the final pages and realized you've read a book that's turned from childhood innocence to envious relationships to loving families. I feel like I've lived a LIFE, only to realize I've just read it through someone else's eyes. I don't know. I really don't know. I audibly sobbed my way through the last 50 pages, and no book has ever come close to leaving me like that (runners-up are The Great Alone and The Nightingale, which, not coincidentally, happen to also be written by Kristin Hannah. I love that woman.)While I will mention that Tully and Kate sometimes feel like caricatures of certain personality traits, I don't think it detracts from the book too far. Often times, their stubbornness to grow is what prompts issues in their life to arise and reveals the effect each of them have on the other. Perhaps, it can feel like a bit of an exaggeration, but the consequences are all fluid. They make sense. And one can only read the full story to understand what happens from there.But I would recommend this a million times over. To those who enjoy the journey. To people who need to apologize and people who need to forgive. And to any woman ever. This is the female friendship wrapped up in a pretty little package.

People fail to find the essence but it's marketed as that anyway. What I've seen is that they take the most shocking parts of it all and chalk it up to be the highlights, even though, in reality, they probably wouldn't even make the reel. This is a rant about me being told that this book was a horror because it was much less like that and much more like a Moshfegh -- sorry guys. Death In Her Hands type beat. But let me not get distracted. As always, a plot lowdown: Upon her husband (Ralph)'s mother's suicide, protagonist and narrator Abby rejoices over the fact that she no longer has to deal with offhand remarks about her character in a manner so delightful that could win her the motherly love she so always longed for...because that was never going to work anyway. Abby steals the ring off her late mother-in-law's finger while her body is in the hospital. She buries it in the yard, hoping to bring it back up to Ralph when she's finished grieving, like ""Oh! I just found this what!"" Maybe he'll give her the ring that his mother refused to pass down to her. But things get weird as Ralph starts noticing his mother around the house -- what could she be back for? After long pages of rambling from an insecure woman (which I get, I don't blame her), I started thinking to myself, ""How does one define horror?"" And then I got to the climax and thought to myself ""Ahhh. I think I get it now."" In the middle of multiple ""wtf just happened"" moments of the final pages, I had to try to analyze what literally any of it meant. What I've deduced is that author Hogarth is examining a woman's desire to be a good mother, whether that be instigated by society or childhood trauma (or is it innate? Bc if so, evolution skipped that one out on me). And in being the perfect mother, you must also be the perfect wife. But even if you try your darndest to fit this mold, you'll still get flak from the people you're supposed to call your loved ones. You're not a good mother. No one is.So is the only good mother a dead one? The one who, in her absence, is absolutely incapable of making mistakes, or causing conflict? Hogarth's diction is masterfully chosen to communicate all these things. The word ""baby"" is stretched to its edges as all its different meanings are used in close proximity to each other, whether it's to describe a lover or a yet-to-be-conceived child. It makes you feel disgusted, but I can't believe someone was capable of making me feel that way with only one word. I don't know. I'll leave you with this quote to think about.""But now [Ralph's mother] was quiet, now that she might be gone, Ralph was being pummeled by the full typhoon of his love for her, one of life's cruelest tricks, that the extent of this love waits to reveal itself.""

I don't know how I've only read Utopia Avenue by this man because this was a stroke of genius. I fell in love.In a paranormal psychological thriller, Mitchell divides this book into sections, each following a new first person perspective, from either a victim of the mysteries of the Slade House or someone otherwise related. Your classic haunted house story takes a turn as these interconnected plots jump 9 years forward each time to give you another mini-story that serves as a puzzle piece for the audience. I'll spare you the dirty details for the sake of your enjoyment... but if you've read this, please message me. I need someone to talk to about it. Every single time I thought I had a well-rounded idea of where the story was going to go, I was completely swept off the Earth's axis. At first, I assumed the novel would follow the first person, Nathan's, perspective for its entirety, but I was a bit disappointed when I was proved wrong -- for his storytelling remains my favorite out of all of them.But that is not to say that the others were terrible! No no NO they were far from it. Each of the characters were SO distinct. Little nuances appeared across them that differentiated the present perspective from the last, and I am truly in awe at Mitchell's mastery in giving each character their own voice. I don't know how he managed to get inside the head of each one. It's like he knew them. It felt raw and authentic, as though the story was being told to me by the character themselves.I think it's important to note that the final act references Mitchell's The Bone Clocks, which I'm very regretful for not having read prior to this. I feel as though the payoff would have been that much more satisfying, so I don't know if those of you reading would like to heed some advice. Nonetheless, I don't feel like the tie-in detracted from the main story at all, unlike the de Zoet plotline in Utopia Avenue (imo). This could absolutely stand on its own, but also allows room for further stories to be built.I feel like i've written an essay, so in spirit of those written by most high schoolers at one point or other... in conclusion...... this book was phenomenal, unpredictable, unputdownable, and just downright entertaining.

Kuang’s previous works have been so highly praised. Although I heard amazing things for The Poppy War and Babel, both works that I’ve been wanting to pick up for quite some time, this was a bit of a letdown for me. I’m going to say one thing right off the bat: after reading the masterpiece that is Disorientation by Elaine Hsieh Chou, which has VERY similar themes to this book, Yellowface simply could not measure up to me. In that novel, stolen Asian literature is tackled both so maturely and humorously in a way that makes it feel like the pinnacle of modern satire. R.F. Kuang’s approach to this was surely unique: writing from the white woman’s perspective, a task that was likely challenging considering she had to prioritize humanizing the main character while pointing out her flaws. There were a lot of great questions opened up here — who has the right to tell certain stories? when does inspiration become stealing? do white men fetishize their asian partners? and the like. Yet, I feel as though the answers to these questions weren’t explored as deeply as they could have been. This novel was tied so closely to the plot (mainly a lot of insight into the publishing process) that any actual thesis wasn’t backed up with much contextual evidence. I just could not stop thinking about how much more masterfully these ideas were examined in Disorientation. I wish I didn’t have to compare, but these are my thoughts! Otherwise, the book was compulsively readable. Yes, I was entertained, but for an author of Kuang’s status, I was just expecting so much more. I can’t wait to hear everyone’s thoughts when the book comes out.

The girl came in town to help her brother get the house in ship-shape condition so that it could be ripe for the market, and that's where our story begins. I don't have many remarks as to the romance itself, as it follows your average plot and takes your average turns. I mean, it was simple, and that's exactly the kinda thing I was looking for. I enjoyed it, I was squirming, I was blushing, but I didn't get incredibly invested to the point of me completely swooning over it. Sam's a sweet guy, and Phoebe's a... girl, for sure. Although I feel like the dissertation plotline had a healthy amount of page time (screen time), it also felt blah? Like it was just there? I will note that I loved hearing Phoebe's perspective on how the method of spreading true crime in the media influences our perception of the modern world, but its integration in the story fell apart after she and Sam started getting things going.

Yes, I knew Kafka before then. I'm not stupid. I read the Metamorphosis in high school English. I don't even know what I'm saying.

I thought it was a bit silly because I thought to myself... you know, this story is almost, dare I say, Kafkaesque... until I had to re-realize that it's quite literally based on what he wrote. We as readers are introduced to a very unique set design, drawn out on the page and manipulated cleverly to communicate different locations and plot progression. I really enjoyed seeing the stage used in such a meaningful manner, although I question how quickly stage managers were able to relocate set pieces from place to place so quickly. It seemed like every 4 pages we were getting a whole new setting... I don't know, that's not really for me to wonder. I'm sure the live audience back in the 60s witnessed it firsthand and can vouch for the playwrights, but it was such intricate design......sorry that's enough from me.As for the story itself, it was silly. Joseph K, big boy banker, is flanked by guards in the middle of the night who claim that he is under arrest - for what reason? He doesn't know. The man jumps from law authority to law authority trying to get himself out of it all the way up to his trial where he attempts to give a ""and then everyone clapped"" moment, but fails. I guess this says a lot about society and the judicial system and what not. I was enjoying it in the beginning and then quickly got tired of it though. That's why it's a 3 starrer.

Plot progresses forward as he comments on certain aspects of the human condition. He multitasks in a way I have never seen done so efficiently before- emotion of curiosity in a book- anecdotal. I feel like he writes a bunch of short stories (in the sense that he gives them all much attention to communicating in metaphor) & somehow melds them together (pg. 102 proved me right)- like reading the script of someone's dream- he writes little lines that each deserve their own beginning of ""Keep calm and...""- still a cohesive story though- fluid. Reading this feels like being carried down the stream's current- some of the characters lack the same depth as the others have- very academic.

But he's my boyfriend's favorite author, and after his incessant attempts bordering on nuisance to get me to read SOMETHING by him, he ended up just buying this book for me so I would read it. Well, I wasn't gonna let a good $20 go to waste. And I cannot deny... this slapped.Boyfriend is aware that my taste in books tend to be those in which literally nothing happens. Given the fact that the majority of Stephen King's works have relatively infamous storylines, he specifically recommended this one because the biggest chunk of it was just focused on main character's life. Outside of the main plot is some pretty thorough character exploration, and that's the kind of shit I live for. So let's get a quick synopsis shall we....Jake Epping is a teacher who has been donned with the responsibility of traveling through a portal hidden in the back of a closing burger place that takes those who use it back to the year 1958. Just what has he been tasked to do? Prevent the assassination of beloved former President John F. Kennedy, of course! I feel like I've been doing this far too often with my recent s, but I'll leave my spoilage at that. You can figure out for yourself what happens in the rest of the novel. It's a journey, and it's better traveled alone.But boy do I admire Stephen King's writing. I love an author who knows how to sew a common thread from the beginning of the story to the very end, and for a massive brick of a book like this one, I think that's an awesome feat. I really don't know how to explain it, but King can tell a cohesive story. One thing I'd like to note is that I didn't feel terribly connected to the main characters... I loved the side ones, but for a story that was so focused on Jake's double life, I wasn't terribly invested. Maybe I just didn't like him all that much, and that's fine! It was still crazy and wonderful. After reading this, I'm definitely more inclined to lean into more of Stephen King's work. Perhaps I was blinded by the fact that all of his books are shelved in the horror section of every bookstore even though not all of his books even fall under that genre.

Well, humanity has colonized essentially every planet and rock in the solar system, so that’s our grounds for where we start. But the heart of this book lies in its mystery.Detective Miller has been assigned to a small, throw-away job to find a missing girl (except she doesn’t really want to be found, her parents kinda want her back… so it’s a kidnap job).

Even though our main character originally went into this whole thing being interested in the woman, she ends up finding herself a lot more pleased when submitting to the man. Enter questions of inherent power dynamics between men and women, morality regarding certain kinks, the influence of gender in sexuality, etc. A lot more shit happens in this that makes the book feel like a steaming pot of gossip that you probably shouldn’t be reading. So sorry… I was very intrigued.One thing I love about Acts of Service is that it tackles real ideas about sexuality very seriously. In this s o c i e t y (dare I say), sex is still really taboo, so that makes conversations about its effects in our human interactions pretty difficult. But I honestly think these effects are important to discuss, and Lillian Fishman opens the door to a bit of that dialogue over power and desire. Even though we might be into certain things, there are real world implications for it, and this book just kinda got me thinking, which is something I wasn’t really expecting it to do.

I looked at some of the other s written by dedicated fans of Seanan McGuire’s Middlegame, and the lot of them were just happy that they got more lore in this fictional alchemical world. And I certainly enjoyed that aspect of it yes!! McGuire is still a wildly talented writer, but I was disappointed anyway.Middlegame (the companion novel to Seasonal Fears that came out before this one) literally rewired my brain and blew me out of the water. Never have I ever been more confused with the puzzle of a novel that I kept turning the pages to learn just what the hell was going on. And the characters were so so lovable!! Dear god it was so good. In Seasonal Fears, I think the one thing that is just as well accomplished is McGuire’s brilliant characterization. In the first 50 pages, you already feel emotionally attached to the main characters, which is like… how do you do that?? Instead of Roger and Dodger, Melanie and Harry, two 17-year-old lovebirds, are the stars of the show. They’ve been friends (and progressed into lovers) ever since childhood since they lived in the same neighborhood. But on the night of their Valentine’s Day dance, they both drop dead on the football field, become resurrected, and learn about how closely their identities are tied into the fantastical world they never knew existed. Now, they must embark on a journey to compete for their positions as the living embodiments of Winter and Summer.Sounds awfully confusing, right? Ehhh… McGuire makes sure that you get what’s going on, and that’s honestly the biggest downfall of this novel. While Middlegame revealed only tiny bits and pieces of information about the rules of the world, so it’s more of a mindfuck once you reach the end, Seasonal Fears just explains everything to you. For pages on pages. And it’s overkill. All of this is basically done through one of the secondary characters whose purpose seemed to serve as just the world-builder. I guess she got a bit more depth later, but like… eh. There was just way to much exposition instead of actual action, or even just a more artful way of telling the story. It got tiring to me having to hear a different iteration of these rules just so that McGuire ensured the reader got it. Yeah, we got it.I do think Middlegame and Seasonal Fears work wonderfully as companion novels, as each book fills in some gaps that you may have missed from the other one. Seasonal Fears was still kinda fun to read, but after devouring the masterpiece that is Middlegame, it just really wasn’t the same.

I did pick this up solely because my boyfriend liked this book when he read it in high school, and since I'm pestering him to read Utopia Avenue, I thought it was only right to read the super cheap copy we found at Goodwill. (Also this is totally unrelated but I spilled water on the book and now the papers are all thick you know how it is? It makes me so sad to look at this book. Anyway-)Here we follow a young autistic boy named Christopher, who finds his neighbor's dog murdered in the night. In an attempt to solve the mystery of the killer, he writes a book (this book) detailing his entire detective process. Along the way, we learn more and more about Christopher's life, from the fact that he hates the color brown to the interesting dynamic among his immediate family. There were certainly twists I wasn't expecting and those that I were, which always come from reading from a child's perspective. I love reading from a child's perspective. I love Christopher. He is so sweet.This wasn't my favorite book of all time, but I do think that one thing author Mark Haddon exceeds at is telling a story through a young boy's eyes to make the reader sympathize with him. It's heartbreaking to have to read some of the things he goes through; yet, it also does become a bit tiresome. Even though it was a short read, I had to take a couple breaks through my experience because it was so different than what I'm used to.

While I was not on Earth, I read Cannery Row by John Steinbeck. Sure, it was for my English class, but I read it nonetheless. I did skim through bits and pieces of this novel when it was required reading for my English class in my junior year of high school, 3 years ago, and I guess I kinda remember having some lengthy discussions on it -- but nothing I ever paid much attention to. This time around, I actually digested the words on the paper!! That truly doesn't happen too often… unless the book actually interests me. 3 years ago, I didn't care. Now, I do.I think this novel came to me again in a time where I learned to appreciate the simplicity of things. I have become much more accustomed to reading novels that allow the stories to crawl out on their own (here am I paraphrasing Steinbeck himself), much like most of my new favorite books in the literary fiction genre. Since books like these don't tend to have a very strong plotline, I was happy to just float along and indulge in all of the shenanigans that ensued in Monterey in the mid-20th century, from catching frogs to throwing parties. Interspersed with chapters of fables or smaller stories about other people in town, it felt relaxing, like a breath of fresh air.I want to commend Steinbeck on his ability to drop minute details about the characters without going into further depth. What he wants us to know we will know, but other information will be kept hidden unless the need for it arises later on. It makes the reader question the contents of the characters' pasts: what happened that made them end up like this? But I do think a bit too much consideration on this topic will make for a less enjoyable read. We don't need to rack our brains to answer the mysteries of the story when we can instead sit back and watch. Just one more thing I wanted to note: I didn't entirely like the characterization of Asian characters in this novel, from ""the old Chinaman"" to Lee Chong. Both seemed flat, each representing different stereotypes often held for Asian characters. I don't know, just considering how much depth Steinbeck gave other characters, it felt a bit odd to leave those two very stale. That's all folks.

I absolutely ADORED Stuart Turton’s 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, and I was SO looking forward to seeing what other delightful mystery he cranked up. But this, for lack of a better phrase, sucks balls. I’ll admit, I was hooked from the synopsis and in the first 100 or so pages of the novel. How am I to describe this after reading the blurb Turton himself provided after the story’s close, which emphasizes his frustration in readers/critics trying to mold his work into one genre? Okay, well, it’s NOT a historical fiction set in 1634. It’s also NOT a boat book set on a boat. It’s NOT a devil story centered around a devil that may or may not exist. I’ll just safely say it’s a mystery... unless he has any objections to that. (I have to remark that it was really funny reading that blurb. He said something along the lines of “please don’t send me angry letters about the inaccuracies of men and women’s fashion,” which reminded me of angry comments I’d get for making minute mistakes on tik tok. Oh what a hard life it is for us both to be so famous!) Instead of crafting a set of wordy paragraphs in my , here is a list of grievances. Let’s shake things up, shall we! 1. Major plot points were poorly written and dropped in little phrases that you didn’t even realize something was happening until the characters started reacting. 2. Major plot points are basically all in the synopsis. You can only do that if your writing is good enough to fill in the gaps. I don’t think his was. 3. Hasty attempts were made to make these characters lovable, so I simply could not get myself to care. 4. The ending was ass bootycheeks. I don’t want to give any more of my brain power to this book. It was long, and I had to force myself to finish it. It’s really sad because there was truly so much potential to build a wonderful story with this premise, and perhaps even with the same exact plotline, but I don’t think Turton had the skillset to make me feel enraptured in this world. The writing was too elementary and distracted me from delving into it, sucks. Now if you’re Turton, and you’re reading this, I apologize for coming off harsh. It’s just fun.

Cisneros's collection of fictional short stories was assigned reading for my English class, but I need to add it to my roster because even assigned reading is reading, folks! Let's dive in, I guess.Any kind of work that I have to read and discuss in English always ends up being one of my favorites. This happened for Dante's Inferno, this happened for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, both in high school. I think I feel more elite than most readers of the same pieces because I assume I learn more than them. Did YOUR English professor give you a run-down of the author's life and make you watch Ted Talks that she gave? No! Because you didn't HAVE an English professor to make you do that. Even though I know this thought process is flawed, it makes me appreciate the writing so much more than if it were just leisure-reading. This collection is truly a gem. Some were definitely more entertaining than others, and I certainly have my favorites (""Never Marry a Mexican"" being my highest ranked out of all of them) -- but I would never say that one story was bad. They all had something different to offer, and depending on the reader, there will undoubtedly be some hidden value that another person would be unable to find. It was such a delight to both relate to and learn from Cisneros's characters' perspectives. From a scared eleven-year-old to an absolutely unhinged revenge-seeking woman (slay!!!), I was always intrigued. Truly I am shocked by how much emotion Cisneros is able to convey by telling the most specific of stories. A 3-page story about Barbies ends up being a thinkpiece on economic class differences? Brilliant. She writes how I can only dream of writing. I have to write an honorary paragraph dedicated to my best and favorite story: ""Never Marry a Mexican."" Dear God, don't you all say you're obsessed with the unhinged woman? This is it. This is she. For fans of Gillian Flynn and all that, I IMPLORE you to pick up this story. Goodness gracious, it's so good. I loved getting in her head. After reading this, I'd love to pick up House on Mango Street, which I've known a lot of you guys have already read. It is so highly praised after all. I admire Cisneros's style of integrating her own culture and Spanish language in away that is both foreign and familiar to me, a second generation immigrant who feels the need to project herself onto every main character ever.

I am sure all of you are absolutely bursting at the seams over the fact that I have finally finished a book. A whole book! I’ve been in the worst, most terrible, horrendous slump for the past few months after having read a bunch of shitty novels. I did not want to pick anything else up. So when I spotted The Idiot in our beloved Barnes & Noble and read the back of the book, I thought it was perfect for me right now. An awkward college student navigating both her passion for writing and her first love? She’s me ! I am she. I’m not even saying this in the ironic “this is my Joker moment” manner because it’s not ironic. Not at all, no siree. This quite literally IS my Joker moment. Now how is one to go about explaining the plot of a book that has no plot? In a style much like that of famed Ottessa Moshfegh and Sally Rooney, we follow a young Harvard freshman named Selin through her first year of higher learning. Since the book seems to let the stories crawl out onto the page themselves (thank you, Mr. Steinbeck), there are a plethora of the most valuable nuggets I have ever read in my life. At about page 50, I realized I had to annotate this book a little because I swear Selin has thought literally every thought I’ve ever thunk ever. Now I’m left with a copy that is fully marked-up and dog-eared after only one day of reading. It was addictive! (I am literally Selin, btw). I must remark that if you were to enjoy this as much as I had, you’d have to be a part of the target audience. There are some events in this novel that I would not have appreciated as much if I hadn’t gone through it myself. Undoubtedly my identity as a college student made me identify with the main character a bit further than someone who was, say, in middle school. If you were a younger reader, do be wary about that, but that’s not to say the book is useless without personal relation. Something I wish I had done prior to reading this book is picked up some Dostoevsky. Fyodor Dostoevsky himself had written a novel entitled The Idiot, and with all of the references to Russian characters and literature, I’m sure there were numerous allusions I missed out on. But it don’t matter. This novel was just such a gem. I kept turning page after page to see what other quip Selin would offer. Everything was also just so comical, and I personally think that a lot of humor in any kind of media makes the grittier moments of the story that much more hard-hitting. Selin’s relationship with Ivan was aggravating but relatable. The constant doubt influencing her every decision was both as well. I could not believe the amount of insight author Elif Batuman provided in this one novel. It truly feels like she poured her entire writing career into this, which makes sense as to why there’s a sequel coming out. But that does make me wonder: would Batuman be able to top herself after Selin’s story comes to a close? I’d recommend this one whole-heartedly. I’m only giving it 4 stars because the last third of the book seemed to drone on a bit more than its counterparts, but that could be because I was devouring this book in the span of like 30 hours. Who’s to say! Do pick it up, and I will probably be checking out the sequel. I’m interested to see if Selin learns from life going forward....more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Apr 09, 2022","Apr 10, 2022","Apr 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30962053-the-idiot

It’s not like the writing style is completely indigestible so much so that you’d have to google every other word, it’s just that these types of books are not what I normally gravitate to. You know, I like the modern stuff. It took me about 150 pages in to start really caring for the characters, and I will admit I was entertained.As my bf likes to remind me nearly every time I ask him why he likes the book so much, this is essentially a true story. It follows the life of a young Ishmael Worth, born out of a false marriage and raised in poverty as he tried to succeed with the cards that life has dealt him. The boy grows into a man over the span of the novel and faces more adversity, but the remarkable thing is how he continues to stick to his values. He’s a good person and whatnot. Sometimes (actually, often times) too good for his own good (and I found that annoying at points (my bf doesn’t like when I bring that up)).What else is there to say about this but that it’s a good biography. I do feel for Ishmael a lot. It’s not like what he goes through is A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara level shit, but he still didn’t have the best life out there. He tries nonetheless. The story did kinda leave off on an unfinished note, but I guess there’s a sequel to that. And word around the town (literally only my bf) tells me that it is heartbreaking.

Writing a book is a phenomenal accomplishment, and you should be proud of that! Now please kindly log off the Goodreads website and make yourself a nice green tea and do a facemask or something. I’m about to say rude things, some unwarranted and some completely warranted. After watching the movie Don’t Look Up, I was really looking forward to trying out some other media that would be able to delve in to the more science-y aspects of a comet crashing into Earth and ending all life as we know it. That was strike #1 for me. I saw this book in Barnes & Noble and bought it because the cover looked like a traveling comet that was bound to destroy our lovely home. I admit that it was my fault for not actually reading the summary on the inside flap, so to enlighten you all, this was actually about humans making alien contact with a planet named Omni that was going to cross paths with Earth. No destruction necessary. As I started reading the novel and realized my mistake, I thought to myself that it was fine. As long as I get those good good science elements. Strike #2. This book was like 10% sci, and 90% fi – percentages are estimates. God, was I disappointed. And in strike #3 I will list every single other grievance that I had with this book. Just to clarify, strike #3 is not my fault as the reader, it is the author’s. I am incredibly upset with Mr. Soto for providing me with such lovable characters and doing absolutely nothing with them for the span of 292 pages. In those passages that would so accurately describe feelings of love or loneliness, I felt like I was falling in love with these printed words on paper. Yet, it would end just like that. These relationships that were established between the characters would receive no further depth, leaving the reader to fill in the gaps. I also saw a similar thing happen with the plot. We would jump from point to point without elaboration. Although this may be effective in some instances, I think we missed out on a lot of great character development because Soto refused to tackle some of the more difficult conversations. And every political take was weak. Or centrist. Take an actual stand on something (or make a character take an actual stand on something) if you’re gonna make it political!I think the point of this book is another “aw humanity <3. The world is such a great place to be. Live laugh love while you’re alive! The birds and worms are all special too. Appreciate them!” But it was somehow difficult for me to get to this conclusion with certainty. Real quick: another thing I want to bring up that I feel was just thrown in as a cute little Easter egg were the passages from secondary characters in between the main storyline. I personally found little motive in including that. While they were fun to read, I don’t feel like they pushed the novel forward at all. I didn’t like this.

Although this novel has all of the ingredients that should combine to form one of my favorite books, I did not like the taste of it. Perhaps, these ingredients were thrown in willy-nilly, with no regard to the proportions and measurements provided in the recipe. Now that I say that, yeah. Yeah that’s it. There was way too much of some things, and way too little of others. Now, you know I hate to be a hater (that’s a lie. I don’t know why I lied. I’m sorry for lying), but this book was so surface level to me. Our unnamed protagonist has garnered some internet fame (or as the author Lockwood would say, “portal” fame) by making a stupid post asking whether or not dogs can be twins. Just like past internet stars such as Alex from Target or Daniel with the white Vans, she has been invited to numerous talk shows to, well, talk about it. While I pondered on this question (the dog twin question) for a little bit and found it to be humorous, I was waiting for something a little bit more. Something a little bit deeper. As I flipped through the pages, I was met with more post-ironic imitations of memes and things you would see posted on the portal. Some half-assed political commentary was made and then we moved on to the protagonist’s “irl” struggles. Some readers may say that this book was able to tackle “deep” issues posed by the portal and question what the modern age is coming to, but I would disagree. Unlike the title of the book suggests, nearly every point that Lockwood made has been made before. Honestly, everyone I know is talking about this. The internet sucks, and it’s ruining our perception of the real world and our interaction in relationships. What else do you have to offer? I have to say that most commentary that arose from this book came from quite a privileged and white perspective. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with providing that kind of viewpoint to the conversation, but it ends up being an incredibly lackluster reading experience in the kind of novel that should challenge the structure of today’s society. What do we have so far? Too little social criticism, and now I bring you too much fragmentary writing. I will say that this is more of a personal opinion, but I could not dive into Lockwood’s novel as deeply as I could have because almost every paragraph is separated by 3 little dots aligned in the middle of the page. While it made for a rapid read, it also rapidly jumped from topic to topic that I feel I could not be settled. If this was intentional to represent how gathering information feels in the portal, then I applaud Lockwood. Otherwise, I just don’t like it. Whether or not my criticism resonates with you has a lot to do with your individual reading taste. You may love this book, and I would totally be able to see where you’re coming from.

In a momentous turn of events, the pair run into Jen in person and end up deciding to go on a surfing trip with her and some of her friends. This is where things start to get weird. I REFUSE to go into any further detail than what I’ve already given, but there is so much more to the story that meets the eye. Most of my enjoyment that came out of reading this novel was from the sheer surprise that it provided me, and I want you all to go in blind too. The twists sure were something! Once I finished, I sat there staring at the very last page for at least three minutes trying to decide whether or not I hated it. I think I’ve settled on not hating it. Although what just happened was crazy unexpected, I think it was a brilliant way to incorporate commentary on social media, relationships, self-perception, and even spirituality in the modern age. Morgan just gets the world. She gets it. So deeply. Ugh her mind!!! Okay, perhaps I’m exaggerating, but I ADORE the particular plot points and symbols she worked into the horror story to make grander speculations about the world as a whole.

The table that must not be named. Okay fine, I’ll name it, if you insist. It’s the BookTok table! Filled with a vast selection from young adult books to hardcore smut that makes you wonder, “what audience is this supposed to be geared to?”, this table houses some of internet’s favorite picks of modern literature. It was this at very location that I grabbed hold of The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood. Now, I had heard tell of this tale, but all I knew was that it originated as fanfiction between Kylo Ren and Rey Skywalker set in an alternate universe. Where in the vast multiverse did author Hazelwood set our beloved couple? Stanford graduate school. Where Adam Driver – sorry! -- Adam Carlsen is a professor at age 34, and Olive Smith is a graduate student of 26 working on cancer research. I know what your little minds are thinking, that’s a bit of an age gap. Most everybody else on campus thought that too when Olive kissed Dr. Carlsen out of the blue, not knowing that it was Dr. Carlsen. She just grabbed the closest person and kissed them because her friend was walking by, and she told her friend that she was out on a date at that time. And instead of chalking the whole situation up to a little mistake, enter our plot: Fake Dating. Both party members have something to gain out of pretending that they’re in a relationship together. I won’t go into detail, but Olive’s reason was so weak. So weak. Just admit that you want a chunk of that ass. Anyway, the pair are put into all of these awkward moments where public displays of affection are a necessity, and over time, they fall in love. <333. Surprise surprise. Overlooking all of the quote unquote “meta” jokes about the book not selling if it were an actual romantic comedy, and one too many references to Star Wars including Dr. Carlsen’s scar, I have my own qualms with the book. The first may be a little bit personal, but I’ve never liked the whole “oh my parent died of cancer, so now I wanna find the cure to cancer” because I don’t want to do that. You know, maybe I should rethink why I’m on the pre-med track, but I don’t wanna do that. I don’t understand why Olive had to take a moment for herself every time her mom was brought up. Your mom died 10 years ago, you’re fine. You can bring her up in conversation without having to cry, you’re fine. But once again, personal thing! That’s a personal thing! What’s not personal is how ass the writing is dude. That shit is objectively bad. I will admit that the little hypotheses at the start of every chapter were cute, that was cute. But I had to laugh out loud when Hazelwood wrote with her own keyboard that Adam could fit Olive’s entire breast into his mouth. I think that could have been omitted. But even with that, I do think that we could have got more smut. A chapter and half is not nearly enough for me. Could have done with a lot more. We could have replaced that boring and unnecessary epilogue with another sex scene. I also did not care for any of her friends, they were all so annoying and just caricatures of people. I did spend the entirety of the book giggling because it was cute. By the power of horniness, I read it in a day. I could probably shit on this book more, but that doesn’t change the fact that I really enjoyed it. Something about it was just so entertaining, and now I feel like reading more romances. It is a Title IX case though. ...more",Notes are private!,0,248,1,"Dec 27, 2021","Dec 29, 2021","Dec 27, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56732449-the-love-hypothesis
