Allegedly a history of San Francisco in the wild, fractious 1970s, it comprehensively tells the city’s story from Hippie Haight Ashbury in the mid-60s to the peak of the AIDS crisis in the Castro in 1984.Talbot is a master of “show, don’t tell.” Each chapter is 4-6 pages of tightly packed cinematic scenes about some of San Francisco’s most colorful characters.Throughout these stories, we detect some of the common themes:- The tension between the Irish Catholic SFPD and the increasingly immigrant, queer, and hippie population.- The isolation, oppression and distrust of SF’s Black community.- The importance of the “adults in the room” who get shit done like Bill Graham and Dianne Feinstein. - The city’s tightly knit machine of political mentorship (to this day!)I wish that there were a book with this quality of storytelling for every decade and every city I’ve lived in. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 06, 2022","Jan 22, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12352452-season-of-the-witch

I was hesitant at first to read another book about habits. I had already read Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business and didn't think there was much that anyone could add.Then my wife started reading it and I noticed that she was highlighting more passages than she wasn't. I recalled that I had purchased the Audible version when it was on sale and so I decided to give it a listen.I encountered a concise, well-written, and surprisingly deep reflection on the relationship between our habits and our identity. You don't really need to read this book if you just want the high-level tips, which are outlined on Four Minute Books, the author's own website, and plenty of other blogs. On the other hand, having spent five and a half hours of my life with the audio book was a great use of my time. I especially admire that Clear ends the book with a reflection on the downside of habits — something I think about often:The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention. Reflection is the antidote.

For cycling advocates like me who are quick to point out the many benefits of cycling (health, environmental, economic, community), Salvador points out:* Just like drivers, cyclists assume that they own the road — often to the detriment of pedestrians. (For instance, in Paris.)* Cyclists often exhibit a moral superiority, in part from their self-reliance and physical condition, that is intimidating to most and exclusionary for the disabled community.* Cycling is an individualistic way to become an activist without truly addressing collective problems like inequality, housing, and climate change.With this book, Salvador wants to shift the focus of urban planners away from ""how many bike lanes?"" and toward ""how can we make cities accessible and livable for everyone?"" For instance, he criticizes upper-class cycling advocates who complain about working-class street vendors who block cycling lanes without considering the larger economic and regulatory policies of a city. He's particularly enamored with Henri Lefebvre's The Right to the City and David Harvey's concept of Rebel Cities with the hope to ""reclaim the city for anti-capitalist struggle.""I appreciate Salvador's argument that buying a bike and advocating for cycling lanes will not bring about a socialist utopia where everyone has access to quality housing, education, and healthcare. And while I don't think anyone is making that argument, I agree that many cyclists (myself included) emphasize the virtues of our chosen mode of individual transportation without engaging in the difficult, collective politics necessary to make cities enjoyable for all residents. This book is a quick read and a useful complement to celebrations of cycling like Jody Rosen's Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle. And while it's worthwhile to question the overall value of cycling advocacy, I'm more focused on the harms of car-centric urban planning. I worry that if you take Salvador's argument too far, you could support tax policies that subsidize car purchases when there are no equivalent subsidies for e-bikes despite the immense harm of cars to the environment, our health, and racial justice....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 13, 2023","Jan 14, 2023","Jan 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/75094470-el-socialismo-no-llegar-en-bicicleta

And another found ""all of the characters entirely unlikable and hard to empathize with, very few with any positive animating traits, mostly just self-absorbed, narcissistic, occasionally cruel and capricious.""I don't disagree, and so I'm wondering why I enjoyed the novel so much and struggled to put it down well past midnight, even when I needed to wake up early the next morning. I supposed I'm a sucker for good wit and smarts, even when it comes from characters who are ""mostly just self-absorbed, narcissistic, occasionally cruel and capricious."" Perhaps I ought to reconsider.I'm also a sucker for a unique voice, a writer who writes unlike other writers. The uniqueness of Karl Ove Knausgaard kept me reading his mega tomes of ""self-absorbed, narcissistic, occasionally cruel and capricious"" auto-fiction; it certainly wasn't the plot!What comes off as self-absorbed to some readers is also an unusual degree of self-awareness, and self-observation. Perhaps only millennial novelists grew up with enough cameras constantly pointing at them to constantly consider their gestures and expressions from others' points of view. Rooney gives us words to express feelings that we all relate to, but rarely voice:We sat there talking and drinking for a long time. I started to get tired and a little drunk. I couldn’t think of anything witty to say and it was hard to arrange my face in a way that would convey my sense of humor. I think I laughed and nodded a lot.Writing about Murakami, Charles Finch observes that: At any moment on our planet there are at most a few dozen novelists working with great power, for a broad audience, with the material of consciousness, which is what the novel is so uniquely good at handling, how it feels to be inside us, what it means, the devastations and beauties it brings.Though she has only published two novels, Rooney seems destined for the list. The plot is a cliche: a younger, self-conscious feminist feels kinda bad but mostly powerful as she's able to seduce an older, married, attractive, and depressive man. This cliche is told on repeat. It was the New York Times Modern Love column just last month. By the end of the novel, we detect some moral and emotional growth in the narrator. Maybe she's not doomed to sabotage her happiness and relationships despite her unresolved, unhappy childhood and class resentments? Maybe there is room to accept others as they are and to love herself fully? Nah. The plot may be cliche, but Rooney doesn't choose the predictable ending.PS: One last note. Much like the narrator of Elif Batman's The Idiot, I struggle to understand how a narrator can show so much self-awareness without having any idea of what she wants to do or who she wants to be. I can't decide if the narrators of the two novels would be best friends forever, or would despise each other. Either way, they share many patterns....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 02, 2023","Jan 12, 2023","Jan 02, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends

So why then do intelligent, insightful women spend so much time thinking and talking about them? Why do they hyper-analyze the meaning behind every word, every gesture as if they were deciphering code?If you have ever wondered why on earth two women would spend 95% of their time together talking about boys instead of talking about themselves (or really, anything else), then Elif Batuman has a narrator to put you at your wits end. To be sure, this is intentional. As Batuman says in a “By The Book” interview by the New York Times Book Review:After #MeToo, I reread “Eugene Onegin” and “Anna Karenina” and, although I could still see everything I had loved about those books as a teen, I also saw a message I hadn’t been attuned to before: something like, “Great literature is about a young woman who ruins her life over a guy who isn’t that smart.” Where had such messages led me?It seems such messages inspired her to write this novel about Selin, a sarcastic Turkish-American freshman studying linguistics at Harvard, and her all-encompassing crush on Ivan, a Hungarian math major (with a girlfriend) who is planning on going to California for graduate school. But before he does, they (sorta) spend a summer together in Hungary.Batuman is an ideas writer, but she doesn’t overdo it. Her descriptions and dialogues are entertaining enough that she can get away with asides like:At first I was excited about Against Nature, because Gary said it was about a man who decided to live according to aesthetic rather than moral principles, and that was something Svetlana had recently said about me: that I lived by aesthetic principles, whereas she, who had been raised on Western philosophy, was doomed to live boringly by ethical principles. It had never occurred to me to think of aesthetics and ethics as opposites. I thought ethics were aesthetic.Or this:I found myself remembering the day in kindergarten when the teachers showed us Dumbo, and I realized for the first time that all the kids in the class, even the bullies, rooted for Dumbo, against Dumbo’s tormentors. Invariably they laughed and cheered, both when Dumbo succeeded and when bad things happened to his enemies. But they’re you, I thought to myself. How did they not know? They didn’t know. It was astounding, an astounding truth. Everyone thought they were Dumbo.We’re never really sure if Selin is in love with Ivan, or just his emails. When she arrives to Harvard in the mid-90s, she had never before used email. But as Lara Feigel writes in her , “she quickly discovers that she can create an email relationship more real than those she’s experiencing in the flesh.” Listless and searching for meaning, she visits a campus counselor, who offers good advice she chooses to ignore:This is not a fellow who’s going to be there for you. Not in the short run, and not in the long run. From what you’ve described, it sounds as if he barely exists at all. He’s just a voice from behind a computer. Who knows who or what is behind there—behind the computer? He obviously enjoys hiding. And you, too, are hiding behind the computer. This is perfectly understandable. Human beings, all of us, hate to take risks. We all want to hide. And thanks to this e-mail”—he said it like it was a word I had made up—“ thanks to this e-mail, you can have a completely idealized relationship. You risk nothing. Behind your computer screen, you’re completely safe.There is no real plot or purpose to this novel. It doesn’t resolve. Like Teju Cole’s Open City or Knausgaard’s My Struggle, it’s more like a vibe, an opportunity to see the world through someone else’s neuroses. In an essay for n+1, Batuman talks shit about “crisp” writing. In fact, her willingness to talk shit every few pages is part of what makes her writing so endearing. I picked up The Idiot after reading a fawning  of its sequel, Either/Or. The er admonished the reader that we dare not start with Either/Or without first reading The Idiot. And so I started, and I didn’t want to stop. I need a short break from Selin and Ivan, but I’ll be ready for the sequel soon....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 21, 2022","Aug 21, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32037345-the-idiot

So it was aI love Jody Rosen's irreverent profiles for the New York Times and New Yorker — from Matt Damon to Bob Dylan to Willie Nelson and Beyoncé. So it was a disappointment that this book — which was greeted with rave s (by generous colleagues?) in the NYTimes, New Yorker, and Atlantic — didn't benefit from the same space limitations and editing of his magazine writing. Like much nonfiction, the book would have been twice as good if it were half as long.An upside to this book is that each chapter is largely self-contained, so you can pick the topics that interest you and skip the ones that don't. The downside, is that there isn't a cohesive narrative that pulls the chapters together. Treat this as an anthology of meandering writing about bikes and people who adore bikes. If that's not you, then this book isn't for you.I tend to have a higher threshold for meandering writing assembled around a loose theme than most. Plus, I love bikes and am fascinated by their brief history, so I read on to the end and mostly enjoyed myself. Each chapter has some great gems lurking in the verbosity, including:(view spoiler)[* There is no definitive history of the invention of the bicycle, but it seemed to arrive ""illogically late"" compared to other human inventions. Some people point to the 16th century stained glass of the St. Giles Church as the earliest evidence. Every European country has its own origin myth of the bicycle. As one tour guide tells Rosen, ""people like mysteries. They like mysteries, I think, as much as they like certainties.""* I spend so much time on my own bicycle (and fantasizing about purchasing new ones), so I enjoyed the chapters on bicycle design. For instance, I had no idea that Boyd Dunlop tried a water-filled hose for a bike tire before he opted for a tube with air, inventing the pneumatic bicycle tire that we still use today.* I had never thought about the distinction between European bike style (thin, utilitarian urbanism) compared to 1980s American bike style (thick, motorcycle like handlebars — play things for kids aspiring to upgrade to car culture).* Who knew that during the Alaska gold rush, there were ""bicycle prospectors"" who could cover 100 miles a day through snow compared to a mere 50 miles per day for those using dog sleds?* My favorite chapter was about Bhutan. I love the idea of a king abdicating his throne in order to ride his bike more, even if that's surely a simplification. (Rosen's 2014 article for the NYT about Bhutan's Tour of the Dragon race — bucket list! — is honestly a more enjoyable read than the longer chapter.* I also appreciated the chapters on Rickshaw riders in Bangladesh (trying to earn enough money to have some leftover money after all the calories they must consume to keep going) and the 1976 Bicentennial Ride across America, which I knew nothing about. A ride across the country is another bucket list item for me!* But the most interesting chapter was definitely the last — a history of the bicycle in China. We learn that the bike was a major part of the pro-democracy protests in China at Tiananmen Square. There are horrifying images on Reddit of bodies and bicycles strewn across the square after student protestors were gunned down. The government removed the bodies but left the bicycles as a reminder, writes Rosen. It wasn't the first time that bicycles were associated with Western Democracy. In fact, they were unpopular in China because of their Western association until Mao came to power in 1949 and invested heavily in the ""Flying Pigeon"" bicycle company. (I rode a Flying Pigeon when I studied for a semester in Katmandu. Not comfy, but it got the job done.) You don't need to buy the full book to read the fascinating history of the ""The Rise, Fall, and Restoration of the Kingdom of Bicycles"" — the title of Neil Thomas' fascinating piece for Macro Polo about the past, present and future of bicycles in China.Rosen tries to end the book on a positive note by comparing the decline of cycling in China with the bicycling boom during COVID-19 and the growing popularity of e-bikes. He cites one 2020 survey that found that 1 in 10 Americans rode a bike for the first time in over a year at the start of the pandemic and planned on continuing. Thanks to the infrastructure bill and Buttigieg as Transport Secretary, unprecedented funding is going into bike infrastructure. We're in a moment where cities could use ""once-in-a-generation"" funding to plan for mobility that looks more like Amsterdam than Sao Paulo. (Unfortunately, we're not off to a good start.) It's not just the U.S.; India is experiencing a bike boom too — and the government is all with their ""Cycles 4 Change"" initiative. I wish that Rosen ended on a chapter profiling some of the reasons for optimism that the natural desire for cars doesn't have to displace the bicycle: Bogotá, Mexico City, Kigali, Guadalajara. For that we have ITDP's case studies ... and maybe an idea for a (hopefully shorter) follow-up book.

So I didn't know much about Trevor Noah other than the occasional YouTube clip that made its way across my social media feeds. But what a life! It's difficult to believe all that has happened to this guy in such a short amount of time.I started reading the first third of this book on my Kindle and then switched over to the audiobook, which is how I should have started out. Trevor's performance in the audiobook version is laugh out loud funny, even while I was listening on my bike. After finishing the book, I was burning with curiosity to learn more about the author, so I did my usual internet stalking. I came away even more impressed at how he has remained humble, relatable, and decent in spite of all the success. Just check out these three clips: 1. Trevor describing to his audience a recent trip to South Africa in between recording segments for the Daily Show:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvcmr...2. Trevor interviewing his grandma in her Soweto home, where he spent much of his childhood:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s5iz...3. And a heartwarming applause for Trevor by South Africa's president and parliament:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFnNo...During the Covid-19 pandemic, Trevor Noah continues to record short segments of the Daily Show from his apartment and he's quietly covering the salaries of his furloughed employees out of his own pocket. His foundation has paused their educational activities in South Africa and continues to donate money to Food Forward for food security for poor communities.Despite very different childhoods in very different places, I was surprised by how much I personally related to Noah:- Growing up feeling like we don't belong in any one group, but that we're able to adapt to all groups- Growing up with a strong single mother; being a product of her search for meaning and love- But then being an strong-willed child focused on our own independence and autonomy- Performed poorly in school, too independent and contrarian, picking apart logical inconsistencies in rules and religion- Spending a lot of time alone, in our heads, without needing others to be entertained- The bad habit of getting to know people by asking them questions rather than spending time with themTrevor Noah comes across as so ridiculously wise from such an unusual upbringing that it's difficult to grasp that he's just 36-years-old. But there are still some hints of youthfulness: his penchant for young Armenian models, the fact that the board of his foundation is made up of his tax guy and an Armenian reality TV star. But then, that makes him all the more relatable and human.I look forward to spending more time with Trevor Noah's Daily Show and following his career.

Which is how I feel about many nonfiction books: they would have been better if they were shorter. Pollan knows when to end a book so that you feel sated, not sedated. The book weaves three intertwined narratives: 1) the history of coffee, 2) the science of caffeine, and 3) Pollan's experience giving up caffeine for a period and then, quite hilariously, returning to his vice of choice. Pollan does his usual thing of looking at our relationship with the plant world through the plant's perspective and, indeed, humans have are responsible for the worldwide success of Coffea Arabica as much as the plant has been responsible for culture and capitalism. By the end of the book, it doesn't ring as hyperbole when Pollan suggests that ""caffeine equips us for a world that caffeine helped create."" In other words, the globalized knowledge economy probably would have never come about if we were not sufficiently caffeinated. And it's pretty difficult to thrive in the modern, info-saturated economy without at least a couple cups of coffee.Caffeine has been my vice of choice since I started working at coffeeshops when I was 15. I'll smoke pot occasionally while on a sauntering hike, or drink wine to relax in the evening with a novel; but caffeination is my preferred high. Not to say it's always a great trip. I nodded along with Balzac's description of over-caffeination: A state which produced a kind of animation that looks like anger. One's voice rises, one's gestures suggest unhealthy impatience. One wants everything to proceed with the speed of ideas. One becomes brusque, ill-tempered about nothing. One assumes that everyone else is equally lucid. A man of spirit must therefore avoid going out in public.Indeed, my preferred caffeine trip is solitary. My focus is intense, and I'm able to spot patterns and synthesize ideas like never before. Pollan says his wife calls each morning coffee her ""daily cup of optimism."" I listened to this audio book during a solitary two-hour bike ride, with a stop by Equator Coffee in Mill Valley for my usual double cortado.

Take the 1906 San Francisco earthquake as an example. I already knew that it destroyed 80% of the city and killed around 3,000 people, but I had no idea that up to 500 of those deaths were caused by soldiers shooting unarmed residents during an anti-looting order that put the whole city on curfew, even as buildings and houses were burning down. As Gary Kamiya describes his 2013 book Cool Gray City of Love:Dennis Smith argues in San Francisco Is Burning: The Untold Story of the 1906 Earthquake and Fire that the presence of often undisciplined and trigger-happy troops, combined with Schmitz’s draconian shoot-to-kill order, prevented San Franciscans from fighting the fire themselves—which they could have successfully done. Again and again, residents or neighbors were needlessly driven from their houses or offices by zealous troops and police, and the buildings they had been defending were left to burn or blown up. San Francisco archivist Gladys Hansen estimates that 500 people, many of them innocent, were shot by soldiers—one-sixth the total number of casualties.See, doesn’t that make you feel better about our current situation?[image]Gary Kamiya was born in Oakland in 1953, just two years before my parents were born a mile or two away. But I relate to him as if he’s of my generation, a brother from another mother. He was raised in a half White, half Japanese-American household, dropped out of college, worked in a shipyard, then as a taxi driver while studying literature, and eventually becoming a journalist — first at the Examiner, then as a co-founder of Salon.com, a columnist at the Chronicle, and now the executive editor of San Francisco Magazine. (It’s hard to imagine Kamiya, a cerebral and scholarly lover of literature, overseeing pieces like “Five Looks For Your Little Ones We’re Loving For Summer.”)Cool Gray City of Love, it seems, is the enviable result of making the most out of a double-knee replacement. He dedicated his time recuperating to “doing the knowledge” — reading dozens of books and archival accounts of San Francisco’s relatively brief history. Then, once his knees were back in working order, he starting “doing the work,” hopping on his bike to explore every nook and cranny of the city’s 46 square miles. Inspired by Katsushika Hokusai’s 1820s series of woodblock prints “36 Views of Mount Fuji,” he set out to narrate San Francisco’s history and geography with the subtitle “49 view of San Francisco.”I started reading the first of the 49 chapters during my week one of “sheltering in place.” It turned out to be the perfect companion to get through a pandemic. Each night, I’d read about a new place and its history, and the next day I’d hop on my bike to visit during my lunch break. To make this easier, I created a Google Map List of 60 places mentioned throughout the book with the relevant excerpt saved as a note for each location:[image]The book is a breeze to read and I easily could have finished it in a couple of days. But it was more rewarding to take it one chapter at a time and spread it out across a couple of months. I came to appreciate and enjoy my city even more. At points, I felt embarrassed that there was so much of San Francisco and its history that I didn’t know. I read Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings in high school, but I had no recollection that a major plot point of the book is her family’s move to San Francisco during WWII, as the Western Addition transitioned from mostly Japanese American to mostly African American; Blacks migrated from the south to work in the shipyard while Japanese Americans were taken to internment camps.Somehow I had never once visited Lily Pond in Golden Gate Park or Mountain Lake in the Presidio even though I ride my bike past them both nearly every day. I reread Jack Kerouac’s The Dharma Bums a couple of years ago and was entranced by its description of the Six Gallery reading, where Allen Ginsberg first performed Howl. I had always assumed that the gallery was somewhere in North Beach and had no clue that it was in the Marina neighborhood in what is now an upscale taqueria across the street from my cycling club. I should have read this book when I first arrived to San Francisco, but better late than never. At the end of the book is a helpful bibliography, a long list of diverse readings to continue deepening my relationship with San Francisco. I’ve also been digging into Kamiya’s column in the Chronicle, which includes entertaining descriptions of the city’s past with headlines like “Sex and cycling: How bike craze aroused passions in 1890s San Francisco.” Cool Gray City of Love was a reminder of why I read: it simply makes life a bit more interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 05, 2020","Apr 24, 2020","Mar 05, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18749122-cool-gray-city-of-love

Sacks’ curiosity about everything inspired me to be more observant and curious myself. While the rest of us would merely enjoy the taste of chocolates from different types of cacao, Sacks asks himself: But why, I wonder, should chocolate be so intensely and so universally desired? Why did it spread so rapidly over Europe, once the secret was out? Why is chocolate sold now on every street corner, included in army rations, taken to Antarctica and outer space? Why are there chocoholics in every culture? Is it the unique, special texture, the “mouth-feel” of chocolate, which melts at body temperature? Is it because of the mild stimulants, caffeine and theobromine, it contains? The cola nut and the guarana have more. Is it the phenylethylamine, mildly analeptic, euphoriant, supposedly aphrodisiac, which chocolate contains? Cheese and salami contain more of this. Is it because chocolate, with its anandamide, stimulates the brain’s cannabinoid receptors? Or is it perhaps something quite other, something as yet unknown, which could provide vital clues to new aspects of brain chemistry, to say nothing of the esthetics of taste?I read the slim book in just a few days and learned much about Oaxaca’s contributions to civilization. I didn’t see anyone smoking cigarettes in Oaxaca, certainly not compared to Europeans, but I learned that “cigar” comes from the Mayan “sik’ar.”Sacks visited Oaxaca for ten days in 2000, the same year that Vicente Fox was elected president, bringing more than 70 years of single-party rule to an end. But there is no mention of politics in the book. In fact, the book still reads as if it were written today rather than 20 years ago. In the last passage, he reflects on what he learned during the 10-day trip: I had imagined, ignorantly, that civilization started in the Middle East. But I have learned that the New World, equally, was a cradle of civilization. The power and grandeur of what I have seen has shocked me, and altered my view of what it means to be human. Monte Albán, above all, has overturned a lifetime of presuppositions, shown me possibilities I never dreamed of. I will read Bernal Díaz and Prescott’s 1843 Conquest of Mexico again, but with a different perspective, now that I have seen some of it myself. I will brood on the experience, I will read more, and I will surely come again.To my knowledge, Sacks never did return. He passed away in 2015, the same year he first identified publicly as gay, though there are strange hints scattered throughout the book. It seems Sacks often lived a lonely, celibate life, and so it’s nice to read passages idiosyncratically describing the sudden onset of joy. I myself may be the only single person here, but I have been single, a singleton, all my life. Yet here this does not matter in the least, either. I have a strong feeling of being one of the group, of belonging, of communal affection—a feeling that is extremely rare in my life, and may be in part a cause of a strange “symptom” I have had, an odd feeling in the last day or so, which I was hard put to diagnose, and first ascribed to the altitude. It was, I suddenly realized, a feeling of joy, a feeling so unusual I was slow to recognize it. There are many causes for this joyousness, I suspect—the plants, the ruins, the people of Oaxaca—but the sense of this sweet community, belonging, is surely a part of it.And later: This has been a lovely trip. I have not enjoyed one so much for many years, nor can I analyze, at the moment, quite what is so … so right.I first visited Oaxaca in 2004 and this year marked my third visit exact 16 years later. It is likely that next year we’ll return. On all three visits, I’ve shared Sacks impression.

I’m instinctively suspicious of eager advice-givers, even if I sometimes find myself offering advice and occasionally of the worst kind: unsolicited. What makes these people so confident that their recommendations are better informed than my own? Often guarded and unwilling to share their own failures and vulnerabilities, on what experiences do they base their counsel?But Sugar, the online advice columnist who remained pseudonymous until this book was published under the real name of a bestselling author, is different. Sugar is all vulnerability. Sugar shares her heartbreaks and fuck-ups so that we trust her advice about our own. It’s not that I haven’t had experiences of mentorship throughout my career, but it has mostly been by accomplished people from wealthy families who went to fancy schools. If their advice for me was based on hardship and mistakes, they haven’t let down their guard long enough to share their pain or regret, or even the lessons they learned.I also struggle to embrace advice proffered with little self-doubt or uncertainty, so I was grateful when halfway through the book Strayed confesses, “I couldn’t help but wonder who the hell I thought I was in daring to address your question. I wonder that often while writing this column ...”The book contains around 50 of Sugar’s responses to a wide range of issues, though a few principles rear their head over and over again:• Trust yourself. Trusting yourself means living out what you already know to be true. • Anger, fear, self-doubt, sadness, jealousy, hatred, anxiety — the whole slew of negative emotions from which none of us are exempt — are part of the human experience, we must accept them; a therapist can help us do so by exploring how they are weaved into the stories we tell ourselves about our Self.• We can’t change others. We can’t make them love us. But we can and we should set boundaries. We don’t have to spend time with people who don’t make us feel good. We inherit no obligation to please or placate anyone. We can be true to ourselves by choosing with whom and where and when we spend our time and energy.• We accumulate wisdom and maturity through acts of forgiveness.Did I know those things before I read this book? I probably did. But there’s a world of difference between knowing principles to be true and applying those principles with an open mind and an open heart when shit gets difficult. This book is a collection of case studies about how to have an open mind and an open heart when shit gets difficult.Real change happens on the level of a gesture. It's one person doing one thing differently than he or she did before. It's the man who opts not to invite his abusive mother to his wedding; the woman who decides to spend her Saturday mornings in a drawing class instead of scrubbing the toilets at home; the writer who won't allow himself to be devoured by his envy; the parent who takes a deep breath instead of throwing a plate. It's you and me standing naked before our lovers, even if it makes us feel kind of squirmy in a bad way when we do. The work is there. It's our task. Doing it will give us strength and clarity.

According to my Kindle, it takes the typical reader more than 25 hours to get through it.What is book six? How does the most celebrated and scandalous work of 21st century literature end? More than 400 pages are dedicated to Hitler’s life, including critiques of his previous biographers. It is also an intellectual history of Europe in the 1930s and the social and economic forces that enabled the rise of Nazism. 100 pages are dedicated to Paul Celan’s relatively brief poem The Straightening. (Ruth Franklin describes this section as “essentially live-blogging his line-by-line effort to make sense” of Celan’s poem.) It is an unflinching, brutally frank depiction of his wife’s struggles with bipolar depression and mania. Finally, the book is a tally of the damage done, the pain he caused others and himself, by having shared his most shameful thoughts in public, his “transgressive blurring of the borders between the public and private, sayable and unsayable.” As Evan Hughes puts it, “reading My Struggle is like opening someone else’s diary and finding your own secrets.”My Struggle is an awe-inspiring effort, which Knausgaard claims that in the end he didn’t fully achieve, to break free from the self-censorship imposed by the social world, to attain total liberation from inhibition. ***I find visits to bookstores and libraries almost unbearably daunting, an in-my-face representation of all the information I won’t have the time to read, the knowledge I’ll never attain. As a writer staring enviously at shelves upon shelves of published books, I confront the inevitable truth that every story has already been told. There may be a different setting with new characters, but the basic plot and principles and ideas have already been retold millions of times through the same archetypical story structures.Until Knausgård. Somehow it occurred to a sensitive man from Norway struggling with writer’s block to attempt something that has never been tried before: he would be unsparingly honest about his most treacherous thoughts while describing the banalities of modern life with microscopic detail. The thoughts we all have but would never share with anyone else, except for perhaps a therapist.A therapist. Writing is clearly a therapeutic act for Knausgård. As he tells Ryu Spaeth in an interview, “there must be a place where you can be, where you can write, where you can think, without a façade at all.” For most people, that place is a therapist’s office. But toward the end of Book Six, as he describes his wife’s worsening mental health (which he fears he caused by sharing so much of her life publicly), he writes:She wanted me to help her go back into therapy. Most of all she wanted us to go together. She had wanted that for many years. She knew I would rather die than go to couples therapy, and actually I meant it. If there were a choice between couples therapy and death, I would unhesitatingly choose death.He repeats the same line in an interview with Ali Tufan Koc: “I’d rather shoot myself than go to therapy.""How is this possible? How can a writer who demonstrates such self-awareness through his writing be so fearful of therapy? How can he expose himself to relentless criticism by journalists and critics, but not speak with a therapist trained to listen without judgement? If he is racked with guilt for what he has done to his wife, can he not at least give her this?Writing is the way Knausgaard expresses the emotions that he’s not courageous or mature enough to tell his loved ones in person. Instead, his family, his wife, his friends, (and presumably his children) all discover his resentments and regrets when they are given manuscripts to . He joins a long lineage of mostly male writers who demonstrate startling self-awareness in their prose and yet a total lack of emotional intelligence in the social world: Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, Charles Bukowski, Bob Dylan, Isaac Brock, JD Salinger, Ryan Adams, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac.How were these writers able to endow their characters with such sentimentality while totally cutting themselves off from the emotional lives of their loved ones in real life? Or is it the inverse? Perhaps their inability to express emotions in person allows the writer’s inner torment to distill through the pen into compelling prose. Perhaps the well-adjusted person, who shares his vulnerabilities honestly in the social world, lacks the burning impulse to produce great writing.***Book Six was too long, too intense, too interesting for me to read in one go. I took several breaks to read other brooks, including Lori Gottlieb’s Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, in which she recounts her relationships as a therapist to her clients, and as a client to her own therapist. I read the book because I was just beginning therapy for the first time and I wanted to know what I was getting myself into. Like Knausgaard, I had been resistant to therapy. Like Knausgaard, I preferred facing my fears and insecurities through my writing.As I read Gottlieb’s descriptions of her patients, I began to wonder what she would write about Knausgaard if he were her patient. What would she think about his tendency to consider literary theory or philosophy while his wife was yelling at him? How would she connect it to his descriptions in Book One of escaping to his room as a young boy to read comic books when his angry, alcoholic father lashed out at him? How would she try to help him remain present and grounded when confronted by anger? ***On the last day of our beach vacation, my wife and I had the type of unremarkable social interaction that happens nearly everyday between couples, the type that Knausgaard describes poignantly. But this time, for reasons I couldn’t understand, I was hurt and offended. I didn’t say anything in the moment, for the intensity of my emotions was totally disproportionate to what had happened. I spent much of the afternoon sulking like a fool and the next day I spent by myself.Once I was able to write, everything came pouring out with surprising eloquence. I was triggered, of course. The words staring back at me revealed the obvious connection between what happened and how I was treated by my mother growing up. I saw how the minor interaction was a symbol of something larger, a departure from my idealized notion of a caring relationship. Now I knew what I needed to communicate to my wife; not so much what she did, but how it made me feel — and why.We met that evening for dinner. I ordered a mezcal and she had a cocktail. She knew I felt unsettled and she was waiting for me to explain why. But I couldn’t find the words. Just hours earlier I had written with poetic eloquence what I wanted to express. I had metaphors, stories from my childhood, raw vulnerability. And now, even after my mezcal, all I could muster up was, “How was your day?”How was this possible? Did I lack the ability to communicate, or did I lack the courage to express myself? The next day we were laying in bed and I managed to tell my wife, the person in this world who cares the most about me, that I was hurt. She acknowledged my feelings, she expressed her remorse, and we agreed that we could both do more to communicate better in the future.It was a liberating conversation. I wasn’t trapped by the trauma of my past; I could break through and become a different person. But why was it so immensely difficult?***Karl Ove Knausgaard and I share similar childhoods and dispositions. We share the same taste in music, literature, and film. Deep down we are both committed progressives, and yet we rebel against the social pressure of political correctness. When we were young men, we wanted more than all else to become great writers, to develop an authentic voice, and to push the boundaries of literature. Knausgaard did this by turning his attention inward to the self, where he encountered a subject that had never been fully, honestly treated despite the thousands of memoirs and autobiographies. My curiosity drew my attention outward to the larger world, where I spent my 20s trying to make sense of the cultures, people, and places I encountered. We were both seeking a form of liberation. I sought to transcend the boundaries of my own culture by embedding myself as much as possible in other cultures. In his own words, Knausgaard, “tried to transcend the social world by conveying the innermost thoughts and innermost feelings of my most private self, my own internal life, but also by describing the private sphere of my family as it exists behind the façade all families set up against the social world.”In the end, Knausgaard became the great writer. I became a program officer working behind a desk at a private foundation. Six months shy of 40 without having published any work of significance, I ask myself, would I rather be a great writer or a good person? Would I rather be creative or kind? And is it possible to be both? These are the questions for the next 40 years of my life.There is a tension in life, one that I feel every day, between being present in the moment, attentive and kind to our loved ones, and producing great art. By focusing all of his attention on his writing, Knausgaard gave his readers an inspired work of art. By ignoring his wife, violating her privacy, and sleepwalking through his social life, he lost his family and has surprisingly few friends.“What reality does, and brutally so, is to correct,” writes Knausgaard in the section on Hitler. “And a prominent trait of the young Hitler’s character is precisely an unwillingness to accept correction.” From recent interviews, it seems that Knausgaard is accepting correction. Divorced and living in London with a new partner, he no longer yearns for liberation from the social world. Perhaps he even sees value in liberation from the trauma of his childhood.He certainly sees value in being more present. In an interview with Joshua Rothman, he acknowledges his unhealthy tendency to be pulled “away from home and into art.""It’s much better now—I think I’ve managed to fasten my gaze somehow—but I’ve struggled with that throughout my life. Because nothing is as defined in life as it is in literature or in art. If everyone fastened his gaze on life, there would be no art.It’s true. A world of mindful meditating monks would be a world without culture and art, not the kind of world I want to live in. Like Knausgaard, I will continue to seek insight and beauty through writing. But all in moderation. I will also fasten my gaze on life, and on the people I love....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 14, 2019","Jan 30, 2020","Apr 14, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41184151-my-struggle

I equated it with foodies, which I equated with bourgeois snobbery. But I was reluctant to read Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dillema back in 2009. I equated it with foodies, which I equated with bourgeois snobbery. But after enough recommendations from dear friends whose opinions I value, I gave in and ended up writing a fawning, long-winded  from Buenos Aires, which included the line “few other books have given me so much reason to re-think my own beliefs, outlooks, and behaviors.”It’s true. To this day, The Omnivore’s Dillema has changed both what I eat and how I eat, and how I think about the inextricably linked co-evolution of humans and the species we depend on for nourishment. I then read The Botony of Desire and In Defense of Food and ... I’ll just say that am I glad that Pollan decided to write about something other than food.Of course, Pollan’s books were never just about food, which is what makes them so compelling. Peering through the kitchen window, he weaves together stories along the seams of history, biology, and pop culture. It all seems rather effortless and smooth to the reader, but surely requires years of research followed by aggressive editing and deletion.I’m such a fan of Pollan’s writing, in fact, that I’ve read a good deal about his approach. Unlike most writers of non-fiction, who aim to impress upon the readers the weight of their credentials, depth of experience, and strength of argument, Pollan introduces himself as a flawed but curious know-nothing, who is eager to take a journey with the reader to learn something new. There is no convincing, no condescension, just an invitation to explore and learn something new. In fact, well into his 60’s, Pollan admits to his readers that he had never tried psychedelics prior to this project, that he’s “less a child of the psychedelic 1960s than of the moral panic that psychedelics provoked.” I find it more satisfying to learn about something through the eyes of an intensely curious novice, I realized, than an expert with hardened views.How to Change Your Mind is as much about mindfulness and changing the mental habits that become so ingrained in adulthood as it is about psychedelics. In the prologue, as if he had just returned from a week-long meditation retreat, Pollan writes:Habits are undeniably useful tools, relieving us of the need to run a complex mental operation every time we’re confronted with a new task or situation. Yet, they also relieve us of the need to stay awake to the world: to attend, feel, think, and then act in a deliberate manner. (That is, from freedom rather than compulsion.) The efficiencies of the adult mind, useful as they are, blind us to the present moment. We’re constantly jumping ahead to the next thing. We approach experience much as an artificial intelligence program does, with our brains continually translating the data of the present into the terms of the past, reaching back in time for the relevant experience, and then using that to make its best guess as to how to predict and navigate the future.This is not a novel observation. Back in the 70s, even while psychedelics provoked moral panic, corporate California was already reading about Zen Buddhism, popularized largely by Shunryu Suzuki’s book Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind.Pollan approaches the topic from a novel perspective -- through the medical and recreational use of psychedelics to show us the path to beginner’s mind through intense experiences that dissolve the obsessive, analyzing ego and leave us with nothing but observation and appreciation for what is around us. “Less doing, more being,” as he describes it.Psychedelics seem to be especially helpful for a certain type of person: ruminative, introspective, analytical — someone like me. “The achievement of an individual self,” Pollan writes, “a being with a unique past and a trajectory into the future, is one of the glories of human evolution, but it is not without its drawbacks and potential disorders.” The price of a sense of self with the ability to shape an individual identity is also a sense of separation from others and nature. Self-reflection can lead to great intellectual and artistic achievement but also to destructive forms of self-regard and unhappiness.Those of us who spend a great deal of time in our heads — analyzing, reflecting, problem-solving, imagining forms of creative expression — can easily become blind to the beauty that surrounds us. Not just the natural beauty of a sunset, but the significance of our friends, a potential conversation with a neighbor, the taste of a delicious meal. We need to get outside of our analytical heads, tune into our senses, and just observe without judgement. As the novelist Andrew Martin put it:I’m all for interrogating the shit out of everything. But I’d like to be able to experience art in an open, unmediated way, to be really moved by something even if it’s out of fashion or challenging to some of my own values.You can substitute the word ""art"" with just about any other noun. Psychedelics are one powerful way to get us out of our own heads. They offer an intense, often transformative, experience that reveals what life could be like if we were to turn off our obsessive, analytical minds, extinguish our insecurities and aspirations, and simply be. Also, unlike coffee, cigarettes and alcohol, there is no evidence that psychedelics are addictive. But the effect does seem to eventually wear off and we return to our usual mental habits driven by deep seated insecurities and anxieties that we barely register or understand.Still, although not a one-time cure-all, the psychedelic experience provides us with a North Star that we can return to when we’re at our most anxious and depressed. Why am I obsessing over these recurring thoughts rather than enjoying all the amazing experiences all around me? What would this same, boring, uncomfortable group dinner be like if I were on magic mushrooms? How much can we change about our lives simply by changing perspective? Quite a bit, psychedelics tell us.One of the great benefits of reaching the stage of life where I currently find myself — let’s call it close to 40 — is that I have developed useful template responses for most situations. I can kinda coast comfortably on auto-pilot. As Pollan puts it:Certainly by middle age, the sway of habitual thinking over the operations of the mind is nearly absolute. By now, I can count on past experience to propose quick and usually serviceable answers to just about any question reality poses, whether it’s about how to soothe a child or mollify a spouse, repair a sentence, accept a compliment, answer the next question, or make sense of whatever’s happening in the world. With experience and time, it gets easier to cut to the chase and leap to conclusions—clichés that imply a kind of agility but that in fact may signify precisely the opposite: a petrifaction of thought.I think that’s why I sense more of an interest in psychedelics these days from folks in their 40s than young people in their 20s. I appreciate my learned ability to easily deal with many situations today that would have caused me anxiety and akwardness in my 20s. But I’m also wary of becoming an adult automaton based on prior experiences and assumptions that likely need to be revisited. In short, I don’t want to be set in my ways.A day after finishing the book, I was walking through San Francisco with my wife when we passed a young homeless man muttering to himself, not an uncommon occurrence in this city. Like so many others, I feel helpless and horrible when simply walking by a fellow resident so obviously in need of help. Homelessness is the most visible symptom of the American mental health crisis, but the increase in suicide is more telling. ""There are almost forty-three thousand suicides every year in America (more than the number of deaths from either breast cancer or auto accidents),"" Pollan writes, ""yet only about half of the people who take their lives have ever received mental health treatment."" I still hear a longstanding assumption that the mental health problems of most homeless San Franciscans are caused by alcohol and drug abuse. But after reading How to Change Your Mind, it struck me that the causality is likely the other way around. What if these individuals have especially analytical, ruminative minds? What if drugs and alcohol are the only reprieve to turn off the otherwise insistent inner-monologue?My only disappointment with the book is that Pollan didn’t attempt a 10-day silent meditation retreat as a comparison with his experimentation with mushrooms, acid, and DMT. Toward the end of the book he says he tries to keep up a daily meditation practice of 15 or 30 minutes, but in my experience such a daily practice is closer to taking a nap than the dissolution of the ego of the self that comes with the rigor of more than a week of constant meditation.The East Coast media — especially the New York Times — still like to poke fun at meditation and psychedelics, which they group with worst kinds of gemstone West Coast quackery. Ironically, it’s the kind of highly analytical and critical folks who work at East Coast media institutions that are most in need of a psychedelic experience. Michael Pollan is the rare individual — a credentialed professor who writes for the New Yorker — who can write earnestly for both coasts. No wonder How to Change Your Mind has been on the New York Times’ bestseller list for weeks now.

I read this while in India for work earlier this year. I first traveled to India in 1999 and then again in 2001, '06, '09, and '14. With the exception of the United States, Mexico and perhaps Kenya, it is the country whose (extremely rapid) development I’ve followed most closely and first-hand. Unlike the other three countries, I have spent weeks at at a time in India’s rural, remote villages, where daily routines and rituals have changed little in the past thousands of years — that is, until the recent arrival of cell phones and cheap solar panel chargers from China. From Delhi’s flourishing hipster enclaves to Rajasthan’s tribal communities, today’s India is unrecognizable from the India I first experienced nearly twenty years ago. While I was in India, my friends at Pratham released their Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). For the first time, Pratham focused their annual household survey on youth between 14 and 18 to answer a question of urgent importance to parents and policy-makers: how prepared are today’s youth to join tomorrow’s workforce? They produced a wonderful five-minute ‘trailer’ on YouTube to show the importance of skills and basic knowledge for young people to pursue their dreams. They also released a slightly less slick 11-minute video to summarize the findings. There is also four-page analysis of major findings and a brochure that includes actual questions from the test that was given to over 30,000 teenagers by 2,000 volunteers in 26 districts around the country. Given the skills needed for 21st century jobs, the findings aren’t encouraging. Less than 35% of youth aged 14-18 were able to correctly answer this question: If a girl went to sleep at 9:30 pm and woke up at 6:30 am, how many hours did she sleep?Like George Packer’s The Unwinding, Poonam’s “Dreamers: How young Indians are changing their world” alternates between profiles of Indian youth hustling their way to some sort of career and analysis of the structural challenges and opportunities they face. A few highlights that have stuck with me:* To compete globally and cash in on its “demographic dividend,"" India will need to educate about 100 million young people over the next ten years, a task never before undertaken in history. At least 1000 universities will need to be built and nearly 50,000 colleges.* In 2016, 19,000 people applied for 114 jobs at a municipality. 1.7M applied for 1,500 jobs at a state-owned bank. 9.2M applied for 100k jobs with the railways and 7M applied for 8,300 entry level jobs in the public sector.* Use of social media by young Indians is redefining their aspirations: “A 20-year-old in central India has the same access to information as someone his age in Iowa — and could very well have the same desires. They see no connection between where they live and what they want from their lives.” The gulf between opportunity and aspiration is growing.* Globalization has helped create a lot of new winners in India. They live in cities, speak in English, spend their holidays in Europe and visit family in the U.S. There have also been many losers, especially among young, rural, Hindu men who see their historically elevated status threatened by decades of government support for minorities, the feminist movement, and globalization. Sound familiar? For them, Modi’s brand of Hindu Nationalism doesn’t go far enough and some say that India’s liberal democracy depends on finding jobs for these angry young men to keep them busy. Poonam's account of Richa Singh’s campaign for the post of president of the students’ union of Allahabad University in 2015 literally brought tears to my eyes.

For science fiction fans, it was each release of the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 70s and early 80s. For teenagers around the world, it was the release of each of the seven Harry Potter novels in the early 2000s. But I had never gotten sucked into a serialized, international pop culture phenomenon until Karl Ove Knausgård — and, so far, Book 4 is my favorite of his six autobiographical novels.""All the books I liked were basically about the same topic,” he writes in the first, foreshadowy pages of Book 4. ""Books about young men who struggled to fit into society, who wanted more from life than routines, more from life than a family, basically, young men who hated middle-class values and sought freedom. They traveled, they got drunk, they read, and they dreamed about their life’s great passion or writing the great novel. Everything they wanted I wanted, too.""Me too. All of Knausgård's books have been a form of therapy for me, but especially this one.I hated all authority, was an opponent of the whole limited society I had grown up in, with its bourgeois values and materialistic view of humanity. I despised what I had learned at [high school], even about literature; all I needed to know, all true knowledge, the only really essential knowledge, was to be found in the books I read and the music I listened to. I wasn’t interested in money or status symbols; I knew that the essential value in life lay elsewhere. I didn’t want to study, had no wish to receive an education at a conventional institution like a university, I wanted to travel down through Europe, sleep on beaches, in cheap hotels, or with friends I made on the way. Take odd jobs to survive, wash dishes at hotels, load or unload boats, pick oranges …That quote is the essence of just about every entry in my journal from 16 to 25 years old. I was filled with odious resentment of all figures of authority in my youth: my parents, teachers, policeman, my managers — anyone who held any power over me, I was adamant to challenge them. Literature became my escape and solace. Kerouac, Bukowski, Gary Snyder, Kingsolver, Salinger, Jack London. All these stories of people flipping the bird to polite society, setting off, and creating their own adventures. I wanted to be a working-class, wandering novelist. It seemed to me, in fact, the only dignified way to live a life.Despite my knee-jerk anti-authoritarianism wielding such strong influence over my behavior, I hadn't given much thought to why I, in particular, belonged to this archetypical tribe of rebels, so common in literature and movies and so seemingly absent from real life.Knausgård invites us to play the part of armchair psychoanalyst by alternating passages (there are no chapters) between his difficult upbringing and the embarrassments we all experience as we transition from youth to adulthood, from dependence to independence, from fantasizing to hustling. I saw so many similarities between Knausgård’s upbringing and my own — and the way it seemed to shape both his anti-authority ire and his disciplined ambition — that I was inspired to dig into the psychological literature on anti-authoritarianism. It was a gift to find the writings of Bruce E. Levine, who notes that anyone who spends two decades of his life in search of costly credentials (like most psychologists) are especially likely to be rule followers and overprescribe medication for so-called “opposition defiant disorder.” So many of the people we celebrate today — from Saul Alinsky to Albert Einstein — suffered from opposition defiant disorder. That is, they eagerly questioned the status quo put into place by those with (often illegitimate) power. Norms are slowly changing, however, as non-conformists are celebrated by authors like Disobedience Award....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 02, 2018","Aug 05, 2018","May 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25361609-my-struggle

My emerging adult identity was stirred by the raw urgency of his writing and the audacity of a twenty-something eager to process his inner angst and distribute the results through bookstores and libraries around the world. Since 2001, I have read each and every of his ten major works. His first three books — A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, You Shall Know Our Velocity, and How We Are Hungry — are intimately personal, first person, and mostly apolitical. They use Hemingwayesque simple, short sentences to describe the world as it is. Unlike Hemingway, the earlier incarnation of Eggers was willing to share the anxious monologues of his own insecure mind in a refreshingly honest way that pokes fun at the phoniness surrounding us. Something changed in 2005 when Eggers was turned 35. He became an advocate for public school teachers in the US and co-authored his first work of non-fiction, Teachers Have it Easy. The next year he published What is the What about Sudanese refugee Valentino Achok Deng, which established a formula of long-form novelistic profiles of unlikely heroes — including Zeitoun set in New Orleans and his latest book, The Monk of Mokha set between Yemen and San Francisco. There is a third category of Eggers’ books, which taken together espouse a political worldview. They include the 2012 A Hologram for the King, a sympathetic portrayal of a 50-something white American male middle manager who has lost all dignity in a globalized, technological 21st century. The next year, Eggers published The Circle, a techno-dystopian critique of how we are losing our authenticity and mental autonomy in the anxious social media-driven search for self-worth. The very next year, 2014, Eggers released his least known and most political work, Your Fathers, Where Are They? And Prophets, Do They Live Forever? It is, admittedly, a boring book made up entirely of unbalanced dialogues between Thomas, an emotionally off-kilter 30-year-old struggling to find his place in the world, and an assorted cast of characters he has drugged, kidnapped, and taken to an abandoned military base on the California coast. Thomas is, as one er puts it, “disillusioned with America and ill-equipped to deal with freedom.”That’s a pretty succinct summary of the worldview and ideology that emerges from Eggers’ political novels. As he travels around the country, Eggers must see a country with total freedom, but lacking in direction and meaning. How do we create meaning for ourselves in a world that presents us with few challenges and offers us few opportunities? There are no meaningful wars to fight. No place to explore. No industry to build. No religion to follow. No new ideas to develop. Ours is the era of total freedom and many of us haven’t found a better way to use that freedom than the distractions of social media. (Then again, the same was said of the lackadaisical suburbanite watching sitcoms in the 80s and 90s.)All of the above is preamble to share my views on Eggers’ latest novel, The Monk of Mokha, which has been roundly criticized by ers for the predictable charge that Eggers, a PWM (“privileged white male”), has appropriated the story and compelling character of a young Yemeni entrepreneur. It’s worth pausing for a paragraph on the role of race in Eggers’ novels. In broad strokes, Eggers either writes about directionless, anxious White people in search of meaning (Alan from Hologram for the King, Josie in Heroes of the Frontier, Mae in The Circle, Thomas in Your Fathers ...) or brown people who heroically overcome adversity to create great projects while helping others (Valentino from What is the What, Abdulrahman from Zeitoun, and Mokhtar from The Monk of Mokha). Eggers uses his white protagonists to pessmistically pick apart the decline of the American Dream. And he uses his protagonists of color to optimistically explore the continued possibility of the American Dream.The Monk from Mokha is very much about the continued possibility of the American Dream told through the story of a young Arab man from San Francisco’s poorest neighborhood, the Tenderloin. Eggers writes as much in the prologue:But his story is an old-fashioned one. It’s chiefly about the American Dream, which is very much alive and very much under threat. His story is also about coffee, and about how he tried to improve coffee production in Yemen, where coffee cultivation was first undertaken five hundred years ago. It’s also about the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, a valley of desperation in a city of towering wealth, about the families that live there and struggle to live there safely and with dignity. It’s about the strange preponderance of Yemenis in the liquor-store trade of California, and the unexpected history of Yemenis in the Central Valley. And how their work in California echoes their long history of farming in Yemen. And how direct trade can change the lives of farmers, giving them agency and standing. And about how Americans like Mokhtar Alkhanshali—U.S. citizens who maintain strong ties to the countries of their ancestors and who, through entrepreneurial zeal and dogged labor, create indispensable bridges between the developed and developing worlds, between nations that produce and those that consume. And how these bridgemakers exquisitely and bravely embody this nation’s reason for being, a place of radical opportunity and ceaseless welcome. And how when we forget that this is central to all that is best about this country, we forget ourselves—a blended people united not by stasis and cowardice and fear, but by irrational exuberance, by global enterprise on a human scale, by the inherent rightness of pressing forward, always forward, driven by courage unfettered and unyielding.That’s precisely what the story is about. And I loved it. I loved it as an American, a San Franciscan, a lover of coffee, and an intense admirer of anyone willing go to ridiculous lengths to pursue a dream.Dave Eggers has become so preposterously successful as a novelist that he’s an easy target, especially as a PWM who writes about an assortment of people and places. I understand the criticism. And I’m grateful for each of his novels. I’m grateful that his writing has been part of my own coming of age....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 10, 2018","Apr 30, 2018","Apr 30, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35215524-the-monk-of-mokha

Sisonke endorses French as the only American who has written decently about the continent. So I was curious, what makes his approach to writing as an outsider stand out?I didn’t come away with the answer. The book starts out with Howard alongside his younger brother as hippie backpackers in search of the famed Dogon Tribe of Eastern Mali whose astrological beliefs were celebrated by the New Age hippies of the 70s. He soon transitions from the hippie son of an American doctor working for the World Health Organization in Abidjan to the New York Times’ correspondent for West and Central Africa.Throughout the first half of the book nearly all of Africa’s woes are blamed on European colonialism and misinformed American foreign policy. The question that goes unasked in Western news coverage of Africa, and in most of the other ritualized hand-wringing over the continent’s plight, is why should anyone be surprised that violent European hijacking of Africa’s political development resulted in misery and chaos? How could it be that in America, a country where 12 percent of the population traces its ancestry to African slaves, the vast majority of the population remains totally unaware of this derailment, except by a deliberate and long-term burial of the truth?Similarly:In little more than a generation, the Belgian king’s yearning for empire and fortune may have killed ten million people in the territory—half of Congo’s population, or more than the entire death toll in World War I. Even today Japan continues to face international ostracism for its brutal imperial conduct in China, Korea and other parts of Asia in the 1930s, which followed Leopold’s Congo holocaust by a mere two decades. And yet there has never been any remorse in the West over the fallout from Europe’s drive to dominate Africa. Indeed, few have heard these grim facts. In view of the vastly larger scale of Leopold’s atrocities, it is worth asking how he escaped remembrance alongside Hitler and Stalin as great criminals of the twentieth century. If Leopold’s legacy had been millions of deaths alone, the impact of Belgium’s takeover of the Congo would have been horrible enough. But the Belgians also created a tragic example of governance, essentially teaching Zairians that authority confers the power to steal. And the practical corollary to this lesson was that the bigger the title, the bigger the theft.I’m don’t disagree with this point of view. I think it’s crazy that everyone recognizes Hitler, but few have heard of King Leopold. And there is no explanation other than racism that the US intervened so significantly in Yugoslavia but not in Rwanda. What’s missing from French’s writing, even as he criticizes most reporters’ lack of historical context, is any recognition of African societies before European colonialism. I’m reminded of those ethnic studies majors who spend all their time criticizing the lack of minorities in movies produced by white people but don’t celebrate movies produced by minorities. At some point near the middle of the book, its mood and focus change. Gone is the portrayal of Africa as flourishing culture of innovation wronged by the greed and brutality of the West. Instead, we’re given an insider’s view to the first-hand reporting of some of the most violent conflicts in Central and Western Africa in the 1990s — most notably in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (then Zaire). For the most part, French stops pointing fingers at the West and becomes bewildered by the episodic eruptions of violence. Describing Liberia’s instability in the 80s that led to the tragic violence of the 90s, he writes:A barely literate master sergeant, Doe had disemboweled his predecessor, William Tolbert, in a 1980 coup and summarily executed twelve senior government officials on a Monrovia beach. Thus, as enthusiastic street kids cheered the firing squad, 111 years of Americo-Liberian rule came to an ignominious end. The slayings took place just one year after the Ghanaian military leader, Jerry Rawlings, a young junior air force officer, who had recently seized power, publicly executed three of his predecessors.French seems more forthcoming during the second half of the book that the violence and conflicts he witnesses are not just the product of arbitrary borders drawn by colonial powers or greedy Western mining companies extracting Africa’s natural resources for their own gain. Much like we in the United States have faced time and time again, Africa too has deep ethnic conflicts that most outsiders don’t even attempt to understand. Sitting in a hotel with dozens of other reporters that flew in to cover Africa’s latest bloodbath — this time in Zaire — French writes:The scramble to do some rudimentary ethnic detective work brought to mind just how normal it was for reporters to operate in nearly perfect ignorance of their surroundings on this continent. Africa remained terra incognita for most within my profession, whose job it was to inform the world, and for many of us an assignment here involved little more preparation than thumbing through a Lonely Planet guide. Anywhere else in the world we would have been judged incompetent, but in Africa being able to get somewhere quickly and write colorful stories was qualification enough. It was a repeat performance of the same contemptuous glossing over that characterized so much of Europe’s colonial involvement with the continent, and though I had more experience here than most of my peers, I was in no way exempt.Today Americans are (finally) forced to reckon with our own deep-seated tribalism between race, class, gender and geography, but there’s still a knee-jerk political correctness to not recognize anything that could be construed as tribalism in another country, especially in Africa. At some point we’ll have to finally recognize the tribalism in other countries, much as we’re now forced to recognize our own. And hopefully it will be part of a process of healing. French rarely address the ethnic tensions directly, but you can see it between the lines and ultimately it contributes to his fatigue. By the end of the book, he’s elated to get a posting in Japan and put his days in Africa behind him.I’m glad I read this book. French has a wonderful personality that shines through his writing more than the majority of books written by journalists, trained as they are to worship the illusion of objectivity. And I learned a lot about West and Central Africa (including both Anglophone and Francophone countries) — the part of the continent I know the least about. I wish I had read it before my trips to Liberia where I stayed at the very hotel from which French does most of his Liberian reporting. The book was also a reminder of how much progress the region has made over the past decade. Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso: compared to just a decade ago, they are all more developed, democratic, and peaceful. And it’s also a reminder that some things stay the same. French describes how a new generation of “strong men” were propped up in the region by the Albright State Department and most of them are still around today, still giving the head-nod to democracy without embracing democratic institutions: Kagame in Rwanda, Kabila in the DRC, Museveni in Uganda. There is such a thing as progress, it’s just not a straight line....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jan 21, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/103294.A_Continent_for_the_Taking

But then throughout the second half, its meaning and prose unraveled into seemingly arbitrary reflections on anything and everything. His work was done around page 70 and there was no reason to continue. Still, there is plenty I'll take away:Only when I understood that I had a primal need for silence was I able to begin my search for it — and there, deep beneath the cacophony of traffic noise and thoughts, music and machinery, iPhones and snow plights, it lay in wait for me. Silence.Silence is a nice alternative for ""meditation,"" and its surprising how little Kagge mentions meditation given its awkward moment in our noisy mainstream. But Kagge is an explorer and he prefers silence that is sought out more than merely paid attention to. Rather than a tool against stress and information overload — as the meditation apps now market themselves — Kagge's silence is a precursor to wonder, sensation, and more meaningful conversations. There's a lot to like about this book — not least the accompanying illustrations by Ed Ruscha. Still, I found it ironic that a homage to silence and the aesthetics of restraint goes on for too long....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 31, 2017","Jan 06, 2018","Dec 31, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36243813-silence

I picked it up because I was curious about the mythic icon, Che, not expecting anything great as far as writing goes. But as it turned out, Che is a better writer than Robert Drewe. I admit, though, that the Motorcycle Diaries become that much more interesting because it paints a portrait of a 23-year-old kid who will grow into the shoes of legendary status. You see what affects and forms Che into the revolutionary he becomes. And the LA Times is right — “it redoubles his image and lends a touch of humanity with enough rough edges to invite controversy.”But it is one of those books — like A Walk Across America was years ago — that is a complete inspiration. In the prologue, written by Che’s father, he writes:I didn’t realize that his obsession with traveling was just another part of his zeal for learning. He knew that really to understand the needs of the poor he had to travel the world, not as a tourist stopping to take pretty pictures and enjoy the scenery, but in the way he did, by sharing the human suffering found at every bend in the road and looking for the causes of that misery. His journeys were a form of social research, going out to see for himself. but trying at the same time to relieve suffering if he could....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Dec 27, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/172732.The_Motorcycle_Diaries

It was fun to read our own shameful inner thoughts in the voice of a relatable 30-something Brooklynite dude, but somehow written by a woman. So when I stumbled across this addendum - an alternative perspective of a segment of the original novel, but told from the perspective of Nate's friend, Aurit - I couldn't resist.

Zadie Smith's White Teeth and Victor Villaseñor’s Rain I’m a sucker for sweeping historical novels that unfold over generations and across countries. Zadie Smith's White Teeth and Victor Villaseñor’s Rain of Gold are two that come to mind. And this time I was swept away by Yaa Gyasi’s Homegoing, which begins with the story of two half sisters in 18th-century Ghana, one who is sold into slavery and one who marries a British soldier, and follows their respective ancestral lineages in the United States and Ghana until they converge in Palo Alto. Each chapter is a vignette into a particular period of Ghanian and US history through the eyes of compelling and complex characters that draw you in and stay with you. I read the book during my first (very brief) visit to Ghana and it helped me understand the country better. What I didn’t expect, however, was that it would help understand my own country and our ongoing racial turmoil. I finished the last pages, put on my headphones, and started listening to Jose Gonzalez’s latest album. When track 6, Every Age, started playing I stared out the window as we approached San Francisco. The lyrics reflected the book so poignantly my eyes grew glassy with emotion:Every age has its turnEvery branch of the tree has to learnLearn to grow, find its way,Make the best of this short-lived stayTake this seed, take this spadeTake this dream of a better dayTake your time, build a homeBuild a place where we all can belongSome things change, some remainSome will pass us unnoticed byWhat to focus on, to improve uponIn the face of our ancient tribesFeels so clear, feels so obviousTo each one on their ownBut we are here, togetherReaping what time and what we have sownWe don't choose where we're bornWe don't choose in what pocket or formBut we can learn to knowOurselves on this globe in the voidTake this mind, take this penTake this dream of a better landTake your time, build a homeBuild a place where we all... can belong...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 31, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27071490-homegoing

In part, it stems from spending more time in office environmenOver the past couple of years an old interest in personality psychology has reawakened. In part, it stems from spending more time in office environments, where my success is dependent on my ability to work well with people who are different from me. Also, the more data I get from 23andme about my genetic traits, the more curious I’ve become about how nature and nurture have shaped my adult self. Nurturing My Nature Studies of adopted twins that grew up in different families have found that most personality traits are inherited rather than developed. In one study, researchers gave a personality questionairre to identical twins that grew up separately. Based on their responses, the personality traits most strongly influenced by heredity were need for achievement, leadership, obedience to authority, zest for life, alienation, risk-seeking, and resistance to stress. In other words, most of the traits that define how we behave in any given situation.Researchers that study the genetics of personality now focus on the so-called “big five” of personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness and conscientiousness. With genetic data from more than 140,000 people, there are demonstrable associations between our genes and our personality traits, but they have yet to find, say, an extraversion gene. Not only do these studies confirm that we inherit many of our personality traits, but they have also found correlations between some of those traits and other characteristics. There is a strong association, for example, between extraversion and attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder, and between openness and schizophrenia. More controversially, some research suggests that there may be associations between our personality traits and our physical traits. Studies from the Face Research Lab at the University of Glasgow have found a correlation between plump cheeks and higher rates of anxiety. Introverts produce more saliva when drinking lemon juice than extroverts.The internet becomes a scary place when you search for these studies. If some of our personality traits are inherited and linked to our appearance, then it’s natural to wonder if there are broad personality differences that differ by race. Of course there are differences between a Chinese teenager in Beijing and a Finnish teenager in Helsinki, but how many of those changes would reverse if the Finnish teenager had been adopted as a newborn baby by Chinese parents in Beijing and vise-versa? Traits, Situations and Self-Constructs “Every person is in certain respects like all other people, like some other people, and like no other person.” ~ Clyde Kluckhohn & Henry MurrayA few weeks ago, I went to a happy hour after a workday that was packed with meetings and was greeted with, “we all thought you were too introverted to come out.” Instead, I was one of the most talkative and animated people at the happy hour. I wasn’t behaving out of character. I’m almost always extraverted when in group settings, though I put myself in group settings less often than most. Personality traits are real, but how they manifest themselves in any given situation depends on the person and the situation. We can learn about ourselves and others by using personality assessments like Myers-Briggs or DISC, but we run the risk of exaggerating the effect of personality traits and underestimating the importance of mood and situational context. In fact, when we attempt to explain the behaviors of others, we’re more likely to cite personality (he’s rude), while we’re more likely to explain our own behaviors based on context (I was hungry). We Can Change So, context matters. And so do self-constructs, the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves. The more we identify with the introvert construct, the more likely we are to explain our behaviors through that lens. The more we identify as “decisive,” the more decisive we are likely to become.On the other hand, personality tests can help us see ourselves through the eyes of others. Whereas I may describe myself as “direct, intellectually curious and willing to engage in disagreement,” others may describe me as judgmental, cynical, aggressive, and even closed-minded. Personality types help us see traits that tend to bundle together and how those traits are interpreted by other types of people with different bundles of traits. And there is no shortage in the offering of personality types.Let’s say there is total randomness in how the big five of personality traits express themselves; then there are 25 possible combinations of personality types. That’s more than the 16 personality types according to Myers Briggs , the 15 types based on the DISC assessment, or the four color-coded profiles of Taylor Hartman. And it’s slightly less than the 27 personality sub-types based on the Enneagram or or the 4000+ personality traits described by Gordon Allport.Over the past two years I’ve read up on all of these different personality frameworks to come to a better understanding of myself, how I differ from others, and how they are likely to perceive me. Surprisingly (to me at least), the most helpful framework is the one surrounded by the most psuedo-scientific, mystical woo-woo: the Enneagram.Author and Enneagram evangelist Beatrice Chestnut doesn’t shy away from hippie mysticism in her book The Complete Enneagram: 27 Paths to Greater Self-Knowledge. Case in point:In the chapters that follow, I will explain how the vision and technology associated with this ancient wisdom tradition come alive in the Enneagram. As we will discover, the Enneagram symbolizes this wisdom path through both its message and its mathematical-geometric structure, which expresses universal laws of nature that show how this ancient vision can be enacted, and reveal the methods for achieving it.I would advise the scientific minded to skip chapter two and head straight to Chestnut’s clear, no-nonsense descriptions of the nine main Enneagram profiles and the three sub-types for each profile. I identified deeply with the #5 “Investigator” profile with a strong “social subtype.” This isn’t to say that it’s a complete picture of my personality traits or behavioral tendencies, but it’s pretty damn close. Among my highlights:  	 “Fives have analytical minds and tend to spend a lot of time pursuing their intellectual interests.”  	 “They see knowledge as the most secure and satisfying form of power. In the face of conflict, difficulty, or hurt feelings, this stance sees withdrawal and distance as the best strategy.”  	 “They are calm in a crisis. As they appreciate the importance of boundaries in relationships, they value and respect others’ boundaries and confidences.”  	 “Naturally austere and laconic, Fives are minimalistic and economical in the things they do, which reflects their concern with making the most of what resources they have and an ability to get by on limited supplies.”  	 “Fives typically report that they had an early experience of being either neglected or engulfed by others at a time when they needed other people to survive. Because there was nothing to do but to live in privation, they learned to hold onto their meager resources.”  	 “This leads to a tendency to withhold limited resources, and to a “greediness” or hoarding mentality when it comes to time, energy, information, and material supplies. They often pride themselves on having an ascetic or minimalistic way of life.”  	 “This defensive strategy naturally leads Fives to acquire habits through which they distance themselves from others. This strategy can make Fives seem aloof and uncaring, but they are much more sensitive on the inside than they appear.”  	 “Five’s desire to observe and reflect on life instead of participate in it actively, in spontaneous ways. Naranjo thus likens the satisfaction Fives seek in thinking to a “replacement of living through reading.” Intense thinking activity also serves the purpose of helping Fives prepare for life, a preparation that they always feel like they need to do more of because they never feel ready enough.”  	 “Fives’ thinking tends to focus on figuring things out, preparing for interactions, and engaging in mental classification and organization. They are also attracted to thinking because it supports looking competent, which can be a way of hiding or a way of communicating your value without revealing too much of yourself.”  	 “Fives both feel a need for and idealize autonomy. They highly prize self-sufficiency, a value that offers both a way of affirming and rationalizing their preference for distance from others.”  	 “Fives are mindful of others’ needs for space based on their own concern with privacy and protection.”  	 “Normally, people have some ability to say, “I want that”—to express desires and do the work they need to do to get what they want—but these Fives cannot ask and cannot take. So they must rely on preserving what they are able to acquire themselves.”  	 “In their search for meaning, these Fives can become spiritual or idealistic in a way that is actually counter to real spiritual attainment, because it bypasses compassion and empathy and the practical level of how people connect to each other in ordinary life. This tendency is the prototype of what is sometimes called a “spiritual bypass,” in which a person looks for and devotes himself to a higher ideal or a valued system of knowledge as a way of avoiding doing the emotional and psychological work he would need to do to grow and develop.”  As you can see, these archetypical observations aren’t intended to make us feel good about ourselves; they are far more useful. Chestnut describes the common childhood experiences that lead to coping mechanisms that become personality traits — and I readily identified with all three. Also, each chapter doesn’t stop at diagnosis; we’re given practical suggestions to understand ourselves better and experiment with approaches to address the negative aspects of our personality traits. For example, she recommends that I:  	 Recognize when you may be thinking about feelings rather than actually experiencing emotions … allow yourself to shift your attention to your body, with the intention of being open and alert to picking up subtle signs of emotion.  	 Whether it’s getting a massage, letting someone take you out to dinner, or sharing more of yourself with someone you trust, allow yourself to increase the pleasurable ways in which you participate in the external world.  	 Notice when your devotion to high ideals displaces an openness to what’s happening in everyday life and actually causes you to close yourself off to others.  The biggest surprise from reading over past journals is how little I’ve changed over the past 20 years. The fundamentals of my personality remain the same, and surely most of them are rooted in my genes while others are deeply encoded in my subconscious based on how I grew up. Still, emerging research suggests that there are aspects of our personality we can change. And even if we couldn’t, I still find it valuable to better understand why others perceive me differently than I perceive myself.

Whereas Gawande argues that we can’t trust our judgeUpon first read, Messy seems to be the counter-argument to Atul Gawande's *Checklist Manifesto* . Whereas Gawande argues that we can’t trust our judgement during times of stress and would benefit from checklists to help us remember, Harford argues that we are our own worst enemies when we simply follow neatly planned checklists and would benefit from inserting ourselves into situations of stress and unpredictability. I think both writers are correct and the books are ultimately complementary.Both Gawande and Harford turn to air travel for anecdotes to buffer their arguments. Gawande recounts the the so-called "" Miracle on the Hudson “ that safely brought down US Airways Flight 1549 after it was struck by two flocks of migrating Canadian Geese. He argues that the safety of that particular flight and the impressive improvements in aviation safety more generally stem from the use of checklists to ensure that pilots don’t overlook anything — especially during times of stress. For Harford, however, automation is the enemy. He turns to the 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 to show how autopilot can create incompetent pilots — and it’s not hard to extrapolate from commercial aviation to, say, navigating our own neighborhoods without the assistance of Google Maps. It may seem that Gawande’s and Harford’s arguments are oppositional — one in favor of step-by-step automation, the other against it — but really they’re both asking for greater attentiveness from us. For Gawande, a checklist is a way to remind us to pay attention to what we may otherwise forget. For Harford, we must develop our own intuition and skills over time in order to react to life’s challenges and opportunities with competence. Gawande celebrates thoroughness; Harford praises improvisation.I read this book for one of our quarterly “learning weeks” at my work, when a bunch of busy travelers all commit to staying in town one week to learn from a guest speaker and each other. For this past learning week, our “guest speaker” was Harford’s TED Talk based on this book. It begins with a fascinating story behind the creation of my favorite album of a live concert: Keith Jarrett’s The Köln Concert. The book is a quilt work of such anecdotes of individuals like Jarrett — creative geniuses that are thrown into messy, unpredictable situations and thrive as a result. Martin Luther King becomes a powerful orator once he lets go of his carefully prepared notes and embraces improvisation. Jeff Bezos, Erwin Rommel, and Donald Trump all outmaneuvered their competitors by improvising so quickly and unpredictability that their opponents couldn’t react in time. Paul Erdős, the most prolific mathematician of the 20th century, was constantly pushing the frontline of theory while throwing himself into constant messiness and unpredictability. Brian Eno produced many of the most celebrated albums of the last 50 years by forcing bands to break away from all the musical habits they had developed together. And Benjamin Franklin was too busy drafting the Declaration of Independence and inventing bi-focals to ever master his aspiration to become neat and organized.Maybe you’ve noticed something about the subjects of all of Harford’s anecdotes? They’re all men. And, in fact, with the exceptions of MLK and Franklin, they’re all notoriously ill-tempered and narcissistic men. During our 21st century moment of constant collaboration in minimalistic co-working spaces designed to look like Apple Stores, Harford reclaims the reputation and mystique of the individualistic, unpredictable genius surrounded of piles of paper while ordering armies of underlings around. It’s partly why the world can’t stop paying attention to Donald Trump — the combination of his power and unpredictability is captivating. But these types bring no shortage of challenges. They tend to be terrible managers, constantly shifting from one goal to the next without a coherent vision and clearly laid path that a team can get behind. And they don’t spend much time thinking about the needs and ambitions of others. Colleagues and teammates are mere means to achieve their goals, which are constantly changing. Good management, inclusive participation, and democracy itself all depend on planning and preparation.Still, I concede Harford’s argument that the dominant work culture has probably tipped too far on the side of neat planning and tidiness, and I appreciate his suggestions for how to invite a little chaos into our perfectly planned lives and workplaces. Most tasks, he argues, require a combination of “flashes of inspiration to identify the right approach, and long effort characterized by selfless teamwork to put it into practice.” They require a “willingness to allow a degree of messiness into a tidy team.” We can minimize groupthink by inviting detractors to challenge and collaborate with us.Ultimately, Messy is a call to stay awake and attentive in a time of increasing automation and passivity. Following a checklist is one way to pay more attention to what we often gloss over. So too is throwing ourselves into an unfamiliar situation to liven our senses and force improvisation. As far as the future of flying goes, however, it seems inevitable that pilotless planes aren’t far behind driverless cars....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28815513-messy

Each of her books feels as if it were written to address the current moment of my life, the issues I'mZadie Smith remains one of my favorite authors. Each of her books feels as if it were written to address the current moment of my life, the issues I'm struggling to make sense of. Five years my senior, it's been a joy to grow up with her over the past 17 years.It's unavoidable comparing her latest novel, Swing Time, with her first novel, White Teeth, which was published in 2000 when she was just 24. White Teeth was a multi-generational epic that follows the intersecting lives of two families from Bangladesh and Jamaica. Its characters are quirky, compassionate, and complicated. They are defined by the multiple cultures they inherit, but they are not contained by them. Anne Chisolm's  observes that White Teeth ""makes racism appear not only ugly and stupid but ludicrously out of date."" With so much hand-wringing by graying professors at the time about the ""Clash of Civilizations"" and ""Jihad vs. McWorld,"" here was a young, mixed race author who seemed to understand the outlook of a new generation struggling to develop identities that transcend what is imposed upon us at birth: our gender, race and nationality. For a 20-year-old me convinced that the Internet would change everything (in a different way than it has), Zadie Smith's warm, glowing portrait of a post-racial society wasn't an optimistic ideal; it was the inevitable direction we were all headed.Swing Time is less optimistic, more ambiguous and far more complicated. There is more concern about appropriating others' cultures than celebration of bucking racial stereotypes. Even in 2000 when White Teeth was still on the bestseller list, Smith hinted that future books would look at race and nationality through glasses of a different tint.When I was little, we'd go on holiday to Devon, and there, if you're black and you go into a sweetshop, for instance, everyone turns and looks at you. So my instinct as a child was always to over-compensate by trying to behave three times as well as every other child in the shop, so they knew I wasn't going to take anything or hurt anyone. I think that instinct has spilled over into my writing in some ways, which is not something I like very much or want to continue.Fast forward 16 years to last November, just two days after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections, when Zadie Smith gave a talk in Berlin with her inimitable fusion of precision and sublime. She addressed the obvious question facing her work: “You were such a champion of ‘multiculturalism.’ Can you admit now that it has failed?” After some disclaimer, Smith admits:But still the question of a failed project—as it applies to the tiny unreal world of my fiction—is not entirely wrongheaded. It’s true enough that my novels were once sunnier places and now the clouds have rolled in. Part of this I chalk up simply to the experience of middle age: I wrote White Teeth as a child, and have grown up alongside it. The art of midlife is surely always cloudier than the art of youth, as life itself gets cloudier. But it would be disingenuous to pretend it is only that. I am a citizen as well as an individual soul and one of the things citizenship teaches us, over the long stretch, is that there is no perfectibility in human affairs. This fact, still obscure to a twenty-one-year-old, is a little clearer to the woman of forty-one.Swing Time recognizes the strength and significance of the identities we are born with compared to the identities we shape for ourselves. Indeed, it's the book's overarching theme and a lesson I keep learning over and over again, every year, every day. Yet, Smith doesn't lose hope for a future in which we are defined by more than our birth. As she ends her talk in Berlin:If novelists know anything it’s that individual citizens are internally plural: they have within them the full range of behavioral possibilities. They are like complex musical scores from which certain melodies can be teased out and others ignored or suppressed, depending, at least in part, on who is doing the conducting. At this moment, all over the world—and most recently in America—the conductors standing in front of this human orchestra have only the meanest and most banal melodies in mind. Here in Germany you will remember these martial songs; they are not a very distant memory. But there is no place on earth where they have not been played at one time or another. Those of us who remember, too, a finer music must try now to play it, and encourage others, if we can, to sing along....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Apr 2017,"Jan 24, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28390369-swing-time

For that, I could do no better than Janet Maslin’s excellent  in the New York Times. Rather, like most of my s on Goodreads, it’s a self-centered look at how the book affected me.I loved this book and loved that it made it onto so many year-end lists including the New York Times’ top ten books of 2016. During his podcast interview with David Axelrod, Obama mentioned that he has been re-reading old journals from his ascetic undergrad days at Columbia University. Looking back on them now, he said the writing is totally impenetrable with multi-page references to Sartre and Camus.I can relate. I went deep into existentialism when I was around 22, finishing my final year of college, and getting ready to go out into the wider world to make a life for myself. Like author Sarah Blakewell, my journey began with Sartre’s novel Nausea. It couldn’t have come at a better time. Up until that point, so much of my life felt like it was being shaped by something else — in part my parents, but also some other nebulous force of societal expectations. Then I discovered Sartre and Camus and I wasn’t just encouraged to pursue my own path in life; rather, it became a moral imperative to be authentic to my freedom and individuality — an intentional resistance to the type of group-think on display everywhere from the use of office-place jargon, trendy fast fashion and even the Third Reich (a central player in Blakewell’s book and the lives of the existentialist philosophers).As a 22-year-old, I hesitated to use the word existentialist. It sounded like the kind of ism a pretentious college student would use to mask his relative lack of real life experience. But Sartre and Camus left an indelible mark. An existentialist is mindful of the burden of freedom (the burden of making choices), and I wanted to be an existentialist. In every situation, we have the freedom to choose how we act, and this is a heavy thing indeed — so heavy that the vast majority of us would prefer to ignore it.For me, it’s quite the opposite. The weight of existentialism excites and energizes me. It makes me more curious about the hidden forces — my personality, my neuroses, the age I live in, the individuals and social norms that surround me — that drive my behaviors. And it motivates me to be more active and less passive in every situation, conversation and relationship. I haven’t felt sorry for myself once since reading this book.When I was in my 20s I wanted to soak up as much philosophical theory as possible; I cared little about the lives of those philosophers. Like Blakewell, I now find myself much more interested in how philosophers live than what they write. That’s what makes this book so rewarding and novel: it manages to clearly summarize the key aspects of each philosopher’s work without reducing the complexity, and then compares their philosophy with how they lived their lives. The discrepancies are often more illuminating than their writings. As Blakewell puts it, “philosophy becomes more interesting when it is cast into the form of a life.”I learned a lot about the philosophy and lives of Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Richard Wright, Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Edmund Husserl. Beyond theory and biography, Blakewell’s writing also nudged me to think about the practical applications of existentialism to modern life. Fascism was the greatest threat to individual freedom during the time of the existentialists. Today we’re more likely to complain about the burden of limitless choice than fascism crushing our individuality. North Korea may be the last holdout of forced collectivism suppressing any effort to develop individual authenticity.Yet existentialism is still relevant today, and not just because we have to make more choices than ever before, which inevitably means that we’re able to give less attention to each individual choice. Today, it’s the quiet march of software — adding one seemingly small feature after the next — that presents the greatest threat to our individual authenticity. There is a glass rectangle in our pockets that we mindlessly obey without consideration. This reduces anxiety; we no longer feel the angst of roaming the city lost, or not knowing what to do next, or whom we can speak to. Our GPS map and algorithmically driven calendar and to-do list point us in the right direction. Foursquare and Yelp tell us where to go, Amazon and Twitter tell us what to read, Spotify tells us what to listen to, Facebook tells us whom we should interact with. And we obey. It makes everything easier and more productive. Heidegger wrote The Question Concerning Technology back in 1953. He was worried that increased automation took away from our capacity as intentional craftsmen. Rather than using technology in the way that we use a hammer, we become embedded in the technological sphere — what Neil Postman called The Technopoly. We read and we experience the same fears today. We mindlessly trade our individual agency for the seduction of optimization. We seemingly accomplish more by thinking less. This isn’t inevitable, but we need a call to arms to once again treat technology like a hammer — with intention and purpose. (I’m tempted to try my hand at a draft of “The Existentialist’s Internet” — an attempt to retain our intention and individuality without escaping to live off the grid in the woods.)A modern existentialist is forced to consider other anxiety-producing questions. Do we become parents ? What to do for work? How to become politically involved with seemingly few meaningful opportunities? How much of the world should we experience and ignore? Is there even such a thing as an authentic self beneath the layers of heuristics, biological desires, personality types and psychological coping mechanisms that make up our personalities? These are heavy questions. No wonder we mostly ignore them. And no wonder we admire those who don’t even while they leave us feeling unsettled....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 15, 2016","Dec 15, 2016","Jan 15, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28444405-at-the-existentialist-caf

Over the course of the subsequent two years I had read all of his books published up to that point and they had a profound effect on me. His last four novels — all written in French and all significantly slimmer — failed to inspire. By switching from Czech to French it seemed that he lost his inimitable talent to effortlessly combine the weight of existentialist philosophy with the funny absurdity of human behavior. With The Festival of Insignificance Kundera retains the elegant economy of his latest novellas while recovering the irony and philosophical rumination that so many of us missed from his earlier novels. And, unlike his recent collections of essays in which he complains about everything younger than himself, Kundera is now more comfortable with the absurdity of all humans, including the youth. He's almost forgiving to his readers for their inevitable ignorance of, for example, the birthplace of Kant. There is still plenty of reason to protest Kundera's objectification of the female body, but it's done in such an original way that I find it much easier to forgive than your average magazine advertisement. Besides, I'd love to read a woman author philosophize about the male body in a similar vein.Selfishly, I'd love to see another Kundera novel in the future. But really, now is the time to put down his own. This book is the perfect period to an incredible literary career that represents the triumph of individuality in the 20th century and all the ironies it brought forth. When he does eventually die, the image of the final scene of this book, the festival of insignificance itself, will be the first thing to come to mind.

I am sure that I'll eventually read all five volumes. And by that time, I will have read more words by Knausgaard than any other novelist. Like the best of art and music, reading Knausgaard is a spiritual experience. It makes me feel different, see differently. There is an authenticity to his writing -- or at the very least a convincing illusion of authenticity -- that completely strips away all the phoniness that seems to permeate every situation, every conversation. Knausgaard is able to do this better than others because he's so completely willing to expose and examine his most unflattering, unacceptable thoughts and behaviors. Through his writing he has traded in a life of calm and politeness for unflinching honesty and authenticity. I don't think it's a morally right or envious way to live. It's just so refreshing for a reader eager to cut through the bullshit.Despite our many dissimilarities, there were dozens of times while I read this book that felt like Knausgaard had reached deep into the amorphous fog of my brain to pull out finely sculpted prose that describes perfectly thoughts I've never been able to articulate. As Knausgaard himself writes at one point, describing a friend's book: ""As is always the case with books that seem to be groundbreaking, they put into words what for me had been suspicions, feelings, hunches.""Some of my highlights:So the life I led was not my own. I tried to make it mine, this was my struggle, because of course I wanted it, but I failed, the longing for something else undermined all my efforts.whereas before man wandered through the world, now it is the world that wanders through man.meaning is not something we are given, but which we give. Death makes life meaningless because everything we have ever striven for ceases when life does, and it makes life meaningful, too, because its presence makes the little we have of it indispensable, every moment precious.From my own childhood I remember only a handful of incidents, all of which I regarded as momentous, but which I now understand were a few events among many, which completely expunges their meaning, for how can I know that those particular episodes that lodged themselves in my mind were decisive, and not all the others of which I remember nothing?For who brooded over the meaninglessness of life anymore? Teenagers. They were the only ones who were preoccupied with existential issues, and as a result there was something puerile and immature about them, and hence it was doubly impossible for adults with their sense of propriety intact to deal with them. However, this is not so strange, for we never feel more strongly and passionately about life than in our teenage years, when we step into the world for the first time,They were talking about cheap air tickets, how they started out dirt cheap, slowly became more expensive as you had to pay one surcharge after another, until you were left with a ticket that cost as much as those from the more expensive airlines. Then the topic moved to buying CO2 quotas, and after that to the newly introduced chartered train journeys. I could definitely have offered an opinion about that, but I didn’t, small talk is one of the infinite number of talents I don’t master, so I sat nodding at what was said, as usual, smiling when others smiled, while ardently wishing myself miles away.I have no problem with uninteresting or unoriginal people – they may have other, more important attributes, such as warmth, consideration, friendliness, a sense of humor, or talents such as being able to make a conversation flow to generate an atmosphere of ease around them, or the ability to make a family function – but I feel almost physically ill in the presence of boring people who consider themselves especially interesting and who blow their own trumpets.All my adult life I have kept a distance from other people, it has been my way of coping, because I become so incredibly close to others in my thoughts and feelings of course, they only have to look away dismissively for a storm to break inside me.This way of thinking, putting others’ reactions before your own, I recognized from myself, and as we walked toward Folkets Park in the rain I wondered about how she had picked that up.

It was the sole condition I had made before taking over responsibility for Vanja during the daytime, that I would have an hour on my own in the afternoon, and even though Linda considered it unfair since she’d never had an hour to herself like that, she agreed. The reason she’d never had an hour, I assumed, was that she hadn’t thought of it. And the reason she hadn’t thought of it was, I also assumed, that she would rather be with us than alone. But that wasn’t how I felt.“The more unreflective you are, the more active you are. You know, the boxers I wrote about had an incredible presence. But that meant they weren’t spectators of themselves, so they didn’t remember anything. Not a thing! Share the moment with me here and now. That was their offer. And of course that works for them, they always have to enter the ring again, and if you’ve been given a pounding in the previous fight it’s best if you don’t remember it too well, otherwise you’ve had it. But their presence was absolutely amazing. It filled everything. Vita contemplativa or vita activa, I suppose they’re the two forms, aren’t they? It’s an old problem, of course.

Hopefully, this is still honest critique that doesn’t shy away from criticism.Living in America, at this unequal, messy moment, can break your heart—but it doesn’t have to break your spirit. Living in America is so interesting, so fertile, so up-for-grabs. It’s also disintegrating and reconstituting and recalibrating. It’s up to us to make lives that we can be proud of — and to make communities and systems and policies to cradle those lives. It’s up to us to reject tired narratives about success, instead authoring new ones that are less about exceptional heroes and more about creative communities.I’m a sucker for applied existentialism — developing the daily craft of living with meaning and authenticity within the imperfect institutions and communities within which we're embedded. Which is why I’m more drawn to the bookshelves of biography and self-improvement these days than philosophy: it’s far more challenging to live than to theorize. In many ways, Courtney Martin’s The New Better Off is the antidote to the gospel of jet-setting self-centeredness advocated by another San Francisco-based self-improvement writer, Timothy Ferris, in his bestseller The Four Hour Workweek. Like Ferris, Martin too is a fan of the flexibility of freelance work, but she has a radically different vision of what we should do with our free time. Whereas Ferris advises his readers to focus entirely on self-optimization by not becoming distracted by the neediness of others, Martin asks her readers to come out from their isolated caves of Netflix, multiple screens and Uber Eats to find meaning through communal (and yes, offline) experiences. She even goes so far as to claim that social connections help us direct our attention — our most precious resource — more judiciously. That’s probably true for some folks helplessly addicted to playing Angry Birds while hunched over the blue shine of their iPhones. But for others, like me, constantly reacting to the demands of socializing can quickly become a drain on my attention and creativity.As I read through the book I found myself alternating between two very different sensations. First, it made me want to be a better person. A better husband, neighbor, colleague, citizen. With clarity and concrete examples, it points out the many ways I could be a more decent human being. But then, a second sensation would creep up, a feeling of inadequacy. Courtney does an excellent job painting an alternative portrait of success to the outdated expectations of a high salary, climbing the corporate ladder and jet-setting to exotic locations. But in doing so, mostly by describing her own alluring life, she set's a very high bar. Halfway through the book I wanted to throw my arms up and say, ""Courtney, I give up. I will never be as good of a parent, or neighbor, or enlightened consumer, or Zumba dancer. My friends will never be as multicultural and civically engaged. They can't cite their own TED talks or published books."" But I'm happy with my life and my friends and the way I've defined success for myself.I think that Courtney would respond that my conclusion is precisely what she hopes her readers to take away from her book — that we each must define and judge our own metrics of success and contentment. She puts forth some suggestions that, for her, define the good life — the ""new better off."" And while I agree with some, I disagree with others. But that's beside the point. The point is that we take the time to examine our lives and then act intentionally to put our ideals into practice. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 03, 2016","Oct 28, 2016","Oct 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28691818-the-new-better-off

With hindsMy instinct is to ignore the warnings of lawyers, security experts, and anyone else whose income is based on their capacity to invoke fear. With hindsight, it's an instinct that has served me well; the long arc of history is usually on the side of the optimists. But it is also my blindspot. Rarely to I seek out information about the risks and dangers we face. Fortunately, my colleague Eli Sugarman suggested that we read Fred Kaplan's Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War as the first installment for our Hewlett Foundation nonfiction book club. It was a timely read; cyber warfare has become one of the biggest policy issues of the campaign, and each day brings increasingly dystopian headlines about cyberhacks that erode our trust in our devices, our presumed privacy, and our democracy. First, Trump insinuates that Russian hackers should break into Clinton's email, and then hacker magazine 2600 offers a $10,000 bounty to any hacker able to uncover Trump's tax returns. Meanwhile, the US Department of Homeland Security is begging state election authorities to seek help to secure their voting systems against cyberattacks. I'm the kind of person who learns about the complexities of contemporary issues by studying their history, and so Kaplan's historical telling of the rise of cyber war and the institutions created in response served me well. I had no idea, for example, that the National Security Agency has its roots in World War I, when the government created ""MI-8"" to surveil all incoming telegraphs from Europe. It continued to do so for ten years after the end of the war until Secretary of State Henry Stimson finally shuttered the program in 1929, proclaiming, ""Gentlemen don't read each other's mail.""A game of cat and mouse resurfaces with each historical anecdote. The US government -- usually the NSA -- discovers some exploitation with which it can surveil its enemies, but also realizes that we are equally susceptible to the same exploitation by others. We were able to penetrate the nuclear reactors of Iran (which were run on Microsoft Windows!), and yet much of our national infrastructure is just as susceptible to attack. Over the years the NSA regularly assembles teams of internal hackers and sets them loose to see how much damage they could hypothetically inflict. A lot, it turns out, and each exercise in exploitation is an effective strategy to request billions from Congress for another expensive policy effort to bolster defense of national cyber-security. Most of the vulnerabilities, however, are embedded in commercial software like Windows, and the private sector has little incentive to invest costly resources in security and cryptography, which tends to slow down performance and means little to consumers that have grown accustomed to free software with new features. When the NSA does uncover vulnerabilities in commercial software, they have to balance the opportunity of using them to break into the computers of terrorists with the risk of terrorists and foreign governments using them to exploit American interests. The book was also a helpful corrective to my superficial understanding of the NSA's PRISM surveillance program famously disclosed by Edward Snowden. The initial reporting and media fallout over PRISM didn't give readers historical context about the NSA's longstanding relationship with software companies even before the PRISM program. I was under the impression that it was the NSA pressing companies like Microsoft to create backdoors that would allow for surveillance, when it fact it was more often the NSA alerting Microsoft that there were vulnerabilities that allowed anyone to gain access to users' data. Snowden's leaks were fundamental to alerting the public to the potential for abuse (I certainly wouldn't entrust PRISM to a Trump administration), but it's amazing how thoughtful and restrained the NSA actually was in its pursuit of information related to terrorists with little legislation in place to force oversight. Fortunately, Snowden's leaks prompted Obama to create a five-person commission to draft a report and policy recommendations to better balance ""liberty and security in a changing world."" Kaplan's chapter describing the relationships and interactions between these five old white guys with gigantic egos is among the most entertaining of the book. They were chosen intentionally for their diverse viewpoints, and yet all five men came to complete agreement about the changes needed to establish sufficient oversight of surveillance in the name of security and protection from surveillance in the name of liberty. Their recommendations prompted by Snowden's leaks led to a number of important reforms, but Obama chose not to adopt all the recommendations, which makes one think that he's seen firsthand the importance of data collection in deterring attacks.This book is a must-read for anyone who assumes that the NSA does little more than infringe on our civil liberties. Our culture celebrates those who respond heroically during disaster (think the firefighters of 9/11), but does little to recognize those who prevent disasters from happening in the first place (think of a hypothetical engineer who had invented a way of securing cockpits so the 9/11 terrorists couldn't have broken in).I would have appreciated a final chapter from Kaplan speculating on the future of liberty, security and cyberwar. It seems inevitable that the game of privacy cat and mouse will continue until the computers themselves become better at creating and cracking cryptography than the humans that once programmed them. The cryptography we use today to secure our email, financial transactions and most private documents will be rendered obsolete by quantum computers. Driverless cars, wireless credit cards, instant cloud storage of everything, smart homes -- the more we connect the more vulnerable we become. My biggest takeaway from the book is that there is real reason for concern, and that the NSA is pretty low down on the list of what we should be concerned about. Though 2016 has seemed like a year of death and disaster, in fact it's been one of the most peaceful years in the history of our species. We've come to take it for granted that major wars between nation states is seemingly a phenomenon of the past. And yet moving forward, cyberwarfare between countries and groups within countries is set to become a constant....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 21, 2016","Oct 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25814289-dark-territory

We weren't yet distracted by the dominance of our inner monologue -- When we were children we had direct sensory experience with the world around us. We weren't yet distracted by the dominance of our inner monologue -- the constant planning, evaluating and worrying of our adult minds. Knausgård poetically reminds us what it's like to engage deeply in sensory experience as if for the first time while simultaneously permitting the reader to enter the obsessiveness of his mind. Consider these descriptions of the banalest activities, how they engage all senses:I raised the glass to my lips and drank. The water, so cool in my mouth, had a faint metallic taste. Yngve’s cutlery clattered against the plate. A wasp or a bee buzzed around the dining room, behind the half-open door. Grandma sighed. And she twisted sideways in her chair as though the thought that had occurred to her had passed not only through her consciousness but also her body.I put my computer down, leaned against the wall, and peered up at the sky. There was a ventilation duct directly above me, which filled the air close to the house with the smell of warm, freshly washed clothes. From the laundry room you could hear the faint whine of a spin cycle, so strangely angry compared with the slow, gray clouds drifting through the air far above. Here and there the blue sky behind them was visible, as if the day was a surface they scudded across ...I switched on the stove, took a frying pan from the cupboard under the counter and some margarine from the fridge, cut off a slice and scraped it in the pan, filled a large saucepan with water and placed it on the rear burner, opened the bag of potatoes, spilled them into the sink, turned on the tap, and started washing them, as the dollop of margarine slowly slid across the black frying pan. Again it struck me how clean and, for that reason, heartening the presence of these purchases was, their bright colors, the green and white of the frozen beans bag, its red writing and red logo, or the white paper around most of the loaf, though not all, the dark, rounded, crusty end peeped out like a snail from its shell, or, so it appeared to me, like a monk from his cowl.Knausgård's slow deliberateness also comes out as he explores in inner mind with total honesty:I don’t get anything out of socializing anyway. I never say what I really think, what I really mean, but always more or less agree with whomever I am talking to at the time, pretend that what they say is of interest to me, except when I am drinking, in which case more often than not I go too far the other way, and wake up to the fear of having overstepped the mark.I have never been in any doubt that this is what girls I have tried my luck with have seen in my eyes. Too much desire, too little hope.for thoughts, whatever good one can say about them, have a great weakness, namely, that they are dependent on a certain distance for effect.This isn't a book for everyone. Part of what I drew me in is that I relate so closely to Knausgård's worldview, ambitions, and worries. He's also extremely sensitive -- far more sensitive than I. Throughout the book it seems like he's always on the verge of tears. But it probably takes such a sensitive disposition to live one's life with such careful observation. It will be hard for me to resist reading the next book in the series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 28, 2016","Jul 28, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19569669-my-struggle

Saving Capitalism -- a dramatic title for a book that otherwise mostly avoids hyperbole -- begins with the premise that we must drop the typical way we frame liberalism and conservatism as big government versus small government. Ostensibly, Reich wants to appeal to both Bernie supporters and the Tea Party disenfranchised, but this is clearly a book by a progressive for progressives. He would rather us think about a government that works on behalf of the 99% -- the middle class and poor -- regardless of whether it is a very large government or a very small government. To create such a government, Reich argues, we need to reform some very basic laws that set the rules of the market -- things like bankruptcy laws, intellectual property, contracts, and financial and anti-trust regulation. Reich calls the effects of these regulations that favor the wealthiest ""predistributions"" -- a play on ""redistributions,"" borrowing the term from Jacob Hacker's paper, The Institutional Foundations of Middle Class Democracy. Unlike Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty, who have focused on tax reform as the most effective way to reduce economic inequality, Reich argues that we must first set fair rules of the game that don't discriminate against the non-rich working class. If you'd like a condensed summary, Reich touches on the major points with some illustrative examples in this blog post. Our intellectual property and antitrust policies, he points out, cause Americans to ""pay the highest pharmaceutical costs of any advanced nation"" and to ""pay more for broadband Internet, food, airline tickets, and banking services."" (For a maddening overview of the current state of American monopolies, including sunglasses, cat food, plastic hangers, syringes, take a look at this 2015 American Prospect piece by David Dayen.)This is a very different argument from Reich's earlier work, which focused on the need to improve education and skills training for adult workers in order to adapt to technological change. Paul Krugman, comparing Reich's first and latest book, writes: ""economists struggling to make sense of economic polarization are, increasingly, talking not about technology but about power.""Saving Capitalism is enlightening with its clear re-telling of 20th century US economic history. By looking back in time, the gravity of our current economy comes alive. Sure, life is still good, but we realize that it could be so much better and that our current state will only accelerate with continuing technological displacement of middle class jobs while the wealthiest individuals and companies further their own interests through lobbying, campaign finance and tax evasion. In addition to the benefit of historical comparison, Saving Capitalism helpfully compares how the United States has decided how to regulate its market with other countries. In the US, for example, the wealthiest neighborhoods have the best schools because we mostly finance education through property tax. Other countries invest more money in schools in the poorest neighborhoods. ""The bottom line is that the vast majority of O.E.C.D. countries either invest equally into every student or disproportionately more into disadvantaged students,"" notes Andreas Schleicher. ""The U.S. is one of the few countries doing the opposite.”Reich is equally enlightening in his survey of reports from think tanks and journal articles from economists on the expected effects of the policy adjustments he proposes. By comparing our present state with our past, our peers and our potential future, it is clear what must be done.But how to get it done? Only then does the no-nonsense, fiercely intelligent Reich veer off into a fantastical world of political theory that only seems believable at a Berkeley coffee shop or a Bernie Sanders rally. Skimming the surface of John Kenneth Galbraith's notion of countervailing power, Reich proposes with a straight face that the disenfranchised on the far left and far right come together to build institutions that take on the power of the 1%. He's intentionally vague about what these institutions might look like. It could be a new political party, or a reformed party (in the way that Teddy Roosevelt reformed the Republican Party in 1901 or how FDR reformed the Democratic Party in 1933). Or it could be a resurgence of workers' unions. Or it could be some new platform connecting all gig workers to stand up to the dominant power of monopolistic firms like Uber, Task Rabbit and Etsy.Reich's call to arms for a countervailing political force seems so out of touch with the current political reality -- which has divided the country based on fear, identity and personality types -- that it's hard to take seriously. Krugman's  offers an observation that is as fundamental as it is simple and obvious:Anyone hoping for a reversal of the spiral of inequality has to answer two questions. First, what policies do you think would do the trick? Second, how would you get the political power to make those policies happen?Reich has me sold on his answers to question one. But he comes up short in his effort to tackle question two. Given Hillary Clinton's close relationships to Wall Street and the most powerful and influential of our country, I'm doubtful (as is Reich, who served as Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton and went on a date with Hillary Clinton in college) that she is positioned to ""rewrite the rules of the American economy."" But a recent New York Times Magazine article highlighting the work of Felicia Wong and the Roosevelt Institute leaves me feeling more hopeful. Regardless, Reich is a model of what we need from our economists: a recognition of the importance of power in shaping policies and a recognition of policies in shaping the market. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2016","Jul 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24338377-saving-capitalism

Just as you expect the many disparate threads to come together, the narrator confesses:As I write, I don’t know what this book is about. It’s not exactly about a tennis match. Nor is it a book about the slow and mysterious integration of America into what we call “the Western world”—an outrageous misapprehension, since from the American perspective, Europe is the East. Maybe it’s just a book about how to write this book; maybe that’s what all books are about. A book with a lot of back-and-forth, like a game of tennis.And then a couple chapters later:I don’t know what this book is about. I know that as I wrote it I was angry because the bad guys always win. Maybe all books are written simply because in every game the bad guys have the advantage and that is too much to bear.If you’re looking for a well-developed plot, this is not the book for you. If you’re looking for predictable character development, this is not the book for you. But if you take pleasure in subtle sarcasm and mockery, then there is something deeply satisfying about how Enrigue is able to paint a veneer of irreverence and absurdity over the usual stiffness of 16th-century European history.The more you invest in this book, the more it gives back. But it requires some determined attention. Page after page I looked up 16th and 17th-century European counts and countesses and their incredible rivalries — totally amazed by the amount of research and imagination that Enrigue invested to create such an ambitious work of absurdity based on real, historical figures.The descriptive writing isn’t for everyone, but I loved it. Of the Spanish poet Francisco de Quevado, he writes, ""He had bushy eyebrows and a thick, untidy beard circling a mouth dark red like a cunt.” Or: ""he was the kind of man who had seen so much that it would never have occurred to him not to scratch his ass if it itched.""My wife told me I had to read it in Spanish if I wanted to appreciate all of Enrique’s linguistic acrobats. But Natasha Wimmer, who translated Bolaño’s equally irreverent 2666 and The Savage Detectives, does an amazing job. Wimmer fully embedded herself into Mexico City to translate The Savage Detectives.

I'd come up with four people whose lives inspire me and do some thinking about why that was. Oliver Sacks was one of the four. This was last July.

I've struggled my whole life to find the right balance betweeThis will likely turn out to be one of the ten books that have most shaped my worldview. I've struggled my whole life to find the right balance between duty, altruism and hedonism -- the responsibilities we have toward others, both near and far, and to our own pursuits of pleasure. Like so many others, I suffer from the nagging guilt that I should be more altruistic, but where does that guilt come from and why do I seem feel it more than most? Strangers Drowning by New Yorker staff writer Larissa MacFarquhar helped me place that guilt into a much larger picture of what it means to be human and what motivates our moral behavior. Where do we draw the lines between what is expected of us and what goes beyond the call of duty? What do we owe ourselves as imperfect humans inspired by art, vanity, ambition and fellowship?The book's title comes from two moral thought experiments. The first is from ethicist Peter Singer: if you're walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning, do you muddy your clothes to save the child's life? Of course you do. Yet, we regularly spend our money on frivolous, unnecessary things when that same money could save the lives of children in far-off places. Singer's argument is compelling; just try reading The Most Good You Can Do without feeling more obligated to help others. MacFarquhar overhears the second thought experiment during a conversation between Jeff McMahan, a moral philosopher at Oxford, and one of his students: should you save the person you love the most from drowning or two strangers? What about three strangers? Three thousand? Three million? Where do we draw the line between whom we love and our responsibility to those we don't know?MacFarquhar observes that the difference between the drowning child and the distant child is one of duty versus altruism:To most people, the distance between themselves and another person—physical as well as emotional—is a deep moral fact: it makes a profound difference to their sense of duty. A person who is far away, whom you cannot see or hear, and with whom you have no memories or loyalties in common, cannot compel your help in the same way as a person who is right in front of you, or who is in some sense one of your own. Ignoring the cries of a drowning child is a violation of the most basic kind of compassion; anyone who did that would seem less than human. Cultivating sympathy for unseen and unknown people, on the other hand, seems an abstract, second-order, extra-credit sort of moral emotion—admirable enough, but more than can be required of an ordinary person.The book is a series of episodic profiles of extremely altruistic individuals whose sense of moral duty inspires both admiration and unease. Why are they so hell-bent on sacrificing all pleasure and tranquility in their own lives out of a sense of moral duty to help others despite their frequent inability to actually do so?The writing style is unique. Unlike her New Yorker profiles, which pull readers into every detail of the physical features of her subjects, in Strangers Drowning, we're not given even hints of the physical appearances of any of the altruists. Like a movie director, MacFarquhar does everything she can to remove herself from the connection between her subjects' inner mind and her readers' judgement. The effect is an alluring sense of intimacy, and also an unfair impression of objectivity -- as if the portraits of these do-gooders weren't filtered through MacFarquhar's own biases and interpretations.After profiling three or four altruists, she offers readers a change of pace with a chapter that reflects on the philosophy, psychology, and literary history of altruism. She refuses to criticize or endorse any of her subjects directly. But, whether intentional or not, each reflective chapter is easily interpreted as a condemnation or defense of the individuals profiled before it. (You can read two of the profiles from the book -- about Ittetsu Nemoto, a Buddhist monk and online counselor for suicidal Japanese, and Sue and Hector Badeau, who adopted 20 foster kids in need of a home and help -- on the New Yorker website.) On the philosophy of altruism MacFarquhar dives deep into the philosophy of altruism with a focus on the critiques of utilitarianism. She writes:The philosopher Susan Wolf has written that a morally perfect person would be an unappealing, alien creature, driven not by the loves and delights of ordinary people but by an unnatural devotion to duty. In a life devoted only to duty, there’s no room for art and little for enjoyment. “Morality itself,” she writes, “does not seem to be a suitable object of passion.”In a world where we're all motivated to help as many others as much as we can, there would be no art, no gourmet food. Arguably, in a world where humans do so much damage to other species, there would be no more humanity.However, MacFarquhar fails to address an appeal of utilitarianism for many non-religious, cerebral do-gooders. Utilitarianism, the idea that that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about moral right and wrong, offers us a clear moral code that isn't based on natural law or a higher power. She is right that it's a moral code -- like most moral codes -- that is impossible to adhere to. But without it, non-believers are left without any code at all. On the psychology of altruism This is the chapter that most disturbed and challenged me. It hit too close to home, and it continues to pester me. Here's MacFarquhar speaking with Lindsay Beyerstein about the role of suffering in altruists and some of the psychological research about altruists she came across in the course of writing the book:It's the idea that a child who grows up with at least one parent who is non-functional either because he or she is an alcoholic or severely mentally ill, or for some other reason just does not function as a parent. And the idea is that this child may take on the burden of fixing his family. He wants desperately to make everything OK, and he feels it's up to him, and so he may try to become the perfect student, he may do the housework, try to cook the dinner, try to take care of his siblings, even his parents. And the idea is that this child may, when he grows up, feel an outsized sense of moral duty to fix the world in the way that he tried to fix his family when he was a child.At first I resisted this idea as I had resisted many psychological ideas about altruists because it seems designed to suggest that extreme altruists were mentally unhealthy, that there was something wrong with them, that it was simply a matter of trauma. But then I thought about the people I wrote about in my book, and it certainly is striking that almost every single one of them falls into this category. Almost every single one has a parent who is alcoholic or is severely mentally ill. And, in that sense, I think that particular kind of suffering demonstrably can lead to a true moral commitment.Most of the chapter surveys decades of psychological theory and research suspecting that the true motivations of altruists is a need to control others.Selflessness was, in Freud’s view, usually suspect. The devoted, self-sacrificing mother, for instance, he found to be part masochist, part tyrant, enslaving her child with chains of guilt ... Excessive altruism tended to preclude real intimacy with another person, because intimacy was a business of giving and receiving, but the overly moral person could not receive, only give ... The moral narcissist’s extreme humility masked a dreadful pride. Ordinary people could accept that they had faults; the moral narcissist could not.Others, like science fiction writer David Brin, have suggested that altruists suffer from a ""relentless addiction to indignation"" -- and, indeed, that seems true of a couple of the subjects of Strangers Drowning. These are the kinds of altruists that we can all agree are the most annoying -- each act of do-gooding is intended as a slap-in-the-face to everyone else. But MacFarquhar concludes the chapter citing more recent studies that have discovered ""people for whom helping others was a source of genuine and unconflicted pleasure.""Intentions do matter, we realize. We're left trying to guess the intentions of each of the book's subjects. And our own. On the literature of altruism For me, the most interesting and unexpected chapter of the book surveys the treatment of altruists in English literature. ""In novels,"" MacFarquhar writes, ""moral extremity and a devotion to abstract ideals are nearly always regarded with suspicion ... it's as if there is something about do-gooders that is repellent to fiction.""There aren't many do-gooders in fiction, which is odd, because many fiction writers, like do-gooders, are driven by moral rage. But most such writers would rather show the thing that enrages them than show a character trying to fix it. You could say that do-gooders are rare in life, so their rarity in realistic fiction is not surprising -- though they are rarer in novels than in real life.Novelists love to dig into the irrational idiosyncrasies of human behavior driven by lust, desire, fear and ambition. If they were to include highly rational do-gooders, it would only be to deride them for their lack of humanity. Ironically, MacFarquhar's character portraits show that extreme do-gooders, in fact, make for complex characters with compelling stories. The ego of individualism After presenting readers with all the critiques and suspicions of do-gooders from the fields of philosophy, psychology and literature, MacFarquhar finally puts her cards on the table and expresses enthusiastic admiration for do-gooders:What do-gooders lack is not happiness but innocence. They lack that happy blindness that allows most people, most of the time, to shut their minds to what is unbearable. Do-gooders have forced themselves to know, and keep on knowing, that everything they do affects other people, and that sometimes (though not always) their joy is purchased with other people's joy. And, remembering that, they open themselves to a sense of unlimited, crushing responsibility.MacFarquhar's writing is so understated, so subtle, that its nuance and complexity are easily glossed over. I know it's a book that will offer more the second time that I read it. In an interview, MacFarquhar said: ""I hoped that someone reading the book would have experienced enough uncertainty and bewilderment in the course of reading these lives that they would reflect on something of what they were feeling.""That it certainly does. Mission accomplished.I only have one critique of the book. MacFarquhar's treatment of altruism and the individuals she chose to profile present a very individualized notion of what it means to do good. This is a critique that has been leveled against a certain breed of altruists by Amia Srinivasan, Lisa Herzog, Martha Nussbaum, and others. Sure, I could sacrifice 80% of my annual salary, live on peanut butter, and send all my money to purchase malaria bed nets, as GiveWell instructs me to. I could then quantify the estimated number of lives that I personally saved based on research by GiveWell and others. But sending over bed nets (or food or medicine or money) is not necessarily the most effective way to ""help others."" We live in a world of complex problems -- tax justice, climate change, aging populations, automation of employment -- that can only be addressed through institutions, collective action and good old fashioned politics.We know this to be true, and yet as our economies and societies evolve we retreat from social movements into highly individualized forms of participation, where we seek attribution and recognition for each of our actions. There is a more humble, and arguably more effective, form of altruism, which is to be one of many organizing and advocating for social justice....more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,"Apr 05, 2016","May 02, 2016","Apr 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24611937-strangers-drowning

We all strive to live more intentional lives. To have all the moments of each day add up to something more This slim little book has changed my life. We all strive to live more intentional lives. To have all the moments of each day add up to something more than just reaction to what circumstance puts in front of us. Especially in adulthood, when our lives become less dreamy and more confined than our younger selves ever anticipated, it feels like we merely abide by whatever our calendars, to-do list, email and vibrating phones tell us to do. How to reclaim the idealism and creativity of our youth and temper it with the experience and maturity of adulthood?My first attempt was meditation. I tried to silence all the noisy, reactive thoughts bubbling around in my brain so that I could experience the reality around me with fresh eyes, with a ""beginner's mind."" It worked, to a degree. But something was missing. I was suppressing thoughts, aspirations and anxieties instead of processing them.This very simple book has given me another step that has made all the difference: three little pages of journaling first thing in the morning to get it all out on paper first, and then meditate with a clear, rested mind. Morning Pages are about action. Unlike conventional meditation, which may lull you out of taking action, the pages magnify our discontent, pointing out actions we could take. The pages tend to point out our many choice points. We are egged on to increased honesty and candor. Our life becomes our own. We no longer sell ourselves out, giving our time and energy to others’ agendas. We have a choice whether to invest in others or ourselves. Investing in ourselves is novel for many of us.If you have a problem and you take it into Morning Pages, you will be given a sense of a possible next step. If you take the same problem into meditation, you may find yourself so spiritually “high” that no action seems necessary.These three, daily ""morning pages"" amount to a conversation with ourselves. But that conversation is typically like a bunch of random text messages. This morning exercise helps us place them into a narrative and spot the patterns that emerge over time. Day by day, pages tutor us. We learn to act in our own best interests. We stop being victims of circumstance. A choice at a time, we begin to craft a life that reflects our authentic values. Rather than sitting on the sidelines critiquing the game, we start to participate.Maybe Morning Pages aren't for everyone.

I was guilty, holding up Wainaina as a voice of reason among so much bad, cliché, heart-of-darkness writing about Africa without giving his own writing the time of day.It has to be said, and I think most readers would agree, that as far as memoirs go, this one is ambitious and demands dedicated reading. It's a coming-of-age story about a dreamy, awkward boy who eventually comes into his own as a confident and successful writer. As Wainaina the subject grows in age from chapter to chapter, so too does the voice of Wainaina the narrator. Some of the early chapters are so dreamy they are difficult to get through. The downside of such an ambitious project is that we only experience Wainaina's fully developed, sophisticated writing during the last 50 pages of the book, as he is commissioned to write long feature pieces in South Sudan, rural Kenya, Ghana and Togo. I'm always aware of my foreignness in other countries (and sometimes my own), but never more so than in East and West Africa. And so it was interesting to read Wainaina's meditations on feeling different kinds of foreignness: among his own tribe for having a Ugandan first name, among his Ugandan family for not speaking their language, as a foreign exchange student in South Africa at the end of Apartheid, as a Kenyan in West Africa, and finally as an African in London and upstate New York. Feeling so much foreignness can develop a fierce spirit of independence. Whenever an African intellectual like Wainaina makes a name for himself, the do-gooders in Holland, Washington DC, Geneva and Scandinavia are quick to jump on the bandwagon and claim him as their own. I was part of the unseemly process myself at Gates Foundation. They invite him to their conferences, include excerpts of his writing in their brochures. But Wainaina refuses to cede his independence. He's probably the only person ever to turn down an invitation to join the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders program. In a response to Klaus Schwab and Queen Rania of Jordan, he wrote:The problem here is that I am a writer. And although, like many, I go to sleep at night fantasizing about fame, fortune and credibility, the thing that is most valuable in my trade is to try, all the time, to keep myself loose, independent and creative…it would be an act of great fraudulence for me to accept the trite idea that I am ""going to significantly impact world affairs.""In the book he describes a ""very nice Dutch man"" who works for ""the European Union Humanitarian Something"" and invites Wainaina to write a literary piece about Sudan. He demurs, explaining he doesn't do development writing. The very nice Dutch man insists that he'll have total freedom and autonomy to shape the writing. So Wainaina travels to South Sudan and writes a profile piece of a South Sudanese doctor, and insists on referring to the south of Sudan as South Sudan. When the very nice Dutch man explains that this is against EU policy, Wainaina refuses their money and self-publishes the book. Such independence isn't career-advancing, but it will win over loyal readers. Like me. Last October Binyavanga Wainaina suffered a stroke. His community came together and raised $30,000 for medical care. His Twitter account is still active, and so too hopefully is his writing.

That’s a smart way to market a book in a world where sThe premise of this book is that it will help you get others to perceive you as you really are. That’s a smart way to market a book in a world where so many of us feel misunderstood. But it’s not until the very last page that author Heidi Grant Halvorsan notes an important addendum: we’re also pretty poor at perceiving ourselves. The identity we’ve crafted in our minds usually doesn’t match up with how we actually act. That is the book’s greatest flaw: it leaves the reader with some tips to enhance how we’re perceived by others without giving any guidance to better understand ourselves through their eyes. Without greater self-awareness, we’re just as likely to remain feeling misunderstood. And, more often than not, it’s our own perception that is at fault.Fortunately, this book is not just about manipulating perceptions. It’s about how to communicate with others who are different from you, which makes it valuable reading for anyone who has family or works in an office. “Others who are different from you” are defined by a number of psychological profiles that shift depending on context, but tend to be more dominant (or not) in different types of people. Are you an optimist constantly looking for new opportunities, or do you first focus on what could go wrong? When you are stressed, do you avoid others or do you actively seek out their help and emotional support? Depending on which type of person you are dealing with, there are some important implications for how we communicate. I’m sure we’ve all seen these two types of people in a friendship or relationship:[image]The book is marketed at manipulating others to perceive us better, but it’s just as useful to become more perceptive of others, and to understand how our hidden biases shape how we perceive. If you flip the framing, it’s really a book about how to become fairer and more empathetic. Halvorson claims that we unconsciously ask ourselves three main questions as we size people up:1) Can I trust this person, or might (s)he screw me over at some point?2) Is this person more or less powerful than me?3) Is this person a threat to my self-esteem?We don’t like to admit that our sense of power and ego have such sway over how we perceive others, but Halverson makes a pretty compelling case. Unless we feel like we’re in the same close group of special individuals, then we tend to distance ourselves from anyone who could threaten our sense of self-worth in a social setting. We tend to spend much more time psycho-analyzing those who are relatively more powerful than those who are less powerful. And, of course, we fall victim to stereotypes — mental shortcuts so that we don’t have to spend so much mental energy on forming a truly accurate picture of every person we meet. If you think back to our ancestors’ time around the fire in the African Savanna, these unconscious biases make a lot of sense.Unfortunately, they can also hijack our ability to accurately perceive people and make the most informed decisions. Boards say they want creative executive leaders, but then they’re swayed by the stereotypical reticent, tall, graying executive with plenty of gravitas but very little creativity. Women on hiring committees penalize attractive female applicants that threaten their self-esteem. And we all mistake warmth and charisma for trust when we should wait for a track record of dependability.Halvorson leaves us with no shortage of tips and tactics to improve our perception of others, and potentially how we’re perceived by others. I think only two are going to really stay with me. First, I’m going to try to slow down my first impressions — let them shape over months not minutes. Second, once those first impressions are shaped — those mental shortcuts that let our minds focus on other things — I’ll still try be a little Zen Buddhist from time to time and try to see the people I know through the eyes of a stranger....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Feb 13, 2016","Feb 22, 2016","Feb 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22750285-no-one-understands-you-and-what-to-do-about-it

Usually we chalk it up to good or bad management, but this book helped me realize that it’s so much more. It’s from Harvard Business Review's “Must Read” series — compilations of classic articles from HBR over the years that are collected along certain themes. The books are ridiculously expensive — nearly $30 for a cheap paperback — but often worth it. Unlike so many other business books, the recommendations in most chapters are backed up by sound, peer-ed research.I loved that this book was about effective teamwork rather than the typically individualistic take on the importance of leadership or management. We’re so hyper-focused in the US on the Steve Jobs-like figure, and we fail to appreciate that leadership is just one of many factors that contribute to successful teams.In case it’s helpful to anyone that doesn’t want to drop $30 on the book, here are my notes: On effective team communication: - Everyone on the team talks and listens in roughly equal measure, keeping contributions short and sweet- Members face one another, and their conversations and gestures are energetic- Members connect directly with one another — not just with the team leader.- Members carry on back-channel or side conversations within the team.- Members periodically break, go exploring outside the team and bring new information back.Energy is a finite resource. The more people that devote to their own team (engagement), the less they have to use outside their team (exploration), and vice versa. Successful teams, especially successful creative teams, oscillate between exploration for discovery and engagement for integration of the ideas gathered from outside sources. Teams err when they assume that all the information needed exists in the collective experience and knowledge of their members.Important that there are many short one-to-one conversations among team members between team meetings. Successful teams gave themselves time to learn to be a team.Effective team leaders circulate actively, engaging people in short, high-energy conversations. They are democratic with their time — communicating with everyone equally and making sure all team members get a chance to contribute. They listen as much as or more than they talk and are usually very engaged with whomever they’re listening to. We call it “energized but focused listening.” They connect their teammates with one another and spread ideas around. They seek ideas from outside the group but not at the expense of group engagement. On Team Composition: Define who is on a team clearly: Often our teams are not clearly defined. We overuse the term. Less than 10% of team members agree on the individuals that make up a team. Often the CEO is responsible for the fuzziness of team boundaries (fearful of seeming exclusionary or adding team members for political reasons).Teams usually don’t have enough time to congeal and truly trust everyone. It’s rare that teams get stale. Typically they don’t have a chance to settle in.Appoint and respect a “deviant” — a naysayer who tends to be skeptical and will challenge groupthink.The difference between working groups and teams:On a genuine team, each member does equivalent amounts of real work; all members, the leader included, contribute in concrete ways to the team’s collective work-products. Leadership roles are distributed throughout the team and members hold each other to mutual accountability to finish produce together. If it’s just about keeping people up-to-date on what each individual is doing, then consider it a working group. On Team Motivation and Challenges It’s important that teams and team members feel a sense of making progress toward a goal. The most motivating factor is an individual's sense of progress — even more so than recognition. Recognition that isn’t based on true progress toward an established goal isn’t effective.

You want to slap the protagonist, throw a cold glass of water on his face, and somehow get it through his head that he doesn't always have to play the martyr. But it is also a powerful reminder of why existentialism was so appealing to so many in the 50s and 60s. For the generation that came of age between the two world wars, not only did they suffer through the Great Depression, they also sacrificed their desires and contentment to always follow social convention. Maybe the Boomers didn't fulfill their dreams, but at least they changed the world enough to let us be ourselves. I mostly enjoyed the writing, though the middle third of the book occasionally felt like a slog. It redeemed itself in the final third.

Not because the writing was shallow or the subject matter superficial — Cormac McCarthy could never be accused of shallow writThis was a guilty read. Not because the writing was shallow or the subject matter superficial — Cormac McCarthy could never be accused of shallow writing. No, there was guilt because I enjoyed this book so much — the writing, the storytelling, the characters — despite a constant awareness that it perpetuates all the same old, unhelpful stereotypes of violent Mexican men, taciturn, courageous Americans, and lustful Mexican girls. “All the Pretty Mexican Girls” would be a more apt title, suggests one critic.This inspired some introspection. My wife is Mexican and happens to be a “pretty Mexican girl.” And I moved to Mexico shortly after college, probably in search of something similar to McCarthy and his three protagonists: a little more adventure. It’s not like I think novelists should only be able to write where they were born and raised. Christine Granados seems to imply that we shouldn’t read McCarthy’s books set in the American southwest because he was born in Tennessee. That’s ridiculous. My two favorite books about New York, Open City and Netherland, were written by Nigerian and Irish novelists. Still, this is a book about Mexico. 90% of the story takes place in Mexico. And, yet, none of the Mexican characters are given any depth or agency save Alejandra’s great aunt who is given a few pages to philosophize about love, loss and honor.But, the writing. McCarthy’s deceptively simple, vivid wordsmithing is what inspired me to pick up the book in the first place. The only other book of his I’ve read, The Road, contains some of the most descriptive and cinematographic passages I’ve ever read. All the Pretty Horses didn’t disappoint. Much like The Road, most of the book is a tour through stunning landscapes:By early evening all the sky to the north had darkened and the spare terrain they trod had turned a neuter gray as far as eye could see. They grouped in the road at the top of a rise and looked back. The storm front towered above them and the wind was cool on their sweating faces. They slumped bleary-eyed in the saddles and looked at one another. Shrouded in the black thunderheads the distant lightning glowed mutely like welding seen through foundry smoke. As if repairs were under way at some flawed place in the iron dark of the world.McCormick’s writing has a geological perspective, where humans just happen to inhabit and make for interesting subjects. As Madison Bell puts it: ""human thought and activity seem almost completely inconsequential when projected upon the vast alien landscapes where they occur.”I’d recommend this book to anyone who loves writing and language. There is a unique poetry to McCarthy’s style, its lack of commas, its archaic language, its simplicity and confidence, that is a delight to indulge in. It is poetry that is best savored slowly; I read the best paragraphs twice, and always got something new from them the second time. The writing is beautiful and the storytelling masterful, but the subtext deserves criticism. Much like Sean Penn’s “reporting” on El Chapo, All the Pretty Horses exploits Mexico and its charro culture as a background of nostalgia and violence, rather than helping us understand its complexity....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 27, 2015","Jan 12, 2016","Dec 27, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/469571.All_the_Pretty_Horses

I read an excerpt of the first chapter in the Wall Street Journal, and knew it was the right book for me:The image of Vietnam we foreigners seek is a close-cropped study in 'otherness'. Zoom out from the girl in the conical hat and the newly erected pylon intrudes on the view. Turn away from the buffalo boy and the scene is 'spoiled' by his parents' new concrete house. Vietnamese development planners don't share the western tourist aesthetic. Call it socialist, call it proletarian or just call it ugly; they'd rather see an electricity substation than a pre-industrial rural landscape. The people want progress and prosperity. The fantasy country we seek is the one they want to leave behind.This book helped me understand our every day and every social interaction in Vietnam so much better. It made the invisible become screamingly obvious -- the rampant prostitution at the karaoke bars and massage parlors, the political infighting behind each corruption scandal, and the delicate balance of allowing youth culture to flourish without threatening the self-preservation of the Communist Party. I wanted to travel to Vietnam to zoom in on the otherwise-abstract concept of ""authoritarian development."" Vietnam's GDP growth has been a steady 6.5% since 2000. The World Bank calls it ""a development success story,"" but Hayton goes into detail to show how the Vietnamese government time after time ignored advice from the World Bank and IMF:Vietnam has not developed in the way it has – balancing rocketing economic growth with one of the most impressive reductions in poverty anywhere, ever – by completely liberalising the economy. Yes, restrictions on private enterprise have been lifted, markets have been allowed to flourish and foreign investment has been encouraged – but Vietnam's success is far from being a triumph of World Bank orthodoxy. Some might snigger at the official description of a ‘socialist-oriented market economy’ but it's not an empty slogan.In many ways, Vietnam is the counter-factual to the 10 guiding principles of the Washington Consensus. The country is still run like a massive corporation, with the threat of revolt from managers and workers alike always on the horizon.More important to the Communist Party than economic dogma is self-preservation. Everything else: growth, poverty reduction, regional equality, media freedom, environmental protection – everything – is subordinate to that basic instinct. To survive, the Party knows it has to match a simple, but terrifying, figure: one million jobs a year. Every year Vietnam's schools produce a million new peasants and proletarians, the product of a huge postwar baby boom which is showing little sign of slowing down despite an intense ‘two-child’ policy. Growth is vital, but not at the expense of creating too much inequality. So is reducing poverty, but not at the expense of impeding growth too much.What I found most interesting is how the federal government is encouraging more transparency, participation and accountability at the local level in order to keep municipal and regional leaders in check so that they don't accumulate enough power to potentially threaten the party's monopoly of power. In that way, citizens are able to participate actively in the politics of their local communities without ever threatening the dominance of a one-party system. Similarly, it's never been easier to start a company, and free enterprise is everywhere so long as it doesn't threaten the dominance of a state-run firm. Much of Vietnam's good fortune has come from multinationals hedging their bets by building factories outside of China. Even leaving that dependency aside, challenges still loom:As the economy has industrialised, the share of agriculture in GDP has halved – from 40 per cent in the mid-1980s to about 20 per cent now. But the number of people working as farmers has fallen much more slowly – from three-quarters of the population in the 1980s to about half now.About a third of Vietnamese farmers are expected to lose their jobs. They will need to be retrained as waiters, drivers, hotel staff. But Vietnam has underinvested in education, and many of the hotels were we stayed imported staff from the Philippines that could speak English better and were generally better at customer service. Every once in a while there are pro-democracy rumblings from the scooter-driving youth, but more often than not the impulse comes from Vietnamese-Americans living abroad. Hayton doesn't expect a social media-fueled, democratic revolution any time soon:It's a common assumption among many observers of Vietnam that the coming of capitalism will create a new force in society, a new middle class with sources of income independent of the Communist Party and able to stand up and defend itself. This may come in time, but it seems a long way off. For the moment getting better off requires loyalty to the Party. The well connected are exploiting their connections to become rich, and the rich are exploiting their money to buy protection from the state. The result is widening inequality between rich and poor.The Communist Party is trying to stay true to its roots and address the growing inequality, but ""redistribution will mean taking wealth away from [the party's] biggest supporters. Does it have the ability to stand up to its own children and demand they hand over part of their wealth through taxation to benefit poorer people in faraway provinces?"" It seems doubtful. Meanwhile, the kind of one-party, authoritarian economic development taking place in China and Vietnam seems to have captured the attention of other, authoritarian governments in Rwanda, Egypt and Tanzania. It's hard to argue against what seems to work. Even more worrying is the dysfunctional, gridlocked circus that has become American politics.

Linsey McGoey’s No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy came out just weeks Talk about a well-timed release. Linsey McGoey’s No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy came out just weeks before Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan announced the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and set off an Internet-wide firestorm about philanthropy and its relationship with inequality and democracy.This was almost the book I had been waiting for. But it only goes half way, pointing out what’s wrong in billionaire philanthropy without any substantive analysis of how to make things right, or at least slightly better. It builds on the work of other thoughtful critics, including Rob Reich, Mark Dowie, Gara LaMarche, and Joanne Barkan, and applies it to the work of the Gates Foundation (disclosure: my former employer). But it doesn’t offer any new arguments or solutions. And, as Andy Beckett points out in his , it doesn’t seem like McGoey spoke to many Gates Foundation employees to better understand how the structure and management of the foundation contribute to its shortcomings.McGoey depicts those of us who work at foundations as naive, idealistic “TED Heads” that jet around in business class from one to the next faddish conference without ever understanding the roots or realities of the problems we purport to address. Sure, you can find those types at many foundations, and sadly their ilk is on the rise as foundations increasingly recruit MBA generalists on the assumption that they are more efficient and ""outcome focused."" But if she had spoken with more foundation employees, McGoey would have discovered that many of philanthropy’s toughest critics are those of us that work on the inside — even at the Gates Foundation. Each time we go through an existential crisis about our work, we ask ourselves a question that McGoey mostly avoids: given the current political realities, if not this, then what?The strongest section of the book looks at the implications of the Gates Foundation’s choice to work with rather than against Big Pharma to make progress against diseases that affect the poorest. That decision is rooted in Bill Gates’ belief that philanthropy can help attract “the smartest minds to the most important problems.” It’s a noble goal that necessitates some ugly trade-offs. Supporters of the foundation’s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies argue that, as a result, poor people get access to new medicines faster and cheaper while pharmaceutical companies gain access to new markets. Critics, like McGoey, point out that Big Pharma is making record profits that it uses to lobby governments for strict patent protections against generic equivalents — government-sanctioned monopolies that deny life-saving medicine to poor people. Hepatitis C, for example, affects 150 million people worldwide and kills 700,000 people each year. There is a treatment, but it will cost you $1,000 per daily pill — $84,000 for the full treatment. The state of Illinois has paid tens of millions for the drug, and was forced to restrict Medicaid patients from treatment. Generic versions of the drug in developing countries (where 73% of all people with hepatitis C live) could be as low as $100 for the full treatment, leading to healthier citizens and more productive economies.I fully agree with McGoey that patent protections shouldn’t keep people from accessing medicines that could save their lives. It was one of the areas I was most interested in when I worked at Open Society Foundations (yes, an evil private foundation). But even as I nodded in agreement, I was frustrated that McGoey didn't substantively address the tradeoffs of working with versus against Big Pharma, and that she didn't dig into the details of Gates Foundation’s Global Access policy. The foundation’s approach to intellectual property is much more nuanced than just “patent protection at all costs.""She also joins the chorus of voices demanding that the foundation’s trust divest from oil companies, without recognizing research that shows that divestment campaigns rarely work. All that activist effort to get private foundations to divest from oil companies is a distraction from what would really make a difference: higher taxes on carbon extraction and consumption, and cheaper renewable energy.To the degree that McGoey offers a solution, it’s that wealthy people should pay more taxes, and governments should provide quality public services and a basic safety net. I agree, and both Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are on record for supporting higher taxes. (Buffet has been especially vocal.) But McGoey’s faith in governments to be the sole financier of public goods, scientific research and the arts makes me think she’s never lived in a developing country. It’s a model that works well at the University of Essex, where she works, but just ask researchers, activists and artists in Mexico what they have to go through to get government support.Finally, when I ponder the book’s central premise that private foundations amount to unaccountable, institutionalized plutocracy (and this is something I think about frequently), I ultimately come to the same conclusion. Private foundations aren’t the problem, and getting rid of them isn’t the solution. As Larry Kramer (disclosure: president of the Hewlett Foundation, where I work) argues, the problem is large aggregations of wealth. Allocating those large aggregations of wealth to private foundations (compared to, says, campaign finance, lobbying or luxury yachts) is the least of our worries.I’d recommend this book to anyone who works in philanthropy, and to anyone interested in the relationship between wealth, idealism and democracy. It reveals the many contradictions rampant in my field. McGoey is a deep, subtle thinker who rewards her readers with great passages from 19th century literature, sociological theory and political philosophy. It’s an especially important read for all those attracted to the hype of social entrepreneurship and the next TED conference. For those of us who have been pondering philanthropy’s shortcomings for some time, however, this is not the book to help us advance our thinking on how to improve philanthropy and its relationship with democracy....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Dec 11, 2015","Jan 18, 2016","Dec 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25614443-no-such-thing-as-a-free-gift

You’d be better off selecting the best posts from the blog that eventually gave rise to the book. Still, I loved the concept, and there is no shortage of interesting examples of the benefits of asking questions.Children are notorious for their questions. According to one estimate, they ask around 40,000 questions between ages two and five, driving their parents crazy in the process. Then something happens and most of us stop asking questions. We lose our curiosity.Berger has a few theories as to why. He says our education system values answers more than asking good questions. As we grow up, and become more sensitive to how others perceive us, we stop asking questions for fear that others will think us stupid. And, finally, some stop asking questions because questions challenge authority, and questioning authority can get us in trouble. I’m most interested in the last type of question, the kind that challenges authority and challenges our inherited assumptions. Those who have the least power are also the least likely to question authority; it’s one of the thorniest obstacles in our field of transparency, accountability and governance.Much of the first half of the book profiles the Right Question Institute, a non-profit based in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a staff of just four that teaches question-asking as a “catalyst for microdemocracy.” It’s the kind of place I’d intern at today if I were a recent college grad. I love the concept of Microdemocracy, that we can act democratically in our everyday lives by simply asking questions of our public officials and institutions. There is something empowering about asking questions, though it requires us to be self-confident enough to be vulnerable about our ignorance. Unfortunately, society rewards the bombastic “experts” that claim to have all the answers.There is plenty in the book to disagree with. Berger is strangely enamored with Silicon Valley technologists and pundits, though he has a knee-jerk tendency to criticize technology’s effect on inquiry. Sure, having Google and Wikipedia at our fingertips can make us lazy, but they’re also wonderful tools for the inquisitive and can give us the necessary context to ultimately ask better questions. Berger says “experts” don’t ask good questions, yet then he seems to introduce everyone as an expert and can’t help but mention their credentials. His own bio calls him an “innovation expert,” whatever that is. I wish the book featured fewer technologists and more insights from researchers and investigative journalists. And I wish it were slightly more nuanced in distinguishing between different types of questions: those in search of facts, opinions, or the kind that question assumptions.

My highlights:From somewhere, in college, Pip had gotten the idea—her mind was like a balloon with static cling, attracting random ideas as they floated by—that the height of civilization was to spend Sunday morning reading an actual paper copy of the Sunday New York Times at a café. This had become her weekly ritual, and, in truth, wherever the idea had come from, her Sunday mornings were when she felt most civilized. No matter how late she’d been out drinking, she bought the Times at 8 a.m., took it to Peet’s Coffee, ordered a scone and a double cappuccino, claimed her favorite table in the corner, and happily forgot herself for a few hours.It was kind of remarkable how instantly and totally she’d been trapped the minute her four years of college freedom ended; it would have depressed her, had she been able to afford being depressed.What she hadn’t yet learned was how not to want somebody to be nice to her.She and her boyfriend, Martin, were vacationing in various American slums, ostensibly to raise awareness of their international squatters’ rights organization, and to forge connections with the American antinuke movement, but primarily, it seemed, to take pictures of each other in front of optimistic ghetto murals.the Internet is the greatest truth device ever. And what does it tell us? That everything in the society actually revolves about women, not men. The men are all looking at pictures of women, and the women are all communicating with other women.Here Annagret winked at her, which seemed a real feat to Pip, who was no good at winking, winks being the opposite of sarcasm.It’s true I’m male and have some power, but I never asked to be born male. Maybe being male is like being born a predator, and maybe the only right thing for the predator to do, if it sympathizes with smaller animals and won’t accept that it was born to kill them, is to betray its nature and starve to death. But maybe it’s like something else—like being born with more money than others. Then the right thing to do becomes a more interesting social question.Was there anything more sweetly existential than the walking done for sex in the most desolate of streets at three in the morning?Leila saw middle age as the Revenge of the Brunettes.The Bay Area is where you’d expect a story like this to come from. All that hacker capability mingling with the Occupy mentality.”And yet it was oddly comforting to know that even if she could identify the ethically correct thing to do with a billion dollars, and proceeded to do it, she could never alter the world’s shitty course.A fact of my life was that I had a morbid fear of reproach, especially from women.She waited, with the particular exposure of a barista, while he claimed his preferred table with his paper and came over to the pastry case.The mark of a legitimate revolution—the scientific, for example—was that it didn’t brag about its revolutionariness but simply occurred.it seemed as if the Internet was governed more by fear: the fear of unpopularity and uncoolness, the fear of missing out, the fear of being flamed or forgotten.The world was overpopulated with talkers and underpopulated by listeners, and many of her sources gave her the impression that she was the first person who’d ever truly listened to them.How do you know that you’re a person, distinct from other people? By keeping certain things to yourself. You guard them inside you, because, if you don’t, there’s no distinction between inside and outside. Secrets are the way you know you even have an inside. A radical exhibitionist is a person who has forfeited his identity. But identity in a vacuum is also meaningless. Sooner or later, the inside of you needs a witness. Otherwise you’re just a cow, a cat, a stone, a thing in the world, trapped in your thingness. To have an identity, you have to believe that other identities equally exist. You need closeness with other people. And how is closeness built? By sharing secrets.For a while, living with them, she’d felt vindicated in her belief that she could have been a well-adjusted and effective person if she’d had a pair of parents like these.“I like that you can be honest about what you want.

This is a journey deep down into Arenas’ subconscious. Maybe it’s a good read if you’re on peyote or if you’re a fanatic of abstract performance art. Here’s a representative excerpt:“If you didn’t exist I’d have to invent you. So I invent you. And instantly that makes me not feel so lonesome. But all of the sudden the elephants and fish come up. And they grab me by the neck and pull out my tongue. And they wind up convincing me to make myself eternal. So I have to try to invent something again. Until finally there’s not a tree left standing. Now I can sleep easy, with my big hatchet tucked under my arm.”Actually I was being charitable. He’s much more coherent in that paragraph than most.The novel was clearly a catharsis for Arenas after having lived most of his life as an unwanted gay artist in a country that celebrated the macho political revolutionary figure. Arenas sought the Manhattan life he eventually attained: sexual liberation, the arts, a tolerance - if not appreciation - of the absurd.This is the first book of Arenas’ quintet, the Pentagonía, which he called his “secret history of Cuba.” I’m very doubtful that I’ll read the other four....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 05, 2009","Dec 05, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36553.Singing_from_the_Well

It wasn't until the second half of the book that I really got into it, but eventually I stayed up into the early morning to finish the last 100 pages even though I already knew how would end. Daniel James Brown is skilled at disappearing into the background and letting the story tell itself. He offers little insight or analysis, but by the end of the book any reader with half a heart will have developed feelings for the characters and it's just about impossible to watch old clips of them on YouTube and not feel that you're cheering on old friends. This book quickly became a greatest hit here in Seattle. I was the last of my family to read it, and it even became a cheesy corporate metaphor at my work complete with a rowing field trip to inspire us to ""all row together."" Indeed, it does make for especially compelling reading for residents of north Seattle. The main character's parents owned a house just two blocks from my own. And I routinely pass by the old crew house on Lake Washington during my longer runs. Brown does a great job bringing these places to life, and reminding us of just how much Seattle has changed in the past 80 years. My inner Marxist has always thought of crew in the same way that I think of polo, golf and even tennis -- pretty boring ways for rich people to pass the time. The Boys in the Boat helps an outsider like me understand why rowing remains popular in Seattle (head to Green Lake early on any Sunday morning), and not just among the upper-class. Like so much that is dear to Seattle's identity, it was a way for the city in the woods to outshine the wealth of the East Coast and San Francisco on their own terms.

Until recently I had mistakenly thought that HP was a computer company that eventually got into the printer business. I didn’t realize that HP started out as a scientific instruments company that began designing and manufacturing various products that I had to look up in the dictionary: audio oscillators, wave analyzers, distortion analyzers, proximity fuses.I remember choosing between a Texas Instruments or Hewlett Packard calculator when I was in high school, but I had no idea that HP released a wristwatch calculator in 1977 — the Apple Watch of its day — for between $2,500 to $3,300 in 2014 dollars depending on your preference of stainless steel or gold. Nor did I know that Dave Packard worked in the Department of Defense at the height of the Cold War and Vietnam conflict.As far as business memoirs go, this one is a relative joy to read. Packard is a likable narrator who is self-confident enough to not seek credit for every HP accomplishment. If anything, he celebrates when HP was successful in spite of his decisions, such as when a maverick engineer designed a highly successful monitor that Packard and others had unwisely tried to kill off. If Packard takes pride in anything, it is not giving into the greed and luxury of the business class. When some Chinese executives visit his house, he heads to his woodworking workshop to make some chopsticks out of redwood. When Hewlett and Packard invited executives and politicians on deer hunting trips, they each were expected to lend a hand in washing dishes and cleaning up.In the 1980s, when the economic slowdown forced the company to consider laying off 10% of its staff, Hewlett and Packard asked their employees if they’d instead be willing to reduce the number of days they work each month from 20 to 18, and take a temporary 10% reduction in salary until the economy improved. They did, enjoying longer weekends and temporarily tightening their belts until the economy improved and everyone went back to full time employment without having had to lay anyone off.It’s easy to romanticize the past, but Hewlett and Packard really do seem to have had a stronger moral code than most entrepreneurs and business leaders today. It’s hard to know from a single book, but they seemed more sure of themselves, their values, and their ambitions compared to the business leaders you see in Silicon Valley today. I think there are two reasons for this. First, Hewlett and Packard both grew up with the values of taking individual responsibility for effort while contributing to community with their work. Today’s entrepreneurs are more worried about the valuation of their startup and retaining control over their boards. Second, HP was manufacturing actual products that made a clear contribution to electric engineering, if not society. Today, the most successful companies in Silicon Valley create “platforms” that are ultimately vehicles to sell advertisements, or to be acquired before they even make a profit.The HP Way is a useful book for someone like me wanting to learn more about the culture of the Hewlett Foundation.

First, she offers an archetypical character portrait of the type of person we have aNina Munk accomplishes two feats in one short, easy-to-read book. First, she offers an archetypical character portrait of the type of person we have all met: charismatic, intelligent, influential and arrogant. These people are immediately impressive; we are entranced by their eloquence and confidence — as Nina Munk was at first by Jeffrey Sachs. It’s only after we follow them for years and dig deeper that we realize there is often more arrogance and hunger for attention than intellect and empathy. Second, Munk describes the cyclical failures of aid and development, and delves into the research to explain some of the reasons for those failures. For at least half of the book, she describes development’s shortcomings from the perspective of those who are meant to benefit from all this work and investment — a rarity in development literature. It’s a book of show, not tell. This is as close as Munk gets to making an explicit argument:The term ""rural development tourism"" was coined by the scholar Robert Chambers in Rural Development, his influential 1983 book about why outsiders remain ignorant about rural poverty. His thesis, in short, is this: with their “hectic excursions from the urban center,” development experts don’t see behind the facade. The more distinguished a visitor happens to be, the greater his ignorance and self-deception. “They come, and they sign the book, and they go. They only talk with the buildings, writes Chambers, quoting destitute Africans. “They don’t realize there are living people here.”Jeffrey Sachs’s observations on the ground were necessarily limited — by the pressures of time, by language, culture, education, background, preconceptions, and ingrained models of thought. Wherever he went in Africa, he was greeted by a spectacle: villagers danced for him, dignitaries put on their Sunday suits and praised him, dozens of photos were snapped, and just before his arrival, schools and clinics were scrubbed clean. His view of what was happening in the [Millenium Villages] wasn’t wrong; it was incomplete. Real progress had been made, by all means; nevertheless, the villages had serious, deep-rooted problems, problems that for one reason or another Sachs received to acknowledge.I subscribe to the semi-mystical view that the right books find us at the right time. This one certainly did. It stood out among several thousand at a small, chaotic bookstore in New Delhi’s Khan Market. I started reading it days before I traveled to rural Bihar to do some “rural development tourism” of my own. I joined a researcher from a prestigious American university to study the use of communications to promote healthy behaviors among young women during pregnancy and the first three years of the child’s life — little things like taking iron supplements during pregnancy, exclusive breastfeeding for the child’s first six months, and then discredit Nina Munk and her book. The same character traits that have alienated so many of his would-be allies come through clearly in the way he dismisses her careful research and thoughtful writing. That said, he does have a point that it’s still early for an authoritative pronouncement on whether the Millennium Villages Project was effective at improving health and development outcomes. 2015 is meant to be the year of “extensive data collection,” which will feed a final evaluation for publication in mid-2016.

Yet this same profile simultaneously manages to reveal no new information. We love it because it confirms our best beliefs. No other form so seamlessly constructs the necessary components of celebrity, exploiting the desire to see our idol as both “just like us” and nothing like us, as both the girl next door and a goddess above. It is, in other words, spectacularly banal.There is a concrete reason celebrity profiles are so banal; they are the inventions of public relations firms. Before the journalist is granted an interview, she is first vetted by PR consultants who set the rules and parameters of the ""conversation."" If a journalist gains a reputation of asking questions that haven't been vetted by the PR firms, their interview requests are no longer granted. The celebrity goes through media training with communications professionals to learn how to convey an appealing personality without actually revealing information. Fortunately, The Believer doesn't just criticize the celebrity profile, it regularly improves upon it. The tone of the monthly arts and culture magazine (now 107 issues deep!) goes back to its 2003 introductory essay, which called for a new literary and arts culture free from snark. Snark, the defining worldview of a generation.Confidence, or the Appearance of Confidence is a collection of the magazine's best music interviews from 2003 - 2013. They range in style, genre, and topic. Occasionally, the musician asks more questions than the interviewer. And, refreshingly, the interviewer isn't afraid to point out if the musician is saying something obvious and uninteresting. The book is full of passion, but there is little hero worship. Jack White talks about his days as an upholsterer in suburban Chicago. Questlove puts John Mayer and D'angelo in the same category as Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, and Bob Marley. And Wayne Coyne (The Flaming Lips) has a contagious laugh with Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) over the awkward questions of German Journalists.As often happens, some of my favorite musicians and songwriters turn out to be the least interesting people, at least if you're to judge someone based on an 10-page interview. Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse, one of my ten favorite lyricists, comes off as a frat boy shouting at anyone willing to listen at a keg party. (And he's mostly shouting about his favorite recipes.) More often, I was blown away by the insight and eloquence of musicians I only knew by name or song: Trent Reznor, Joanna Newsom, Lucinda Williams, and Pat Benatar among them. I picked up this book at the airport because I needed something light and segmented to read in bed while I was traveling. I didn't expect it to wake up a love for music -- for the craft of music -- that has largely dissipated over the past decade. We're confronted with so much music, so many demands for our attention, that it's increasingly difficult to fall in deep communion with a band. Karen O, formerly of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, makes a case that ""because of the internet, everybody's a critic.""It's like people listen to the records so they can get on their blog and write their own . It's so reportorial, I feel like it's less and less about one's individual relationship to the music and more about being the first person to have an opinion about it.Even live shows, once the ideal place to lose oneself in the communal ecstasy of the crowd, can increasingly feel like another testing ground to prove oneself to critics. Again, Karen O:There's this whole crossed-arms, ""OK, prove something to me"" audience. One of the last shows we played last year was in Mexico City. The kids came and we were the only band playing. We were playing at 9:30 pm and they opened the doors at seven and kids came running in and it was a huge line. Two and a half hours before we even hit the stage, kids were whistling and yelling, and it was just nuts. When we went out there, it was the most amazing crowd we've ever played, the most receptive and loving and enthusiastic. Totally the most sincere crowd we've ever played to. I was like: ""Damn, if I could play to a crowd like this every night, I'd do this every day of the year. It wouldn't drain me. It wouldn't sap me. I wouldn't feel all these conflicts."" I couldn't even believe it.

The book lacks anything resembling a plot or narrative tension, and yet in its entirety it illuminates our understanding of how America has evolved since the end of WWII. It is a collage depiction of what Packer calls ""the dismantling of the Roosevelt Republic.""In classic Aaron Sorkin-like liberal establishment fashion, it's a tale of our fall from grace that ends with the subtle hope that we will regain good ol' fashioned American idealism.

I went to Eleanor Roosevelt College at UCSD, and yet I knew very little about her life -- such as that she was Teddy Roosevelt's niece, or that her mother died of diphtheria when she was eight. I didn't even know that FDR served four terms in office, and that it was generally expected that he would serve a fifth.Death is one of the themes that stands out the most in No Ordinary Time, though it's never called out.

Then again, you can get pretty close with just two words: family dysfunction. At times, reading Franzen feels like indulging in Maury Povich for the intellectually inclined. He has also mastered his craft. The Corrections is stock full of hilariously awkward scenes that depict how far removed my generation is from our parents' generation. It follows the trajectories of three very different siblings as they all move east to escape the bland earnestness of the Midwest. Their parents are impressed by money, gaudy weddings, and cruise ships. The children prefer theory, art and argula. The children blush at their parents' consumerism and lack of cultural sophistication. Their parents, in turn, are embarrassed by their children's lack of religion, practicality, or sense of direction in life. At first, each sibling finds success and sophistication in their respective corners of the modern East Coast economy. But they never find satisfaction, and eventually they sabotage their own successes. They flee from the stagnancy of the Midwest, but can't escape the same anxieties that have haunted their parents.In broad strokes, the two generations have sought meaning in fundamentally different ways. Our parents, having grown up in relative material scarcity, found meaning in paychecks, industry, and consumerism. Our generation, surrounded by mass-produced shit that we don't make, seeks meaning through authenticity of experience -- whatever that may mean.Franzen is at his worst during his anti-technology Luddite rants. He has criticized the corrupting effects of social media many times -- most notably in his 6,500 word lament, ""What's Wrong with the Modern World."" But in this novel, it feels forced and out-of place.

By strengthening and defending rights, we can mitigate the negative effects of these large institutions. For all the insane blabber by Glenn Beck about George Soros being a Communist puppet master, the foundation actually has a worldview much aligned with the Republican Party of early 20th century: defend the rights of individuals so that they can seek prosperity and political representation.At Omidyar Network, we never spoke about rights. Within the Omidyar Network worldview, there are no enemies, only opportunities to improve. Technology, according to this worldview, is the fulcrum that creates these new opportunities. To put it in unsophisticated terms, Open Society Foundations seeks to defend individuals from a pessimistic view of the world while Omidyar Network seeks to accelerate and distribute an optimistic view of the world.In general, Silicon Valley is a geography of optimism, but no one takes it to such an extreme as Peter Diamandis, co-founder of Singularity University, founder of the X Prize Foundation, and author of Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think. The book makes three main arguments:   The world today is better off than it ever has been. This is a result of formerly scarce resources becoming abundant and accessible to all thanks to technological innovations.      As a species, we are psychologically primed to exaggerate the negative and ignore the positive.      There are three main forces that are accelerating innovation to improve the lives of everyone, but especially the poor of developing countries.   The book begins by recounting the famous anecdote of a goldsmith who presented a new type of metal to Emperor Tiberius of Rome in 23 AD. The shiny silver metal was so alluring that, rather than reward the goldsmith for his invention, Tiberius ordered his beheading to ensure the new metal wouldn't devalue the empire's massive store of gold. Aluminum remained a rare metal until the middle of the 19th century. We are told that Napoléon III hosted the King of Siam for a banquet ""where the honored guests were given aluminum utensils, while the others had to make do with gold."" Decades of technological innovation from 1825 to 1886 made aluminum cheaper and faster to produce. Today the International Aluminum Institute calls the lightweight material that we use to wrap our leftovers ""almost infinite."" For Diamandis, the anecdote is illustrative of the most important trend of the past 300 years: what begins as rare and only accessible by the rich becomes abundant and accessible to everyone. And, significantly, the timeframe between rare and abundant -- whether it's access to the latest gadgets or an individual's ability to sequence her DNA -- is narrowing with each passing year.[image]One of the book's many examples from Singularity University is Matternet, a start-up that aims to deliver food and medicine to African villagers by drone. More recently, the questionably branded ""Flying Donkey Challenge"" wants to ""pioneer a new transport system of large cargo robots in Africa and beyond.""Diamandis spends a long time arguing with the pessimists. It's a tiring, repetitive portion of the book that could have been summed up in a single paragraph: Our evolution on the African Savanna surrounded by predators primed us to be hypersensitive to any signs of threat. Our brains are structured to focus on the bad. As a result, even if our rational selves acknowledge that life expectancies have tripled in the past few hundred years, we still spend all our time worrying about Y2K or melting ice caps or the threat of China. It's probably a good thing that our brains are wired for alarmism -- if, that is, our alarmism persuades us to lead more sustainable lives. Unfortunately, often times we spend all our attention worrying about the downfall that awaits us without ever changing the behaviors that cause the problems in the first place. Many of today's most influential pundits gain fame by constantly pointing to the latest potential threats without ever offering any suggestions to address them. Diamandis thinks we'd all be better off if we spent less time worrying and more time innovating.That takes us to his third and final argument: three forces are coming together to accelerate innovation in order to improve the lives of the world's poor. The DIY Innovator -- You no longer need to work at Bell Labs or IBM in order to invent new products and bring them to market. Microsoft, Apple, Google and Craig Venter's indie sequencing of the genome are all examples of how individual entrepreneurs have been able to outperform the giants.   The Technophilanthropists -- Modern capitalism has produced extremely wealthy technology entrepreneurs who are increasingly using their money, insight and fame to address the world's greatest problems.   The Rising Billion -- Ever since C.K. Prahalad published The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, an increasing number of entrepreneurs are trying to build products and services designed for the billions of people at the bottom of the financial pyramid.    As an illustration of how old business is rethinking their practices to reach the ""bottom billion,"" one of the most intriguing anecdotes of the book describes how an Indian jeans manufacturer was able to change his approach to reach the rural poor that make up the majority of the country:Arvind saw a golden opportunity forming in the budding domestic market for jeans. Today, the company sells four brands, priced between $7 and $30 a pair. Its best-selling label, Ruf & Tuf, caters to rural India, home to 70 percent of the country's 950 million people. Before Ruf & Tuf was introduced in 1995, most rural Indians had only seen jeans on television.It took some creativity to crack the rural market, where many Indians still prefer custom-tailored clothes. Rather than fight that mindset, Arvind conceived ""ready-to-stitch"" jeans. Ruf & Tuf jeans are sold as a kit: two legs, buttons, rivets, zipper, leather label and an instruction booklet for the neighborhood tailor.I am sufficiently optimistic to get annoyed by the pessimists who are always crying wolf about the next disaster that awaits us. Yet, I am sufficiently pessimistic to get equally annoyed by the uber-optimists that disregard threats to our freedom because they are so focused on the next innovation. As I've written many times before, the automobile probably seemed like a pretty great idea at the time. Diamandis sits squarely in the camp of tunnel vision optimists. He isn't concerned that we could run out of water, but rather that we aren't able to make the systems efficient enough.

Last week I read Man's Search for Meaning and now this week, All Things Shining: Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age. I promise, I'm not having an existential crisis. Last week I was in Seattle's seductive Elliot Bay Books where I stumbled on All Things Shining and was immediately drawn to its opening essay on David Foster Wallace's nihilism as representative of our society's ""gut-level sadness."" On a whim I decided to take it with me. Really, All Things Shining is two books written by two eminent philosophers from two different generations and with two very different writing styles. Sean Dorrance Kelly, the chair of Harvard's philosophy department, tackles the first two introductory chapters on contemporary nihilism and David Foster Wallace. He also writes most of the final two chapters on Melville's Moby Dick and then concludes by returning to David Foster Wallace. Hubert Dreyfus, a widely respected philosopher of existentialism and artificial intelligence who was Kelly's teacher and mentor at UC Berkeley, tackles the middle chapters on the philosophical implications of the Western classics. Kelly is a clear, engaging writer and should publish his own work of non-fiction for a general audience. Dreyfus belongs to an older generation of academics. He struggles to connect with his audience in a way that transcends lecturing behind the podium. Too often the middle of the book feels like sitting through a boring secular sermon. Much like Jared Diamond's The World Until Yesterday, which explores what contemporary Western civilization can learn from traditional societies, All Things Shining looks back to the classics to explore how we can address the ""indecision and sadness"" that characterize contemporary life. Unlike past generations, whose lives, beliefs and identities were defined by religion, ideology and hierarchy (a firm sense of one's place in the world), today we suffer the ""burden of choice."" Even those who are avidly religious must make choices that did not burden their ancestors. Most Christians in the US today must choose whether they support gay marriage, whereas their grandparents simply assumed that to be gay was to sin because the bible says so. Similarly, we are inclined to reflect on our every behavior through the lens of psychology and cognitive biases, whereas our grandparents could behave with the freedom of not questioning the why behind each action.This burden of choice wears us down. Unlike our ancestors, we must choose our beliefs, our identity, our work, our ethical justifications. We are each responsible for developing our own toolkit to lead our lives and evaluate the lives of others. The hit HBO show Girls can be interpreted as a struggle to find meaning in a modern New York City that offers no guidance as to how we should make decisions. The protagonists address meaninglessness with a combination of sarcasm, sadness, and sex. ""What's sacred is whatever you’re not allowed to laugh at in a given culture,"" write Dreyfus and Kelly paraphrasing Nietzsche. There is an aspect of meta-hilarity to see Kelly tell this to Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report, the show that is perhaps most representative of our culture's inability to treat anything as sacred.Ultimately the authors and David Foster Wallace find contemporary sacredness in sports, citing Foster Wallace's New York Times Magazine essay on ""Federer as Religious Experience."" Colbert pokes fun: ""We're trading in Jesus for football? But Kelly responds with a straight face that sports is one of the few common domains that the majority of society treats as sacred. It allows us to get lost in the ecstasy of the crowd at the enjoyment of superhuman performance, whether it's Roger Federer's tennis, Michael Jordan's pull away jumpshot or Lou Gherig's unbelievable perseverance.   [image]""Getting lost in the excitement of the crowd"" is one of the authors' prescriptions to reclaim meaning, though they are cognizant that the fervor of the crowd can also lead to mob violence and conformity. We must first develop a strong ethical backbone to distinguish between a crowd calling for vigilante justice and a crowd experiencing the thrill of collective rhapsody. For too many of us, our knee-jerk reaction is to either always join the crowd or never join the crowd. The most challenging suggestion by the authors is to craft an image of who we would like to one day become in order to develop the craftsmanship necessary to dedicate our lives to becoming that person. We can appreciate the freedom of choice while still basing our decisions on a framework that guides us to become our better selves. With a clear idea of who we are and who we aspire to become, the authors argue, we can cultivate the same awareness in life that Bill Bradley exhibited on the basketball court. At our best, we are never frozen by indecision and yet we are always aware of the why behind each decision we make....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 13, 2014","Mar 14, 2014","Mar 13, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10087892-all-things-shining

Freud insisted that our dissatisfaction derives from our failure to achieve the pleasure we seek — especially sexual pleasure. Alfred Adler argued that our dissatisfaction is rooted in our failure to achieve power, and that we act out to compensate for our feelings of powerlessness. Viktor Frankl, the author of Man's Search for Meaning, asserted that it is man's failure to give meaning to his life that causes his discontent. Pleasure, power, meaning. Of course, we desire all three. And the fact that we so often fall short surely leads to all sorts of subconscious behaviors.In his introduction, Frankl explains his focus on meaning to build on the work of Freud and Adler. It starts with his experience in concentration camps during the Holocaust where the inmates had neither pleasure nor power but were frequently able to maintain the will to live by focusing on the meaning(s) of their lives. For Frankl, there is no one meaning to life. Rather, we each have multiple meanings. They are those capacities to which we are uniquely suited: raising our children, writing a novel, constructing a house, some scientific research. We give our lives meaning by excelling at that which makes us unique.Man's Search for Meaning is not your typical psychological text book. The first half recounts Frankl's experience in various concentration camps during WWII. The story itself is fascinating — especially Frankl's animosity toward fellow Jews that became camp guards (so-called ""capos"") and his empathy toward various Nazi SS officers, including one of the camp's main directors who used his own money to buy medicine for the prisoners. But what makes the story enlightening as well as engaging is Frankl's focus on the psychological behavior of his fellow inmates as death becomes imminent and suffering is drawn out. Most prisoners succumbed to total apathy, even those who were outwardly strong and healthy. Those who were able to retreat to an inner intellectual life fared the best. They managed to find meaning in their unfortunate circumstance.""You can take away everything from a man except his attitude and ability to make decisions,"" writes Frankl. Even when everything else is stripped away, we can still maintain dignity by staying true to who we are — by forever striving to be our best selves. Frankl's philosophy, based on Kierkegaard's ""will to meaning,"" is illustrated in this short clip from The Hunger Games.Given that we won't be participating in the Hunger Games and, fingers crossed, none of us will ever experience a concentration camp, how do we apply Frankl's philosophy of ""suffering with dignity"" to our contemporary lives? We are all expected to act with subservience in some situations. Frankl doesn't rule out subservience; indeed, he emphasizes that on several accounts it saved his life. But he insists that we must be subservient with dignity, always remaining true to our own identity, ethics and beliefs.I've always found that pleasure and power are easier to attain than meaning, but that's not to discount their importance. I agree with Adler; I don't think we can truly experience pleasure if we're constantly compensating for our feelings of powerlessness. And I love pleasure. I love turning off my mind and giving myself to the flow of basketball, a sweaty club at three in the morning, rock climbing, or some other ecstasy-inducing activity. But the lack of meaning in life is the malady that pursues me most relentlessly. I find Frankl's philosophy to be both helpful and inspiring. As I grow older I am learning to address feelings of powerlessness with dignity and quiet confidence instead of my twenty-something standard rebellion, sarcasm and anger. What I find missing in Frankl's philosophy is how we come to identify ""those capacities to which we are uniquely suited"" in the first place. Nor am I truly convinced of our individual uniqueness in the first place, at least not to the extent assumed by Frankl. He insists that we are not products of our environment or genes, but rather active agents that form our individual decisions, opinions, and attitudes. Most social science research over the past thirty years, however, reveals that we are more the products of our environments and social networks than we had ever imagined.

Frankly, it’s not well written. However, if youI wouldn’t recommend this book unless you are fully invested in learning more about Seattle’s history. Frankly, it’s not well written. However, if you do come to the book with ample curiosity about Seattle’s boom and bust history from its timber beginnings to post-Boeing period in the 1970s when it truly became its own metropolis, then Seattle Past to Present is worth the long slog. (Though, honestly, the Wikipedia page on Seattle's history is almost as thorough and certainly more efficient.)As I mentioned in my  of Niall Ferguson's Civilization, I appreciate big history told through the lens of big arguments. And Roger Sale, a literary critic and former professor at the University of Washington, isn't shy in expressing his opinions or criticizing the interpretations of other historians of Seattle's rise. As a native of Seattle (albeit my family and I moved when I was only five) and as a future resident in just ten days, Seattle's history helped me better understand its present condition. Seattle had plenty of opportunities to decline and even disintegrate: over-exploitation of timber, the bust of the Klondike Gold Rush, the Great Depression, and the Boeing bust during the 1970s. But every period of bust has shortly been followed by yet another boom period, which attracts newcomers, diversifies the economy, and ultimately creates a more cosmopolitan city.Seattle began as a timber economy, transitioned smoothly to the manufacturing economy when Boeing became the world's airplane maker, and then transitioned relatively smoothly yet again to technology, retail and service with the rise of Microsoft, Amazon Starbucks, REI and Nordstroms. The timber and manufacturing economies firmly established Seattle as a middle class city, which is only now being threatened by the young millionaires of the Internet economy. Still, there are few rich or poor neighborhoods in Seattle — and there are many neighborhoods where expensive and cheap homes stand side by side. As Sale rights, it has always been a city where the baker, banker and professor are immediate neighbors. While Sale is clearly a proud resident of Seattle, he isn't afraid to take the gloves off and deal critical blows, especially in how the city has dealt (or continually refused to deal) with ethnic integration. First it forcibly kicked out the Chinese in the 1890s. Then its white residents cooly looked on while their Japanese residents were rounded up during WWII and taken to internment camps. Seattle's Black population, which grew considerably during Boeing's WWII expansion, was always isolated from the rest of the city, ultimately leading to ethnic tension in the late 60s. Seattle continues to be a segregated city with good intentions and little evidence of successful integration. Sale also documents the many visionary civil engineers and urban planners that have been calling for effective public transit for the Seattle metropolitan area since the 1950s. They warned of the traffic and chaos that would result if the middle class city continued to expand and every family owned a car. Unfortunately, Seattle's residents routinely voted against public transit in favor of more freeways and bridges. They wanted their cars and suburbs, and as a result Seattle followed the urban planning model of Los Angeles more than New York or San Francisco. Finally, after decades of attempts, Seattle has established a light rail system that will have decent coverage by 2020. I always find that history is the best way to learn about the present. During the westward expansion of the United States in the 1850s, Sale observes, single men headed to San Francisco to make their fortune in the Gold Rush while families settled to Portland and Seattle to construct their homesteads and become self-sufficient. I think there is an argument to make that the greedy ambition of Silicon Valley today and the rugged self-sufficiency of the Pacific Northwest were established in their first decades. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 22, 2014","Mar 09, 2014","Feb 22, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1525898.Seattle

By 2Trained to cope with scarcity, we have struggled with abundance.James WallmanIn 1991, the average American bought 34 items of clothing each year. By 2007, they were buying 67 items every year. It means Americans buy a new piece of clothing every four to five days.James WallmanMinimalism is not defined by what is not there but by the rightness of what is and the richness of what is experienced.John PawsonI often think that there are two macro-trends that have shaped the contours of my life: globalization and the rise of the Internet. Without those two sweeping trends I wouldn't have the same job, friends, fiancee, lifestyle, intellectual interests. The life I live today simply wasn't possible 20 years ago. Of course, that is true for us all. But in my case I think the difference is amplified.James Wallman's book, Stuffocation, has convinced me that there is a third macro trend that has also defined much of my life, but with more subtlety than globalization or the Internet — and that is post-materialism. Like most of my generation, I grew up surrounded by shit. As my family climbed the household income ladder from lower-middle class to middle class to upper-middle class, we collected more and more material objects that no one wanted and no one used. There were bags of clothes from discount stores like TJ Maxx, cheap electronics that were thrown out after a couple months, dollar books from Barnes and Noble that nobody read.It led to a personal rebellion against stuff that, for me, is encapsulated in a single memory from college when I was working in a San Diego coffee shop. It was early 2003, I was just about to graduate from college, and I have a vivid memory of a twentysomething sitting at a table with his 12-inch PowerBook G4, a Canon EOS digital camera, and his latte. The laptop, camera and lens cost more than $3,500 — about three months of work for me at the time. There was no way I could afford it, but I vividly remember thinking that I wouldn't spend my money on anything else until I was able to purchase a good laptop and digital camera. I didn't want any other objects in my life. I only wanted to live as many experiences as possible and then document them through my writing and photography.Indeed, that is more or less what I did from 2003 until around 2010. All of my belongings fit into a single suitcase. Two pairs of pants, four or five shirts, one pair of shoes and one pair of running shoes. I had achieved the ideal of post-materialism. My life was based on experiences and social connections, not material objects.  [image]Wallman's book is part prophecy and part preaching. Not only does he think we will increasingly trade in 20th century materialism for 21st century ""experiatialism;"" he argues (with admittedly scant evidence) that we'll be happier as a result. The book introduced me to an online community and genre of blogs I had never heard of: the new minimalists. Just as active as other niche corners of the internet, like the GTD productivity freaks, you can find these new minimalists on blogs like Becoming Minimalist, Slow Your Home, Zen Habits, Unclutter, and, sure enough, The Minimalists. Once I started to dig deeper I also found, inevitably, a New York Times Sunday Review op-ed by Treehugger.com founder Graham Hill on minimalism. Of course, there was also a Slate.com critique calling Hill's essay elitist. There is perhaps irony that there is so much online noise about minimalism, but for Wallman, it's also evidence of a sea change in social norms. Instead of showing off their latest shiny gadgets, these new minimalists are competing with one another to see who can own less.  [image]Wallman is sympathetic to the biological and structural obstacles that stand in the way of our aspiration toward minimalism. ""The idea that we are making decisions in an age of abundance using mental tools honed in an age of scarcity might seem obvious,"" he admits, but it is our greatest psychological hurdle to resisting the temptation to consume and hoard. Even if we are able to transcend our inherent biological impulses, our capitalist system depends on consumerism. For Wallman:Materialism, and the consumer culture and capitalist system it underpinned, was the right idea for the right time. It meant that the masses, for the first time in human history, lived in abundance rather than scarcity. It gave us washing machines, TVs, and indoor toilets. It delivered clean water, the welfare state, and health care that has improved the length and quality of our lives.Indeed, the consumerist society is one of Niall Ferguson's six factors to explain ""the rise of the West."" Notes Wallman: ""In the sixty years since the Civil War’s end, the population had increased by a factor of three, from 35 to 114 million. Over the same period, output had risen between twelve and fourteen times.""The culmination of 150 years of mass-manufacturing is portrayed in the 2007 viral online video, The Story of Stuff:Even more poignant is the Life at Home in the 21st Century, a 2001 - 2005 study by UCLA's Center on the Everyday Lives of Families to understand how 32 middle-class families handle ""material culture."" Clutter led to spikes in stress hormones, lower productivity, conflicts between spouses and their children. Yet, despite the clear connection between stuff and stress, the families continued their weekend trips to bulk stores to buy more than they could ever consume.Wallman finds some evidence that finally we have reached peak consumption in rich countries:We may have reached the apex of our (over)consumption on clothes as well. After decades of going up, perhaps we have reached “peak clothes”. In 2007, the average American bought almost twice as many items of clothing each year compared to 1991. But by 2012, the number they were buying had stopped rising, and had even fallen slightly, from 67 to 64 items.With the rise of the ""sharing economy"" today's youth are growing up subscribed to Netflix, Spotify, and Zipcar rather than purchasing DVDs, CDs and a new car. Social media incentivize us to show off our experiences much more than our latest shopping spree. For Wallman, this all points to a new, burgeoning ""experience economy"" epitomized by projects like Secret Cinema and Sofar Sounds. I came away from Stuffocation a convert. I've made various changes in my own life to aspire to greater minimalism, and to prioritize experiences over material objects. But I was left with a couple questions that were also raised at Wallman's lecture at the Royal Society of Arts. Stuffocation points to community events and performance art as examples of the ""new experience economy,"" but it seems like a more realistic scenario is comprised of video games and virtual reality. One member of the RSA audience mentioned that he invited his son on a rafting trip down the Zambezi River. ""That's OK dad; I can just watch videos on YouTube,"" was his son's response. My other doubt is whether the experience economy can replace all those jobs being left behind by the decline of the manufacturing economy. Wallman addresses this concern by citing similar alarmist concerns by the Luddites at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Sure, the textile artisans lost their jobs. But the Industrial Revolution ended up creating more middle class jobs than could ever be imagined at the time. Surely the future will also reward certain types of workers, but it takes a leap of faith to imagine an experience economy job market as vibrant as that of the manufacturing economy....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 11, 2014","Feb 17, 2014","Feb 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18865910-stuffocation

Indeed, for anyone under 40 who lives in the hip Roma-Condesa part of Mexico City (and especially for foreigners), Pacheco's slim novella should be mandatory reading. Sadly, it was José Emilio Pacheco's death a couple weeks ago that finally convinced me to give it a read. Set in 1948, though published in 1981, the plot follows a typical literary trope: young, precocious kid falls in love with his friend's mom and is then ostracized by his friends and family who think he's too young to experience love and that he's been corrupted by a depraved woman & increasingly amoral society. But, much like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince, it's not the plot that draws you into the narrator's charm so much as his innocent, honest way of seeing the world around him. The novella is infused with nostalgia for a Mexico City that was just beginning to take shape as migrants from around the country (the narrator's family is from Jalisco) moved to Mexico City to work in industrial factories, which one-by-one were acquired by multi-national corporations. This is one of those books that I turned the last page with regret, not wanting to the story to end, not wanting to leave the character behind.

Aira complicates the relationship — showing the mutual distrust and dependence between the classes, what often seem like different worlds. Clearly, Aira spent a considerable amount of time in the city's slums to describe the complex calculus of how they are governed. There's another project, less literary and less abstract, that aims to integrate Buenos Aires' informal communities into the larger metropolis — and that's Wingu's Ciudad Integrada, one of the grantee projects of the Civic Innovation Accelerator Fund.

Wherever You Go, There You Are is divided into three parts: 1) why meditate, 2) how to meditate, 3) how make mindfulness part of your life. Each section is further divided into chapters between two to five pages. Each of those chapters reads quickly, though leaves you with plenty to reflect on. This is a book I can imagine myself coming back to in future years. Among my highlights:By lost, I mean that we momentarily lose touch with ourselves and with the full extent of our possibilities. Instead, we fall into a robotlike way of seeing and thinking and doing. In those moments, we break contact with what is deepest in ourselves and affords us perhaps our greatest opportunities for creativity, learning, and growing. If we are not careful, those clouded moments can stretch out and become most of our lives.The habit of ignoring our present moments in favor of others yet to come leads directly to a pervasive lack of awareness of the web of life in which we are embedded.If you did die, all your responsibilities and obligations would immediately evaporate. Their residue would somehow get worked out without you. No one else can take over your unique agenda. It would die or peter out with you just as it has for everyone else who has ever died. So you don’t need to worry about it in any absolute way.The spirit of mindfulness is to practice for its own sake, and just to take each moment as it comes—pleasant or unpleasant, good, bad, or ugly—and then work with that because it is what is present now. With this attitude, life itself becomes practice....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 21, 2014","Feb 03, 2014","Jan 21, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14096.Wherever_You_Go_There_You_Are

Those unfair expectations were met throughout the first half of the book, but the second half was a slow let-downThe strength of the book's beginning lies in its juxtaposition between two scenes that unravel with cinematic allure. First we meet James More, a British spy posing as a water engineer who has been taken hostage by members of Al Qaeda in southern Somalia near the border with Kenya. Next we are introduced to Danielle (Danny) Flinders, a biomathematician searching for life where the ocean meets the magna core of Earth. The first half of the book alternates, page by page, between More's captivity in a dark shack just meters from the Somalian coast and his budding romance with Danny at Hotel Atlantic, a fictive manor resort on the French Atlantic coast with an attention to detail modeled on César Ritz's famous Parisian hotel. Both scenes are described with a kind of observation that would require most writers to use LSD. Ledgard's description of the Hotel Atlantic convinced me that it would be worth blowing two month's salary to experience its comforts for a week.Beyond the beautiful descriptions of southern Somalia and France's Atlantic coast, this is a novel about time and exploration, two themes that have always been dear to my heart and identity. They had different understandings of time and space. He worked on the surface, the outside of the world. For him, everything was in flux. He was tasking agents to infiltrate mosques in Somalia and along the Swahili coast. He was concerned with alleys, beliefs, incendiary devices; with months, weeks, days, with indelible hours. For her, an age was an instant. She was interested in the base of the corrosive saltwater column, delimiting through mathematics the other living world, which has existed in darkness and in continental dimensions for hundreds of millions of years.Both James and Danny are explorers, but James measures his work in moments whereas Danny hopes that a lifetime of her work will contribute something to the last five centuries of science.Submergence was published in the UK in 2011, but Ledgard wasn't able to find a US publisher until the indie Coffee House Press signed on last year. Since 1995, Ledgard has covered East Africa for The Economist. His journalistic curiosity for context and trivia shows throughout the novel. But so too does his own dual identity as journalist and novelist: the journalist rushing to make the weekly print deadline and the novelist taking his sweet time to make something lasting that stands on the shoulders of his literary influences. The beauty and originality of the first half of the novel slowly gives way to repetition and lack of direction. By the time I had reached the last page, it felt like I was finishing a soured dessert after an exquisite dinner. [image]Also, I was left slightly unsettled by the portrayal of Somalia and the Somalians throughout the book. Teju Cole, one of the book's greatest promoters, once wrote the following in a completely different context:One song we hear too often is the one in which Africa serves as a backdrop for white fantasies of conquest and heroism.There are passages from Submergence such as this one:That is why Somalia serves as a trapdoor for Saudi Arabia. Young Saudis are sent there to lay low and to learn how to fight. They are marginal characters— on the run from themselves as well as from the police— withdrawn, stammering, younger brothers, with unresolved inner conflicts, most of them sexual.While I mostly agree with Schulz that Ledgard "" neither dehumanizes nor excuses"" his captors, I wonder what a Somali writer such as Nuruddin Farah thinks about Ledgard's portrayal of his country and countrymen....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Jan 2014,"Jan 09, 2014","Jan 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16057147-submergence

I can't stop thinking about them. It all started a few months ago when I joined a delegation of mayors and their staff to a site visitHidden cameras. I can't stop thinking about them. It all started a few months ago when I joined a delegation of mayors and their staff to a site visit of New York Police Department's Real Time Crime Center. We were told of the center's ability to tap into any of the police department's 3,000 streaming cameras at a moment's notice. They can go back in time, pinpointing the exact moment an alleged crime took place and extracting images of the perpetrators face. If only the side profile of the face is available, they use software to instantly construct a model of the individual's face as if (s)he were staring straight into the camera. Next, they take the reconstructed image and perform a facial recognition search that pulls on their own database of photos in addition to publicly available photos on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. If a match -- or a number of matches -- is made, then the center uses its social relationship mapping software to determine if there is a probable link between the person who committed the crime and the individual identified in the photograph. [image]NYPD's Real Time Crime Center""None of this is treated as evidence of a crime,"" we are assured. ""Rather we're just trying to uncover information that can assist our officers in their investigation."" The presentation walked us through two cases where the above steps were used to apprehend a criminal. I can't say I was really surprised.What did surprise me, what really blew my mind, was the off-handed mention that, in addition to NYPD's own 3,000 cameras, they also had access to 23,000 streaming cameras placed in residential buildings by the private security firm, SecureWatch24. I immediately searched for the company and its relationship with NYPD, but nothing had been published. Shortly after this comment was made, a tall woman introducing herself as the Real Time Crime Center's counsel entered the room and took all questions related NYPD's access to SecureWatch24's 23,000 cameras. She said that all the cameras had signs declaring that footage could be made available to the NYPD, though no one in our delegation had ever seen such a sign. She also said that the police department only requested access when a crime was reported, though she wouldn't offer any details about oversight mechanisms in place to protect New Yorkers' civil liberties. I mentioned NYPD's access to SecureWatch24's 23,000 cameras on Twitter. It attracted more retweets and responses than anything else I've tweeted. Most of the responses criticized the increasing surveillance in New York City, but more than a handful replied that they'd be grateful for the NYPD's access to the footage if they were a victim of a crime. Carlton Purvis, an investigative reporter at MuckRock News filed an FOI request for access to the agreement between NYPD and SecureWatch24, but it was denied within three days. Revenge Porn The next morning I was walking through Chelsea Market with an elevated awareness of the almost-hidden cameras placed throughout the building. They were accompanied by no signs, no disclosure. Where did all those live feeds go? Who had access to them? Why were they watching?I recalled discovering one afternoon in my office that I could view dozens of real-time cameras in smog inspection centers across Mexico. Allegedly the presence of the cameras would discourage employees from demanding bribes for smog check certificates, a practice common throughout the country. I spent the next 15 minutes watching the inspectors walk around, do their work and scratch themselves before I got back to work.I had come to Chelsea Market to grab a cup of coffee and read the New York Times before my meeting at Google's massive building across the street. The day's paper reported on the rise of revenge porn in which individuals post naked, erotic photos of their exes in order to exact some revenge. Once those photos are posted online, the victim's identity is forever associated with the photographs. Holly Jacobs, founder of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, changed her name after her ex-boyfriend posted intimate photos of her online. Soon enough, though, the same photos were linked to her new name. Once facial recognition search engines like pictrieve and Viewdle become more pervasive, it will become all but impossible to disassociate your identify with a photograph -- past or present -- that is posted online. Think about that. Any photo of you ever taken, if made available online, can be forever associated with your name when anyone searches for it. This includes photographs of you that you don't even know exist. Consider this one, taken by a roaming Google Street View car:[image]I walked across the street to Google's New York office building, which they purchased in 2010 for some $1.9 billion. Google Maps didn't just point me to the front door; I knew the layout of the entire fourth floor where I had my meeting. Google says they are mapping the insides of buildings so that users can find the fastest path from kitchen gadgets to living room accessories at Ikea. But already companies like Nordstroms are using wi-fi routers to triangulate the phones of their customers to track where they spend the most time inside their stores. [image]The fourth floor of Google's New York building, as seen from my iPhoneI got off the elevator on the fourth floor and all appeared as was expected. It doesn't seem improbable that within a couple years we will be able to click on a camera icon to see live streaming video of every room that appears on the map. In fact, we already have a map of live web cams along the eastern seaboard. And my good friend Felipe Heusser is working with Jeff Warren to develop Peepol.tv, which aims to make all streaming video (U-Stream, Tweet-Caster, YouTube Live) more accessible. SeeChange A few days later I was reading Dave Eggers' latest book, The Circle, while on a flight to Rio de Janeiro to attend the Global Investigative Journalism Conference. Joe Nocera, writing in the New York Times, is spot on: The Circle will become -- or should become -- the 1984 of our generation. The book describes a dystopian future in which an Internet monopoly -- modeled on Google after it has acquired Facebook and Twitter -- controls our every digital action. The company's latest innovation, SeeChange, is a streaming webcam the size of a lollipop that is always on, always connected to the Internet, and forever archived. Of course this already exists today with the Narrative Clip, and will become pervasive with Google Glass. But back to ""fiction."" Here's how one of the company's co-founders in The Circle pitches the product to an audience of fawning fans (not unlike Steve Jobs' launching of new Apple products):Folks, we’re at the dawn of the Second Enlightenment ... I’m talking about an era where we don’t allow the majority of human thought and action and achievement and learning to escape as if from a leaky bucket. We did that once before. It was called the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages. If not for the monks, everything the world had ever learned would have been lost. Well, we live in a similar time, when we’re losing the vast majority of what we do and see and learn. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Not with these cameras, and not with the mission of the Circle.Soon all politicians are convinced to wear the SeeChange cameras to lifestream every hour of every day. Those politicians who refuse to wear SeeChange (to ""go transparent"" as it becomes known) are assumed to be hiding secrets. Eggers views a world of live streaming politicians as dystopian, but others like IFTF's David Evan Harris have proposed similar scenarios as a way to fix our broken democracy:[image]The SeeChange cameras, of course, are not unlike Google Glass, which is expected to be made available to the general public next year. [image] Surveillance Cameras and Undercover Journalism I landed in Rio de Janeiro where IBM has built its first Urban Operations Center with access to an unknown number of live surveillance cameras placed throughout the city. Activists have repeatedly used Brazil's new freedom of information law to access the contract between IBM and the government of Rio de Janeiro, but their requests have been denied. It is not known whether IBM also has access to the surveillance cameras.[image]In Rio de Janeiro, I was also reminded of the upside of hidden cameras. At the Global Investigative Journalism I attended a panel on undercover journalism, which included an intriguing presentation by Brazilian undercover reporter Eduardo Faustini who posed as a procurement official in a public hospital for three months in order to record evidence of fraud by corporate suppliers to the hospital. There are hundreds of other undercover investigations that have led to public outcry and, at times, real accountability. Many are listed on NYU's comprehensive database of ""Deception for Journalism's Sake."" Another example of hidden camera surveillance for a good cause is Meu Rio's campaign to save the Friedenreich school from demolition to make room for Rio de Janeiro's Olympic facilities. The group of young activists set up a streaming web cam across the street from the school and depended on its network of volunteers to watch the live feed to ensure that the school wasn't demolished when ""no one was watching.""Several friends have told me that they feel safer walking in neighborhoods with CCTV police cameras. The New York Police Department found a 36% drop in crime in public housing projects with CCTV cameras compared to those without. From Rodney King to Cairo, citizens have used their cell phone cameras to document police brutality and official corruption across the world, as I documented in my essay on ""The New Omnipresence.""  Accountability and Freedom So why should we care about our privacy from the increasingly pervasive semi-public cameras that stream and record our movements everyday? Because ""privacy is a means to democracy, not an end in itself,"" as Evgeny Morozov has observed, citing Spiros Simitis.... Privacy is not an end in itself. It’s a means of achieving a certain ideal of democratic politics, where citizens are trusted to be more than just self-contented suppliers of information to all-seeing and all-optimizing technocrats. “Where privacy is dismantled,” warned Simitis, “both the chance for personal assessment of the political process and the opportunity to develop and maintain a particular style of life fade.”When we are constantly recorded, we begin to act differently. Pull out a video camera at any social gathering and all authenticity fades away. This is precisely what happens to Mae, the protagonist of the Dave Eggers novel, The Circle, when she begins to livestream her every moment to thousands of online followers who provide continuous online commentary about her life. A letter from her ex-boyfriend — who is increasingly critical of Mae and her employer — affords Eggers the opportunity to editorialize:It’s one thing to want to measure yourself, Mae— you and your bracelets. I can accept you and yours tracking your own movements, recording everything you do, collecting data on yourself in the interest of  …   Well, whatever it is you’re trying to do. But it’s not enough, is it? You don’t want just your data, you need mine. You’re not complete without it. It’s a sickness.I expect this is some second great schism, where two humanities will live, apart but parallel. There will be those who live under the surveillance dome you’re helping to create, and those who live, or try to live, apart from it.I doubt that we're on the cusp of a great schism between the surveilled and those that forsake the convenience of networked technologies in the pursuit of freedom. I do, however, agree with Richard Stallman that we need to define "" the maximum tolerable level of surveillance, beyond which a government becomes oppressive."" Stallman, who concedes that ""some surveillance is necessary,"" prescribes a mix of technology and policy fixes to protect democracy from surveillance. They are all worthy of consideration.It took Americans 40 years following the Civil War to understand that industrial monopolies were a threat to democracy. It then took them another twenty years to pass legislation during the Progressive Era to protect democracy from corporate lobbying and abusive monopolies. We are only now beginning to understand how surveillance threatens democracy. The road to reform will be long and arduous....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 27, 2013","Dec 22, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18302455-the-circle

The book, written during the aftermath of the urban race riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in the summer of 1968, examines how the residents of cities form their identities amid so much chaos and and diversity. The book was also written at the beginning of what journalist Bill Bishop has termed ""The Big Sort,"" when urban centers of the US became increasingly diverse and White middle class families fled that diversity by moving to the suburbs. But even while post-war, middle class families fled to the suburbs, the Beats and flower children of the 1960s were already giving up on the dream of rural, communal living and turning their attention to the city. ""For they have sensed in dense city life some possibility of fraternity, some new kind of warmth, that is now understood in the vague term 'community.'""The 1960s is usually remembered for the Civil Rights movement, the anti-war protests, student mobilizations, and the countercultural moment. But we focus less of our attention on the incredible economic growth during the 1950s and 60s that led to a larger middle class and more affluence than any other country had ever achieved. Few intellectuals of the time, including Sennett, predicted what Timothy Noah has called ""The Great Divergence;"" that the US middle class would once again begin to contract in 1973 after decades of sustained growth. Rather, the intellectuals of the day assumed that we were moving from a society of scarcity to a society of abundance. And so Sennett asks this central question: ""What does one do with community life when freedom from what has been achieved?"" Sennett paints two archetypical paths that the American middle class took at the end of the 1960s to achieve community life and individual identity: the suburbs and the cities. The suburbs offered their residents predictability, order, homogeneity, a sense of control over one's life. ""Live with people you like,"" read a billboard I recently passed on the outskirts of Guadalajara. Cities, on the other hand, offered their residents little predictability, order, homogeneity, or control. To enter a suburb is to enter a comfortable house party with your closest friends, your favorite music, the kids playing in the pool, everything under control. It's easy to understand why this was a compelling vision of the good life for returning soldiers from World War II. But Sennett is unapologetic in his celebration of the chaotic city over the orderly suburb:This kind of family living in the suburbs surely is a little strange. Isn't this preference for suburbia as a setting for family life in reality an admission, tacit and unspoken to be sure, that the parents do not feel confident of their own human strengths to guide the child in the midst of an environment richer and more difficult than that of the neat lawns and tidy supermarkets of the suburbs?And then: ""Suburbanites are people who are afraid to live in a world they cannot control.""Sennett is compelling in his celebration of chaos and the city life. Foreshadowing his later book Together: The Rituals, Pleasures, and Politics of Cooperation (written some 40 years later), he notes that city life forces us to develop the social aptitude to negotiate uncomfortable situations, to make them comfortable. Ultimately, the city makes us more mature. He laments the mid-century relocation of ""gambling dens and whorehouses from the city centers to the peripheries, and ultimately to Las Vegas. He prefers a world that recognizes, rather than outsources, its vice and depravity. Today our vices are outsources even further, to online gambling and porn sites, always accessible, but never real.Cities offer us a path to the greatest reaches of social maturity. We form communities that aren't fixed or homogeneous, but rather that constantly shift, teetering on chaos and serendipity. We must become strong, and confident in ourselves, to engage in such diversity and dynamism. I read this book in October, just after I read Anthony Townsend's Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia. The smart city is our new impulse to bring order and control to the chaos of the urban landscape.

Like Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel and Robinson and Acemoglu's Why Nation's Fail, Niall Ferguson stretches over centuries of history to argue his version of how the modern world was made. Specifically, he argues that the rise of the West over the past 500 years can be explained by six unique factors: 	 Competition – a decentralization of both political and economic life, which created the launch-pad for both nation-states and capitalism. 	 Science – a way of studying, understanding and ultimately changing the natural world, which gave the West (among other things) a major military advantage over ""the Rest."" 	 Property rights – the rule of law as a means of protecting private owners and peacefully resolving disputes between them, which formed the basis for the most stable form of representative government. 	 Medicine – a branch of science that allowed a major improvement in health and life expectancy, beginning in Western societies, but also in their colonies. 	 The consumer society – a mode of material living in which the production and purchase of clothing and other consumer goods play a central economic role, and without which the Industrial Revolution would have been unsustainable. 	 The work ethic – a moral framework and mode of activity derivable from (among other sources) Protestant Christianity, which provides the glue for the dynamic and potentially unstable society created by apps 1 to 5.  There is something unsettling about Ferguson, the chauvinistic apologist of European colonialism who married Africa's greatest critic of Islam. While he echoes many of the same arguments made in Why Nations Fail, such as the difference in property rights between North and Latin America, he makes no effort to counter Robinson and Acemoglu's thoroughly researched argument that European colonialism was the prime cause of ""extractive institutions"" throughout the developing world. Nor does he take into consideration Jared Diamond's compelling arguments that natural factors, such as Europe's fertile soil and disease immunity, gave the region a head start toward industrialization and modernity. Nor, for that matter, does he adequately counter Samuel Huntington's ""Great Divergence,"" which argues that the West emerged as the clear global leader only in the 19th century (for Ferguson the divergence began back in the 16th century with the proliferation of the printing press and the reformation).Ferguson is far from an objective historian. He doesn't just make an argument as to why the West has been the dominant global force over the past 500 years; he also makes an impassioned plea to continue studying Western Civilization at a time when many scholars argue convincingly that academia should reach past the hegemony of Eurocentrism. He is concerned that Western Civilization doesn't have a foundational text in the same sense that Islamic Civilization (""the cult of submission,"" he claims) has the Koran, Hindu Civilization has the Vedas, and Chinese Civilization has the teachings of Confucius. He criticizes academics who claim that ""imperialism is the root cause of nearly every modern problem."" Indeed, he dedicates a not-minor portion of the book to celebrate the positive aspects of imperialism, insisting that the ""Western package still seems to offer human societies the best available set of economic, social and political institutions – the ones most likely to unleash the individual human creativity capable of solving the problems the twenty-first century world faces.""The second half of the book feels as if it were rushed to meet a deadline. Both the writing and the argumentation become sloppy. He goes off on historical tangents that have little to do with the alleged argument of the chapter. It's as if he had a burning desire to share his thoughts on Napoleon with his readers, but didn't know where to fit it in. Still, the book is an enjoyable and accessible compilation of big history stretching across centuries and continents. And it's filled with fascinating trivia tidbits.It's a strange sensation to read a persuasive book by an author who you want to punch in the face. (Last year he suggested that John Maynard Keynes was not able to imagine the future because he was gay.) And yet there is something compelling about both his arguments and his form of argumentation. As William Skidelsky wrote in his :Ferguson's self-confidence – which, if it wasn't accompanied by considerable charm, might be downright insufferable – is no doubt partly a matter of temperament. But it also has something to do with the kind of historian he is. His approach to the past is overwhelmingly materialistic. Questions of right and wrong, or indeed of personality and psychology, don't appear to preoccupy him greatly. What gets him going is hard data, facts and figures – the stuff, in other words, that is most measurable (and, by extension, provable).His arrogance is appalling, but his method is appealing. Despite the many flaws that Pankaj Mishra points out in his  of Civilization, I will probably continue to read Ferguson books in the future, always with the temptation to punch him in the face....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 26, 2013","Dec 20, 2013","Nov 26, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10475421-civilization

Of course, every capitalist society needs some inequality to serve as an incentive to acquire new skills and take entrepreneurial risks that could lead to an innovative new company. The question is: What's the right amount of inequality?This question has been coming up at least once a week among my friends, and I am no longer able to participate without citing Doris Kearns Goodwin's 900+ page history of the Progressive Era, The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism. “There are but a handful of times in the history of our country,” writes Goodwin in the book's introduction, “when there occurs a transformation so remarkable that a molt seems to take place, and an altered country begins to emerge.” A disciplined historian, that is as close as Goodwin gets to explicitly suggesting a parallel between the Progressive Era's dismantling of the excesses of the Gilded Age and our own struggle to address today's startling inequality in which 85 individuals possess as much wealth as one half of the world's population.  [image]""The Bully Pulpit” is built around two relationships,"" writes Bill Keller in his NYT , ""one between Roosevelt and Taft, lifelong friends and reformist comrades, until the partnership ruptured; the other between power and the press."" The stories of both relationships — one personal, the other structural — are fascinating.From the end of the Civil War (1865) to the beginning of the 20th century, the US experienced unprecedented economic expansion due mostly to the technological advances of the Second Industrial Revolution. Real wages in the US grew 60% from 1860 to 1890. This impressive economic growth parallels the boom of the 1940s to 1970s that is compellingly described by Benjamin Wallace-Wells in his New York Magazine essay, The Blip. However, the economic growth of the Second Industrial Revolution was also accompanied by an increase in economic inequality, political corruption and harrowing workplace conditions. While real wages rose for everyone, they rose most significantly for the wealthiest industrial ""robber barons"" of the day: John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan, and Cornelius Vanderbilt. These ""first movers"" were able to create monopolies in each of their respective industries (oil, railroads, steel, finance, steamships) by either buying out or suppressing the competition. There were three perspectives on how to address rising inequality and industrial monopolies: socialism, progressive reforms, and philanthropy. The progressives and socialists sought many of the same ends with differing means: an 8-hour work day, federal income tax, direct election of senators, and a government crackdown on the abusive practices of the industrial monopolies. Perhaps the socialists of the 1890s were the Occupy Movement of their day, as some have suggested, and Obama represents the moderate, party-driven strategy taken by Roosevelt and Taft.Others, like Andrew Carnegie, insisted that the inequality of the Gilded Age ""is not to be deplored, but welcomed as highly beneficial."" For Carnegie, this new class of industrial billionaires could dedicate their accumulated wealth to philanthropy and, in doing so, address societal problems that are too large for individuals and too complex for government. This is the same argument made by Matthew Bishop and Michael Green in Philanthrocapitalism. Writing in the New Yorker, Russ Juskalian is less convinced. [image]During their political formation, both Roosevelt and Taft — from upper-class, well educated households — held the minority view of their Republican Party that government has a role to play in the redistribution of wealth and the regulation of monopolies. We must remember that after the US Civil War, in addition to increased industrialization and migration to cities, the tone of the country was largely defined by the Homestead Acts, which encouraged the settlement of the West, and established the American Dream — the assumption that any hardworking American could make a future for himself. Somewhere between the noisy labor activists and the wealthy industrialists of the East Coast, most Americans were distrustful of both groups — and they were especially distrustful of government. The Reconstruction Era following the Civil War was defined by its laissez-faire attitude toward government. It assumed that the less the government was involved, the better off society would be.In order to change the public's attitude toward government, Roosevelt successfully managed relations with the press to take advantage of the ""bully pulpit,"" a term he coined to describe the president's privileged position to change public opinion. Roosevelt was an extreme extrovert, tireless, always engaged in meeting after meeting, and ceaselessly advocating his point of view. He frequently invited journalists both to solicit their opinions, but also to spread his own progressive gospel. Taft, by contrast, was an extreme introvert who dreaded public speaking, always sought consensus and was hesitant to use the press to advocate his reform agenda. In temperament Roosevelt was similar to Bill Clinton — always seen, always charismatic — and Taft was like Obama — thoughtful, eloquent, cautious. We're left with no doubt that Taft's introversion was a burden to his presidency. The same is probably true of Obama. Roosevelt, like JFK, was a great storyteller. He was able to shape a compelling narrative about where the country had come from since the Civil War and where it was heading. In contrast, a common criticism of Obama today is that, while he's an excellent writer and orator, he hasn't been able to craft a vision of where we are headed as a nation and how we will address rising inequality and structural unemployment.The parallels between the Gilded Age of the 19th century and the New Gilded Age of today are obvious. What is more subtle is the role of the press — then and now. The Bully Pulpit makes a convincing case that the muckraking investigative journalists of the 1890s — especially those at McClure's Magazine — were requisite in raising the public's conscious about the poor conditions suffered by the working class, the abuses of the industrial monopolies, and the political corruption exemplified by Tammany Hall in New York. McClure's 20,000+ word articles were both investigative and explanatory in nature — uncovering abuses, yet also explaining their political relevance to their readers. There is perhaps another modern parallel between the Muckrakers of the Progressive Era and some of the entrepreneurial journalists of today like Ezra Klein , Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Bill Keller. In addition to uncovering malfeasance, these journalists focus on explaining the social importance of the issues, and, ultimately, make a case for political reform.I am optimistic that today's new breed of philanthropy-backed, entrepreneurial journalists are the muckrakers of today's new Gilded Age that will uncover the wrongs and advocate for necessary reforms. I'm less optimistic that a progressive reformer like Teddy Roosevelt could be elected in today's money-driven electoral system. Granted, Roosevelt was never elected in the first place. If William McKinley hadn't been assassinated by the anarchist Leon Czolgosz, it's unlikely that Teddy Roosevelt (McKinley's vice president) would have become president.It took aggressive, enlightened leadership to stand up to the corporate interests that defined the party politics of the Gilded Age. Obama, so far, has proven to be enlightened, but not aggressive. It's difficult to imagine a contemporary national leader who could craft a sufficiently compelling narrative to rally the entire country behind a movement to address campaign finance reform, corporate lobbying, and economic inequality....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 18, 2013","Feb 19, 2014","Nov 18, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17334495-the-bully-pulpit

On just a handful of days after the rainy season, which pushes out the city's infamous smog, the view of the valley is bookended by the massive volcanic range of Popocatépetl (""the Smoking Mountain"") and Iztaccíhuatl (""white woman""). Riding down the steep grade at 50 kilometers per hour, those volcanoes felt so close that I could stretch out my arms and touch them. At that moment I wondered, as I often do, what Mexico City looked like before it was Mexico City. Before the bloody arrival of the Spanish conquistadores, before the Toltecs and Aztecs established Anahuac and Teotihuacan and Tenochitlan, before the first humans made their migration across the Alaskan Strait and down the continent that would come to be called the Americas. We all ask that question -- What would this place look like without humans? -- and it's at the center of JB MacKinnon's The Once and Future World.The book sits somewhere between ecological history and philosophical inquiry. MacKinnon reaches back into the historical record to remind us what ""nature"" once represented. ""To know what [nature] is,"" he writes, ""you must know what was."" And so, much of the book is filled with rich descriptions of the natural world 100, 200, 500 years ago. But a significant portion of the book is philosophical, questioning just what we mean when we speak of ""the natural world."" Where do we fit in nature? And what is our role in its evolution?Looking back in time, MacKinnon argues convincingly that, as a generalization, we live in a 10% world. Compared to a few hundred years ago, the seas now have ten percent as many fish, the forests ten percent the number of birds, the land ten percent the former biodiversity. Imagine, for every whale we see today, we should have expected to see 10 a few centuries ago. If this massive impoverishment of biodiversity had happened during a single generation, them surely we would have done something about it. But instead it happened across centuries. For MacKinnon, our inaction is rooted in the ""shifting baseline syndrome."" Each new generation takes for granted that the world always has been as it was when they were born. We picture the natural world as we inherited it, not as it once was. If we don't read ecological history, then we don't realize how vastly we have transformed the planet across generations. Our cultural amnesia forgets what house prices were just ten years ago or the portion size at a restaurant, or what that hillside looked like before it became a suburban development. There is much talk about conservation and sustainability, but MacKinnon doesn't want all the humans in the cities, isolated from the biodiversity in natural reserves. Rather, he advocates for a wilder world, one in which humans, animals and plants all commune together. ""The crisis in the natural world is one of awareness as much as any other cause,"" MacKinnon writes. We move into cities where we become more isolated from nature, and as a result we care less about it. Unlike our grandparents, we're not able to name the species of local birds or flowers, we know little about their characters or habits. ""For most of us, familiarity with corporate logos and celebrity news is of more practical day-to-day use than a knowledge of local birds and edible wild plants.""MacKinnon is an able writer. Even when he is occasionally repetitive, I read on because his prose is so frictionless and each chapter is littered with nuggets of wisdom. The book changed how I see the world. Its history of how we as a species have become isolated from nature parallels my own increasing isolation from the natural world over the past ten years.

Both are hugely influential in their respective industries, but who is willing to list either as his favorite musician or writer?I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for both Dave Matthews and Gladwell. Even the bad stuff. And Gladwell's latest, David and Goliath Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants is far from his best writing or most profound intellectual inquiry. It builds on several themes from his previous book, Outliers, which argues that what we perceive as ""success"" and ""genius"" is more dependent on context, hard work and luck than inherent capability. In other words, so-called extraordinary people are actually hard-workers who have benefited from a number lucky breaks. It is a worldview aligned with my own. At first glance, David and Goliath makes the opposite argument: It's not the people with the lucky breaks who become successful, but the unlucky, the underdogs. The David who conquers Goliath, the dyslexic who didn't learn to read until the third grade and later became one of America's most successful trial lawyers, the cheeky jester behind the Civil Rights Movement. Indeed, taking the two books together, Gladwell seems to argue that, even if you can't get by on good luck, then you can still turn bad luck into your advantage. Both books emphasize that hard work and creativity are more important than inherent capability.Gladwell has received much flak for David and Goliath. Indeed, the anti-Gladwell backlash has been building over the past few years. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, psychology professor Christopher Chabris claims that Gladwell ""excels at telling just-so stories and cherry-picking science to back them."" (Gladwell responds to Chabris in Slate with the great headline ""Christopher Chabris Should Calm Down."")Even if Gladwell does cherry-pick the research to support his own way of looking at the world, there is something about that worldview that I find irresistible. Deference and irreverence [image]Last week, the actor-turned-lawmaker, Taro Yamamoto, was condemned by Japanese society when he personally handed a note to Emperor Akihito. Like most cultures, the Japanese stress deference to authority. (Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, only renounced his divinity when Japan was defeated in WWII.)And it's not just royalty. Around the world, the rich, famous and powerful are treated with deference. Here in Mexico, journalists rarely ask difficult questions of politicians or business leaders due to the strong culture of deference to authority. (The most famous example of Mexican deference is the common use of the word mande, which literally means ""at your command."") Deference and reverence can be detrimental to democracy. If we don't ask difficult questions of the most powerful individuals of society, then they will not be held to account. Their riches, power, and influence will be used to further their own narrow interests rather than to promote the wellbeing of all. And I believe that our deference to authority originates in our belief that they are extraordinary, that they are somehow inherently better than the rest of us. In Outliers, Gladwell gives us the framing to see even the wealthiest and most powerful actors in society as regular people who worked hard and got some lucky breaks. In David and Goliath, he reminds us that, even if we didn't get those same lucky breaks, we can still stand up to the giants and persevere. Granted, this worldview is less social science and more inspirational preaching. But Gladwell's intellectual project is to equip us with the mental toolbox to speak truth to power.A couple of weeks ago I was in London where the Indian social activist Aruna Roy was the sole civil society representative on a panel with US Secretary of State John Kerry, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, and billionaire Mo Ibrahim. Roy is the founder of MKSS, the Association for the Empowerment of Workers and Peasants, which uses India's FOI law to empower the working class. She has spent the majority of her life training the disempowered to seek accountability from India's elites. And that is precisely what she did on the panel, asking a surprised John Kerry how he can possible speak of establishing trust between government and citizens when the NSA leaks have demonstrated America's mass surveillance over ordinary citizens.I have seen highly confident, qualified individuals become stuttering nervous wrecks in the company of billionaires and heads of state. I have a hunch that Roy's quiet, calm demeanor when surrounded by such powerful men is rooted in the conviction that power is mostly a product of circumstance.  David beat Goliath, but is average over? It's difficult to square Gladwell's latest — how the Davids can beat the Goliaths — with Tyler Cowen's latest, Average Is Over, which argues that we are entering a chapter of humanity that will be increasingly segmented between the techno-empowered elites and the disempowered majority. [image]In the first chapter, Gladwell sets out to challenge the myth that David was the underdog in the battle with the giant warrior, Goliath. In fact, David, the future king of Israel, was most likely an elite, rock-slinging sniper. If you had to put your money on an elite sniper or a sluggish giant, you'd probably go with the sniper. For Gladwell, the anecdote of David and Goliath demonstrates that what we initially perceive as disadvantages (David's small stature and lack of armor) are, in fact, often times advantages (his mobility and speed).But the story of David and Goliath also reminds us that both individuals were elites (David, of course, goes on to become the king of Israel). Gladwell focuses on the handful of highly successful people with dyslexia, but only mentions in passing that dyslexics are vastly over-represented in prison. (A study of more than 2,000 prisoners in the UK in 2008 found that over half were diagnosed with dyslexia compared to 10% of the overall UK population.)In other words, Outliers seemingly argues that the highly successful aren't exceptional; they are lucky and hard working. David and Goliath seems to reveal, on the other hand, that a few successful people are unlucky, but both exceptional and exceptionally hard working. Gladwell's latest is a work of inspiration for the highly ambitious. But what about the rest of us? What if we didn't get all the lucky breaks that opened up opportunities for the elites profiled in Outliers? And what if we don't have the unlucky disadvantages that ultimately encouraged the heroes of David and Goliath to work harder and more creatively? The outlook for your average Joe or Jane in the 21st century seems considerably less optimistic than Gladwell's portrait of reality....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 11, 2013","Nov 12, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15751404-david-and-goliath

They rebelled against the phoniness and polite society of the times while celebrating spontaneity, sexuality, drugs, and jazz. In retrospect, the founding text of the movement was Jack Kerouac's On the Road, which ends in Mexico City where the rebel protagonists seek out William Burroughs, the wise priest of the beats who accidentally shot his wife in a corner apartment in la Roma, about a mile away from where I now live. On the Road was written in 1948 and 1949, but wasn't published until 1957 when Jose Agustín was 13-years-old. Despite the fact that William Burroughs, Neal Cassidy, Gregory Corso, and Allen Ginsberg all lived in Mexico City in the early 1950s (their house was at Orizaba 210 in Roma Sur, if you're curious), there is little evidence that they sought out or influenced Mexican writers. It would take another seven years after the publication of On the Road until a 20-year-old Jose Agustin wrote his first novel, La Tumba. The narrator and his dissatisfaction have more in common with Salinger's Holden Caulfield than Kerouac's freewheeling Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty.

Adults seem phony, stale, compromised.

While I was traveling in London a couple of weeks ago, I started reading Absolute Beginners about 1958 Notting Hill in the run-up to the race riots. Now I'm reading José Agustín's La Tumba, which was published in 1964 and follows a rebellious, literary teenager as he attempts to navigate the stiff, adult world of 1960s Mexico City. I realized why I'm finding these books appealing when I watched the recent documentary on JD Salinger, author of perhaps the most famous midcentury book narrated by a teenager, The Catcher in the Rye. All teenagers feel alienated from adult society — mostly because they refuse to succumb to the phoniness of it all. In order to become successful in life, you must accept a level of phoniness. You must learn to refrain from expressing certain opinions. You must master the art of sycophancy and tactical deference. Adult social interaction is, in the words of Irving Goffman, ""theatrical performance."" But teenagers aren't yet invested enough in their careers or communities to succumb to the phoniness. And so, refreshingly, they rebel against it. Teenage protagonists of novels are so appealing because, despite their insecurity and inexperience, they are authentic. They allow us to engage in the fantasy of doing and saying what we merely think because we're afraid of upset the theatrical performance of polite society.Throughout my week in London, I became increasingly attached to the nameless, teenage narrator. Absolute Beginners is the British equivalent of beatnik literature. But instead of depicting the jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing literary beats of the US, we're entreated to a ragtag cast of mods and teddy boys, the two rival youth subcultures of post-war London. The novel depicts youth culture in London through the eyes of a precocious, empathetic teenager in the run-up to the 1958 Notting Hill race riots. The book is great social documentary of London's complicated multicultural coming of age through the eyes of a narrator's personal coming of age. It's also excellent fiction with a Kerouac-like unorthodoxy of prose.

Its argument in a nutshell: Public policy should maximizeReally enjoyed the framing of this book, which summarizes much of my own political thinking. Its argument in a nutshell: Public policy should maximize an individual’s freedom to choose — unless that choice is harmful for society’s collective well-being. In that case, government should enact policies that create incentives that nudge us toward decisions which improve our individual and collective welfare.But it’s not just government. Thaler and Sunstein emphasize that we are all “choice architects” — that is, we all set defaults that influence how others make decisions. For example, Google re-designed their corporate cafeterias to nudge their employees toward eating healthily They didn’t ban them from eating pizza and junk food; they merely made it easier to eat well and a little more difficult to eat poorly. We all recognize that default choices are important. When the George W. Bush administration passed No Child Left Behind, a little-known clause forced high school administrators to share the rosters of their students with Army recruiters. Individual families could opt out, but few did. Then, some prep schools decided that they wouldn't share student information with Army recruiters unless parents opted in (rather than providing the info by default unless they opted out). Donald Rumsfeld understood the importance of the defaults and required that parents opt-out rather than opt-in.There is no such thing as a ""neutral"" decision. Every choice we make is informed by defaults and biases, and influenced by our psychological and cognitive limitations. (""People aren’t just loss-averse; they are also effort-averse,"" writes Elizabeth Kolbert in her .) Thaler and Sunstein argue that we should take those biases and limitations into account when we architect decisions, whether it's how people save for retirement, choose a school for their children, or decide what to eat for lunch.Nudge builds on the arguments of three recent books to develop an entire political ideology, which the authors have dubbed ""libertarian paternalism."" The first is Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, which synthesizes decades of research into the cognitive biases that affect how we make decisions. Thaler and Sunstein were also clearly influenced by Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives by Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler. And, lastly, it builds on the framework of Full Disclosure, which argues that public information, when contextualized appropriately, can improve how we make decisions. Examples from the book include nutritional labels, restaurant hygiene score cards and requirements that car manufacturers list a model's mileage per gallon. (However, Thaler and Sunstein note that MPG isn't the best metric; car manufacturers should be required to disclose how much consumers will save in money by choosing a car with more mileage per gallon.)The book is full of interesting factoids and proposals. We learn why those little black flies are painted on urinals in men's bathrooms. When administrators at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam first put the flies on the urinals, spillage was reduced by 80%. Chapter 16 of the book (available in its entirety here) lists twelve innovative ideas that use the nudge framework. One of my favorites is the Charity Debit Card, which would make it easier for people to keep track of and deduct their charitable contributions.Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Mario Rizzo criticizes the book for not sufficiently addressing the concern of the slippery slope. If higher taxes on junk food don't persuade us to purchase healthier food, then why not ban unhealthy food completely? The authors respond that libertarian paternalism focuses first on maximizing choice and is against all outright bans. Decision makers should change defaults, but not minimize choice. Rizzo doesn't come away convinced. Evgeny Morozov's criticism of nudging is more philosophical: if we are constantly nudged to do the right thing, then we don't develop the moral faculties to ""do the right thing"" despite the temptation of selfishness. Ironically, Morozov's latest book concludes by recommending several technological nudges, such as gadgets that remind you if you are using too much energy. (He also has purchased a safe with a timer in order to resist his Internet addiction; if that's not a nudge, I don't know what is.)It seems like every month new research emerges that supports the nudge thesis. Some of that research was summarized in a recent column by David Brooks. Just last month a new paper was published that adds evidence to the thesis that we are not willing to make sacrifices to protect the well being of future generations. Unless we want the world to look like this in 5,000 years, we'll likely need to be nudged to cut down on our carbon production. [image]The concept of nudging is closely related to my own work. How do you most ethically get someone to do what you want them to? Our grant to IMCO, for example, supports their educational transparency platform, Mejora Tu Escuela. The hypothesis is that if parents learn more about the performance of their children's schools, then it is more likely that they will become more involved in their children's education. What can be done to nudge them to become more involved?Civic participation ideally comes from a sense of civic duty, but are there other incentives that should be used? Take the case of transportation. We all know that cities need to encourage their residents to use more public transportation in order to reduce pollution, commute times, obesity rates, and health problems. But what should a city do to nudge their residents toward more sustainable transport? Charge for parking? Increase taxes on cars? Subsidize public bicycle sharing programs? Would Google Maps convince more people to ride public transportation if the default for directions were for always set to transit rather than cars? Or is it more progressive for a city to outlaw cars altogether? I came away from the book cautiously supportive of nudges and libertarian paternalism. Marketing and PR firms have long nudged the world toward greater consumerism. I'm OK with governments nudging the world toward collective well being so long as its accompanied by an education system that makes us aware of choice architecture and our own cognitive limitations. Sure, put the broccoli up front in the salad bar.

How is it that a woman can describe my subconscious behavior toward women better than myself? Who told her all the secrets?This isn't a book that I would recommend to everyone. Some of my friends would find it intellectually snobbish. Others would say of the characters, ""no one really talks like that."" But then, those friends haven't spent time with Ivy League humanities grads slumming it in Brooklyn. 90% of American men are clueless to the fact that there is a foreign land where attractive, well-dressed, sophisticated women fight for the attention of bookish, introverted men. This foreign land is called New York and it must be a terrible place to be a woman looking for love. My assumption is that many of these women move to New York for professional ambition, or because they watched too much Felicity growing up, but eventually, as Nathaniel P observes:""... in his thirties everything was different. The world seemed to be populated, to an alarming degree, by women whose careers, whether soaring or sputtering along, no longer preoccupied them. No matter what they claimed, they seemed in practice, to care about little except relationships.""The first three-fourths of this book could have been written by a modern, urbanite Hemingway. Only toward the end does it become occasionally clear that its author is a woman. My hunch, based on the most popular Kindle highlights, is that the majority of readers are women as well. That shouldn't keep men away. It's a surreal and satisfying experience to peer into the male mind from a woman's point of view....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Sep 03, 2013","Sep 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16045140-the-love-affairs-of-nathaniel-p

Then the personal computer, a first step toward the democratization of computing power for the masses. Next, the smart phone and tablet, keeping us constantly connected to the cloud and to each other. What's next? The city itself, according to Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia.The ""city as computer"" is Townsend's first premise, and it has been the promise of ubiquitous computing since the phrase was first coined by Mark Weiser in 1988. Indeed, today there are two networked objects connected to the Internet for each of our personal devices. (Think stoplights, traffic cameras, industrial sensors, even refrigerators.) But by 2020 Cisco estimates that some 50 billion objects will be connected to the internet. The second premise of Smart Cities argues that ""the coming century of urbanization is humanity's last attempt to have our cake and eat it too"" — our last chance to benefit from the abundance of the industrial revolution while avoiding the destruction of our planet.The Industrial Revolution was an urban revolution that caused an unprecedented migration of humanity from the farms of the countryside to the factories of the city. In 1900, just 200 million people lived in cities, about one-eighth of the world's population. Today 3.5 billion people live in cities, more than half the world's population. (In the US, Western Europe, and Latin America, that number is closer to 80%.) As Edward Glaeser chronicles in The Triumph of the City, urbanization was an important factor in the unprecedented growth of the global economy throughout the 20th century; with urban density comes the acceleration of innovation while driving down the costs of service delivery and governance.But Industrialization is also responsible for our greatest 21st century challenge, climate change. If China and India follow the Western model of industrialization, it is doubtful that the planet will hold up. Cities need to use new technologies to increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption: homes and offices that turn off automatically when they detect that your phone is out of range, smart transport to replace individual cars, technologies to reduce water usage, smart electric grids that give incentives to households that produce their own solar energy.""For the giants of the technology industry,"" Townsend writes, ""smart cities are fixes for the dumb designs of the last century to prepare them for the challenges of the next, a new industrial revolution to deal with the unintended consequences of the first one. Congestion, global warming, declining health -- all can simply be computed away behind the scenes.""  [image]Then there's the problem of slums — a ""planet of slums"" to use Mike Davis' catchy phrase. Cities struggle to keep up with the demand for the benefits they offer their residents. As a result, 62% of city dwellers in Sub-Saharan Africa live in slums. In major cities in Latin America, informal slums push up against wealthy, gated communities, yet they are not officially recognized by their city governments. ""India needs to build the equivalent of a new Chicago every year to keep up with demand for urban housing,"" writes Townsend. ""In 2001, China announced plans to build twenty new cities each year through 2020."" Many of those cities have already been constructed, and remain empty.  [image]Chinese ""ghost cities""Though affordable housing is the most urgent crisis, cities also struggle to keep up with the demand for water, electricity, waste removal, recreational spaces, wireless bandwidth, and other public services. In order to meet the increasing demand, they will need to provide public services more efficiently and more intelligently. They will need to become smart cities.[image]Rio de Janeiro's Operations Center build by IBMTownsend's third premise is that there are two paths to develop the operating system that powers the smart city, one modeled on the proprietary Windows operating system and the other modeled on the open, distributed World Wide Web. Cisco, IBM, Siemens, Living PlanIT and General Electric are all aggressively pushing their own proprietary operating systems for the smart city. For IBM, the Operations Center in Rio de Janeiro is the showcase of the Smarter Cities product that they hope to sell to all cities. For Cisco, it's Songdo, South Korea. And for Living PlanIT, it's PlanIT Valley in Portugal.The alternative to the top-down, corporate version of the smart city, is the bottom-up, grassroots innovation that is exemplified by organizations like Code for America, Tumml, WikiCiudad, OpenPlans, Urban Prototyping, and the hundreds of urban startups that are catalogued on CityMart. The difference between the top-down and grassroots visions for the smart city is the main narrative tension that accompanies us throughout the rest of the book. Townsend reminds us that this tension that has played out before, when Jane Jacobs took on New York City ""master builder"" Robert Moses. At the end of World War II, Moses had almost total control over the post-war transformation of New York City. He was responsible for the construction of four major bridges and five major expressways. He reshaped New York around the technology of his day, the automobile. The promise was a more efficient, more comfortable New York where happy families could coast in from the suburbs to their Manhattan offices and back in time for the evening news. But as a result, urban neighborhoods were divided by expressways and hundreds of thousands of residents were displaced to make room for stadiums, highways, and parking lots. Famously, he tried to bulldoze a children's playground in Central Park to make room for more parking at an upscale restaurant. When Moses proposed the Mid-Manhatten Expressway to cut through Greenwich Village and SoHo in order to link New Jersey with Queens, he met his match in journalist-activist Jane Jacobs whose book The Death and Life of Great American Cities remains influential with urban planners around the world. Robert Moses was the IBM and Cisco of his day — the master planner with all the ideas to make the city more efficient and productive without considering the needs and wants of the people who lived there. Jane Jacobs advocated for the network approach: let decentralized innovation happen organically to respond to the desires of residents. Top-down versus bottom-up innovation. Townsend is clearly on the side of the grassroots civic hackers and wary of the ""smart-city-in-a-box"" pitches by big corporations. But the book never quite articulates why we should favor the grassroots tinkerers. What do they offer us that IBM, Cisco, and others do not?For the answer we must turn to Richard Sennett's 1970 book The Uses of Disorder: Personal Identity and City Life. Writing when he was just 27-years-old, Sennett wanted to know why a generation that grew up in the post-war suburbs was once again moving back to the inner-city neighborhoods that their parents had fled for the calm comforts of the suburbs. He wanted to understand the sociological forces that drove the first wave of gentrification in the late 60s.   [image]Times Square BreadlineFirst, we must understand the historical context. Those born in the 1920s and 1930s grew up during the great depression. They experienced scarcity first-hand. Their parents waited in breadlines to fill their hungry stomachs with bread and soup. But after World War II, the American economy experienced its greatest period of economic growth. Some six million African Americans migrated from the rural south to the urban north to work in factories and service jobs. When urban White neighborhoods weren't able to keep Blacks from moving in, they fled to the suburbs where they sought homogeneity, tranquility, and comfort. You know: two and a half kids, a golden retriever and a white picket fence.[image]Their children grew up in very different circumstances. While their parents experienced scarcity, they grew up surrounded by abundance. While their parents were subjected to life-changing surprises, their lives were never-ending routines with clear expectations. While their parents fled the chaotic diversity of urban life, they grew up in the monotony of cookie-cutter, planned communities. Sennett argues that those of us who grew up in suburbs and are now drawn to urban life are seeking serendipity. We are placing ourselves in circumstances that force us to interact with people who are different from us. We seek a different social and psychological development from our parents. We seek disorder as a means to liberate us from control, homogeneity and habit.This, I believe, is the great difference in outcome between the top-down and bottom-up visions of the smart city. IBM, Cisco, Siemens — they sell city governments greater control and efficiency, but they could care less about serendipity, social inclusion, and participation. Of course, it doesn't have to be either/or. We need both greater efficiency and greater serendipity in our cities. But we shouldn't sacrifice the latter to achieve the former....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 13, 2013","Oct 15, 2013","Sep 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17573660-smart-cities

The Consolations of Philosophy, published in 2000, examinHands down, Alain de Botton is my favorite self-help author, whether on Twitter or in print. The Consolations of Philosophy, published in 2000, examines the lives and writings of six philosophers — Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, and Nietzche — to unearth insights that help us reduce our anxieties and live a happier, fuller life. From Socrates we learn to stick to our individual authenticity in the face of unpopularity. Like de Botton, my immediate instinct is to strive to please others rather than ground my behavior in my own values and philosophy. We are hardwired to seek the approval of others, but in doing so there is a danger that we stunt our own development, our own authenticity. In their book, Connected, Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler demonstrate that much of what we consider to be our individualism is, in fact, our assimilation of social norms. While I believe this to be true, I appreciate de Botton's observation that there are degrees to which we assert and defer our own values and beliefs as we seek both popularity and authenticity. (A version of this chapter was produced for TV and is available on YouTube. )From Epicurus, whose philosophical brand has ironically been hijacked by luxury brands like the Epicurean Hotel and Epicurean Kitchen Tools, we learn the joys of simplicity. In an age of abundance and distraction, Epicureanism is poised for a comeback. We don't need the latest iPhone, a new spring wardrobe, a new car, Epicurus would tell us were he alive today. True happiness depends on three conditions: friendship, freedom, and thought. This is why so much advertising attempts to link what we deeply desire — communion, freedom, nature — with what we don't need: say, new jeans.[image]We are foolish enough to believe that overpriced denim will help us achieve our deepest desires. Instead, we find ourselves trapped in artificially lit shopping plazas feeling anxious about our credit card debt. For Epicurus, the recipe for happiness is as simple as: shelter, friends, freedom (from superiors, patronization, infighting, politics), and reflection. Once you filter out the noise, you begin to appreciate the simple pleasures of freshly ground sea salt on a perfectly fried egg, or reggae on a Sunday morning.From Seneca we learn to manage our frustrations, which arise when our expectations go unmet. We expect to arrive to our destination in 10 minutes, but it takes 20. We expect our costly dinner to satisfy our palate's desires, but the chicken is dry. We expect to arrive from San Francisco to Mexico City in five hours, but it takes seven. We are enraged when we are stuck for 20 minutes at a stoplight, but we read of 20 fatalities from a bus accident and think nothing of it. Seneca's prescription is as simple and logical as it is difficult to achieve: lower our expectations. Or, as CK Louis rightly points out: ""Everything is amazing and nobody is happy.""From Montaigne we learn to cope with our feelings of inadequacy. Montaigne, isolated from intellectual companionship in rural France, was the first philosopher to deal directly with our most intimate insecurities: our sexuality, our aspirations of normalcy, and our intellectual self-doubting. In the summer of 1580 Montaigne took a trip from France to Rome via Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. He experienced firsthand how assumptions of normalcy shift from town to town. Most expats (including Americans here in Mexico City) stick together because they are unable to adapt to new behavioral norms. In his diary, Montaigne wondered why a Frenchman would travel to Italy if only to constantly surround himself with other French travelers.I read this chapter while taking a short break from the constant dancing, conversing, exploring, and hugging that is Burning Man. [image]Burning Man is so far outside the cultural norms of my quasi-corporate profession that my colleagues are unable to ask me serious questions about the experience. They resort to cracking jokes and poking fun because the norms at Burning Man (inclusion, giving, immediacy) are so different from the norms of the workplace (deference, competition, ambition). Having read Bartolomeo Las Casas' Brevissima Relación de la Dustrucción de las Indias, Montaigne realized that we tend to classify behavior outside of our own cultural norms as inferior. Spanish and Portuguese colonists spoke of native Americans as inhuman beasts to justify their inhumane treatment. By classifying someone as ""abnormal,"" we feel justified in treating them badly, or ignoring them all together. Unlike the Spanish conquistadores, Montaigne dealt with his feelings of inadequacy by actually dealing with them — constantly questioning his anxieties and insecurities. His lesson for us: We would do well to examine our own feelings of inadequacy rather than project our insecurities onto others by excluding them from the closed circle of alleged ""normalcy.""The least convincing chapter summarizes Schopenhauer's consolations for a broken heart. The cranky old philosopher — who never found true love despite a number of embarrassing attempts — advises his readers to see love objectively as a social phenomenon that has pulled us from reason throughout the ages, rather than as a subjective crisis. Only a man who has never been in love — the most subjective of experiences — could offer such advice.Nietzche, whose many difficulties concluded with suicide, offers some encouragement to get through difficult times. As a 21-year-old student at Leipzig University, Nietzche came across a copy of Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation. He was immediately sold on the book's Buddha-like worldview: life is suffering, all we can do is attempt to reduce it. Perhaps he just needed a little sunshine; the guest of a wealthy patron of the arts in coastal Italy, Nietzche began to change his philosophical position. There was pleasure to be found in life, he concluded. His prescription isn't that we should travel to Naples to drink martinis on the beach. Rather, having studied the lives of so-called Übermenschen, Nietzche concluded the that greatest sense of contentment comes from having suffered to attain one's goals. The beauty of the views from the Swiss Alps are rooted as much in the difficulty of the hike up as they are the glimmering blue of the glacial lakes below. When we suffer, we must explore how we can transform our suffering into something beautiful and noble, rather than obsess over what went wrong. Greatness comes from a great deal of suffering. As Nietzche writes:Don't talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name all kinds of great men who were not very gifted. They acquired greatness, became 'geniuses' (as we put it) through qualities about whose lack no man aware of them likes to speak: all of them had that diligent seriousness of a craftsman, learning first to construct the parts properly before daring to make a great whole. They allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in effect of a dazzling whole.The six philosopher's lessons are simple enough:   Pursue authenticity more than popularity.      Focus on our basic needs. Enjoy the pleasure of simplicity. Be mindful of manipulative advertising.      Lower our expectations.      Explore our own inadequacies to become comfortable with them. We should not project our insecurities on others.      Others' stories of love can help console a broken heart.      Greatness and contentment come from hard work and suffering.   But keeping these lessons in mind does not guarantee that we will put them into practice. Our desire to please others and our knee-jerk response to slick advertising are strong and subconscious. To overcome our instinctive responses we need to develop what Chip Heath calls ""triggers,"" automatic reminders to change how we respond. We need disciplined mindfulness to remember that we would prefer to go camping with friends instead of purchasing new jeans, or to lower our expectations when feel the rising blood pressure of frustration.There are few people who think as much about the application of philosophy to improve our lives as Alain de Botton. In 2008, having realized that ""more and more people are influenced not just by the books they read,"" de Botton established the School of Life to ""challenge traditional universities and reorganize knowledge, directing it towards life, and away from knowledge for its own sake."" Inevitably, de Botton must balance the school's mission of directing knowledge toward life with the need to make it sustainable. But Epicurus would probably poke fun at the its online store, which sells colorful notebooks and pencils. If we are unable to apply knowledge to life, at least we can purchase some aphorism postcards to convince ourselves that we are trying....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 03, 2013","Sep 12, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23419.The_Consolations_of_Philosophy

A small minority of us will die in a terrible accident — a train derailed, a drug overdose, a chicken bone blocking the airway — but the vast majority of us will extinguish slowly while laying in bed. During those final days we will reflect on the lives we lived up until that moment. Did we leave a legacy with our family and friends? Did we make a contribution to the river of ideas? Did we leave society and the Earth better off than the day we inherited them? Did we develop the capacities necessary to do all of the above? Did we have a good time?These are big questions, and they lay the foundation of David Brooks' latest book, The Social Animal. I first began reading Brooks' New York Times column in college. I remember those columns in the late-90s and early 2000s as mostly political and mostly annoying. Then I took renewed interest in his column after college. It was less concerned with explaining politics and more interesting in exploring the meaning of life. He took a special interest in research that offers insights into how our cognition and culture inform our worldview and subconsciously control the majority of our behaviors.The book, a culmination of those reflective columns over the past decade, can be slow-going and difficult to engage with. Brooks has an annoying habit of poking fun at his own demographic and that of his audience: upper-middle class, intellectual over-achievers. He's not always a convincing storyteller. He trips painfully at each transition between the syntheses of scientific investigation and the narrative of Harold and Erica, the married protagonists whose lives and life decisions make us reflect on our own.That said, Brooks' storytelling is convincing enough to elicit the kind of emotional response that comes at the recognition of the embarrassing and shameful moments of our past. As we follow the lives of Harold and Erica from childhood to old age, we are intermittently pummeled by paragraph-length summaries of scientific studies that, collectively, construct arguments about the basis of human nature. Those overarching arguments, which resurface throughout the book, are:   Character is more influential than IQ in shaping the trajectories of our lives.      The unconscious is more influential than our conscious decisions in defining our behavior.      Sentiment and emotion are more powerful drivers than reason and reflection.      Our social connections define our habits and behaviors more than our individual choices.   [image]In other words, we have much less control over our lives than we tend to assume. These arguments are a direct challenge to the 18th century French Enlightenment view of the individual as rational and autonomous. Rather, Brooks argues, building on the writings and research of others, our behaviors and habits are defined by subconscious cognitive biases, and by our social relationships.Given that character is more important than IQ in defining our life's potential, Brooks reasonably prescribes that our education system should focus more on the development of character than the memorization of facts. In fact, Brooks put his prescription into practice by teaching a course on humility at Yale University. Inevitably, the course was easy fodder for critics that were eager to point out that Brooks was assigning his own writings in a course about humility at the snobbiest university in the country. But Brooks' response to his critics was both sincere and, yeah, sorta humble:All of us have been raised in a culture that encourages us to think well of ourselves and to follow your passion and all that kind of stuff. I don't see why it is ridiculous to spend a few months reading people who tell us not to be all that self-impressed, to suspect you aren't as smart, virtuous and aware as you think. Surely this is a potentially useful antidote for me or anybody else.The passage from the book that impressed me the most was on what Brooks calls ""epistemological modesty"":Epistemology is the study of how we know what we know. Epistemological modesty is the knowledge of how little we know and can know.Epistemological modesty is an attitude toward life. This attitude is built on the awareness that we don’t know ourselves. Most of what we think and believe is unavailable to conscious . We are our own deepest mystery.Not knowing ourselves, we also have trouble fully understanding others… Not fully understanding others, we cannot get to the bottom of circumstances… No event can be understood in isolation from its place in the historical flow. And yet this humble attitude doesn’t necessarily produce passivity. Epistemological modesty is a disposition for action. The people with this disposition believe that wisdom begins with an awareness of our own ignorance. The modest disposition begins with the recognition that there is no one method for solving problems. It’s important to rely on the quantitative and rational analysis. But that gives you part of the truth, not the whole.We are mostly ignorant of the factors that drive our behavior and decision-making, but by reflecting deliberatively about our actions and by studying the neuroscience of our behavior we can strive for wisdom and empathy. When applied to public policy, this means that we cannot view the citizen as an autonomous, rational actor. As Brooks writes in a recent column, ""people are pretty bad at sacrificing short-term pleasure for long-term benefit. We’re bad at calculating risk. We’re mentally lazy."" Government then, can play a role in structuring incentives that bring out our best behaviors despite the cognitive biases that hold us back:Government could design forms where the default option is to donate organs or save more for retirement. Individuals would have to actively opt out to avoid doing these things. Government could tell air-conditioner makers to build in a little red light to announce when the filter needs changing. That would make homes more energy efficient, since people are too lazy to change the filters promptly otherwise. Government could crack down on companies that exploit common cognitive errors to induce you to pay more for your mortgage, bank account, credit card or car warranty. Or, most notoriously, government could make it harder for you to buy big, sugary sodas.This is the topic of the next book I plan on reading, Nudge by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. At its worse, The Social Animal is a bit like Sophie's World for pop science. At its best, Brooks shows that he is the great synthesizer of the big ideas of our time. Anyone interested in dissecting human nature and the meaning of life will enjoy engaging with it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 19, 2013","Sep 11, 2013","Aug 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9628743-the-social-animal

Or, four slices in this case — four cities that I've always wanted to visit: St. Petersburg, Mumbai, Shanghai and Dubai.Prior to this book it never occurred to me what these four cities have in common. (Other than that three of them rhyme.) All four cities began as deliberate efforts to change the values and behaviors of their residents and, eventually, countrymen. St. Petersburg was famously modeled on Amsterdam as an effort by Peter the Great to import not just the architecture and urban planning of Holland, but also its work ethic and even fashion. (All Russian men had their beards shaved upon entering the city.) Shanghai, now China's most populous city, was a relatively small port city until the end of the first Opium War when the Treaty of Nanjing opened up the city to Western administration by the British, French, and Americans. Bombay (""good bay"" in a mixture of Portuguese and Engish) was literally a collection of marshy islands until the British Raj decided it was the perfect location to become the crown jewel's urbs prima, its premier city. And Dubai, though on historical record since the 11th century, is the most recent attempt to import Westernization via urbanization.Brook notes that these cities tend to provoke strong opinions from Western tourists. Either they are comforted by the reminders of their own civilization, or they are outraged by it. However, he emphasizes that ""the question bedeviling visitors—where are we?—is far less fraught than the question these cities provoke for their own people: Who are we?""Indeed, these attempts by reformist leaders to import Westernization via urban planning has led to a cultural schism in all four countries. But the original reformist leaders could have never anticipated the cultural and political revolutions that they were planting. Before Mao headed to the hills to raise a peasant army, China's communist revolution first developed in Shanghai. Similarly, though Mahatma Gandhi was extremely anti-urban and anti-Bombay, the city played a central role in setting the stage for India's independence movement. And St. Petersburg was ground zero of the Russian Revolution. These are not the social revolutions that were anticipated or desired. Dubai, so far, has engendered the opposite reaction from its original Arab residents. Though they represent only 10% of Dubai's population, its native Arabs have responded to their city's top-down cosmopolitanism by embracing traditional Islamic customs and segregating themselves from the city's immigrant population. Far from fighting for the rights of the downtrodden — occurred in China and Russia — most Dubai Arabs live in luxury build by an underclass of mostly South Asian immigrants.Beyond the historical narrative of the four cities, Brooks does a great job finding the surprising intersections that link the four urban experiments of Westernization. The Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art, for instance, which would later inspire Bombay's unique take on the global art deco movement, was founded by a Parsi-Indian philanthropist who later become a legal drug lord by trading spices and tea for opium and British sterling. I also appreciate the way Brooks narrates Big History by focusing on the Small History of a single monument, street, or building. ""While a statue of Jesus towers over Rio de Janeiro, the symbol of an Iberian empire built upon the conversion of the natives,"" he observes, ""it is the goddess Progress who stands high atop Bombay. The [train] station is built to win converts to the Western faith in progress, not in Christ."" By taking a closer look at the contradictions of the cities' architecture, we're offered a glimpse of their larger social and political contradictions. In both St. Petersburg and Shanghai, the allegedly enlightened leaders built impressive concert halls and science museums in order to expose their residents to opera and the latest discoveries of science. But across from these new institutions, which encourage their visitors to think critically, are daunting fortresses of public administration. The lesson: become modern, but don't question your leaders. It is a tension that continues to exist in all four cities today.Brooks is mostly value-neutral on the use of ""new cities"" as a mechanism to change culture and behaviors, though the readers perceives that he is far less enthusiastic than, say, Paul Romer whose controversial ""charter cities"" initiative — seeks to establish foreign-run “charter cities” within their borders of developing countries like Honduras and Madagascar. Utopian attempts to develop the perfect, new city abound. There is Songdo in South Korea, Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, a new London neighborhood designed by Ikea, and the appropriately named New City (""Nova Cidade"") built by Chinese laborers and left mostly empty in Angola.Brooks' History of New Cities tells us that we should expect much more than the expectations of their urban planners.(If you're interested in reading more, there's an excerpt about the history of Dubai in Next City and a long, but interesting  by Brady Dale....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 19, 2013","Aug 14, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13707566-a-history-of-future-cities

Here's a typical on-stage exchange:After Ben AffleThe ""Oscars of philanthropy,"" the Clinton Global Initiative, took place last week in New York City. Here's a typical on-stage exchange:After Ben Affleck introduced Hillary Rodham Clinton, she heaped praise on his work as a humanitarian as well as a movie director. Clinton said she enjoyed working with Affleck at the State Department as he was researching “Argo,” which won the Academy Award for best picture in 2012.“I’m hoping that he films Argo 2,” Clinton joked. “I’m now available.”If plutocratic celebrity shoulder-rubbing isn't your thing, then the Clinton Global Initiative isn't for you. Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World by Matthew Bishop and Michael Green probably isn't for you either. The book is a fawning catalog of dozens of high profile billionaires — many are members of the Giving Pledge — who have launched philanthropic initiatives over the past ten years. For example, here's how Scotland's first billionaire, Tom Hunter got started in philanthropy:When Hunter received his check for £252m, his most pressing concern was a looming visit from the tax man. Hunter's tax advisors suggested that he relocate to Monaco, but Marion [his wife] wasn't keen. And, so, the accountants suggested the next best thing - to set up a philanthropic venture. Hunter and his family stayed in Scotland, and the Hunter Foundation, initially worth £10m, was born. As was, indirectly, Tom Hunter the philanthropist.It's impossible to say why some billionaires become philanthropists. According to tax lawyer William Zabel, ""most philanthropy is tax-motivated."" If the estate tax were eliminated, as was proposed by the W. Bush administration, Zabel and others say that most philanthropy would disappear. (Indeed, Andrew Carnegie, one of the leaders of modern philanthropy, favored heavy estate taxes to mark of the state’s “condemnation of the selfish millionaire’s unworthy life."") Adam Segal, head of strategic philanthropy at a PR firm, told Bishop in a 2001 interview that most philanthropists are driven by ""self-promotion, taking credit, branding ... They are not acting out of a sense of obligation, but rather to be a celebrity."" When observers of philanthropy (and many employees of philanthropic foundations) say, ""it's his money, he can do what he wants with it,"" they clearly don't consider that most of the money would otherwise go to the Internal Revenue Service to fund the following programs:[image]Indeed, many Europeans argue that it's not so much that Americans are pro-philanthropy, but rather that we are anti-tax. The wealthiest citizens of Sweden, Denmark and Norway pay income taxes of 50 - 70%. In the United States, the wealthiest one percent pay on average just 35% of their income on taxes (and that's up from 28% in 2010). It's probably worth pointing out that Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank well above the United States in education, employment, life satisfaction and work-life balance, according to the OECD's Better Life Index. This leads us to the crucial question that is left mostly unaddressed by Bishop and Green: Is it better to live in a country that is low-tax and pro-philanthropy or vise versa? Another way to ask the question: Is government or philanthropy more effective at identifying and fixing social issues? These questions are at the heart of debates around the ""Big Society"" in the UK and ""Creative Capitalism"" in the US. The basic narrative of both ideas goes something like this: High tax rates slow innovation and economic growth. Countries with competitive tax rates like Singapore attract entrepreneurs and wealthy investors that create businesses and thus create jobs. Also, local communities know their needs better than big federal governments. The ideal, therefore, is a relatively small government which encourages local community involvement, and works with philanthropists to encourage ""social entrepreneurs"" to come up with innovative solutions to social problems. Social impact bonds are one example of how governments could work with philanthropists to encourage social innovation: philanthropists give a loan to a government contractor that claims they can save the government money through an innovative approach to, say, decreasing recidivism. If the contractor does meet their established goal — say, reducing recidivism by 20% — then they are paid in full by the government and the philanthropic firm that gave the loan gets its money back (perhaps with some interest). Such a framework, according to its proponents, encourages economic growth and innovation while still addressing social issues. It offers people ""a hand up, not a handout."" Though Bishop and Green rarely address whether philanthropy is more effective than government, it is clear that they are on the side of lower taxes and more philanthropy. U2 rock star and celebrity philanthropist Bono would certainly agree. One of the biggest names at the Clinton Global Initiative, his band moved their publishing operations offshore to avoid paying taxes in Ireland. One hint offered by the authors to explain why philanthropists might be more effective than governments at addressing social issues is the so-called ""hyperagency"" of entrepreneurs-turned-philanthropists like Bill Gates, George Soros, Gordon Moore, and Michael Bloomberg. For Bishop and Green, ""hyperagency"" is the mix of 1) lots of money, 2) a willingness to take risks, and 3) the influence to get people to pay attention to what they otherwise wouldn't (for example, Gates' multinational, private-public partnership to eradicate Malaria). While it's true that philanthropic foundations can take bigger risks than government agencies (voters don't offer many incentives for politicians to take risks), Bishop and Green probably over-estimate the degree to which these so-called ""hyperagents"" are involved in the day-to-day of their philanthropic foundations. Like most media coverage of philanthropy, the authors focus on the lives and speeches of the billionaires without taking a closer look at the program staff that actually develop, implement, and evaluate strategy. Clearly I believe in the potential of philanthropy. I decided to work in philanthropy rather than government because it offers more flexibility. You're not restricted by the campaign cycles, lobbying and media circus of politics. There is more of an appetite for innovation and risk-taking. And for the region where I work, Latin America, social development by government is more often a tool to win political support than a serious endeavor to address social issues. However, I am also realistic about the limits and occasional negative consequences of philanthropy. Compared to government spending, philanthropic spending is mere peanuts. In 2003, the US federal government spent $2.16 trillion dollars. That same year, according to the authors, ""philanthropic foundations gave away $30 billion, but also collected $5 billion from tax breaks on the gifts they received and $15 billion through tax relief on their investment income."" That is to say, all of the philanthropic foundations in the United States spent less than 1.5% of the federal government. And that doesn't take into account independent spending by states, counties, and municipalities. Furthermore, they received $20 billion in tax breaks for the $30 billion that was disbursed. For all the attention that philanthropic foundations receive, their collective spending amounts to a small drop in a very large bucket.There are also some negative consequences of philanthropy, which have been explored in depth by Stanford professor Rob Reich — and, to be fair, are also addressed in Philanthrocapitalism's penultimate chapter, ""The Age of Plutocracy?""Much like government agencies, foundations suffer from a lack of collaboration, transparency and accountability. In the private sector, companies must make profits or they go out of business. Their customers, in the end, hold them to account. In the public sector — at least in theory — ineffective politicians are voted out of office. But there is no inherent mechanism that either rewards or punishes foundations for performing well or poorly. Similarly, in the private sector there is a culture of mergers and acquisitions in order to bring innovation to scale, but most philanthropists prefer to launch their own foundation rather than contribute to what already works (Buffet's $25 billion gift to the Gates Foundation is a notable and commendable exception.)Plutocracy, ""government by the wealthy,"" is derived from the Greek ploutos 'wealth' and kratos 'authority.' In contrast, meritocracy, ""government by people selected on the basis of their ability"" derives from mereō 'earn' and kratos 'authority.' The United States is still a meritocracy, one of the country's greatest achievements. Our rulers are generally competent, well educated, and middle-class. Our billionaires tend to prefer sports franchises more than politics (New York's outgoing mayor Michael Bloomberg is a notable exception, but while the 50 richest members of America's Congress are worth $1.6 billion. In China, the wealthiest 50 delegates to the National People's Congress control $94.7 billion).However, while our politicians may be mostly middle class, the drafting of public policy and the distribution of political ideas are increasingly controlled by the wealthiest individuals and corporations through philanthropy, lobbying, and campaign financing. Whether it's the Koch brothers on the right or Soros on the left, these billionaires are spending the majority of their wealth to convince others of their worldview. Furthermore, as the ad-based business models that once supported journalism crumble, we should expect more billionaires to follow in Jeff Bezos' footsteps; that is, we should expect a return to the plutocratic press.Philanthrocapitalism is a must-read compendium of insider baseball for those of us who work in philanthropy. It catalogs all the new entrants and the latest initiatives in the field, mostly with fawning praise. The book is less useful as an intellectual framework to judge when philanthropy is most effective, and which social issues should be addressed by tax-payer-funded government initiatives. The authors' most recurring piece of advice, that the social sector be ""more businesslike,"" is repeated ad nauseum without offering any specifics. I continue to believe in the potential of philanthropy to encourage and accelerate social innovations that improve the livelihoods of millions of people. The Rockefeller and Ford foundations are widely credited for accelerating the Green Revolution in developing countries. Open Society Foundations have protected the rights of the Roma people in Europe and spread the implementation of freedom of information (FOI) laws around the world.""People do not die for lack of income. They die for lack of access to the wealth of the commons,” writes Kavita Ramdas in her criticism of Philanthrocapitalism. She's right. Philanthropy won't fix social inequality. We must increase taxes on the wealthiest members and corporations of our society in order to redistribute the wealth of the commons, provide basic services, and improve educational opportunities. But, in parallel, we should also encourage giving — not just from billionaires, but from everyone. In his 2009 book, The Life You Can Save, the philosopher Peter Singer reminds us that our every purchase has an opportunity cost. It's hard to escape the logic that the coffee and muffin I ordered this morning could have gone to feed a malnourished child. Right here in Mexico an estimated 90,000 lives were claimed by malnutrition between 2001 and 2011. Singer ultimately recommends that the richest .01% give away one-third of their wealth to philanthropy. The top .01% should give 25%, the top 1% should give 15% and the average middle class family should give away between 2 - 3% of their annual income. True, 90,000 people didn't die from malnutrition in Mexico over the past decade due to a lack of philanthropy in Mexico. (Though Mexicans are notoriously stingy in their charitable giving.) They died due to poor agricultural policies and practices that have promoted mono-cropping and export-led agriculture without bringing down the prices of basic bulk foods for the poor. In order to deal with hunger at its root, the government must pass new agriculture and land title policies that raise agricultural productivity and lower costs of food production. But that doesn't meant that we are unempowered to make a small difference ourselves. Singer's website has an online calculator that suggests how much you should give each year depending on your income as well as a list of ten organizations that are reducing poverty around the world....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 11, 2013","Sep 21, 2013","Jul 11, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8980720-philanthrocapitalism

Others we read with the hope that, having turned the final page, we will better understand the patterns and rules of the world around us. And then there are those books that teach us about ourselves, that open a previously shuttered window to who we are, to why we do the things we do. For me, Susan Cain's Quiet is a book that falls firmly into the last category. Before reading it, I only loosely identified as an introvert -- and with some skepticism of the whole binary notion between introverts and extroverts. Nor had I ever considered the ""American extrovert ideal,"" the pressure that society places on us all to act more extroverted, and the exhausting effect it has on many of us.First of all, some of the defining traits of introverts, cribbed from Amit Nagpal:   Recharge their batteries by being alone (more likely to meditate and do self-reflection)      Drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling.      Listen more than they talk, think before they speak and often feel that they express themselves better in writing than speaking.      Likely to be creative, patient and persevering      High reactive, prone to worry and live in their heads      Excellent artists, writers, scientists and thinkers      Good at observing self and others      Good at focused complex problem solving      Philosophical or spiritual in their orientation      Highly empathetic      Do not like small talk      More likely to feel guilty because of sensitivity      Passion for thought and attention to subtlety      Good at predicting trends and future      Have more determination and give attention to detail      More likely to be driven by inner reward (passion and satisfaction) than outer rewards      More likely to focus on their own instincts and have less of herd mentality      Likely to focus more on substance than style      Don’t like to attend to many people at once (e.g. partying)      Like serious discussions and not very fond of casual talk   That's me. I've long been aware of my need to be alone to recover strength from the depleting effects of social interactions. It's not that I don't enjoy interacting with others — I do, but it makes me tired. (The same can be said of running or going for a bike ride; I love doing both, but they make me tired.) Never before, though, did I consider that my character was rooted in my genetic makeup, that I carry genetic markers that the majority of humans don't which explain my desire for solitude, my comfort with silence, and my sensitivity to music, film, and literature. Last year I was required to take a Myers Briggs personality test with my coworkers. They were surprised when my results marked me as introverted. True, I am probably more outgoing and have more friends than your average introvert. And I'm not frightened by public speaking, which tends to paralyze most introverts. But I associate strongly to all of the above characteristics, and also to most of the attributes of ""the highly sensitive person,"" a term coined by the psychologist Elaine Aron to describe individuals with ""uncommonly sensitive nervous systems."" Aron is quick to point out that the highly sensitive person can also be an extrovert, but there is clearly much overlap between introversion and sensorial sensitivity, and that overlap is probably explained by differences in the serotonin-transporter gene (SERT) and the brain's reticular activating system.In 2005 two researchers developed the ""orchid hypothesis,"" which was examined in a fascinating 2009 Atlantic magazine article by David Dobbs. According to the hypothesis, so-called ""orchid children,"" which carry a particular expression of the serotonin-transporter gene, are prone to depression, highly sensitive to their environment, and predisposed to self-destructive behavior if they are not brought up in a nurturing environment. But here's what is especially intriguing: when so-called orchid children are brought up in a nurturing environment, they tend to ""bloom spectacularly."" As Dobbs' article puts it:With a bad environment and poor parenting, orchid children can end up depressed, drug-addicted, or in jail—but with the right environment and good parenting, they can grow up to be society’s most creative, successful, and happy people.If you're curious to know whether you carry the specific expression of the serotonin-transporter gene that likely defines the highly sensitive person, you could do what David Dobbs did and analyze your DNA. Or, as a short-hand, you could buy a lemon. Introverts have a more sensitive reticular activating system in their brain. A single drop of lemon juice will cause our mouths to salivate like crazy. In fact, if I just look at a photograph of a lemon, my mouth begins to water.  The Extrovert Ideal I found Quiet enlightening in two ways. First, I came to understand myself better. Second, I came away with a better understanding of the society around me and why I frequently struggle to fit in. Playing the part of sociologist, Cain makes a convincing argument that, at the turn of the 20th century, America shifted from what Warren Susman called a ""culture of character"" to a ""culture of personality."" A culture of character celebrates manners, empathy, and moral standards. Oftentimes such celebration was more rhetoric than reality, but a strong moral code was still the dominant narrative. A culture of personality celebrates charisma, self-confidence, gregariousness and the gift of gab. If Abraham Lincoln embodies the culture of personality, then Tony Robbins embodies the culture of personality.Cain names two forces behind the shift. First, urbanization and the rise of big business incentivized individuals to stand out and prove themselves in big cities and big corporations. Second, the rise of Hollywood, advertising and sales all exalted the gregarious extrovert. The 20th century marked the decline in importance of the introverted, reflective novelist and the rise of the loud, sociable (and often narcissistic) Hollywood extrovert. The rest of America quickly followed suit, and introverts were pressured to become more extroverted. A number of institutions played a part in accelerating the process. Business school is little more than an institution to instill in its students the capacity to succeed in the culture of personality. In 1936 Dale Carnegie published How to Win Friends and Influence People, a how-to guide in extroversion. He then founded the Dale Carnegie Institute, which has trained more than 8 million people to become more extroverted. Tony Robbins and Rick Warren are two other preachers of the gospel of extroversion. The American extroverted ideal is beginning to spread globally. A recent Bloomberg Businessweek article about Chinese women in Western etiquette classes caught my eye when it stressed that Chinese conversational norms ""tolerate long silences,"" a no-no for most Americans that are made to feel uncomfortable by shared silence.The cultural dominance of Hollywood, business school, television, business school, and self-help books has led to a society that has sacrificed character and empathy for personality and competition. Americans no longer listen to one another. We are no longer a reflective people. Our popularity and success depends on our ability to convert personal experiences into compelling stories. Character has lost out to charisma.I was always aware of the societal pressure to act more extroverted than I am, but before Cain's book I didn't have the language to articulate it. Throughout my teens and twenties I did what most introverts do as they come of age: I tried to change. I would go to parties and get drunk when I would have rather gone to a coffee shop to read a novel. I learned how to become charismatic and charming even when it drained my energy. In short, I developed my personality because because there was no incentive to develop my character. Liberation If the first third of Quiet causes a rush of recognition for most introverts, then the final third offers us liberation. Introversion isn't the curse that popular culture has portrayed over the past century. Just because you're introverted doesn't mean you have to be shy. Indeed, Cain reminds us that true self esteem comes from competence, not the other way around. Obama, Einstein, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet are all introverts, but none could be described as lacking self-confidence. Introverts are more attuned to the beauty and subtlety of the arts. We tend to be more observant, thoughtful, and reflective. In a society that is ever more attention-deficit, those are increasingly valuable traits. Introverts are more likely to seek cooperation than competition. A table of extroverts will all shout over one other in excitement, each waiting to be heard. Introverts are good listeners and reflect deeply about what they have been told. Extroverts will probably have a better time at a party, but introverts take special pleasure in reading — what Proust called ""that fruitful miracle of a communication in the midst of solitude.""Just as introverts shouldn't be ashamed of the basic traits that define us, nor should we let ourselves be painted into a box. Taken to the extreme, introversion can lead us to social isolation, which can be dangerous. What we must seek is the right balance between sensorial input and restorative solitude and reflection. Unfortunately, the extroverted ideal can make restorative solitude difficult. Increasingly we spend more of our time in meetings and working in groups, surrounded by others in open office plans that were clearly designed by MBA extroverts in need of constant social interaction. Career development almost always focuses on making people more extroverted. The notion of strong leadership has been confused with a strong personality. Given these challenges, introverts must create their own restorative niches. Throughout the day we must schedule solitary walks, meditation, and other activities to be by ourselves.Just as television was a technology that exalted the extrovert, the Internet is a technology that has mostly empowered the introvert. Online communication offers a layer of mediation that plays to the strengths of introverts. Most online communication is written rather than verbal, and introverts express themselves better in writing. Online we (still) don't expect a response in the matter of seconds like we do in verbal conversation — introverts have time to reflect and respond with confidence. Cain cites research that finds that offline ""brainstorming"" tends to result in mediocre work because the group follows the lead of whoever is loudest. But online, ""group brainstorming"" produces superior results as the best ideas tend to bubble to the top. Just as the majority of the greatest writers are introverts, so too are many of the most respected online commentators like Peter Cashmore and Guy Kawasaki. After a century of the culture of personality, I wonder if we can once again come to value quiet and the culture of reflective character. In a reality-TV-world obsessed with celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton that have accomplished nothing other than selling their personalities, there is plenty of reason to be doubtful. But for those of us who have always felt out of place in that world, Quiet helps us transcend and take pride in our supposed limitations....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 11, 2013","Jun 14, 2013","May 11, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8520610-quiet

Unfortunately, I fear that those of us who aspire to global citizenship are a small and diminishing minority. In a world where information is everywhere, time is compressed, and attention is fragmented, I sense an emerging impulse to cultivate local community around common shards of our fragmented culture.Rewire begins with several anecdotes that demonstrate how seemingly globalized our physical world has become, while the globalization of culture and communication lag behind. Residents of Boston, for example, drink bottled water from Fiji without a second thought, but few are aware that Fiji experienced a military takeover in 2006. Far fewer have heard the music of Voqa Mosimosi or seen The Land Has Eyes, the first and only Fijian feature film. Noting that it costs only 18 cents to ship a liter of water from Fiji to the US, Ethan observes that it has proven more complicated to move the weightless bits of Fijian culture across the Internet than to move atoms of Fiji's water from a distant island to your neighborhood grocer.[image]However, in the very next chapter, ""Imaginary Cosmopolitanism,"" we are cautioned to not take Fiji as a representative sample of globalization's forward march. Citing figures from Pankaj Ghemawat's challenge to Thomas Friedman's assertion that ""the world is flat,"" Ethan observes that venture capitalists still invest 80% of their capital domestically, only 20% of stock market shares are owned by foreign investors, and only 7% of the world's rice is sold across international borders. The flat-world view looks at infrastructures of connectivity and conflates what could be with what will be. It blurs three separate phenomena — the globalization of atoms, people, and bits — into a single trend. The infrastructure that it celebrates — container shipping, air travel, and the Internet — quite obviously have the potential to shrink distance and integrate economies and cultures. But they're held in check by social, legal, economic, and cultural forces that make the blurring of international borders a slow, gradual, and uneven process.In all three cases — atoms, people, and bits — Ethan finds that we tend to overestimate the pace of globalization. Products made in China represent only 2.7% of US consumer spending and only 17% of the food that Americans consume comes from abroad. (Ethan cites the figure 7% from a 2008 article, but as of 2009 the USDA claims 17%. Notably, the importation of plant products increased from 16.8% in 1990 to 25.6% in 2009.) Similarly, in the case of the globalization of people, Ethan notes that ""global migration is significantly lower than it was 100 years ago."" If you follow the debate around immigration reform in the United States you might be led to believe that millions of Mexicans are waiting at the US border to cross as soon as any change is made to immigration policy. In fact, only 11% of Mexicans say they would like live in another country. And in 2010 net migration from Mexico to the US was zero — maybe even less. (That is, more Mexicans migrated from the US to Mexico than vise-versa.) Even the most cosmopolitan of regions — North America and Western Europe — are surprisingly domestic. Only 9.4% of those living in European countries were born in another country. Only 14% of those living in the US were born elsewhere, compared to 21.3% of those living in Canada. Migration is more easily explained in leaps and bounds that are shaped by economic development, war, and natural disaster than as part of a linear narrative of steady globalization.Our overestimation of the globalization of atoms and people pales in comparison to to our assumptions about the globalization of culture and communication. Assuming that we are interested in becoming so, there is no reason we shouldn't all be cosmopolitans now. In 1970, your average international phone call cost $2.43 a minute. It was nearly impossible to gain access to foreign newspapers, and video-conferencing was a thing of science fiction. A decade ago you might have had access to CNN and the BBC in your hotel room in Johannesburg, but you couldn't have dreamed of constant, streaming access to live news — in English! — from local sources in Japan, France, China, Russia, and Qatar. You didn't have access to Google News' incredible archive. Nor could you saunter down the streets of all seven continents using Street View.And yet, the Project on Excellence in Journalism found a drop in front-page coverage of foreign affairs from 27% to 14% among sixteen major US newspapers between 1979 and 2009. Similar studies have found even greater drops in international coverage on television and radio news broadcasts. The same holds true for consumers of online news. According to data from Google's Ad Planner, Ethan informs us, 94% of page views by US internet users are for domestic websites. (99.9% of page views by Chinese internet users are for domestic websites.) Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon may give us more access than ever before to movies, albums and books produced in other countries, but it seems that the increase in supply has occurred along with a decrease in demand for content from other countries. Or, alternatively, perhaps the demand for information about other cultures never existed in the first place. Rather, we were force-fed information about other cultures by elitist editors who felt it their duty to inform readers about current affairs around the world. Now that those editors and curators have less influence, we dedicate more of our attention to what we care the most about: ourselves, our family, and our friends.Building on the work of Robert Putnam, Ethan uses the analogy of cities to explain how access to more diverse content online may actually cause us to ""hunker down"" and stick with content and relationships that we are already familiar with. Extensive research by Putnam and his colleagues found a strong correlation between ethnic diversity and the decline in civic participation. Unfortunately, it seems that an increase in diversity is accompanied by a decrease in public trust and cooperation. To put it another way, it's much easier to stick to groups of individuals just like us (think of the groups of friends in popular TV shows like Girls, Friends, Arrested Development and Mad Men) than to expose ourselves to the awkwardness and anxiety of socializing with those who may have different beliefs, values and customs.In fact, our provincial online behavior matches the lives we lead offline. A heatmap made by Wall Street Journal editor Zach Seward reminds us of a truth we'd rather ignore: our lives are pathetically limited to the same few locations over and over again despite an infinity of potential experiences. [image] Engineering Cosmopolitanism Having made a convincing case that we continue to lack cosmopolitan practices despite having all the tools at our disposal, Ethan dedicates the second half of the book to exploring what can be done to rewire ""the Internet"" so that users are more exposed to content from other cultures. He approaches the challenge with the perspective of an engineer, but his recommendations are far from the ""solutionist"" widgets and algorithms that one may expect. In fact, his vision for a rewired, cosmopolitan Internet depends on people — certain types of individuals equipped with increasingly important skills. ... the remainder of the  is here:http://davidsasaki.name/2013/05/revie......more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 28, 2013","May 11, 2013","Apr 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16233761-rewire

I have heard it referenced so many times -- most recently to explain the decline of print journalism and the rise of the Huffington Post -- that I decided it was time to finally read it myself. That probably wasn't necessary. Christensen's framework for how innovation disrupts existing business models is pretty simple and can easily be summarized in a two-minute video. The only added value of reading the entire book is to delve deep into industry-specific case studies -- from the hard disk industry to a major change in big box discount retail stores -- to highlight how some companies adapt well to disruptive innovations (Apple is the best example) while others are caught unprepared, and die out (for example, Hewlett Packard).In the news industry, the Atlantic is a great example of a print company that has adapted well; the Washington Post, not so much. (Last year Christensen co-authored a report titled Be The Disruptor, which applies his framework to the major changes taking place in the news industry.)I also wanted to read this book because it is so closely related to Why Nations Fail, my next . In The Innovator's Dillema, Christensen explains how single companies frequently kill off innovative products because powerful managers are fearful that new products will compete with their current best-selling products and services. In Robinson and Acemoglu's expansive thesis on why some nations are poor and others are rich, they apply the same model to lobbying and public policy. For example, the oil industry lobbies against electric cars, fearful that the innovation will reduce demand for oil. When wealthy lobbyists capture government agencies, a country becomes less equipped to adopt new innovations which drive new industries and create more jobs. Like all business books, this one, too, suffers from the sort of bombastic prose that will cause students of literature to wince. Still, I'm glad that I read it, if only to ensure that the ideas stay with me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 24, 2013","Apr 28, 2013","Apr 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2615.The_Innovator_s_Dilemma

If your job, like mine, is to present people with information in order to chChip and Dan Heath's Switch is propaganda manual for the social activist. If your job, like mine, is to present people with information in order to change their behavior, then this is a worthwhile book. It reads quickly, and while most of the advice is obvious in hindsight, it is organized in a way that, in its sum, is enlightening. Habits are notoriously difficult to change — whether it is what we eat, how we procrastinate, how we speak in public, our how we respond to a particular pet peeve. In order to help make change easier, the authors recommend three main types of activities:Tap into your audience's rational side. The authors use Jonathan Haidt's metaphor of a rider sitting atop an elephant to describe the relationship between the rational and emotional sides of our brains. The ""rational rider"" does its best to deliberately steer the ""emotional elephant"" down the path that is most logical. Our rational side knows that we should eat egg whites and tomatoes for breakfast, but it's incredibly difficult to steer the elephant away from the pastry, coffee, and cigarette. Our rational side knows that millions of children die from malnutrition every year, but our emotional elephant pays attention to the two people who died in a terrorist attack. We are ruled by our emotions much more than anything resembling rationality. But still, the authors suggest that we prime the elephant by waking up the rider with a convincing, rational argument.Point out where your social change argument has already been successful. Find out why it has worked and how it can be replicated. Describe how the world would look different if that successful social change were replicated widely. Focus on those critical steps to implement the change, but don't overwhelm your audience with details that distract from the crucial, critical steps.[image]Motivate your audience's emotional side. Again, the 'emotional elephant' dictates our habits and behaviors much more than our ""rational rider."" In order to change the ingrained habits of our elephants, we must use emotional appeals. We have to make people feel. This is why Al Gore emphasized the (ultimately fictitious) story of drowning polar bears to communicate the urgency of climate change. Drowning polar bears are able to do what graphs and statistics aren't — tap into the emotional side of our brain that is subconsciously responsible for so much of our behavior.Make people feel. Break down the ""milestones"" of change until they are so small that they no longer intimidate our ingrained laziness. Appeal to your audience's sense of identity. If your goal is to change people's energy consumption behavior, then cultivate a sense of ""green identity"" so that they feel like they are part of a movement. (One interesting study cited in the book found that individuals are more likely to become involved in their communities if they first display a small bumper sticker that cultivates a sense of ""civic identity."")Shape the path. Once you have appealed to your audience's rational and emotional side, it's time to define the small, concrete steps that must be taken in order to achieve social change. Too often compelling social change campaigns fail because they don't offer clearly defined steps that individuals can take to make a real difference. They tell the heart-breaking stories, demonstrate all the data, and cultivate a sense of identity with bumper-stickers, t-shirts, and Facebook profile badges. And then they just leave it there, as if change will magically occur as a result. Shaping the path to change is the most difficult step — it's where you're ask people to change their behavior. Instead of taking 10-minute showers, now you're asking them to take just five minutes to save water. Instead of throwing all trash into the same can, you're asking them to take the time to recycle. Instead of drafting policy in a small committee of experts, now you're asking your government leaders to take into consideration a vast amount of contradictory public input.Make things simple by removing unnecessary steps. If you want your employees to deliver information on time, then make that process easier by removing all the non-crucial steps. Alter the environment to promote new behaviors. If you want more collaboration in your office, consider an open space layout. If you want more reflection, then consider adding more spaces for solitude. Help your audience build new habits. Giving away a cheap, plastic timer might help people keep their showers to just five minutes. Insisting on the use of checklists at work can build new habits. Finally, remind people that ""everyone is doing it."" Our behavior always depends on social cues. If you can show your neighbor that 90% of the neighborhood is taking five-minute showers and they are among the minority that takes 10-minute showers, it is more likely that they will change their behavior. Peer pressure works.Like I said, this is all obvious in hindsight, and we can think of many marketing and social action campaigns that follow the script line by line. But most don't, and as a result they tend to be less effective. By the end of the book the authors had me convinced that every effective social action campaign — whether you're trying to change the behavior of your government or your children — depends on informing someone's rational side, provoking their emotional side, and creating a clear step-by-step path to change....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 09, 2013","Apr 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6570502-switch

There is, in fact, an entire genre of blog literature that explains why Timothy Ferriss is a douche. Even New York Times columnist Frank Bruni got in on the action. Since I already heard Ferriss' insecure egocentricity on full display during his Long Now talk, I came to this book expecting a self-obsessed hustler to peddle his ""you-too-can-be-like-me"" vision. But I still wanted to read the book. I wanted to understand why it became a bestseller and why Ferris, the arch-egocentic, has become so influential among ambitious American men of my generation. (If you haven't heard of Ferriss before, you probably don't spend much time reading tech and entrepreneurship blogs.)What I didn't expect was to come to feel a deep sympathy for Ferriss. Despite the fact that he's a jerk, he isn't a terrible writer and the biographic sections of the book are rich fodder for psychoanalysis. Like Ferris, I also grew up with an instinctive, acute resentment of authority and hierarchical structures. It is still the most defining characteristic of my personality, but I have learned to control the resentment and anger as I have matured. Like Ferriss, I too was also extremely motivated and reasonably precocious. This combination of wanting to accomplish so much while spending most of my energy rebelling against the institutions around me led to constant anxiety and insecurity. ""Does not fulfill potential"" was scribbled across all of my report cards, which led me to rebel against my teachers and parents even more, all the while internalizing the basic notion that I was letting people down.Like Ferriss, I knew that I didn't want to define my life by others' expectations. I wanted to find my own path and define my own expectations. Part of that — like Ferriss — was to travel the world. That is where our paths began to diverge. Ferriss embraced a deep individualism that prioritizes self-improvement as the definition of success. Among his conclusions: Don't search for meaningful work; find a way to make as much money in as little time as possible, and spend the rest of your time having fun. There is no meaning in life; what we really want is excitement, not 'meaning.' Don't let others interrupt your path toward personal perfection; if they start blabbering, cut them off and return to focusing on yourself.Ferriss is obsessed with his own image. He constantly reminds the reader that he is a world champion of kickboxing, the winner of a tango championship in Argentina, a polyglot, a motorcycle racer, a chef, and a weight-lifter. But he is driven only by extrinsic motivation. He does not appreciate the ""craftsmanship"" of his pastimes; that is, in the words of Richard Sennett, ""the desire to do a job well for its own sake."" For Ferriss, it's all about winning a trophy, bragging to his friends, or checking something off his to-do list. The collective, the individual, and the twilight of the elites Why has Ferriss' vision of ""the good life"" proved so appealing among my generation? Why has the perfection of the self become such a popular pursuit? I am easily persuaded by Christopher Hayes' argument that the rise of American meritocracy over the past fifty years has led to extreme, individualistic competition among ambitious elites at the expense of our concern for collective well being. In order to be successful in America today you have to focus on yourself. The idea of placing one's community (or one's work team) ahead of one's self is passé. David Brooks has written a lot about the individual versus collective world views. From China, he penned a column noting that Asian economies are challenging the assumption that a culture of individualism creates incentives for greater economic growth. Then, following President Obama's second inaugural address (which he calls ""among the best of the past half-century""), Brooks examines the pros and cons of the individualist versus collectivist society. It is the cultural debate that underlies almost all other contemporary political debates. Like Ferriss, I too am deeply individualistic. The day after I graduated from high school I packed up all my belongings and drove to Alaska to spend six months by myself. I wanted to disconnect from all institutions, responsibilities, and expectations. But unlike Ferriss, during my 20s I came to a deep appreciation of the satisfaction that can come from participating in a community that isn't defined by hierarchical structures or individual achievements. I am speaking of my time working at Global Voices, which finally gave me a productive channel to focus my energy toward the goals of a greater community. There is satisfaction that comes from individual accomplishments. But, in my experience, nothing is as satisfying as building something together as a team. I fear we are losing the ""craft of cooperation."" If there has one thing my generation has learned, it is self-promotion — and no one can out-self-promote Timothy Ferriss. I hope that one day he can take a break from perfecting his self in order to experience the pleasure of cultivating community....more",Notes are private!,1,304,1,not set,"Mar 03, 2013","Mar 17, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/368593.The_4_Hour_Workweek

I had spent the previous year visiting over thirty different countries thanks to a ridiculously cheap round-the-world ticket. ($1,800 to travel just about anywhere over the course of a year. I still recall the shock of spending around $10 a day while backpacking around India for a month, and then barely getting by on $150 a day the next week in Japan.)While I studied political science and international relations in San Diego, I would often drive down to Tijuana for cheap tacos, cold beer, and a little chaos. The San Diego - Tijuana region is one contiguous metropolitan area divided by a political boundary that was established in 1848. The two cities share access to the same sea, have similar demographics, and nearly identical geographies. So why was Tijuana so much poorer and less developed than its northern neighbor? Why did so many residents of Tijuana want to flee their city to move to San Diego, but not vise-versa?Why Nations Fail, an ambitious synthesis of political history and economic research by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, is the most convincing explanation I have read as to why some nations are rich and others are poor. In fact, it's one of only a handful of books I have come across in the past few years that have significantly changed my worldview. (James Gleick's The Information and Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow are two others.)For Acemoglu and Robinson, the most determining factor between rich and poor countries is the effectiveness of their economic and political institutions. They introduce two terms to describe ineffective and effective economic institutions. Extractive institutions ""extract incomes and wealth from one subset of society [the masses] to benefit a different subset [the governing elite].” Examples include forced labor, protected monopolies, and the clientelistic relationships between union bosses and political parties. The antidote to extractive institutions are inclusive institutions, which are designed to create incentives that reward everyone for hard work and innovation. Inclusive economic institutions include the protection of private property rights, predictable enforcement of contracts, regulation to prevent monopolies, access to credit and opportunities to invest. If, for example, a young couple is unsure about the legality of their land title, it's unlikely that they will invest the time and money to improve their house. If an entrepreneur assumes that the government will not challenge monopolies that unfairly squeeze out competition, then she won't invest her life savings to develop a disruptive technology. In Mexico, entrepreneurs with innovative ideas related to media, communication, and energy are constantly told that they can't compete with Televisa, Telmex, and Pemex -- three of the nation's biggest monopolies.  How governments actively discourage innovation Here's a sure bet: when a new government administration comes to power in your country, within the first three months it will send a delegation of policy makers to Silicon Valley to understand how they can replicate the region's success in promoting a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. During these trips they will come across the ""cluster theory"" of Harvard professor Michael Porter, which argues that the economic success of Silicon Valley, Cambridge, and North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park has benefitted from the proximity and cooperation between research universities, technology parks, and venture capital investors. Then this delegation will return to their home country to suggest that the government fund a technology park near a ""research university"" and start up a ""seed fund"" to give support to early-stage entrepreneurs. At the same time the delegation will tell their wealthy family members and friends that they should buy up property where the government plans on building the technology park. The land speculation forces out the families that live there, but rarely do these industry clusters lead to sustained job creation. This is what is happening today in Mexico with the promotion of Ciudad Creativa Digital, a downtown re-development project in Guadalajara that has been dubbed ""the future Hollywood of digital creativity"" by former president Felipe Calderón. Official press releases claim that the ""digital city"" expects to attract $10 billion of foreign investment from the likes of Disney, Sony, Time Warner, and Viacom while creating 25,000 jobs in the next 5 to 10 years. The press releases are also quick to point out the involvement of Italian architect and MIT professor Carlo Ratti. But they don't mention how much public money will go into funding the project, nor that there is already an expensive state-supported ""digital media park"" just 30 minutes away. Guadalajara's Digital Creative City is largely modeled on Dublin's Digital Hub, which has been anything but successful. Washington Post columnist Vivek Wadwha rightly calls these digital hubs strategies ""modern-day snake oil,"" and Why Nations Fail offers us an explanation as to why they don't work. Acemoglu and Robinson insist that sustained economic development depends on bottom-up, entrepreneurial innovation. Top-down economic development can work in the short term — as it did in Latin America in the 1950s and as it does today in China — but will eventually run out of steam when old sectors can no longer compete with cheaper innovations from abroad. Wealthy countries embrace policies that support entrepreneurs that develop products and services that are better, cheaper, and more efficient than the competition. Poor countries support old monopolies in their effort to kill off all competition. In their response to a sloppy  of Why Nations Fail by Bill Gates, Acemoglu and Robinson note that the US software industry benefited when a court of appeals found Microsoft guilty of monopolistic practices. Unlike the United States, however, Mexico has not constrained Carlos Slim's telecommunications monopoly. In 2012 the OECD estimated that Slim's monopolistic practices have cost Mexico $129 billion. Meanwhile Carlos Slim, who inherited the state telephone company at a discount rate from his friend, former president Carlos Salinas de Gotari, is now the richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $79 billion. Slim's telecommunications monopoly is the epitome of an extractive institution — Mexicans lose $130 billion and Carlos Slim personally gains $80 billion. Meanwhile, Mexico has the slowest and most expensive internet connection speeds among all OECD countries — a major obstacle to startups like NuFlick that require decent connection speeds.Though the oil industry's successful killing-off of electric cars in the 1990s has been well documented, it's still worth noting that South African entrepreneur Elon Musk chose Silicon Valley as the headquarters of Tesla Motors, an electric car company that hopes to disrupt the Detroit-based car industry. Similarly, a US appeals court recently sided with a disruptive startup, Aero, despite pressure from major broadcasters including Comcast's NBC, News Corp's FOX, Disney's ABC and CBS. The decision means more options and cheaper services for customers and a major challenge to existing content companies. Such a decision would never take place in Mexico where content companies like Televisa and TV Azteca have far more political power than the judges that rule over such cases. (Note: I don't think that Aero is a brilliant innovation — see Farhad Manjoo's piece.)Unless developing countries are able to implement and enforce policies that support disruptive entrepreneurs more than established monopolies, then digital hubs won't lead to new start-ups or sustained economic growth. Overstating their argument I have only one qualm with this book: the authors overstate their argument. We shouldn't be surprised. Just as Jared Diamond, a geographer, overstated the role of geography in explaining the difference between poor and rich countries in Guns, Germs, and Steel, so to do the economists Acemoglu and Robinson overstate the role of economic institutions. They come off as childish and defensive in their insistence that differences in institutions account for nearly all the differences between rich and poor countries, while disregarding the roles of geography, culture, and access to natural resources. In his  of Why Nations Fail, Jared Diamond gracefully concedes that differences in economic institutions probably account for 50% of the economic differences between rich and poor nations, but then quite rationally he points out that the vast majority of poor nations are in the tropics where agriculture is often less productive and where tropical diseases are debilitating.Nor are Acemoglu and Robinson willing to admit that culture and the effectiveness of institutions are inextricably linked; different cultures lead to different types of institutions and differing institutions have diverse effects on how cultures develop. In fact, they cite the example of an inventor who comes to the Roman Emperor Tiberius to announce that he has invented a kind of glass that is nearly unbreakable. Rather than rewarding the inventor, however, Tiberius had him killed; for he was sure that the unbreakable glass would become so valuable that it would diminish the value of his vast reserves of silver and gold. Sure, it's important that the inventor lacked access to the patent system and venture capital in order to scale up production of his new invention. However, it's just as important to recognize that the inventor's first reaction was to present his unbreakable glass to the emperor rather than try to set up his own business. If there aren't incentives that reward effort, then that leads to a culture of not taking risk. I see that culture all around me in Mexico. We shouldn't fetishize institutions when behaviors are what must change.Why Nations Fail should be required reading for all students of international development and world history. But it should be read along with other compelling arguments including Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, Fukuyama's Origins of Political Order, and Culture Matters, an anthology edited by Lawrence Harrison and Samuel Huntington. What can be done Acemoglu and Robinson conclude their book with a critique of development aid — a critique which has become fashionable lately among economists who see aid as a market-distorting force that inhibits local entrepreneurs from developing their businesses. (African bloggers rallied against a well intentioned business man from Florida who wanted to send one million t-shirts to Africa without considering that such a campaign would surely kill off African t-shirt manufacturers.) Using many of the same arguments as Dambisa Moyo, Acemoglu and Robinson claim that development aid rarely alleviates poverty, and at times it supports authoritarian governments and their extractive institutions.To achieve inclusive economic institutions, you first need inclusive political institutions. These include representative parliaments, fair elections, competition via regulation, meritocratic access to quality education, and the rule of law applied equally to all. It was no coincidence that the Industrial Revolution took place in England, write the authors. For it was in England where the 17th century Glorious Revolution created new political institutions that would create the incentives that rewarded the invention of the steam engine, locomotive, pneumatic tire, and modern iron mining.The transition from extractive institutions to inclusive institutions occurs during what the authors call ""critical junctures."" These critical junctures could be a new generation of political elites, a political revolution, or a civil war, such as the US Civil War — when the highly extractive institution of slavery was finally abolished. But not every revolution brings about inclusive institutions. More often than not, they merely change the ruling elites that benefit from extractive institutions.Acemoglu and Robinson refuse to make prescriptions, though they do praise the Brazilian model of development under Lulu and criticize the Venezuelan model of development under Chavez. They also praise the role of a free press to make visible acts of corruption and clientelism by the powerful elite. However, even while they stress the importance of a free press, they aren't so idealistic to expect powerful leaders to change their behavior just because it's made public. They would likely agree with Mushtaq Khan that development advocates should focus on influencing the next generation of elites to implement inclusive institutions rather than shaming current leaders for their extractive institutions. Not only does Why Nations Fail offer us a new framework to think about the making of the modern world, but the editorial process epitomizes a major shift in how non-fiction books are published. A recent Op-Ed piece by Mexican entrepreneur Alberto Lujambio points out that the ""first draft"" of Why Nations Fail was published on their blog, where it benefitted from constant feedback by readers. Then the first draft was polished into book form, which in turn has inspired new debates and discussions on the blog. Lujambio calls the editorial process ""open and horizontal,"" and notes that ""reading non-fiction"" these days refers to much more than thumbing pages of a book.And it's a good thing that much of the book's content is available on their website since Mexico's leading bookseller, Sanborns, doesn't stock the book.

But thereafter their explanations diverge; Johnson focuses on incremental improvements to the design and engineering of the aircrafts themselves while Gawande pays no attention to aircraft design and, rather, attributes the safe landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River to the use of a checklist before taking off. (You can see a sample checklist for a Cessna 172 and Boeing 777 on Gawande's website.) Surely pilot Chesley Sullenberger's calm confidence was an instrumental factor in the safe landing, as was the design improvements that have been made to the Airbus A320 since it made its debut in 1988. And, yes, I suppose that reading through a checklist before they took off was also helpful, but throughout the book it becomes increasingly difficult to endure Gawande's incessant cheerleading of checklists as he mostly ignores other important factors.Gawande suggests that there are three types of problems: the simple, the complicated, and the complex. A simple problem is making a cup of coffee or frying an egg. You follow the steps, you memorize the steps, and for the rest of your life you deal with these problems mostly on autopilot. A complicated problem is much more involved, but can usually be broken down into a number of simple problems. Cooking dinner for eight people is complex, but it's not that difficult once you break it down into 15 to 20 simple problems. Then there are complex problems like parenting, which never present the same situation twice and involve hundreds if not thousands of factors that a single mind can't track. Gawande observes that, as the world becomes more complex, so do the problems that we face every day both at work and at home.Practice and intuition help us resolve simple problems, but we need help when we address complicated and complex problems. More than half of the anecdotes from the book invoke medicine and surgery, Gawande's area of expertise. He notes that shortly after the invention of penicillin in 1928 it was assumed by many that similar, future discoveries would improve healthcare throughout the 20th century. But, in fact, there have been very few groundbreaking discoveries in medicine. Most of the substantial improvements in healthcare — as well as the difference in health standards between poor and rich countries — can be explained by differences in how medicine is carried out, not what drugs or technology is available.Gawande also uses examples from skyscraper construction, aviation, and a field that is much more closely related to my own, venture capital. He draws on the Ph.D. thesis of psychologist Geoffrey Smart who argues that there are seven distinct approaches to venture capital analysis, each with its own entertaining name: airline captain, art critic, sponge, infiltrator, prosecutor, suitor, and terminator. The so-called ""airline captain"" is the most methodical of all venture capitalists. She focuses on specific indicators across all potential investments, evaluates them objectively, and uses a checklist to go through her evaluation process. This approach differs from the ""art critics"" who focus on intuition built with experience or the ""suitors"" who focus more on wooing entrepreneurs than evaluating them. Smart, who went on to write the popular business book Who, found that the ""airline captain"" had a median 80 percent return on the investments studied, compared to returns of 35 percent or less for the other venture capitalist types.Philanthropy is similar to venture capital, though we are focused on social impact rather than financial returns. Still, when evaluating the potential of a civil society organization to bring about a significant social change, we must take into consideration hundreds of factors; from how the board of directors is structured to relationships with media outlets to election cycles, financial management, constituent communication, and relationships with other donors. It has taken me years to develop a mental checklist of factors to consider when ing a funding proposal (which I do on a weekly basis). Thanks to Gawande's book, I'm starting to finally document that mental checklist so that I can operationalize it and share it with others.So, why only two out of five stars? The Checklist Manifesto is like a modern rock album from the 1990s: it's got two or three solid tracks, but the rest is filler to sell CDs. There's no reason to read the book in order to be convinced of the importance of using checklists. Rather I'd recommend the 8-page summary from Summaries.com or, even better, the notes from Derek Sivers. It'll also save you from Gawande's annoying habit of portraying himself as the hero, globe-trotting surgeon with sprinkles of self-deprecating humor. His real calling in life was clearly meant to be a script writer for ER.There is one ethical implication of Gawande's checklist evangelization that I am still struggling with. Since I've implemented various checklists over the past few weeks (including the two below), I've found that they are very useful for creating new habits … habits that I want to acquire, like stretching after I run. But I do worry that I might end up becoming a check-listing automaton, as I pay less attention to the spontaneity of my surroundings and ever more to a list of idealized instructions to incrementally perfect each hour of every day. Already I find myself using Google Maps' step-by-step voice instructions to arrive to a familiar destination just because it means I have to pay less attention. My concern with checklists is that I will lose sensitivity to what is around me as I break down my life into a number of steps to be checked off.For those of you wanting to implement checklists in your own life, I'll copy two sample checklists below, one for preparing to travel and the other to process my to-do list every Monday morning. I find that Evernote is the best app for checklists since those checklists sync across all your devices.

Yes, the book is disjointed, incessantly optimistic, shameless in its namedropping, and often reads like a politician's stump speech on repeat. Readers must endure bombastic, tired declarations like:The revolution is happening now, and the world is changing too quickly for government to respond with tiny, incremental changes. It is time to radically rethink the relationship between citizens and government.Because the future is about information— being able to access it, manipulate it, learn from it, improve our lives with it. And the cloud’s sole purpose is to give us information whenever, wherever we need it. The cloud is ubiquity, access, sharing, collaboration, connection. It works for you.With the explosion of social networking, smartphones, and apps, we have the tools available right now, in our hands, to transform government. We just have to have the courage to use them.They are the wave of the future—a future that’s about participation, empowerment, feedback loops, and organically created communities.Technology has rendered our current system of government irrelevant, so now government must turn to technology to fix itself.Our problems are so big and so expensive that we can’t afford to buy solutions. But replicating Apple’s model for the App Store is the antidote.Got that? Our problems are so big that we need an app store.However, if you're willing to wade through the predictable, tired applause lines of the past few years of TED talks, then Citizenville offers readers an interesting glimpse of some of the obstacles that stand in the way of bringing innovation to government. The most interesting revelations run counter to the book's main arguments. Newsom and Dickey claim, for example, that ""transparency leads to trust."" A few pages later we encounter a telling counter-argument. When Newsom took office as San Francisco's Mayor, he asked his team to publish his daily calendar online. His advisors raised their eyebrows. What about private meetings with potential donors? Wouldn't that dissuade wealthy donors from meeting with Newsom if they knew their names would be published on a public website? As Newsom and Dickey explain:People don’t like the idea of their elected officials spending time soliciting funds, and the whole process, fairly or unfairly, feels unseemly. How would it look if, in a particularly busy fund-raising period, I had multiple private meetings with potential donors? Fund-raising may be a necessary part of politics in this country, but that doesn’t make it any more palatable.In the end, concerned that transparency would lead to less trust, Newsom decided not to name the individuals he met with on his public calendar. (Lima's mayor, Susana Villarán, also promised to publish her calendar, though readers are left with the impression that only select appointments are made public.)The title of the book is a play on Zynga's popular social network game, Farmville. Newsom and Dickey cite a Kaiser Family Foundation study that found that today's youth spend on average 53 hours per week with entertainment media. Much of that time is spent on gaming and social media platforms. Meanwhile, in 2011, a record low 12% of residents of Los Angeles bothered to show up to vote on ten ballot initiatives that each represent millions of dollars in campaign advertising. Earlier this month only one in five registered voters in Los Angeles bothered to vote in the mayoral primary election despite the lack of an incumbent candidate. If civic engagement is at a record low, and if youth are spending more time than ever with social media and online games, then, Newsom sensibly proposes, governments must use those same platforms to reach the next generation of citizens. In the same way that Schoolhouse Rock! used television to teach civics to young viewers, government needs to use technology and social media to create stronger ties to its citizens. Specifically, he recommends four concrete actions that all government agencies can implement:   Make all data available in raw formats to the public so that developers can re-purpose the information.      Fund prize-based competitions similar to the X-Prize to encourage citizens to come up with solutions to problems facing their communities.      Host an app store (like San Francisco's own SF Data Showcase) that aggregates applications developed by the community that use open data.      Use social networks to build stronger ties to community groups and to exchange best practices with similar government agencies around the world.   They are sensible recommendations that would have been made more compelling had they been accompanied by more examples from cities and government. The greatest obstacle to their implementation, of course, isn't technical, or generational, or even cultural, but rather political. In any organization with an innovative employee who wants to share information, there is a manager who wants to maintain the status quo. Until the leaders of government institutions change, I don't expect a change in their practices.It is for this very reasong that I was most intrigued by Newsom's reflections on the difference between moral and formal authority:What one thing did Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Vaclav Havel, and Nelson Mandela have in common? The answer: jail time. These men were great leaders of their times, and yet none of them started out with even a shred of formal authority. None had been elected or appointed to a position of power or otherwise anointed, but what they lacked in formal authority, they more than made up for in moral authority.I’ve always been fascinated by this distinction between moral and formal authority. Formal authority is a twentieth-century model, a relic of the age when power was vested in institutions rather than people. It is power as bestowed through titles rather than power earned through genuine leadership. Moral authority, on the other hand, is granted by the people. It is indifferent to titles, and yet it’s invariably more powerful in the end than formal authority.As technology transforms every facet of our lives, it lays bare this division between moral and formal authority.The optimist within me wants to agree with Newsom. I am attracted to the idea that capable, empathetic leaders can challenge the institutional status quo by building influence through online networks. This was the allure of the 2004 Howard Dean campaign in the US and the so-called ""Green Wave"" of support for Colombian underdog presidential candidate, Antanas Mockus. But in the end, both Dean and Mockus lost, and institutions everywhere are still led by insiders who have been groomed for their positions....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 16, 2013","Mar 23, 2013","Feb 16, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15783275-citizenville

Very rarely was I tempted to fast forward. Isaacson strikes the right balance between focusing on Jobs the individual, the changing world around him, and the legacy he left. I found it strange to relate so intimately to certain aspects of his character (his stubbornness, fierce need for independence, and idealism) and so little to others (his obsession for total control, his outright meanness). As with all biographies, it's tempting to speculate as to how the anti-consumerist, hippie, college-age Steve Jobs would have judged the 40-something, obsessive salesman of the world's most appealing gadgets. Isaacson opens the book reminding the reader that Jobs, in his relatively short lifetime, was responsible for bringing about at least seven of the most important new sectors of the past fifty years: the personal computer, the computer-animated feature-length film, the MP3 player, the digital music industry, the modern smart phone, the app economy and the tablet computer. He didn't just create products; those products led to entirely new markets of consumers and producers.Beyond the general interest of learning more about the man who shaped so much of the past half-century, I took away four main themes from the book that have stuck with me:Prioritize. Throughout his life Jobs told friends and colleagues that he expected to die young. As such, he felt it important to focus only on what's really important, and to do those things as well as possible. He had an incredible talent for focusing obsessively on whatever was of most importance to him. Sadly for his family, his next great product usually took priority over his own children. I don't share Jobs' priorities, but I admire his ability to focus so much of his energy and attention on what mattered the most to him without getting distracted by that which doesn't.Surround yourself with passion. Jobs couldn't stand to be with people who aren't passionate about what they do. Much of what he was able to accomplish was enabled by bringing together talented individuals who were extremely passionate about what they do. Jobs knew that passionate people would put up with an asshole boss (like Jobs) if that boss shared their passion. This is true for me as well. Nothing demotivates me more than working with individuals who aren't passionate about what they do.Develop your intuition. Jobs hated PowerPoint presentations, reports, and anyone who read from notes. He celebrated intuition, the ability to speak clearly and intelligently without consultation. This is something I'm trying to develop. Instead of saying, 'let me think about that and get back to you,' I'm trying to answer more often with my gut reaction. I simply don't have the time anymore to think about it, which is a little sad because I do love thinking about things.Design through iteration. Why are so many technology products so damn ugly while Apple products are so beautiful and well-designed? This question has been addressed in thousands of articles and blog posts, and I won't attempt to summarize the explanations here. But there is something Jobs repeats several times in the book that has stayed with me: whatever you're designing, at some point you have to stop completely, step back, and question everything. According to Jobs, this was the difference between Apple and all other technology companies: the willingness to completely re-think and redesign the entire product. (You also, of course, need a single person who is powerful and brash enough to put a stop to months of hard work by costly engineers and take a completely different approach.)As Evgeny Morozov notes in his  of Isaacson's Jobs biography for the New Republic, Jobs also obsessed over ""purity."" For Jobs, every object from a knife to a table to an iPhone has a Platonic essence that must be discovered through a process of design and engineering. Morozov pokes the necessary holes in Jobs Platonic design philosophy, but those of us who appreciate design can respect Jobs' dogged determination to remove all unnecessary aspects of a product that interrupt its essential function. For his critics, however, Jobs' removal of the non-essential is a threat to a product's adaptability, and to our ""freedom to tinker."" Cory Doctorow's critique of the iPad and Jonathan Zittrain's critique of the Apple model are both representative. Throughout his career, Jobs frequently addressed the critique. His defense went like this: 1) most consumers value the user experience more than their ability to tinker with settings and ugly peripheries, 2) very few people have the time to tinker. We're busy and we seek tools that respond to our needs with as little friction as possible.Ten years ago I would have agreed with Doctorow and Zittrain. The battle between open and closed seemed to be the most important tension in computing, and I was entirely on the side of open. However, as the years have gone by, I have come to realize, as Doctorow has, that there is no neat binary between open and closed. The question, rather, is: Is it open enough for your needs and values? Despite my philosophical desire for complete openness, my practical side seeks just enough openness and then chooses the best user experience, which without any doubt is still designed by Apple.The big question in everyone's mind is if that superior user experience will persist after Jobs' death. The disastrous launch of iOS maps and the iPhone 5, which is more or less a lighter, longer iPhone 4 have been cause for concern. And the recent decline in the company's stock price seems to suggest that the public is skeptical. At his very last meeting with the Apple board, Steve Jobs was told that Hewlett Packard had abandoned the tablet, recognizing that they wouldn't be able to compete with the iPad. They thought this news would cheer Steve up; the iPad would have total dominance. Instead he grew somber and reflective. ""Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard built a truly great company,"" Jobs said, ""and it's sad that they are no longer innovative."" Clearly, he was thinking about Apple's own future....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 06, 2013","Feb 18, 2013","Jan 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs

Fortunately Bobby left is paperback copy with me after his visit (I hadn't read a paperback in over a year) and every evening since I thumbed through thirty or so pages before falling asleep. So much has been written about this book; there is nothing I could add beyond yet another devoted endorsement. I agree with John Mullan's pleasant surprise that the novel has been so well received, and what it says ""about the contemporary reader's willingness to accept what would once have been thought experimental narrative technique.""It's also worth noting, as Lee Konstantinou did in Slate last year, that the dystopian sci-fi has officially been welcomed into the gates of highbrow literature. (I'm especially thinking of Super Sad True Love Story — the last book I gave 5 stars — and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake, which I haven't read but it's on the list.)Cloud atlas is divided into six (just barely) connected stories that each represent a different genre and narrative style, spread out across the Pacific in the 1850s, 1930s, 70s, 80s, and then far into the dystopian future. As all ers have written, the book is much more than the sum of its parts. By the middle of the book we begin to piece together a coherent moral thesis. Mitchell himself has claimed that the novel's theme is ""predacity, the way individuals prey on individuals, groups on groups, nations on nations, tribes on tribes."" But our relationship with technology, and its influence on our ethical decisions is another theme that surfaces its head in all the stories. [image]We could frame the novel's moral inquiry with this question: What happens when the greatest risk to humanity's survival is our own invention? This, of course, was the great question of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1960s and 70s, which occupies a substantial portion of the novel and foreshadows humanity's ultimate downfall due to our inability to prioritize ethics over profits in our relationship with technology.The novel places a moral challenge to all non-vegetarian readers (and I've found no evidence that Mitchell himself is vegetarian). It depicts the conquest and enslavement of the Moriori by the Maori, of the Polynesians by the Europeans, and of the genetically-engineered clones by the non-genetically-engineered humans. (I was disturbed when I realized that I felt more sympathy for the enslaved genetically-engineered clones than the enslaved Moriori or Polynesians.) The reader is forced to conclude that the we can only rein in our tendency to conquer and enslave by treating those we perceive to be beneath us with empathy and respect. This is true for 19th century Europeans who assumed that Polynesians were lesser beings, and for our future selves who will surely assume that genetically-engineered clones are lesser beings than organically born humans. Yet every time we eat meat, we are also assuming that other animals are lesser beings than ourselves. If one day those genetically-engineered clones decide to turn on us and enslave the humans, what moral argument can we make?The philosopher Huw Price has founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Trinity College in Cambridge to explore these very questions. As he wrote in a recent piece for the New York Times:I do think that there are strong reasons to think that we humans are nearing one of the most significant moments in our entire history: the point at which intelligence escapes the constraints of biology.

Like so many others, I've found the blog post to be my greatest vehicle. Over the past ten years I have published over 1,000 such posts, of which at least half set out to express an opinion, make some argument, or test out a hypothesis.It's not the only medium — and it's certainly not the most compelling — but the blog post is the most frictionless channel to transmit complex arguments that build on the works of others. No, my writing doesn't show up in magazines or academic journals that boost the perception of the writer's authority, nor does it serendipitously find itself in the hands of bookstore customers exploring the jackets of the latest nonfiction; but it's remarkable that every post I publish is somehow read by thousands of individuals without any intermediaries beyond search engines and social media. I have found it extremely satisfying to contribute ideas and arguments to the public discourse with little intervention from gatekeepers, profit motives, and power brokers.At times, however, I'm tempted to explore other forms of narrative argument. I've long dreamed of producing a documentary film that tells the human stories behind the institutionalized corruption that underlies all aspects of the importation of Chinese products into Mexico. I want the film to be an empathetic look at our basic desire for cheaper goods, and the social, environmental and cultural consequences that desire brings about.I would also like to write a book. Several, in fact. There are topics that refuse to be neatly encompassed in a single blog post, or even a series of many posts. A well-delivered argument that adds substantially to our understanding of how the world works can take at least 300 pages to articulate. As an avid consumer of ideas, I find myself spending more time reading books than blog posts. (Though admittedly, many of those books would have been better off as blog posts while others are, in fact, polished collections of an author's blog.)One of the books I'd like to write, Smart Cities, Dumb Democracies builds on Edward Glaeser's argument that cities should strive to alleviate poverty while promoting social inclusion and personal freedoms. It argues that the current fixation on ""smart cities"" leads policy makers to focus on the creation of ""consumer cities"" that appeal to the tech-savvy ""creative class"" without taking into consideration social inclusion, education and civic participation.I have an outline of chapters, each of which makes a specific argument backed up by data and anecdotes. In aggregate they will hopefully convince the reader to re-think how we approach the development of urban life in the 21st century. Sounds ambitious, I know, but a nonfiction book should be ambitious, or else I don't see why one would take the time to write one. Having spoken with various friends who have published nonfiction books with major publishing houses, I came to realize that I had a lot to learn about the publishing industry. I didn't understand the pros and cons of an agent, the difference between publishing with an academic press or a trade press, nor that publishing houses actually pay bookstores to place books on particular shelves.In hindsight, I was clueless. Thinking Like Your Editor: How to Write Great Serious Nonfiction--and Get It Published is an eye-opening look at the nonfiction publishing industry and what it takes to get a work of serious nonfiction published. Several of the book's suggestions are counter-intuitive until they are explained in greater detail. Publishers don't want groundbreaking ideas, we are told. Rather, they look for the authoritative version of an argument that has already provoked public interest. In other words, publish plenty of book s and Op-Eds to seed your arguments in public before you publish your book.The first half of the book explains step-by-step how to prepare your submission package for an editor at a publishing house. The second half deals with the actual writing process. Most first-time writers, especially academics, the authors write, struggle to effectively encompass narrative into their non-fiction. Clearly some academics simply don't have the natural ability or the learned experience to make arguments with compelling stories. But the authors mention another reason for the hesitation to use stories that illustrate arguments: the increasingly fuzzy line between fiction and nonfiction. The authors point us to the scandal around Edmund Morris' almost-factual biography of Ronald Reagan, which was sold as non-fiction despite its use of fictional characters. A more contemporary example is Jonah Lehrer's bizarre fabrication of Bob Dylan quotes, despite the fact that they hardly contributed to his book's larger argument. The authors mention George Chauncey's Gay New York and Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point as prime examples of effectively mixing narrative with argument. They are also prime examples of why I began to feel uneasy as I read through the second half of this book, passing from one suggestion to the next about how to craft serious nonfiction. In aggregate, those suggestions don't quite make up a formula, but they get pretty damned close. In parallel to reading this book I was also listening to the audiobook of Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography, and I became annoyed when I detected those same rules of thumb in the book's structure. The nonfiction book no longer felt like an exciting new medium to explore. Rather, the best practices of the nonfiction publishing industry began to feel like a formulaic corset that restricts the author's creativity and voice. The publishing industry knows how their customers consume nonfiction, and they ensure that the authors don't stray too far outside of the lines.I am still left with three options: self-publishing, approaching an academic press, or working with an agent to pitch a trade press. Thanks to Thinking Like Your Editor, I'm much more informed about the pros and cons of each option....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 26, 2012","Feb 10, 2013","Dec 26, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/108361.Thinking_Like_Your_Editor

Usually I stick tI listened to this book as an audiobook over the past couple months while folding laundry, washing dishes, and going for bike rides. Usually I stick to non-fiction for audiobooks, but Jefferson Mays' incredible narration of the most diverse set of characters imaginable -- the reserved Dutch narrator, his biting British wife, effusive Caribbean transplants in New York -- brings them to life. Chapter after chapter I couldn't decide if I was more impressed with the craftsmanship of O'Neill's sentences or the way that Mays delivers them. This is not a book written by someone who was greatly influenced by television as a child. Dialogue is sparse, and almost always yields to long, dreamy descriptive passages that often contain memories embedded in memories. It is a European's celebration of New York, written for a commonwealth audience and with a commonwealth sensibility. I'm not at all surprised to see that my American friends gave it two or three stars while my friends from commonwealth countries all gave it four or five stars. There's an arms-length, urban mysticism to O'Neill's portrait of New York City that reminds me of Chris Abani's depiction of Los Angeles in The Virgin of Flames, and it's a style that isn't common among American writers. The book introduces its American readers to a new language, the language of immigrants connected by cricket, and thus by the British empire. I was reminded of the long afternoons I spent 13 years ago with my host family in Kathmandu watching cricket matches that seemed to have no beginning, no end, and no narrative arc. My host family was somehow able to tap into a frame of observation that eluded me. Netherland also subtly portrays the cultural differences between Trinidadians, Americans, the British and the Dutch. It is clear that O'Neill has spent considerable time with all four cultures. I aspire to craft sentences like O'Neill's, each one seemingly sculpted from some mental marble. That doesn't necessarily make it easy to read; beauty demands attention. And so the book isn't for everyone, but if you appreciate descriptive, reflective, understated literature, then I highly recommend it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 14, 2012","Dec 24, 2012","Nov 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2615008-netherland

I'm already part of the urbanist converted, and Glaeser is preaching to the choir. For those of you who are comfortably content in the suburbs, or wary of the chaotic hustle and bustle of dense, tall cities, this is the book for you. It is part urban history, part policy argument. Or, perhaps better put, it's a convincing policy argument grounded on the past few centuries of urban and economic history. The argument is this: It's crucial to our social, economic, and environmental well being that we reverse legislation and tax incentives that encourage urban residents to move from city centers to the suburbs. Policies like the disastrous mortgage interest tax deduction, which encourages urban residents who rent apartments in productive city centers to move to cheap suburban communities to buy cookie-cutter McMansions that dramatically increase the economic and environmental cost of delivering public services and transportation. Or the ridiculously low gasoline tax, which encourages more people to drive in cars rather than take public transportation. (It's even worse here in Mexico, where gasoline is subsidized by the government; money that could be spent on relieving poverty.) ""In the mid-1990s,"" Glaeser reminds us, ""when the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. was close to $1, the average price per gallon in Italy or France was close to $5."" And worst of all, zoning policies (like those in the Silicon Valley, Mumbai, Washington DC, and Mexico City) keep most buildings no taller than three or four stories, limiting the supply of downtown housing and raising the cost of living so high that the middle and working class are forced to live in the suburbs and exurbs. Here in Mexico City, zoning policies that limit height are the principal reason why we have the world's longest commutes. The average commuter spends more than two hours traveling from home to work and back. No wonder the country's productivity is so low. Over the past two decades in the US, ""transportation funding for the ten most densely populated states has been half as much, on a per capita basis, as funding for the ten least dense states."" Not only that, but ""per capita stimulus spending from March to December 2009 was twice as high in America’s five least densely populated states as in the rest of the country."" Taken to the extreme, even income tax can be seen as dis-incentivizing urbanization since city dwellers tend to have higher incomes than suburban and rural residents. (No, I'm not advocating for an end to income tax, but I do think that wealth should be taxed much more than income.)In other words, the cards are stacked against cities; most governments incentivize suburbanization. Why is that a problem? First, because cities are far more productive. ""Today, the five zip codes that occupy the mile of Manhattan between Forty-first and Fifty-ninth streets employ six hundred thousand workers (more than New Hampshire or Maine), who earn on average more than $100,000 each, giving that tiny piece of real estate a larger annual payroll than Oregon or Nevada."" According to Glaeser's math, ""Americans who live in metropolitan areas with more than a million residents are, on average, more than 50 percent more productive than Americans who live in smaller metropolitan areas."" Yet some of the country's most productive cities, like San Francisco and Boston, push residents out to less productive suburbs (or worse, to Houston and Phoenix) because zoning policies prevent tall buildings which raise home prices, ultimately pushing out the middle and working class.Urban residents are, on average, also healthier than suburban residents (they spend more time walking and much less time stuck in traffic). They also report to be happier (probably because they have much more access to cultural activities and are closer to their friends). Glaeser's argument is so convincing that it's frustrating. One of the most interesting sections of the book is its thorough, complex histories of three technologies that would come to define the 20th century: the skyscraper, the car, and the affordable suburban house. At the turn of the 20th century, thanks to the invention of the Otis safety elevator, it seemed that the skyscraper would usher in a century of dense, urban living. ""But twentieth-century urban America didn’t belong to the skyscraper; it belonged to the car."" Eisenhower subsidized the Interstate Highway System. Then William Levitt's perfection of mass-produced suburbia combined with the GI Bill led to a perfect recipe that ensured that the 20th century would belong to cars, suburban cookie-cutter homes, smog, traffic, and parking lots everywhere you look. It's frustrating to read this history and think what if … what if, the skyscraper had won and the car and suburb had lost? What would the world look like today?Even more frustrating is the likelihood that either America's mortgage interest tax deduction or Mexico's gas subsidy will be repealed. In the short term, there is no likelihood.Certainly mistaken policies are responsible for harmful suburbanization at the expense of productivity and environmental conservation, but even if those policies are reversed, will we see more urbanization and less suburbanization? I have a feeling that was the exact question that Andres Lajous was asking himself this weekend when he penned an imaginary dialogue with a civil servant. The text, which is in Spanish, pokes fun at the new young urbanist movement, of which Andrés was one of the early militants. ""What's going to happen when you have kids?"" the civil servant asks him. ""Are you going to take them to the emergency room on the metro? Are you going to take them to their private schools on the back of your bicycle? No, you're going to move to the suburbs and you're going to wait in traffic, and you're going to complain just like all the others.""Already several of my friends here in Mexico City are contemplating heading for the suburbs. All the typical reasons … soft grass for their kids to play on, better schools, less noise. Some are even looking for a greater sense of community. As Angela Giglia has argued in her fascinating ethnography of gated communities in Mexico City, while such communities frequently isolate residents from wider democratic involvement, new forms of community decision-making come about within the gated perimeter.How can cities retain their young talent? They need to offer more. More green parks, more playgrounds for kids. Public transportation that is as inviting as a luxury automobile (like many European cities). Frequent cultural events. Well financed public schools with clear incentives and paths toward upward mobility. The Project for Public Spaces has a handy list and a great blog that profiles successful developments and interventions. It's not rocket science. But it is incredible how wrong we got it in the US throughout the 20th century. If China and India follow our car-centered, suburban path, there's no way the planet will hold up.Not everyone should have to live in dense cities. But for those of us who do, we shouldn't be punished by policies that favor the suburbs....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 14, 2012","Nov 11, 2012","Oct 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9897152-triumph-of-the-city

The first, The Information by James Gleick, which I rev  In the past year I have read two books that completely transformed how I understand reality. The first, The Information by James Gleick, which I ed here, helped me truly understand for the first time just what is information, that pervasive abstraction that overwhelms us all. Thinking, Fast and Slow gave me the same clarity to understand cognition. It is essentially a compendium of a lifetime of research by Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman into how cognition works (and, just as often, doesn't). If you're not yet willing to commit to what is a lengthy and fairly dense book, I'd recommend starting out with this conversation with Kahneman from the London School of Economics podcast, which in my case was intriguing enough to convince me to read the entire book.The book is divided into three sections and makes three main arguments:  We're lazy. We can think of our brain as divided between two ""systems,"" or types of cognition. As Kahneman distinguishes them, ""System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations."" What's 2+2? You can answer that question effortlessly using System 1. But what's 17 X 23? To answer that you would need to use System 2. You could do it, but it would take effort, and you would only take that effort if there is a strong incentive to do so. Our nature is laziness. We avoid using System 2 as much as possible. As a result, ""when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution."" Kahneman's somewhat depressing advice to writers and marketers: ""the recipients of your message want to stay away from anything that reminds them of effort.""  We make poor choices. The second section focuses on how we make choices, and the cognitive biases that prevent us from deciding effectively. It's a highly readable summary of his decades of work developing Prospect Theory, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. We tend to make decisions based on how well they fit into the narrative that we have constructed rather than the ultimate outcome. In hindsight, we take responsibility for decisions that lead to positive outcomes and shirk responsibility for those decisions that lead to negative outcomes. The second section, though it reads slowly, is the most relevant to my work. I've witnessed the hindsight bias in action plenty. At our annual  of all our grants and investments, we are quick to take credit for those investments that went well, but when a project went off course it's always due to some external factor that we allegedly couldn't have predicted nor prevented.  There are two kinds of happiness, two kinds of selves. Kahneman writes: ""Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me."" Another way to put it is that there is contentment, when we reflect back over our life and are either disappointed or content, and there is joy, those individual moments of happiness that make us smile and laugh. You can probably think of friends who are always content but rarely joyous, and vise-versa. Spending time with children, Kahneman finds, doesn't cause all that much joy, but adds a lot to one's contentment. For me, one of the most interesting discoveries about happiness is the role of ""duration neglect."" The majority of respondents say they would rather live 45 extremely happy years and then die than live 45 extremely happy years followed by 5 years of moderately happy years and then die. The end of the movie is the most important part. Another interesting — and obvious — finding is that attention is one of the greatest factors of pleasure. Americans take less pleasure in eating than the French, and that's because Americans are more prone to combine eating with other activities.  At times, especially in the second section of the book on decision making, Kahneman is repetitive and is compelled to cite more research than necessary. At several points in the book I sighed out loud: yeah, I get it, let's move on, I wanted to tell him. Also, it's clear that he has his own biases. Like me, he's skeptical of self-proclaimed experts and believes more in the wisdom of the crowd. If he were to take his own advice, the book would be twice as long and full of counter-arguments from his detractors.Still, I couldn't recommend this book more. To everyone. It is full of interesting observations and research studies that opened my mind to just how little I should trust it.I was left with one concern that Kahneman never addresses. Rather than fluctuating between System 1, auto-pilot intuition, and System 2, careful contemplation, I feel like I'm passing more and more of my life in System 1.5, constantly processing information, sorta paying attention, but never giving it as much clear-headed reflection as I once did....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 08, 2012","Oct 18, 2012","Sep 08, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow

So three-quarters the way through Jonathan Franzen's Freedom I scanned my grandmother's bookshelf and settled on Carlos Fuentes' This I Believe, a collection of thirty or so essays arranged alphabetically. The essays cover everything from love to Buñuel, from civil society to sex. I hate to admit impatience with such a well regarded intellectual just months after his death, but there are times when you feel like you're the audience of a chatty grandfather, determined to prove that not only has he read and remembered all the Western classics of literature and criticism, but that he has integrated them into his own many theories of everything. And sometimes you want to sigh and say, good for you granpa. But Fuentes does deserve the recognition he amassed throughout his life, even when his expounding becomes tedious. His is a brilliant mind and he used it his entire life to read, analyze, and write. His most personal essays are the best -- meditations on friendship, family, and sex. When Fuentes passed away NPR re-played a 1987 interview from his appearance on Fresh Air. Just like this book, he is eager to share his many opinions and reflections on just about every topic imaginable. I realized that at least two generations of Americans (my grandmother's, my mother's) have been introduced to Mexico and Mexican thought via the country's two great intellectual ambassadors, Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz. I wondered what would have come of Fuentes were he born 25 years ago. Would he have a blog? Tumblr? Twitter account? Would he read more literature from Africa and South Asia? Would he read all the same old classics -- Balzac, Kafka, Proust, Faulkner -- or would he jump from one blog post to the next?Over the past few months there has been no shortage of debate among Mexico's intellectuals about the value of citizen and social media in the public sphere. It makes sense that ""public voices"" feel threatened by more public voices, but it seems almost certain that Mexico will never again have literary ambassadors of the same profile as Fuentes and Paz.

I couldn't agree more with Sam Tanenhaus: 1) Freedom is a masterpiece of American fiction and 2) it's a thick book that feels even more sweeping than its 562 pages.A friend (who notedly had not yet read the book) complained that it was just another white person book about white person problems. This is a critique of Franzen's work that comes up over and over again, and reveals more about contemporary readers of American literary fiction than it does of Franzen's writing. As ""Melmoth927"" commented on one such critique by poet Anis Shivani, ""where are the critics of Sherman Alexie for only writing about Native Americans or Amy Tan for only writing about Chinese [or Jhumpa Lahiri or Junot Diaz]?"" (The feminists don't like Franzen either.)Writers do best when they write what they know, but what saddens me about the ""it's-a-white-person-book"" critique of Freedom is that it belittles the universality of so many themes in the book that have nothing to do with one's race, class, or nationality: the agony of a long marriage, the messy psychology behind parent-child relationships, gossiping neighbors, awkward sex, competitive friends, irrational anger, and yes … freedom. To say that a non-white person won't be deeply affected after reading this book strikes me as just as ridiculous as to claim that a non-black person won't be deeply affected by Toni Morrison's Paradise.Freedom is clearly autobiographical. In an interview with the Guardian, Franzen says that it wasn't until David Foster Wallace's suicide that he was angry enough to start ""overcoming resistance to writing about unwritable material"" … ""the mother and son stuff, and the dynamics of the long marriage, and the shame and guilt associated with those very primary experiences.""Of the dozens of themes that are weaved throughout the book and its characters, it was the competitive relationship between Walter Berglund, the red-faced, idealist environmentalist, and his best friend Richard Katz, the self-centered, womanizing rock star who prefers to repair roofs in SoHo than go mainstream, that has stuck with me the longest. There is something so magnetic about Richard's confidence and so annoying about Walter's do-gooding and anger management issues, even though as readers we know that our loyalties should be with Walter. Richard Katz embodies our perceptions of masculine liberation; nothing can bother him, he's simply focused on creating good music and enjoying life. Of course, the self-centered insecurity of not letting anyone else affect him is what ultimately defines his mild, consistent depression until the end.Still, the question that has stuck with me ever since putting down the book: how to maintain absolute confidence and security in oneself while always remaining empathetic to the needs and anguish of others?

You know, unless they were about, like, the American or French I had made a promise to myself: no more books with the word ""revolution"" in the title. You know, unless they were about, like, the American or French or Industrial revolutions.Then again, I came to think half way through this book, maybe urbanization really is as consequential a factor in human history as, say, the agrarian, scientific, and industrial revolutions. Author Jeb Brugmann makes the case — and does a decent job at it, but he sure could have benefited from a more demanding editor. This book would have been 200% stronger if it were at 25% of its length. If you don't read this book, which would be my recommendation unless you're fascinated by the development of cities, I still would recommend Brugmann's ""5 Key Ideas"" from the book, which are available on his website.My favorite parts of the book — when Brugmann travels to cities like Curitiba, Barcelona, and Chicago to better understand what they are doing right from an urban planning perspective — are relatively few and far between. Instead chapters drone on to justify a complicated taxonamony and general theory or urbanism. Still, there was enough of interest to continue reading on. When the book is at its best I began to highlight more text than not. I came away with these new thoughts:   Residents of low-density neighborhoods (i.e.. suburbs) should have to pay more for public services and utilities than residents of high-density neighborhoods.      Slums will continue to grow worldwide. Neither ignoring them nor removing is realistic or sustainable.      Cities tend to be more progressive than rural towns because the most progressive individuals from rural towns head to the cities to escape the restrictions and injustices of most rural towns.      We think of the transatlantic slave trade as having a lasting impact on the history and organization of the larger world, which it did. But when you look at the raw numbers, the 28 - 40 million Africans that were forcefully migrated during the century plus of the slave trade pales in comparison to the number of urban migrants over just the past ten years. An estimated two billion people will migrate from villages to cities in the next 25 years.   Brugmann also argues that urbanization is not given sufficient credit as a factor that has led to democratization over the past 100 years. In fact, I think he even has a chapter titled (ridiculously) ""why urbanization makes democracy inevitable."" I agree that urbanization is surely one of the many factors that lead to democratization (for example, by allowing large segments of society to gather in public plazas and due to the freedom that anonymity grants). But in the 1980's Latin America was one of the most urban and least democratic regions in the world. Not only that, but Brugmann's three model cities — Curitiba, Barcelona, and Chicago — all developed their urban strategy under very undemocratic circumstances. In fact, good urban planning is sadly often a result of hard-handed leadership like New York under Giuliani and Bloomberg.For work I've been spending a lot of time thinking about how civic participation affects city governance and urban planning. Brugmann's book gave me much to mull over, but it lacks a cohesive argument and narrative....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2012","Jul 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6215976-welcome-to-the-urban-revolution

Full of cocktail party facts, but short on beautiful writing, with some notable exceptions:And maps are just too convenient and too tempting a way to understand place. There's a tension in them. Almost every map, whether of a shopping mall, a city, or a continent, will show us two kinds of places: places where we've been and places we've never been. The nearby and the faraway exist together in the same frame, our world undeniably connected to the new and unexpected. We can understand, at a glance, our place in the universe, our potential to go and see new things, and the way to get back home afterward.Really this book is a collection of trivia more than any attempt to piece together a narrative history of mapmaking or a thesis about geography. But it also offers some intriguing portraits of the map-obsessed: the well-off thieves who slice maps out of antique books in libraries, the road junkies who compulsively photograph every intersection they cross, and of course the geocaching addicts.I am admittedly a map geek, which is why I picked up the book in the first place. I am constantly inspecting maps of wherever I go and comparing the expectations that arise from those two-dimensional images with the reality that eventually surrounds me. It is this gap, like Jennings writes above, between expectation and sensation that makes maps so appealing to so many of us. Increasingly, however, that gap is becoming narrower than even Borges could have imagined.

I have spent such a large percentage of the past ten years of my life in airports and yet I've never written seriously about them. Not that the temptation hasn't arisen. Several years ago (I can't remember exactly when), in some European city (I can't remember exactly where, Salzburg perhaps?), I spent the afternoon in a bookstore reading Alain De Botton's A Week at the Airport. The slim paperback was the unexpectedly arresting result of what was essentially a publicity stunt; the large multinational that constructed Heathrow's Terminal 5 began contracting writers to spend week-long sabbaticals at the airport.I had recalled that the book inspired me to think differently about airports, but that's about all I could recall. So, in preparation for my own humble contribution to our understanding of hubs of aerial traffic, I decided to give it another read. (A rarity for me, but reading De Botton is much more like attending a thoughtful, reflective sermon than thumbing through non-fiction.This time, reading on my Kindle, I was able to highlight several gems, among them:Had one been asked to take a Martian to visit a single place that neatly captures the gamut of themes running through our civilisation – from our faith in technology to our destruction of nature, from our interconnectedness to our romanticising of travel – then it would have to be to the departures and arrivals halls that one would head.I was reminded of the Roman philosopher Seneca’s treatise On Anger, written for the benefit of the Emperor Nero, and in particular of its thesis that the root cause of anger is hope. We are angry because we are overly optimistic, insufficiently prepared for the frustrations endemic to existence.Our capacity to derive pleasure from aesthetic or material goods seems critically dependent on our first satisfying a more important range of emotional and psychological needs, among them those for understanding, compassion and respect. We cannot enjoy palm trees and azure pools if a relationship to which we are committed has abruptly revealed itself to be suffused with incomprehension and resentment.At the beginning of human history, as we struggled to light fires and to chisel fallen trees into rudimentary canoes, who could have predicted that long after we had managed to send men to the moon and aeroplanes to Australasia, we would still have such trouble knowing how to tolerate ourselves, forgive our loved ones and apologise for our tantrums?Like thriller writers, the security staff were paid to imagine life as a little more eventful than it customarily manages to be.The advantages of wealth can sometimes be hard to see: expensive cars and wines, clothes and meals are nowadays rarely proportionately superior to their cheaper counterparts, due to the sophistication of modern processes of design and mass production.We may settle on the sort of cheerful but equivocal look commonly worn by people listening out for punchlines to jokes narrated by their bosses.Although each suitcase was a repository of dense and likely fascinating individuality – this one perhaps containing a lime-coloured bikini and an unread copy of Civilization and Its Discontents, that one a dressing gown stolen from a Chicago hotel and a packet of Roche antidepressants – this was not the place to start thinking about anyone else.Out of the millions of people we live among, most of whom we habitually ignore and are ignored by in turn, there are always a few who hold hostage our capacity for happiness, whom we could recognise by their smell alone and whom we would rather die than be without. There were men pacing impatiently and blankly who had looked forward to this moment for half a year and could not restrain themselves any further at the sight of a small boy endowed with their own grey-green eyes and their mother’s cheeks, emerging from behind the stainless-steel gate, holding the hand of an airport operative.Alain De Botton fulfills what strikes me as the principle function of the contemporary writer. While the rest of the world rushes by distracted, he shuffles along unhurried with an careful eye, chiseling those observations into eloquent prose.

If I were to write a leadership book, it would take a sentence: Don't be an asshole, listen more than talk, admit to being wrong, and lead by example. Bill George has a slightly more round-about way of arriving at a fairly similar set of recommendations. The most useful frame that I found throughout the book is the recurring reminder to define one's success oneself, and not just with the usual set of bonuses, raises, promotions, etc. Basically, to focus more on internal validation and less on external validation. The best way to do this, according to George (and I think he's right), is to develop a narrative of who you are, why you do what you do, and what you want to achieve with your life. Those are three difficult questions. More often than not the resulting narratives become personal marketing campaigns, but they can also become powerful value statements that authentically persuade others to join your mission.

I don't think I've ever read a self-help book in my life, but within four weeks I had read three. I discovered Jon Kabat-Zinn after receiving dozens of messages of concern about my recent sleeplessness. Various types of meditation and breathing exercises were the most popular recommendations. Some suggested retreats, others classes, and others audio CDs. I figured I'd start with a guided audio CD, and if it didn't work then I'd enroll in a class or retreat. After some online research I settled on Kabat-Zinn's Guided Mindfulness Meditation and this accompanying book. Both are the results of Kabat-Zinn's research and clinics at the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society in Boston. At least half of the book is directed toward those suffering intense pain and chronic illness. I skipped over most of those sections; fortunately, they simply don't apply to me. But plenty of the book does, and it helped give me patience when I felt I was progressing too slowly with the meditation.For most of October and November I meditated at least three times a week for 45 minutes at a time. I began to sleep better, but more importantly, I felt more at ease in all aspects of life. The book also helped me realize that I had been breathing shallowly. Now I breathe with my diaphragm, which tends to put me at ease and keep me more clear-minded.The book is about being observant as much as it is about meditation. In fact, for me, mindfulness is really just another synonym for observation. And it's true; I've become much less observant as I've grown older. I walk through my neighborhood lost in thoughts about what I need to get done rather than observing and appreciating everything around me.These days there is simply too much information, too much to do. Our default is to accumulate as much as possible, pile it on top of our desk, and stress out as it never gets done. On top of all that we will never get to, there are hundreds of other distractions waiting for us. Kabat-Zinn wrote Full Catastrophe Living in 1990. In the introduction he stresses that ""modern life has made us too distracted."" 1990! That was before the World Wide Web. Before cell phones. Compared to today, 1990 was an oasis of meditation, observation and contemplation. It is for this reason that I'm now putting myself on an information diet.

In 2004 veteran business journalist Dan Gillmor published We the Media to celebrate a new phenomenon, ""Grassroots Journalism by the People, for the People."" In 2006 Jay Rosen coined and honored ""The People Formerly Known as the Audience."" Also in 2006 the Sunlight Foundation was established with the idea that if more information was published about how government works, politicians would be held accountable. A year earlier we created Global Voices to amplify the voices of independent bloggers in regions historically under-represented by ""the mainstream media"" (a term that, at the time, had actual meaning).Now Dan Gillmor is less concerned with all those well-intentioned, independent voices and more focused on how to filter them out. (Unfortunately, no one seems to have time to read his book, or any other for that matter, so he is practically giving it away at $1.) Jay Rosen, meanwhile, is wondering what went wrong with his vision for ""pro-am journalism."" Global Voices continues to be a jewel of fascinating content (where else will you find a collection of Arab bloggers' homages to Whitney Houston?), but these days you're more likely to hear co-founder Ethan Zuckerman complain about ""imaginary cosmopolitanism."" And Clay Johnson, formerly the director of Sunlight Labs, left his gig promoting transparency to reflect a bit on how much of it we really need, and why?The result is his first book, The Information Diet, and the movement he hopes it will spawn. I like that Clay and others are now focusing on media literacy; that is, the demand for, and not just the supply of, information. Meaningful data depends on our ability to make meaning from it. Clay uses the helpful metaphor of nutrition to explain how to most effectively manage our transition from scarcity to abundance of information:If unhealthy information consumption creates bad information habits the way unhealthy eating creates food addictions, then what good is transparency? You cannot simply flood the market with broccoli and hope that people stop eating french fries. If large numbers of people only seek out information that confirms their beliefs, then flooding the market with data from and about the government will really not work as well as the theorists predict.This is obviously a direct challenge to our work at Omidyar Network. So far we have invested heavily in civic startups that ""flood the market with broccoli,"" but we have done relatively little to promote better info-nutrition. (I would argue that this is the principle reason for an education system, though it doesn't seem to be preparing students very well for the modern information ecology.)I was slightly disappointed by the shallow treatment of the neuropsychology of information consumption. (For that we may need to turn to Torkel Klingberg's Overflowing Brain.) Clay does his best to offer a literature  of popular blog posts treating the subject, but the reader perceives that perhaps he was distracted himself when reading into the details of the research. Still, we're offered basic though useful observations like:There are also certain kinds of information we’re hard wired to love: affirmation is something we all enjoy receiving, and the confirmation of our beliefs helps us form stronger communities. The spread of fear and its companion, hate, are clearly survival instincts, but more benign acts like gossip also help us spread the word about things that could be a danger to us.Just like we're hardwired to enjoy salt, fat, and sugar, we also have a natural bias toward fear, violence, sex and gossip. While those interests helped us survive when we were organized in tribes, today they limit our ability to become active, engaged citizens. Also, just as some individuals are genetically predisposed to obesity, some of us also seem to be genetically predisposed to info-obesity. I know that I am. If I have to stand in a line for longer than two minutes, I simply can't resist pulling out my telephone to check email, check twitter, check anything at all in my brain's subconscious search for small hits of dopamine . What's being said? What is being said about me? What can I say? It is an unnecessary and unhealthy compulsion. The book also cites some interesting studies about the physiological consequences of constant info-consumption. Linda Stone, for example, found that 80% of the subjects she studied hold their breath when an email arrives to their inbox. (I began noticing that I also frequently hold my breath when concentrating on incoming content on my screen.)Clay offers the reader more than mere analysis and outcry; he also proposes a useful guide to info-nutrition (noting with sobriety that neither the infinitude of nutrition books nor the mandatory nutritional labels have managed to lower physical obesity rates). Paraphrasing:* Read local. More news about your local neighborhood, less national and international news that you can't put to use.* Improve your data literacy; understand the basics of statistics* Be mindful. Consume information only when you have the attention to make sense of it.* Enjoy. Consuming information can be both healthy and enjoyable.

But I can't help but point out a few ironies:Clay reminds us that ""attention is the currency that marketers lust for, and it’s about time we started guarding it, consciously, like we guard our bank accounts."" Yet his Twitter account has mostly turned into a stream of marketing for his book.Speaking of marketing, the front page of InformationDiet.com includes statements of support from many of those who are most responsible for info-glut: Gina Trapani of Lifehacker, Ev Williams of Twitter, and Baratunde Thurston of The Onion. Famous and talented all, but there is very little evidence that they have become more responsible publishers or consumers of content. Baratunde's latest blog post invites his readers to become his marketers.Finally, it seems like we are often more interested in discussing the meta of media than consuming media itself. I am under the impression that more people read Ethan's analysis of why we should read more global news than they actually read global news.

I skimmed through a couple issues while staying at his place in Austin, and it was enough to persuade me to pick up the latest issue last week in New York. I have mixed feelings about the journal, and they probably reflect the mixed feelings I have about myself. Like any good curation of content, you turn back the cover and you seem to enter a clandestine club of the chosen ones: clever contributing authors who set out from East Coast liberal arts and Ivy League schools to study Arabic in Cairo, poetry in Beijing, economic history in Argentina. (""So young and well educated but dressed like grandmothers from Palm Beach, even the men, with satin windbreakers and creative knitwear; thin, beautifully pale women in black tights and giant hair bows and men in snowflake sweaters and colorful socks,"" writes Emily Witt in That Room in Cambridge.) The continued tradition of intellectual colonialism: the mass migration of privileged 20- and 30-somethings traveling to far off lands to pen authoritative accounts of reality. I always saw Global Voices as an attempted antidote, yet I'm not so steeped in self-denial to pretend that I'm somehow an exception. I realize that I too have more time, more resources to travel, read, and reflect than any one person deserves. This is what I think as I read through n+1, sipping on my Mexico City macchiato.n+1 positions itself as a middle path between the isolated, ivory tower elitism of the academy (see Revolt of the Elites) and the complete, unfiltered accessibility of the Internet, where any mere mortal can publish without the validation of editors and advertisements. It wants to move the avant-garde out of the MFA, but it's also quick to defend the humanities as both an idea and noble profession. I enjoyed Benjamin Kunkel's political-economic history of Argentina, an excellent primer for anyone trying to understand Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's current popularity and the 200 years of tension between the urban center of political power and the rural control of economic power. I was caught off guard by how much I enjoyed Emily Witt's account of her year at Cambridge as a poetry-illiterate Yankee surrounded by artsy Brits who obsess over Moby Dick and J.H. Prynne. Andrew Jacobs' history of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — and the evolution of its interpretation as the web moved from 1.0 to 2.0 — is both thorough and thoughtful. And I took great pleasure in Gemma Sieff's juxtaposition of the photography of Terry Richardson (Vice Magazine & porno-marketing) and Charles Graner (Abu Ghraib). Sieff makes a convincing case that the imagery of Abu Ghraib is subtly influencing Manhattan marketing. Or, perhaps more accurately, that the advertisements of, say, Belvedere Vodka and the photographs of Abu Ghraib each speak to a deeper, collective American psychosis as 13-year-olds grow up watching triple anal penetration as if it ain't no thang.I was less impressed by Luc Boltanski's account of publishing a new journal of sociology with Pierre Bourdieu, which struck me as rooted in insecurity and hero worship. Nor could I get into the only contribution penned by someone outside of the Ivy League elite, the young Yelena Akhtiorskaya from Odessa, Ukraine. Her personal narrative fiction was too staccato to pull me in.But I picked up the issue for the two lead essays, both of which speak to issues that have been circling in my head over the past few months: the recent fetishization of data over narrative and the deadening omnipresence of music everywhere we turn, a manifesto for the celebration of silence:What if we tried to listen to nothing? Silence is the feature of our buzzing sound-world we enjoy least, whose very existence we threaten to pave over track by track. Silence is the most endangered musical experience in our time. Turning it up, we might figure out what all our music listening is meant to drown out, the thing we can't bear to hear....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 17, 2011","Jun 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10972096-n-1-issue-11

It's safe to say this will be the literary hallmark of the new century, with the internet its Gutenberg. And post-nationalism itself is a sign of hope. After centuries of barbarity, a Union in Europe only became possible when it was harder to define who was French or German or Italian or Dutch. We can imagine what the world would be like if only Americans would become post-American.Eliot Weinberger, 2005I can think of no greater exemplar of post-national literature than Teju Cole's first novel, Open City. It is European in structure and theory, American in its candor, and Nigerian in its attention to detail. But it transcends all of these national labels. As Cole has written elsewhere:I write all this from multiple positions. I write as an African, a black man living in America. I am every day subject to the many microaggressions of American racism. I also write this as an American, enjoying the many privileges that the American passport affords and that residence in this country makes possible. I involve myself in this critique of privilege: my own privileges of class, gender, and sexuality are insufficiently examined.Little happens in this novel. It doesn't tell a story; it evokes a mood. A slow, reflective mood under grey skies and always near forgotten monuments. As Cole has cheekily described his fiction writing, ""I try to move at such a slow pace that if you have trouble sleeping, it will knock you out."" But it doesn't. You always want to read on. Many nights I left my reading lamp on past one in the morning. It's not that I was waiting for something to happen; rather, I was soaking in the mood of the novel in the same way one might soak in the winter sun passing through an apartment window.This book provoked a great sense of nostalgia for a former me, or at least my current perception of a past version of myself, more curious and astute. Like Cole, I too took time to reflect on the spaces and relationships that filled my days, the curious situations and the slow trajectories that gave them shape. ""You're so observant,"" was the compliment that most filled me with pride. But observance is little more than the manifestation of curiosity, and I once struggled to understand those who were not curious. Who wouldn't stare endlessly at a map, tracing with one's fingers the rivers and mountain ranges? Who wouldn't take the time to visit the local history museum to learn the past that unfolded underneath our feet? Who wouldn't strike up a conversation with a perfect stranger to momentarily see the world through his or her eyes?Like Julius, the narrator of Open City, I used to do all of these things; I lived to do all of these things. But as the years have gone by, my curiosity has diminished. A combination of Open City and new year's resolutions has inspired me to once again cultivate my curiosity, document my observations, and saunter at least once a week. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 21, 2013","Dec 29, 2013","Jun 18, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8526694-open-city

We mostly survive by keeping our heads down, locking out the rest of the world, isolating ourselves in our earbuds, screens, and living rooms. When Joshua Bell, one of the world's greatest classical musicians, pulled out his Stradivari violin to play for free at a Washington DC metro station, most passerby were incapable of snapping out of their morning daze to stop and pay attention. Extraordinarily few events are truly cathartic, not for a single individual, but genuine collective catharsis. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the freedom of Nelson Mandela, the Cuban Revolution, 9/11. They are events rooted in emotion, they change our worldview, and they seem to actually change the world around us, even as the initial moment of catharsis is inevitably circumscribed by the determined shortcomings of human nature.[image]Colum McCann has written elsewhere that he set out to write a book about 9/11. An Irish emigre, living in New York and teaching at Hunter College, he experienced firsthand how the day changed New York City. His father-in-law was among the lucky ones who escaped from the second tower before it crumbled to ground zero. But those memories, those images, were still too raw, too recent, to view through the looking glass of a novelist. He needed an allegory, which he found even before 9/11, tucked away in Paul Auster's 1992 The Red Notebook. The 100-page collection of stories mentions Philippe Petit, a 61-year-old mischievous Frenchman who on August 7, 1974 walked a tightrope from one Twin Tower to the other. Writes McCann:Shortly after 9/11 everything in Manhattan seemed to have intimate meaning ... A car on 85th Street sat collecting parking tickets at first, but they soon became flowers: On the dashboard was a fireman's parking permit ... Somehow each thing was linked with the next and the last.The question, as a writer, was how to find meaning at all when there was, in plain sight, a world charged with meaning ...The tightrope walk was an act of creation that seemed to stand in direct defiance to the act of destruction twenty-seven years later.[image]Philippe Petit walking on a metal cable between the Twin Towers as an airplane passes overhead. Photograph by Vic DeLuca, 1974.McCann immediately began researching New York City circa 1974 and the novel is a testament to his due diligence, but it doesn't get bogged down by historical trivia. As McCann continued his research, the famous high-wire walk became much more visible to my generation. Petit himself published an autobiographical account in 2002, which was then turned into a stunning 2008 documentary (available via streaming on Netflix).  [image]But wait, that's not what this novel is about at all. Rather, Petit's daring walk becomes an anchor, a single event with which to examine a single year in a single city from multiple perspectives as lives criss and cross with little consideration of all that leads to our every interaction. This is what makes McCann's writing breathtaking. It takes one hell of a ballsy novelist to have a go at narrating from the first-hand perspective of a neurotic Park Avenue housewife, a late-career prostitute in the Bronx, a burned out city judge, a Guatemalan nurse. But he does all of this and much more with seemingly little effort. And from the lives of the characters we begin to piece together some of the emerging trends of 1974: the soldiers back from Vietnam and desperate for sex and drugs, the creeping understanding of the eventual impact of ARPANET, the epidemic of housing fires in the South Bronx, the boom of liberation theology.This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for nearly two years now. I'm not sure what inspired me to finally pick it up this month, but it made for fortuitous companionship. When a character narrated her experience on 53rd and Lexington, there I was, at a hotel just two blocks away. When another character was mugged in Harlem near 5th avenue and 120th Street, I was once again just a few blocks away, reading myself to sleep at a friend's apartment. New York City today is so different from the New York of 1974 that it was at times difficult to believe McCann's portrayal. And yet I know that his descriptions are grounded in impeccable research, that the city really has changed so radically in such short time (even if today's subway rats are the very descendants of their 1974 forefathers).It is difficult to compare 1974 with today and not come away with some sense of optimism. The world — or at least New York City — has become a more tolerant, more respectful, safer place to live. I traveled to New York, in part, to see if I could ever live there. I gave myself a full seven days; from SoHo to Harlem, Newark to Brooklyn, all the way over to Long Island. I wanted to consume and digest the entire city, to let it envelope me, to make it my own, to see it from the eyes of a resident. But quickly I realized that I came with a fundamentally flawed strategy. New York City is too much of an experience for any one person to understand. Residents quickly learn to break it down into its comfortable, component parts. ""You can't treat New York City as a single entity,"" one friend tells me as I complain about sensory overload and exhaustion. ""I've got my weekly dinner friends and my community garden ... you know, you learn to find your spaces, your routine."" And by necessity, you begin to shut the rest out, turn your senses off, hide in your iPod, magazine, and private world of private thoughts.Literature is still a wonderful trick to break down those component parts we all create and tie it all together again. ""One of the points of this novel,"" writes fellow Hunter College professor Nathan Englander, ""is that, no matter how many worlds New York contains within it, it's really a wonderful, singular, unified city."" McCann begins the novel with a quote from Aleksandar Hemon: ""All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.""The concern, of course, is that literature becomes our escapism, our excuse to see individuals and communities unlike our own without ever actually interacting with them. That literature becomes an isolated end in itself rather than an inspirational beginning to a fuller, more satisfactory life. I have recently begun reading three ""anti-armchair"" guides to Mexico City that set out to inspire readers to cross their ordinary social boundaries. All three, beautifully designed guides are available in their entirety online. They are a starting point for me to piece together my own urban tapestry, even if I could never reach the eloquence and ambition of McCann....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 12, 2011","Jun 13, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

Yet by August 2010, it was nearly impossible to watch the nightly news without suffering through yet another segment, interview, or monologue about the country's nini Phenomenon. Nini, ni estudian ni trabajan, they neither study nor work. The first mention of the term I am able to find in the Mexican press comes from the February 2010 edition of Proceso magazine. In his article, The Mexican Ninis, José Gil Olmos says he first heard the term from National Autonomous University rector, José Narro Robles.In Mexico there are at least seven million, and worldwide many more. They are young people with no future, or, if they have one, it is hopeless, bleak, and shameful. This is a generation marked by disappointment. They are now called the ""Ninis,"" and previously were the ""emos"" and generation X.In September 2010 alone, there were at least 161 mentions of the term ""Ninis"" in mainstream Mexican media. It became a favorite buzzword by politicians and talking heads. Unemployed Mexican youth were blamed for the country's insecurity, its slow growth, and the pervasive pessimism that hangs above the metropolis like the ever-present, yellowish layer of smog. César Duarte, the governor of Chihuahua, even proposed mandatory military service for all Mexican youth who are not enrolled in school or employed. Kent Paterson of the Center for International Policy declared 2010 the ""year of the nini.""  [image]The February 2011 issue of Bloomberg Businessweek - ""The Kids Are Not Alright"" - internationalized the alleged nini phenomenon:In Tunisia, the young people who helped bring down a dictator are called hittistes—French-Arabic slang for those who lean against the wall. Their counterparts in Egypt, who on Feb. 1 forced President Hosni Mubarak to say he won't seek reelection, are the shabab atileen, unemployed youths. The hittistes and shabab have brothers and sisters across the globe. In Britain, they are NEETs—""not in education, employment, or training."" In Japan, they are freeters: an amalgam of the English word freelance and the German word Arbeiter, or worker. Spaniards call them mileuristas, meaning they earn no more than 1,000 euros a month. In the U.S., they're ""boomerang"" kids who move back home after college because they can't find work. Even fast-growing China, where labor shortages are more common than surpluses, has its ""ant tribe""—recent college graduates who crowd together in cheap flats on the fringes of big cities because they can't find well-paying work.The current protests in Spain have brought the buzzword back to the Op-Ed pages of Mexican newspapers, but among all the punditry of just what to do with these typically overeducated and underemployed youth, very few Mexican journalists or anthropologists have shown any interest in actually trying to understand them. Daniel Hernandez is one of the few, and in many ways Down and Delirious can be read as an ethnography of Mexico's so-called ninis; youth who have not found meaningful employment, but have managed to create meaning through self-expression.Alain de Botton reminds us that just one hundred years ago it was rarely expected that we would marry for love. As little as 20 years ago work was still seen as work — a sacrifice we made in order to seek pleasure and leisure during our time off. Now an entire, global, connected generation wants to find meaningful work that creates pleasure in itself. But the market has not yet produced those jobs in sufficient quantity. And the youth keep waiting.The Donald Draper Complex[image]There were moments - plenty of them - when I felt undeniable envy; not so much of Daniel's writing, which is beautiful, but rather the seductive aesthetic that seems to shape around his every waking day. It is what first drew me into the novels of Henry Miller, Kerouac and Bukowski as an 18-year-old: the romantic revelry with hobos, drugs, prostitutes, starving artists, and sexual experimentation. While the rest of Mexico City's expats are sipping fashionable mezcal and making their way around the museum and gallery circuit, Daniel and his indie cinema cast of friends ""find an untouched watering hold and make it [their] own:""The little building looks both dead and drunk, unused, and at least two hundred years old. Around the corner, next to a permanent mound of fresh garbage and behind a metal grate, with no sign and no fixed name, sits our spot. It is just one room big and the bathroom is revolting. Nothing decorates the walls but a sticky film best left uninvestigated. Roaches the size of small rodents sometimes amble across the tile floor, giving me the frightening impression that they have large and complex brains. Old prostitutes, gangly old gay men, transvestites or transgendered ladies with saggy chins, gangsters, women with only a few precious bits of teeth hanging from their gums, dealers—it’s their spot, too. We get to know the “owners” and become quite acquainted with the running melodramas of the place.Daniel's Mexico City is mythical. Somehow he is able to find a little Charles Bukowski wherever he goes. Each night, as I flicked through another chapter on my ipad, my own life began to feel increasingly sterile, predictable, institutional. More meetings, more proposals, more white papers, more conferences. Half way through Daniel's book I read a discussion between two old-school allies, Antonio Lopez and Erik Davis, which was yet another reminder of how far my life had drifted from the West Coast, wannabe Bohemianism of my younger days. There were nights when I felt a nearly uncontrollable urge to surround myself with the ""artists, writers, punks, filmmakers, druggies, psychonaughts, Bohemians, and homeless crazies,"" in the words of Antonio. Other nights I nearly hopped in my car to seek out a bag of mushrooms and some hippie encampment outside of Palenque. I reflected on where this urge came from. A lasting vestige of my need to rebel against the monotony and sterility of Southern California's suburbs? An early onset of a midlife crisis?I'm not sure. Nor do I know why Daniel celebrates the hunger of the starving artist and the lunacy of the sobbing transvestite prostitute. Is it the life of the writer? Seeking out the esoteric underground to become its literary ambassador for the intellectual class? Or is it actually an aesthetic choice, our daily actions and discriminations wrapped up in fashion, photographs, waiting to be pinned down by marketers and magazines?It is impossible to write about Mexico and not identityThis is a book about identity on multiple levels. First, and most obviously, Daniel's own struggle to see himself through the eyes of other Mexicans:One day a roommate brought a friend over to our apartment. The friend was a young, redheaded, blue-eyed native of Mexico City, dressed like a gutter punk, who was “hanging around” California. I told the young Mexican girl my parents were Mexican and that I was born in San Diego, that we’re from Tijuana. “But you’re not really Mexican,” the girl responded. I was not? Until then I had always been under the impression that the world perceived me as Mexican, like it or not. I felt Mexican—stuck between a dominant American culture that shunned the “Mexican” within its society, and contemporary Mexicans back in Mexico who found it so easy to dismiss our mixed heritage as somehow unrelated to theirs. Around that time films such as Amores Perros and Y Tu Mamá También were opening up radically new conceptions of Mexican life for people north of the border. The same should have been true in the opposite direction. But no. As a Mexican American, born in gringo territory, I was still excluded from the national narrative in Mexico.But it is also a dissection of the many identities of Mexico City's urban tribes. Emos, hipsters, cholos, punks, rappers, graffiti artists, neo-indigenist peace pipe passers, fashionistas, cult worshippers — he tries to understand them all; at times by ing the literature, but usually by inserting himself into their circles.There is one last, more subtle, layer of identity meditation, and that is Daniel's own coming of age from 2002 when he graduates from Berkeley and books a one-way flight to Mexico City, and the end of 2010 when he finishes the book's manuscript. Throughout the book the references to homosexuality and sexual liberation are both subtle and pervasive. Daniel's relationship with the entire world seems to take on an erotic androgyny. From a conversation with a friend (boyfriend? we don't know, it doesn't seem to matter) about Mexico City's fashion scene:You can see it in other designers here as well. they are merging the global with the local, applying the austere lines and geometries of international couture with the playfulness and surreal qualities of everyday life in Mexico. They are also disciples of the power of androgyny. Among independent young labels, garments are offered as unisex, expressing in a simple article of clothing a belief in the idea that the male and female exist equally within the self.Down and Delirious complicates how we think about sexuality among Mexico City's youth. I have no idea if Daniel is heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. Those categories simply don't seem relevant, and the careful reader senses a deliberate effort to transcend them completely. It struck me that, perhaps, Daniel could have only achieved such transcendence of the usual notions of sexuality here in Mexico City. Back in California the genres of hetero and homo are too well defined, while Mexico City is still exploring its first sexual revolution with daily improvisation.So open it hurtsIn 1970, Boston Globe magazine editor Bill Cardoso first referred to Hunter S. Thompson's unique style of journalism as ""gonzo,"" and so emerged a new sub-genre of narrative reporting that inserts the observer into the observation. Today another, new sub-genre of writing is upon us — a slightly forced marriage between the frantic hyper-connectedness of the web and the reflective, iterative re-writing that eventually leads to a book. There is no shortage of blogs that have become books (there is even software to automate the process), but Down and Delirious strikes me as much more ambitious than an edited aggregation of Daniel's excellent blog, Intersections. Spanish speakers can get a better sense of what he is after in this video to introduce a workshop Daniel will be giving on digital journalism at .357.The characters in Daniel's book are also the same avatars leaving comments on his Facebook wall as I write this. It is impossible to separate the book from the blog, and impossible to separate the blog from every passing day, comment, conversation. We are witnessing a new genre that represents a generation that has grown up over-sharing, that has never been timid to offer an opinion even before learning all the facts, that can frequently share its deepest secrets with the wider public more easily than with its closest friends. It is a generation and a genre of writing that has learned to be so open it hurts. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Mar 23, 2011","May 23, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9733238-down-and-delirious-in-mexico-city

The concept of free will — acting without the constraints of fate or the anesthesia of passivity — becomes the primordial raison d'être, the bedrock upon which we decide our every daily action and reaction. I will improve my relationships with all of my family members, I tell myself. I will strive to understand the greatest aspirations of my closest friends. I will love my work and I will work for love. I will always look at the passing countryside through the eyes of a painter. I will examine each social situation with the empathy and curiosity of a novelist. I will listen to every song as if were Mozart's last concert. I will make love with the enveloping desire that stretches our senses taut and leaves behind the less holy, savage world of honking cars and passing jumbo jets. I have seen death, I tell myself, and now I know how I want to live the rest of my life.Months and years go on. For our sanity, we, the non-believers, repress even the slightest reflection of death and the road between right now and the eventual day when whoever remains will stand solemnly around our grave, the vessels to carry forth any influence or wisdom we may have imparted; perhaps even the very DNA — that mysterious computational code of life — that has been handed down from generation to generation since our zoological ancestors. Which is to say that we repress the overwhelming evidence of our constant biological decomposition. This is a novel about biological decomposition. About our bodies breaking down even when our minds are not ready to; even when we are intelligent enough to know that there is, in fact, no distinction between mind and body. About the loneliness and regret that await us when we are able to take stock of every wrong decision, of every selfish act, of the detriment we've caused others, and thus ourselves. At 75-years-old, atonement (""reconciliation between God and man,"" says the OED), must seem absurd to the non-believer. Eventually I assume that we reach the age where we simply try not to think about such things and we wait for our time to come.Everyman is the most metaphysically depressing book I have ever read. It only took two days to finish, yet every ten pages I asked myself, What is this all for? This highlighting of pages, this reading of newspapers, this traveling around the world, this working toward slightly more transparent governments. Why? I still have no answers; only that it is usually better to not ask such existential questions. Or, perhaps, the remedy is to come face to face once more with death. We are all emotional philosophers after all....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 11, 2011","May 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50695.Everyman

Alain de Botton digs deep into the writings and life of Marcel Proust as a frame to meditate on nine topics:How to love life todayHow to read for yourselfHow to take your timeHow to suffer successfullyHow to express your emotionsHow to be a good friendHow to open your eyesHow to be happy in loveHow to put books downThis all boils down to two essential maxims: 1) live life as honestly and kindly as possible and 2) appreciate the small things in life; look at the world through the eyes of an artist.I have been told that Proust's Remembrance of Things Past is much more than a seven-part novel; it's the investment of at least a year of your life. And I have yet to invest that year, though I know I will when the opportune moment presents itself. But it is interesting to see that in the past five years the novel has served as inspiration for both a self-help book and an introduction to neuroscience. (After encountering Proust's great novel, Virginia Woolf claimed that she would never write again because she could never express herself or the world as clearly and beautifully as he.)De Botton reminds us that writers are rarely as interesting as what they write. Any published book is often the result of years of reflection distilled and compressed from an individual's greatest moments of eloquence. An informal chat over a chicken sandwich just can't compete.He's probably right. I probably would be slightly disappointed if I had a chance to sit down with de Botton over dinner, but then again, if his conversation with Russ Roberts about the evolution of labor is representative, then the man is quite the conversationalist as well.

Here we are by happenstance, it turns out, the sons and daughters of survivalism and sexuality. There was all of a sudden only one thing to set us apart from the roughly 8.7 million other million species on this planet: our ability to process, document, and share information. But what is information?Only now do I appreciate the exceeding difficulty of answering what seems like such a straightforward question. You don't know it when you see it; you don't see it at all. Even my usually authoritative-soundng Oxford English Dictionary comes up pathetically short: ""what is conveyed or represented by a particular arrangement or sequence of things.""  1In interviews James Gleick has said that this is a book he has wanted to write nearly his entire life. The sweeping bibliography and index justify the delay. It took me three months to read — albeit with many other books and pauses interspersed. A deep analysis of something as abstract as 'information' leaves the reader staring often at the ceiling, trying to make sense of the perpetually perplexing.  2 Can information exist without communication? Is there such a thing as knowledge, or is some information merely more useful in particular contexts? Is genetic information really information — based on bits, communicated by computers? Can we eventually capture all of the genetic information of the entire biosphere on a single hard drive? And, if so, is that all we are, a humble collection of bits and algorithms? If those algorithms are pre-decided, then is our destiny as well?The book begins with a quote from Zadie Smith, and it is quite possibly the most unremarkable paragraph she has ever written; except that, when placed in this new context, it speaks directly to an inquietude that now overwhelms us all:Anyway, those tickets, the old ones, they didn't tell you where you were going, much less where you came from. He couldn't remember seeing any dates on them, either, and there was certainly no mention of time. It was all different now, of course. All this information. Archie wondered why that was.Give that information (sometimes referred to as 'culture', 'facts', 'intelligence', 'data', 'meaning', 'dogma' and 'knowledge') is what distinguishes humans from our primate predecessors, it is incredible that there was no technical definition at all until 1949 when Claude Shannon published ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication,"" giving rise to the theoretical fields of information theory and Information Science, but also to practical engineering approaches to storing information on magnetic tape and communicating it across networks. As the subtitle discloses from the get-go, this is a book that treats its topic from three different angles. First we are given an overview of the history of information before we knew how to define it. Here there are African drums that talk, optical telegraph towers constructed across France at the height of the revolution, and Samuel Morse's electric telegraph and famous code.Next we delve into theory, specifically information theory and its various applications in communication, biology, physics, chemistry and quantum mechanics. At times Gleick seems to exuberantly make the case for information theory as a Theory of Everything.  3 This was most economically and mystically expressed in 1989 by John Wheller: ""It from bit."" Information is physical, it must be stored on tangible objects, and must therefore obey the laws of physics. ""To do anything requires energy. To specify what is done requires information.""If all of this sounds increasingly abstract, it only becomes more so, until the theory eventually reaches an apex of abstraction: quantum computing, the fundamentals of which remain beyond my cerebral grasp. For me, the most startling and intriguing ramification of information theory is that information is a measure of probability. 1010101010 contains less information than 1010100011, despite their same quantity of digits, as the former can be expressed by ""repeat 10 five times"" whereas the latter is seemingly random. The significance is that information, randomness, complexity, and computability are four different ways to express the same principle; namely, that 'information' refers to that which we cannot predict.And then I stare at the ceiling.There are increasing accusations against information theory. It has overstepped its application, some say, limiting our understanding of natural processes by viewing everything through a metaphor of bits. As early as 2000 Paul E Griffiths called genetic information ""a metaphor in search of a theory."" Gleick devotes an entire chapter to exploring the math behind claims that information theory is reductionist, beginning with Gödel's notorious incompleteness theorems and ending with Laplace's Demon. It is a frustrating chapter; just when the concept of information seems to make so much sense, it turns out not to.And then I stare at the ceiling.Finally, we enter the third section of the book, the flood. As information becomes exponentially cheaper to store, it becomes exponentially cheaper to ""create."" Hence, as Google's Eric Schmidt is eager to remind audiences, ""every two days we now create as much information as we did up to 2003."" In Claude Shannon's groundbreaking paper he estimated the size of the greatest store of information known to humanity at the time, the Library of Congress. Shannon estimated that it was probably around a terabyte. He was very close. Today CERN generates 1 petabyte of data per second — that's 1,000 terabytes per second.Gleick writes with sympathetic compassion toward those of us who are overwhelmed by the flood. Citing a beautiful essay by David Foster Wallace, he reminds us that making decisions depends on eliminating options, and that we now have more information, more options, to eliminate than ever. He cites psycho-neurological research that shows we often make worse decisions when confronted with more information, even if it is entirely relevant.But in his  of The Information for the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson is decidedly less sympathetic toward the info-overwhelmed. Wikipedia, he reminds us, is a product of the flood, as is 21st century science.Ultimately, we are reminded, information is a part of evolution, and it is now up to us to adapt or drown in the flood.I only have one bone to pick with Gleick's nearly masterful overview of information, and that is his silent transition from bits to meaning. On one page he is summarizing the difficulties of incorporating classical information theory into quantum computing, and the very next page he describes the birth of Wikipedia.Wikipedians like to claim that they are organizing all of the world's knowledge, but 'knowledge' turns out to be even more difficult to define than information. We know how to measure economic capital, but intellectual capital is a guessing game. Einstein's theory of relativity probably contains more 'knowledge' than whoever came up with the idea to make a sandwich with peanut butter, honey, and banana — but only in certain circumstances. In other words, ""meaning"" refers to relevance, which is inherently subjective.Gleick emphasizes from the very beginning — and throughout the book — that Shannon's paper and the birth of information theory was only made possible by divorcing information from meaning. But he doesn't even attempt to draw the fuzziest of lines between the two, though he does seem disposed to the human-centric view of Heinz von Foerster who argued at an early cybernetics conference that it was fundament able to distinguish between the ""beep beeps"" of information theory and the ""process of understanding,"" the decoding, that takes place in the human brain. To put it another way, ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and information is in the head of the receiver."" 1 ☞ Apparently I don't have the latest version of the OED; in a blog post for the New York Review of Books, Gleick notes that the latest entry for 'information' now runs 9,400 words and prompted an essay-length meditation by OED managing editor Michael Proffitt. After all, Gleick reminds us, OED is in the information business, like so many of us.2 ☞ My intellectual insecurity was somewhat soothed when I saw that Cory Doctorow — voracious reader and perversely prolific writer — frequently ""stopped reading it a lot … stopped to stare into space and go 'huh' and 'wow' and 'huh' again.""3 ☞ ""Why does nature appear quantized?"" Gleick rhetorically asks before answering himself: ""Because information is quantized. The bit is the ultimate, unsplittable particle.""...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 11, 2011","Sep 03, 2011","Apr 11, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8701960-the-information

When I hear the prevalent claims of false nostalgia that ""modern writers can't compete with the classics,"" I oftenI had a personal stake in this one. When I hear the prevalent claims of false nostalgia that ""modern writers can't compete with the classics,"" I often point to Barbara Kingsolver as an obvious illustration of literary prowess that far exceeds even the greatest excerpts of eloquence by the likes of Balzac, Voltaire, Cervantes, Joyce, Flaubert, Dostoyevsky, and (yawn) Shakespeare. I believe that The Poisonwood Bible is a masterpiece — and it is difficult for me to distinguish my real-life experiences in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2000 with the landscapes and charachters of Kingsolver's books that I read while I lived there: The Bean Trees, Pigs in Heaven, Animal Dreams, and High Tide in Tucson. Many of her interests are my own. She began as a science writer, focused on ecology and evolutionary biology. She is an environmental advocate, though balances her arguments with a strong sympathy toward labor. In 2005, before it became mainstream, Kingsolver spent a year eating food produced as locally as possible, and then penned the account in Animal, Vegetable, Miracle (of which I have only read excerpts).In short, Kingsolver had a formidable influence during a formative year. When I heard that her most recent book - the first in more than nine years - was a fictional synthesis of Mexican and American history from 1929 to 1951, I felt once again that Kingsolver and I remained connected through that magical bond of imagination and observation that often exists between writer and reader.This is not Kingsolver's most impressive work, which is why I can (perhaps) understand Maureen Corrigan's insistence that the novel is, in a word, boring. (Liesl Schillinger's NYT , on the other hand, calls it 'breathtaking.') Kingsolver is a writer who has always asked for a fairly patient reader. He or she who is able to log out of Twitter and get lost in the detailed description of mother nature's aesthetic and its constant reflection of our own flawed human nature. This is also very much a historical novel - rooted in Kingsolver's ever-methodical research, which began all the way back in 2002. It is her ability to bring well researched history alive that makes The Lacuna such a worthwhile read. San Ángel, Coyoacan, the Zócalo: they are no longer just places filled with people. They are also now haunted by the rewarding ghosts of history, reminders that today's realizations and headlines are not so distant from those of yesteryear.And, indeed, like most historical novelists, Kingsolver uses themes of the past to comment on today's issues. (She actually does this in layers, as the protagonist is also a novelist who writes about the distant past to comment on the loss of civil liberties during the start of the Cold War.) As Bob Garfield remarked in this week's On the Media in response to Pew Research Center's Andrew Kohut's claim that 39% of Americans are in favor of book banning:I've noticed a kind of cognitive dissonance - I think that would be the nicest way I could phrase it - between our notion of going to war to protect our freedoms, a bit of rhetoric that is often mouthed, and Americans' willingness to suspend those very freedoms on the home front as a matter of national security.That statement is one of the central themes of the book, especially during its second half. A less rewarding theme is Kingsolver's focus on fame and how artists are remembered in the public imagination. This 'theme,' however, plays out much more like a rant. From a worthwhile interview with The Guardian:Yet emerging celebrities such as Frida Kahlo take control of their own image. ""We're all required to do that,"" Kingsolver says. ""I never wanted to be famous, and still don't."" So, she chuckles, ""the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most."" She created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones, ""as a defense to protect my family from misinformation. Wikipedia abhors a vacuum. If you don't define yourself, it will get done for you in colorful ways.""Such 20th century protect-my-identity paranoia (""Barbara Kingsolver | The Authorized Site: This is the only author website managed by the Office of Barbara Kingsolver"") makes me sigh. But it doesn't take away from the beauty of Kingsolver's writing.

(1995 was the same year that Pamuk was tried along with several other authors for his support of Kurdish political rights in Turkey.) The book reads like a cross of Franz Kafka with Paulo Coelho. The Coelho half (fate, destiny, love, a cyclical plot) explains the book's mass appeal; the influence of Kafka points to Pamuk's desire to become part of the post-modern canon (something he writes and lectures about frequently).This is a book about books, and about the transformational power a single book can hold - especially on the youth:I had heard of others who had read a book only to have their lives disintegrate. I'd read the account of someone who had read a book called Fundamental Principles of Philosophy; in total agreement with the book, which he read in one night, he joined the Revolutionary Proletarian Advance Guard the very next day, only to be nabbed three days later robbing a bank and end up doing time for the next ten years. I also knew about those who had stayed awake the whole night reading books such as Islam and the New Ethos or The Betrayal of Westernization, then immediately abandoned the tavern for the mosque, sat themselves on those ice-cold rugs doused with rosewater, and began preparing patiently for the next life which was not due for another fifty years. I had even met some who got carried away by books with titles like Love Sets You Free or Know Yourself, and although these people were the sort who were capable of believing in astrology, they too could say in all sincerity, ""This book changed my life over-night!""All lovers of great fiction have experienced this feeling, right? I've had it many times; that after reading some novel an element of life that previously was blurry or entirely unseen comes into crisp focus. But it tends to happen in such a way that the realization itself is impossible to aphorize. You simply have to read the book.Which is why we do. In fact, I'm convinced that those minor glimpses of personal enlightenment - and the satisfaction they give - are a major part of why I continue to read, even if I tend to forget the books themselves a few years down the road. Those books - the kind that really change your life, the ones you recommend to everyone and then grow despondent when they merely shrug their shoulders after coming to the last page - can do both harm and good. They could bring you closer to your family, relieve you of stress, convince you to live a healthier life. But just as easily, such an influential book could make you paranoid, drive you away from you friends, convince you to kill the president of your country, or the world's most famous rock star. (Two infamous assassins, Mark Chapman - John Lennon's assassin - and John Hinckley Jr. - President Regan's attempted assassin - were both found with copies of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye.)The New Life is mostly about the second kind of effect books can have, the kind that destroys lives and relationships. Still, Pamuk manages to insert all of his usual themes: East Vs. West, the nostalgia of local material goods, the paranoia of conservative Islam, the Turkish empire in its final and complete decline, the ever-present irrational variable that is love and lust:When I press my lips on that semitransparent skin between your ear and your hair, when the electricity of your hair gives fright to the birds that suddenly swoop past my forehead and face, raising the scent of autumn in the air, and when your breast stiffens like a stubborn bird taking wing in my palm, look, I see in your eyes how full and right is the unattainable time that reawakens between us: now we are neither here nor there, not in the land you have been dreaming about, not on some bus or in a dim hotel room somewhere, not even in some sort of future that can only exist within the pages of a book.Despite the occasional piercing paragraph like the one above, this book, for me, failed to deliver. It is too much shoe polish, not enough substance. It's the girl with the heavy eye shadow who speaks in half-allusions and riddles to hide the fact that she really has nothing to say. I'm sure that if I re-read the book from start to finish I would discover that some of those riddles and oft-repeated abstractions actually point back to clues sprinkled throughout the book's first half. But I don't read novels for the thrill of a crossword puzzle. I seek beautiful ideas expressed beautifully by characters I come to care for, or even loathe. In The New Life there was none of this, and much of the writing (or at least its translation) was awkward and clumsy, something the narrator even apologizes for:So, Reader, place your faith neither in a character like me, who is not all that sensitive, nor in my anguish and the violence of the story I have to tell; but believe that the world is a cruel place. Besides, this newfangled plaything called the novel, which is the greatest invention of Western culture, is none of our culture's business. That the reader hears the clumsiness of my voice within these pages is not because I am speaking raucously from a plane which has been polluted by books and vulgarized by gross thoughts; it results rather from the fact that I still have not quite figured out how to inhabit this foreign toy. Many of the novel's abstractions intend - I believe - to encourage the reader to think about how we each interpret and appropriate the books we read, as I am doing now. Appropriation, a recent topic of conversation around these parts, is something that Pamuk seems to obsess about. Jillian, having attended one of Pamuk's Norton Lectures, criticized the professor who introduced Pamuk for referring to ""world literature"" as an ""emerging field,"" of which Pamuk is an undeniable force. I think that Jillian is right to point out the parochialism of ignoring millennia of storytelling from all human groups since the evolution of language, or even before. (""Did language develop first and storytellers evolve from the use of it? Or did language evolve as a way to express the internal experiences of storytellers?"" asks Becky Hahn.)But it is worth pointing out that Pamuk himself, in an interview with Christopher Lydon, says that the modern novel is a European invention, and, further, the most universal medium of storytelling. (Many radio, TV, and even video game producers would surely beg to disagree.) Pamuk says that the challenge for novelists living outside of the West is to appropriate the form of the novel for themselves while still building upon the work of its European masters, and not just reacting to them. I think it remains to be seen: will literature ever truly transcend nationality? Is the novel so rooted in European culture that only a new form of storytelling can escape that continent's longstanding literary hegemony? Or, for that matter, will the novel as a medium and format, continue to exist at all?...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 04, 2010","Mar 10, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11694.The_New_Life

Improbably, in the face of obstacle after obstacle, Christianity had spread itself from JerusAbout a thousand years ago Europe was gripped with fear. Improbably, in the face of obstacle after obstacle, Christianity had spread itself from Jerusalem to Rome to Constantinople, throughout Western Europe, Saxony, even into England, Scandinavia, and Russia. Now, after that incredible diffusion and the fascinating power-play that underlaid it, Europe was finally united in worldview, moral foundation, and a sort of ecstatic anxiety that the end of the world was rapidly approaching. The very foundation of Christianity, we must remember, is built on the Messianic prophecy, the belief that Satan will appear on earth, followed by Jesus, the last judgement, and the establishment of the Kingdom of God. If that sounds a little far-fetched today, even by religious standards, then that just goes to show how much the church began adapting its talking points after the year 1033 (a thousand years after Jesus' death) came and went peacefully.Of course, the timing of reading this book is too perfect, which is what Babak told me when he gave it to me in Kiev. (Babak and I have been in touch via email for over four years, but never met in person. We had planned to in South Africa last year, but traffic was too heavy. Then, a few weeks ago, I was sitting across the breakfast table of a Ukrainian hostel when a guy with five o' clock shadow started telling me about his IT consulting in Zambia and Afghanistan. It took us a few minutes to realize the astonishing circumstance.)We are now, according to many, precisely three years away from the end of the world. This time it is not the prophecy of the bible, but rather the Mayan calendar, which allegedly ends in 2012. Actually, theories of the coming 2012 apocalypse are various and diverse. Here's one:""Timewave zero"" is a numerological formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of ""novelty"", defined as increase in the universe's interconnectedness, or organised complexity, over time. According to Terence McKenna, who conceived the idea over several years in the early-mid 1970s while using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT, the universe has a teleological attractor at the end of time that increases interconnectedness, eventually reaching a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable will occur instantaneously.The hipsters love this shit. If you recall, our last end of the world took place on new year's eve, 1999 - another great excuse for the consumption of drugs among my circle of friends.But the allure of the end of the world isn't just limited to churchgoers, science fiction writers, and mushroom-consuming, Yanni-listening new age hippies. In 2003 esteemed British Astronomer Martin Rees published Our Final Century: Will the Human Race Survive the Twenty-first Century? which estimates that humanity's chance of surviving this century is about 50-50. James Lovelock, the celebrated environmentalist wrote shortly thereafter ""Our future is like that above the Niagara Falls, now knowing that the engines are about to fail."" His estimate for the end of humankind? 2033, exactly 1,000 years after the great big scare documented here by Holland.I attend a lot of conferences and watch a lot of presentations by well known speakers. The delivery of their message often falls prey to the same Hollywood narrative: ""Humanity is at a crossroads, the end is near, there are signs that this is no longer sustainable, but here is X new technology, and if we use it for good then the world will be saved."" Why can't interpret our lives as something more - or different - than a Hollywood script? Why is it that we can't seem to find meaning in being human without imagining the end of all humankind? It is a question I considered in my  of The Road. A final end to all misery? A recognition of the ultimate futility in measuring our lives by the materials that surround us? The confirmation of a greater power, or a moral meaning to life?I really don't know because I have a tough time relating to all this apocalypse talk, but clearly there is something resonant and seductive about the end of the world, and clearly it has existed for a long, long time.[image]This book really isn't about the fears of the anticipated 1033 apocalypse. In fact, Tom Holland only devotes one section of a single chapter to that episode. Rather this is a narrative history of the spread of Christianity across Europe from the division of the Roman Empire in 330 to the reconquest of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099. You could get all the same information by clicking around on Wikipedia's ""History of Christianity"" page, but Millennium puts it into easy-to-read prose.It is written from an unapologetic Euro-Christian point of view. Any ethnic group not yet converted to Christianity is automatically described as barbarian:The Saxons, as they contemplated the heroic struggle to uphold God's order, knew themselves in its vanguard. Beyond the Elbe to the east, in sinister groves adorned with idols and animal horns, Slav tribes, known collectively by the Saxons as the 'Wends' still worshipped demons and indulged in their 'vain superstitions'; but westwards the very landscape bore witness to the protecting hand of Christ.But, of course, this was the perspective of the day. Christianity was the great tempering force of the time that marked modernity and sophistication in any community. (Much the same way we think about democracy today.)There is too much x-rated history - battles, deceit, rape, pillage, incest, etc, etc - to attempt to sum it all up in a single , but Noel Malcolm does his best in The Telegraph. This book certainly isn't for everyone, but if you want to better understand the dirty dynamics that led to the spread of Christianity throughout Europe leading up to the Crusades, then this is a great starting place.[image]1033 came and went just like Y2K came and went and just like 2012 will come and go. But after 1033 the Catholic Church needed to change its message. With the earth still revolving the church needed to offer its flocks something more than the Last Judgement. As early as 970, a crucifix had been erected in the cathedral of Cologne that portrayed something truly shocking: an image of the Saviour Himself, His eyes closed, His head lolling in death, His feet and hands nailed to the instrument of his execution. Half a century on, and the notion of 'fastening to Christ's Cross the picture of a dying man' remained a horrifying one to many Christians - and yet already the custom had spread as far as England. God Himself was rendered human.Following 1033 Jesus was increasingly portrayed as a human being, a human who suffered pain, whose pain we - as sinners - were all guilty for. Some sects of Christianity became so obsessed with the pain suffered by Jesus that they began to beat themselves with jagged stones in some strange showing of solidarity. Now any talk of the coming Last Judgement is seen as cultish and on the fringe. But at the turn of the millennium in Europe it was the centerpiece of the Christian worldview.I don't doubt that we'll wake up on December 22, 2012 ready to move on with our day and our lives. Nor do I doubt that soon enough a new end of the world, another prophecy, will make itself known....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 25, 2009","Nov 10, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5574571-millennium

I just couldn't get past all the name-dropping, all the parenthetical observations of who was wearing what label. It read like the intellectual's edition of some gossip column. Those same tendencies remain more than two decades later in The Year of Magical Thinking. For example:The last time I had been on such an escalator in the Garden was with John, in November, the night before we flew to Paris. We had gone with David and Jean Halberstam to see the Lakers play the Knicks. David had gotten the seats through the commissioner of the NBA, David Stern. The Lakers won.But in The Year of Magical Thinking I came to view such passages less as boasting and more as bursts of insecurity, of a woman grieving the loss of her husband of 40 years and trying to hold onto something of their past. I was able to forgive Didion for her high society name dropping because I could relate so much to the rest of what she was writing, and how she was writing it. The Year of Magical Thinking is a beautiful meditation on grief from someone with the unnatural talent to become consumed by mourning and yet observe the entire process lucidly.In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control.Information is control. And it is a coping mechanism. I am guilty of the same: to not feel the pain, I try instead to understand it. But Didion is able to convey both the understanding and the emotion, the intellect and the sentiment.There was one paragraph which was especially resonant:People who have recently lost someone have a certain look, recognizable maybe only to those who have seen that look on their own faces. I have noticed it on my face and I notice it now on others. The look is one of extreme vulnerability, nakedness, openness. It is the look of someone who walks from the ophthalmologist's office into the bright daylight with dilated eyes, or of someone who wears glasses and is suddenly made to take them off.Those four sentences so perfectly describe not only the expression, but the state of my grandmother after the death of my grandfather. Every time I visited her in the weeks and months following she had this look on her face as if she had just taken off her glasses, even when she hadn't. It has been a while since I've seen her. I'm glad that I will have a chance to in January; for The Year of Magical Thinking was also a reminder to make the most of the time we have with our friends and family....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 17, 2009","Aug 16, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking

Carr focuses on the trend toward centralized computing to make sense of mass quantities of information as cheaply and efficiently a possible. Weinberger aims his focus at new attempts to organize, categorize, and make sense of the information. I feel that both books also share the same weakness: Carr often uses his argument as a pretext to rant about all he sees as wrong with the Internet while Weinberger frequently makes unrelated tangents to defend his beloved Internet against the naysayers.Everything is Miscellaneous makes two basic arguments: 1.) there is no single way to categorize digital information and 2.) with so much information the role of knowledge is less about establishing objective truth and more about enabling common understanding. (More recently, Weinberger says ""transparency is the new objectivity"".)In the summer of 2002 I bought my first digital scanner. The previous year I took nine months off from school and traveled around the world on a ticket that cost me less than $2,000. I had two shoeboxes full of photos; one from the trip, and the other with every photo I took before the trip. The photos from my trip were organized by country, but the photos from before the trip were organized by person. Now I was about to scan them into my computer and I needed to come up with a standard system to organize them. Would I put them into folders based on person, place, event, camera, or even the type of photo (landscape, portrait, black & white, color, etc.)? Fortunately I decided on organizing them based on time, but it sure made it a pain in the ass to find all photos of a particular person.A few years later and I imported all my photos into iPhoto which allowed me to label each photo with multiple tags. Now every photo I import is tagged with its place, the people in it, the event, and the type of photo. If I want to see all my photos from South Africa or all my photos of Sparsh I simply perform the right search and an on-the-fly ""folder"" appears with the relevant photos. And it's not just photos I do this with. I tag my video using iMovie, my documents using Together, and even my financial records using Cha-Ching. But what is important is that tags allow us to place digital information in more than one digital shoebox. We organize information based on the appropriate context, and online context changes rapidly.I was hoping to learn some new information about tag-based organization of information, but this book pretty much sticks to the basics. I also wish that it did a better job dealing with some of the criticisms of tags, but Weinberger's blog is a much better resource for digging deeper on the issue than this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 10, 2009","Jul 08, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/726004.Everything_Is_Miscellaneous

Growing up I always had a lingering seLongtime readers know that I have a mild obsession with the topic of success, its definition, and lack thereof. Growing up I always had a lingering sensation that I was somehow expected to be successful and that I didn't meet that expectation. That tension between what I felt was expected of me and what I wanted to be was the root of endless and unnecessary stress throughout my years of teenage and college angst. Paradoxically, it was only when all those teachers, professors, employers, and family members gave up on me - stopped expecting success - that I was ready to set goals and work hard to achieve them. I say 'paradoxically' because, for Malcolm Gladwell, that expectation of success that most middle class kids feel growing up is often time responsible for their eventual success. Pointing to the ethnographic research of Annette Lareau, Gladwell argues that middle class parents raise their kids with a sense of positive entitlement in which they are expected to engage authoritative figures, seek scarce resources, and compete for highly regarded institutions and positions. He excerpts her anecdotes of Alex Williams, a middle class Black teenager raised by wealthy parents, and Katie Brindle, a lower-class White teenager who is mostly without extracurricular activities or parental support. Writes Gladwell:""Alex Williams is better off than Katie Brindle because he's wealthier and because he goes to a better school, but also because - and perhaps this is even more critical - the sense of entitlement that he has been taught is an attitude perfectly suited to succeeding in the modern world.""[image]America loves her Heratio Alger stories: young immigrant arrives with a few pennies in his pocket, works harder and more creatively than anyone else, and ends up becoming big man on Wall Street. Outliers is essentially a collection of anecdotes which deconstructs the myths of America's self-made gazillionaires. Bill Gates was successful because he was one of only a handful of teenagers who had access to a time-sharing computer terminal as a high schooler (The same high school that my cousin, now at Harvard, attended). Bill Joy was similarly successful because he scammed his way into spending more time at the University of Michigan computer lab than anyone else. Joe Flom became one of New York City's most successful lawyers not in spite of being Jewish when Jews were discriminated against, but because of it. He was at the right place at the right time and took the profitable cases which his WASP peers in Manhattan then regarded as dirty work.Reading Outliers after Lewis Hyde's The Gift was, in a way, an interesting segue. Whereas Hyde's entire framework is built on the assumption that in this world there are ""gifted"" individuals, Gladwell's argument can be simplified as: Anyone we consider ""gifted"" was likely afforded opportunities (and, more importantly, afforded opportunities at the right time) that others were not.Reading Gladwell's ""Story of Success"", I couldn't resist thinking back over my own life and all the forks in the road that lead to my present space and place, right here, right now. Had I not moved down to Mexico, had I not attended the Internet and Society Conference, had the Berkman Center not received funding from MacArthur, had Global Voices not received funding from Reuters and the Knight Foundation ... all these seemingly minor factors, some of which I had influence over, others which I did not. But were it not for all of them, I'd be somewhere else. This very minute.In fact, similar to how everything comes into a new sort of focus after taking an introductory class to Marxism, critical race theory, or gender studies, so has life appeared through a new filter ever since I finished Outliers. Anytime someone tells me their journey to some spot on the spectrum of success, I wonder about all those important and uncontrolled opportunities that they might be leaving out. The high school teacher who gave them a second chance, the extra time to fill out a college application, the mentorship, or just being raised to believe in oneself.[image]All of Gladwell's books are filled with the irresistible anecdotes and clever interpretations which have made him our favorite pop social scientist. But sometimes it is too tempting to explain away the world using his polished aphorisms. I am sure that some idiot after reading Outliers strolled up to a Chinese graduate student studying at a cafe and said, ""you know, you guys are so hard-working 'cause your relatives worked on rice fields rather than wheat fields.""There is a case to be made there and Gladwell makes it well, but to say that the children of rice farmers are generally more successful than the children of corn or wheat farmers is ridiculous and doesn't hold up when you look at the American immigrant sons and daughters of rice farmers in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines. I really enjoyed Outliers and am glad that Gladwell is using his writing talent and position in the American public to help clarify the myth of self-made success. But how we define success is never questioned or even dealt with critically. At one point, Gladwell refers to the case of Christopher Langan - billed as the smartest man in America - 'depressing' because he was unable to succeed in academia despite his off-the-chart IQ and passionate interest in theoretical research.But is a tenured position in academia really the definition of a successful life? Even though Langan has worked as a construction worker, cowboy, firefighter, farmhand, and Long Island bouncer in order to pay the bills, he's also been able to conduct his research on the side and is in the process of publishing a book. Today, when a blogger like Markos Moulitsas can have as much influence on popular opinion as any university department head, and when the research tools available to university social scientists are also freely available on the internet, what does institutional support really signify in terms of success?...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Feb 2009,"Feb 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3228917-outliers

(Who liked to refer to himself as ""Citizen Train"" - check out the NYTimes article from the day he finished his trip in Tacoma, WA.)What I hadn't expected of Verne's novel is that it is such a blatant reminder of how far we've come in the last 135 years since colonialist superiority was treated as unquestioned fact:""The steamer passed along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.""Similar descriptions applied to Punjabis, Chinese, and Native Americans are littered throughout the book. It's also clear that, at the time of writing the novel, Verne was an unabashed Anglophile. Not only is the book a celebration of the British empire at its peak, but Verne is constantly praising Fogg's alleged English qualities (honor, stoicism, courage) and jabbing at his servent Passepartout's Frenchness (temperamental, impetuous, chatty).What I found fascinating about Around the World in 80 Days has nothing to do with the book itself, but rather how Jules Verne wrote it. When he was a young boy, according to accounts of relatives, he ran away from home and attempted to sail out to sea to follow the adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Having failed, he promised his mother that ""henceforth I will travel only in dream."" For the rest of his writing career Verne rarely traveled. Rather he would surround himself with books and research the landscapes of his novels without ever setting foot there himself.In the words of Ethan, Jules Verne might be what you consider an OG bridgeblogger. If you have even the most remote interest in African issues then you probably follow Ethan's blog. He is incredibly talented at consuming and digesting large volumes of information about a complicated topic and then presenting that information in an easy-to-follow narrative that doesn't simplify its complexity. But in all my years of following Ethan's blog I think he's only traveled to Africa for two short conference-related trips. The obvious difference between Ethan and Jules (apart from the fact that Ethan is both nicer and more empathetic) is the number of research and communication tools that we now have at our disposal. Verne had his local library, letters, and the telegraph. Today, apart from being able to glimpse the front pages of hundreds of newspapers from around the world at the Newseum, we are also able to learn about the world around us in real time thanks to Global Voices, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Google Earth. What's more, we can - and often do - develop real and meaningful friendships from our interactions on those sites.Still, there is something about being on the ground, there in person, that allows you to soak in and understand new lands, cultures, and customs in a way that even the most advanced virtual worlds could never rival. I doubt that Ethan would be such an impassioned Africaphile were it not for his time spent in Ghana. And Joi is right, if he really wants to understand the Middle East, the best thing to do is move there. (Though mentioning United Arab Emirates' tax benefits would have been a brave gesture of sincerity.)I do understand that increased international travel is neither good for our environment nor our budgets. But, done responsibly, it is good for humanity. The more we experience other cultures the more we understand about ourselves and our place in the world. Which is why I wholly support initiatives like Abby Falik's Global Citizen Year fellowship program (which hopefully won't be bogged down by the bureaucracy, legacy, and politics of Peace Corps). As Michael Naimark notes in a smart essay on the 80plus1 website, Verne's novel celebrated the technological advances of the industrial era. Thanks to the steam engine, railways, and global colonialism, it was possible for the first time to circumnavigate the globe in just 80 days. Today we're still at the dawn of a new era of technological advances: pervasive networked and structured data. These tools will lead to a new era of exploration. There are no longer new lands, tribes, and cities to discover. Just by starting up Google Earth we can cast our eyes on every hidden corner of the world. The curiosity that inspires exploration, however, remains. Something keeps Matt traveling and dancing around the world and keeps Nicholas daydreaming about his next trip to Guyana or Venezuela or Argentina. Something inspired this Chinese blogger to travel around the world in 800 days. But exploration today isn't about discovering the so-called undiscovered. It's about understanding what has been there all along....more",Notes are private!,3,90,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2009","Jan 11, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54479.Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days

One might reasonably guess that everything knowable about brain function would be known by the time his current graduate students retired. Cognition was heading toward its prime collective achievement: grasping itself. What self-image would be left to us, in light of the full facts? The mind might not endure its self-discovery. Might never be ready to know. What would the race do, with full knowledge?I've been having some conversations with CB recently about whether or not science will one day be able to explain everything. She's quite sure it won't. I'm not sure of anything these days, but what I do know - what I remember so well while studying neuropsychology in college - is that the more I learned about the brain, the less confident my brain felt about its comprehension of its own processes; and the less confident I felt about my own sense of self, about what makes me who I am.I was working at the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center in San Diego. The idea of the center - and others like it - is that if you look closely at what went wrong during cases of brain damage then you can better grasp how the brain itself functions. Studying individuals with brain damage clarified the relationship (and dependence) of emotion and reason, confirmed the fluid plasticity of the brain, and revealed that facial recognition is dependent on emotional reaction more than memory of physical attributes.In fact, it is Capgras syndrome - in which a person holds a delusional belief that a friend, spouse or other close family member has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor - that makes up the meat of both the plot and the intellectual meditation of The Echo Maker. Capgras takes place when there is a disconnection between the temporal cortex, where faces are recognized, and the limbic system, which manages emotions. The face is recognized, but that recognition isn't linked with the proper emotional response and so the brain tries to come up with alternative scenarios to explain how a recognizable face of a loved one doesn't elicit any significant emotional response. A British man with Capgras syndrome was sure his father was actually a robot impostor and decapitated him to look for evidence of his robot insides.What is most disturbing about Capgras, however, is what it reveals about how our minds struggle to interpret the world around us. Our brain will go to any length to construct a narrative that makes sense even if that narrative really makes no sense at all. Just ask anyone who has done hallucinogenic drugs: they will tell you ""it made so much sense then, but I can't explain it now."" Everything always makes sense, even when it doesn't. Our brain wouldn't have it any other way.The ending of the book was disappointing, the plot was affected, and some of the descriptions were unnecessarily flowery. But I still enjoyed the character development and the way Powers manages to bring together small town Nebraska, migratory cranes, neuroscience, and environmentalism all into one bubbling Crockpot of human nature, doubt, and humility....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 20, 2009","Nov 19, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19794.The_Echo_Maker

Here is what Abani tells Tayari Jones about the scene in an April 2004 interview in The Believer when she asks for his thoughts on ""global blackness"". (Jones is African American, but spent a year in Nigeria when her father was a Fulbright scholar there.)I grew up conflicted about this whole notion [of global blackness]. Especially about Pan-Africanism. Especially since [Nigerian] independence came quickly and was inspired a lot by Ghana's independence, which was led by the Pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah. Also in Nigeria was Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was also very into Pan-Africanism. But it is interesting that these guys were educated mostly in America. These guys had contact with Du Bois and Marcus Garvey long before they came back. You can see this link much more in music. Enslaved Africans brought the roots of the blues with them to the United States and it made its way back to us in Africa. Sailors would come back and teach kids on the docs of Accra and Mali all the American guitar movements, which later produced people like Ali Farka Toure, who plays this hybrid Malian music that sounds so much like the blues. And he influenced people like Fela Kuti. There's that dialogue going on all the time ...And I see a lot of it happening in literature as well. ""Invisible Man"" becomes such an icon. In the opening of GraceLand there's that metaphor of the book falling off Elvis' chest and splitting open. This not only represents the splitting of the diaspora but the ability to enter the text in a way that he wouldn't be able to if he didn't share that fundamental racial heritage.Much of the book works as a collage - a collection of brief accounts of how Igbos offer the sacred kola nut to visitors; horrifying accounts of poverty and exploitation in modern day Lagos; moments of tender love between close friends and complete strangers; and detailed Igbo recipes which come from the diary of Elvis' mother. And throughout the book there is the waning influence of British colonial rule, the loss of indigenous knowledge, and the expanding influence of American pop culture.What I found most interesting about the book, though, is the almost complete congruence of Elvis and Black, the protagonist of Abani's later novel, The Virgin of Flames. Both are lower class artists, always with a sophisticated book tucked under their arm, with one dead parent and one abusive one. Their friends are concerned about them, they are self-centered, and yet also completely selfless, always willing to go hungry to help feed a stranger. They are moral anchors in a world that has seemingly lost its moral compass. There are multiple scenes in which they try on make-up and contemplate homosexuality. It is almost as if Abani took Elvis' soul stuffed it into a half-African, half-Salvadorean overweight LA artist. Which begs the question, how much Chris Abani is there in Elvis and Black?At the Calabash Literary Festival in Jamaica earlier this year I had a chance to find out. Chris Abani was there looking a little like Jabba the Hutt as he shoveled a plate of food into his mouth while his fiancee looked on across the table. There was something gluttonous about the scene, with the swimming pool in the background, and all the fawning attention. Besides, I've never been one to approach celebrities, literary or otherwise. From my experience, the interactions tend to be recipes for disappointment. Apparently, once you reach a certain level of fame, conversations are easily mistaken for interviews.But up on stage Abani impressed me more than just about anyone else (with the exception, probably, of Kei Miller). His poems were beautiful, his stories where funny, and the man knows how to play sax.GraceLand left me satisfied, but I hope that Abani - who was raised in a mansion with cars and servents - doesn't continue to romanticize the poor, abused artist. Now that he's been living in Southern California for some time, I'd love to read a book about LA targeted specifically toward Nigerian readers. (""The Virgin of Flames"" was very much not that. And, no, such a book would not produce any money. But it's the type of book that both Black and Elvis would want to write.)It's interesting, in his interview with Jones, Abani insists that he doesn't think about the Western reader when he writes:What I do is similar to what Ngugi is doing, operating under that notion that African art must exist in an appreciative context that is outside of the power of Westernization to reduce or empower. We allow access to the Western reader, but also say we don't care about what you think. This is what we are trying to show you. If you get it, fine. If you don't get it, we don't care.But I think Abani does care, and that actually leads to some of the worst passages in the book, which read more like narrative travel guide than good literature.""Return de bottles,"" Redemption said, snatching the cigarette from Elvis's mouth. Empty bottles were valuable because the local Coca-Cola factory washed and reused them. To ensure they got their bottles back, the factory charged local retailers a deposit on the bottles, which could only be redeemed when the bottles were turned in. The retailers in turn passed the cost of the deposit on to consumers if they intended to leave the immediate vicinity of their shops with the drinks. The amount varied from retailer to retailer but was usually no less than the price of the drink.Those sort of explanatory footnotes are littered throughout the book. As a Western reader I don't mind them, but I think its disingenuous of Abani to not own up to them....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Nov 14, 2008","Nov 11, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41250.GraceLand

Similar to Carlos Fuentes' The Death of Artemio Cruz, in which Artemio's life and death serve as metaphors for the historic arc of the Mexican Revolution and the corrupt PRI party it spawned, the anti-hero of The Conservationist is Gordimer's metaphor for a South Africa apartheid system that is impossible to conserve despite the wishes of its White population.In fact, I'm sure there is some college undergrad out there who is writing a paper about Gordimer's imagery of the colonial aesthetic of non-native plants destroying the sacred bond between native Africans and the local flora and fauna. But what is impressive about Gordimer - and what I think she'll always be remembered for - is her ability to write so seemingly effortlessly from the male, female, Black, White, and Indian voice.

And yet I'll probably end up buying copies for both sets of my grandparents and anyone else I care about who wants to know why it is that I do what I do. And just what it is that I'm doing.Shirky doesn't argue that the internet and social media bring about only positive change, but he describes those changes - both positive and negative - with more clarity than anyone else I've read. The value isn't in the content of the book - all if which is available for free just a few clicks away - but rather how well it is presented.For me, for anyone who has been passionate about social media over the past few years, Here Comes Everybody ends just where it starts getting most interesting. Though the book itself is much broader than its subtitle (""The power of organizing without organizations"") would suggest, it does tend to concentrate on how social media are disrupting organizational structures. But he doesn't spend any time discussing how 'non-organizational organizations' are organizing.WordPress, Drupal, Mozilla, Creative Commons, Wikipedia, Global Voices, Ubuntu: we all really got going around four to six years ago when the business community still saw the internet as one big flop, but we saw social media as a huge opportunity for doing good rather than making money. We started out as communities that were brought together by a creative passion (be it writing, knowledge, programming, whatever). In a relatively short amount of time those communities expanded exponentially and the product/service we collectively created took on both a real and perceived value.We have all had growing pains as we've scaled up and we have all become much more hierarchical. Much more like a traditional organization. It might be possible to organize without organizations, but sustaining those communities - especially when they are collaboratively creating a product or service - seems to bring back those very same structures and chains of command that social media enthusiasts (utopianists?) like myself have spent so much time railing against. I can think of a few different reasons for this, but there are surely many more that I have not thought of.

The Argumentative Indian is neither easy nor fun to read. The first threeAfter all my dramatic agony and breathless complaining, I am glad I endured. The Argumentative Indian is neither easy nor fun to read. The first three pages of every chapter and sub-chapter are essentially wordy justifications of why the topic is deserving of discussion in the first place.Throughout the book I was constantly thinking, Amartya, homeboy, stop talking about what you're going to talk about and just get to it. Sen himself is quite the argumentative Indian and sometimes the book reads as if you walked in on a one man debate competition in which Sen, the convincing devil's advocate, faces off with Sen, the impassioned and patient defender of peace and tolerance.Whichever literary framework you prefer, it must be said that Professor Sen is not an effortless writer. Cautious yes (footnotes, endnotes, and asterisks are abundant), but often at the expense of clarity.Despite all of this, The Argumentative Indian is a book I recommend to everyone with an interest not just in India, but also the slippery relationship between cultural uniqueness and so-called universal values. The book is a collection of wide-ranging essays - most of which were previously published elsewhere - that are difficult to encapsulate in a single thesis, but maybe it would be something along these lines: Just how Western are so-called Western values? Democracy, individual liberty, multi-cultural tolerance, secularism, reasoned debate. Are these values unique to Western culture or have they been excluded from shallow historical readings of other civilizations. Like India, for example.Sen is critical of two interpretations of modern India - internal separatism and global isolation. India is often portrayed as a mishmash of separate religions, languages, ethnicities, and castes which are only loosely held together by the legacy of European colonialism. He rejects that claim completely and spends much of the book ing the history of two major Indian leaders - Ashoka and Akbar - as examples of India's pre-colonial embrace of pluralism and multiculturalism. Sen is equally critical of those who try to promote a sense of Indian national identity by rejecting any economic, social, or intellectual engagement with the West. In fact, he keenly observes that most anti-Western thought in India is, in fact, rooted in European intellectual circles.It was the first essay - responsible for the name of the book - that I found most interesting. Why has India become such a strong democracy (the one blemish to India's post-colonial democracy was Indira Ghandi's ""Emergency"" which was strongly rejected by Indian voters) compared to most other British colonies-turned-nation-states? Sen seemingly argues that India was democractic before it was ever a democracy. That is, India despite it's endless history of being invaded by foreign powers, has always embraced skepticism, reasoned public debate, and multicultural tolerance - all of which are key ingredients of modern democracy.It is his idea of ""democracy as public reasoning"" that intrigued me the most because that is one of my main arguments for why I go around passionately promoting participatory media. I'm a sucker for the idea that the more we discuss and debate - and especially the more we listen - the more tolerant and empathetic we become. Sometimes I worry that in aggressively promoting discussion, I am promoting a particularly Western way of interacting with the world around us. Amartya Sen doesn't seem to think so.

My friend and colleague MiThis is the first book I've ed on Goodreads written by a Goodreads friend, but I have a feeling it won't be the last. My friend and colleague Mialy is one of 27 writers featured in Dreams, Miracles and Jazz. From her bio:Mialy Ravelomanana Andriamananjara started writing when she was eight, mostly because she was a lonely child, despite having three older brothers. She spent a lot of time daydreaming and making up stories, which she would then enact in a game called kindriandriana, which little Malagasy girls know well. In this game, girls gather stones and use them much as a western girl would play with dolls. Later, she started playing with words, because she loved books and she knew she liked to tell stories. Now that circumstances and family have taken her away from her beloved homeland, she writes when she is homesick and because her stories keep her closer to her past and her culture. the first story that she wrote, The Shred, was published in SABLE Litmag in 2005.Among all this blogs-versus-books hubaloo, Mialy's story reminded me just how complimentary blog posts and short stories/novels are when it comes to better understanding a foreign place. For the last eight or so months I have been following many of the Foko bloggers as they write about their daily lives in Madagascar. Their posts have an informal, conversational tone to them that make you, the reader, feel like you're all sitting in the same cafe. But Mialy's story, in just 11 short pages, was able to reveal parts of Malagasy culture, values, and idiosyncrasies that I would have otherwise never come to appreciate.Mialy's story is especially inviting and accessible for an American like myself because it is based in the United States. In fact, of the 27 authors featured in this anthology of ""new Africa writing"", at least 60 - 75% of them now live outside of Africa. The same was true with the Caribbean writers who read at Calabash a few months ago. Like Mialy's bio says, writing for expats is a powerful form of nostalgia, of honoring and connecting to one's homeland. But it also often makes for a particular type of short story. Many of the themes in Dreams, Miracles and Jazz deal with issues of identity and belonging, of defining 'Africanness', of trying to find that line that divides those who are entitled to African identity and those who are not.Among my favorite stories, besides Mialy's of course, were The End of Skill by Mamle Kabu, In the Clarity of a Third Class Compartment by Pumla Dineo Gqola, Random Check by Ken N Kamoche, Native Sun by Akin Adesokan, and The Browns' Safari Honeymoon by Tony Mochama.Representative of the stories I didn't care for as much is Kadija Sesay's Love Long Distance, a diary-like recollection of an African-Briton returning to her parents' homeland and worrying that the size of her buttocks is somehow not African enough.The first story in the anthology, An Affair to Dismember, comes from Binyavanga Wainaina a young author from Nakuru, Kenya currently living in New York. Wainaina's story describes an awkward and angry affair between a Kenyan butcher and the daughter of his deceased adoptive (and White) mother. Among bloggers interested in Africa, Wainaina is probably best known for his satiric essay ""How to Write About Africa."" The essay is pretty right-on when it comes to describing much of the literature written about Africa in the 20th century. What is a surprise, however, is how much the essay also applies to many of the stories in Dreams, Miracles and Jazz. I remember the first time I read Wainaina's essay [via Ethan], thinking that he was clearly writing it for a Western audience, to make a point. I felt the same way during most of my reading of Dreams, Miracles and Jazz - that even though all of the stories were about Africa, the audience the writers had in mind was not African....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 11, 2008","Jul 30, 2008",,,view (with text),/book/show/3369315-dreams-miracles-and-jazz

His writing reveals decades of self-scrutiny, of each year wanting to say more with fewer words.Divisadero is about love and the loss thereof. Love falls victim to the jealous wrath of a protective father, to drug addiction, to the minor details of our daily lives, and the greater mystery of the entropy of desire:Lucien and his future wife left the curtained parlour and walked arm in arm for an hour or two along a road banked with poppies and into a marriage that created two daughters. There would be years of compatibility and then bitterness, and who knew when that line was traversed, on what night, at what hour. Over what betrayal. They slipped over this as over a faint rise in the road, like a small vessel crossing the equator unaware, so that in fact their whole universe was now upside down.Much of the novel takes place in the parts of California that even most Californians don't visit: Petaluma, Grass Valley, Santa Maria, Lake Tahoe. I have strong memories of all four places and Ondaatje's descriptions are not only apt; they also manage to capture the aesthetic of the 'other California', far from the bleached hair and blonde sand of Southern California and the cosmopolitanism of the Bay Area. I can only assume that his descriptions of provincial France are equally percipient.There is also, it turns out, a link between this novel and Brazil. On the acknowledgements page of the book facing the back cover, Ondaajte writes:The song 'Um Favor' (partially described on page 73) by Lupicinio Rodrigues in essence began this book.Here is that partial description from page 73:  All of the world there must be people like us, Anna had said then, wounded in some way by falling in love - seemingly the most natural of acts.      He told her there was a song he no longer performed that had to do with all of that. It was about a woman who had risen from their bed in the middle of the night and left him. He would hear evidence of her in villages in the north, bust she would be gone by the time the rumour of her presence reached him. A song of endless searching, sung by this man who until then had seldom revealed himself. His tough fingers would tug the heart out of his guitar.

He knew his reputation for shyness and guile, but now he conceded his scarred self to his friends. 'If any of you on your journeys see her - shout to me, whistle ...' he sang, and it became a habit for audiences to shout and whistle in response to those lines.

Oh, and yes, Steve Almond.They are funny. They are eloquent. They are insightful. They know a little bit about everything and know how to make us laugh while we nod our heads and say, yes, exactly, that's what I've been wanting to, trying to say. They are liberal, all of them. Their sense of comedic timing is orchestral. And their prodigious output makes one wonder if every one of them has a 24/7 Woody Allen monologue running through their heads, which they are kind enough to occasionally put down on paper and share with the comparative glob of ineloquence know as the rest of the world.Have I mentioned yet that they are all Jewish? There are other eloquent, funny, and ironic writers out there who are not Jewish. Like Dave Eggers, Nick Hornby, and, um, Dave Eggers. But for the most part, if you want to be silver-tongued, you better be circumcised. (Google's second return for 'comedic timing' - admittedly following Britney Spears - comes from jewishjournal.com).Let me say, first off, that I am absolutely in love with all of the above-mentioned comedians/writers/Jews. Huge man crushes. I would cuddle with both Ira Glass and Jon Stewart. At the same time, naturally, so long as I were in the middle.And yes, predictably, I loved every essay and sub-essay and even footnote in Steve Almond's (Not that You Asked). Just like with the Daily Show and This American Life, I laughed out loud, I pondered reflectively, and I nodded my head along in enthusiastic affirmation. Steve loves Vonnegut, I love Vonnegut. Steve loves to hate TV, I love to hate TV. Steve glorifies the little guy, himself included, as do I.So why four stars instead of five? Why, in fact, had I hovered my mouse for a few seconds over the 'just ok' third yellow star? Because I largely agree with Jeremy, who writes:The type of thing 812 other well-spoken, accident-prone, socially awkward white dudes are cranking out.And also:All right, I remembered one of the ""essays"": two guys make lobster pad thai, and Steve Almond eats and enjoys it. I got take-out General Tso's the other night and it wasn't bad. Anybody wanna be my agent?Which is to say, as much as I laughed out loud and happily kept turning the pages, I didn't actually learn or gain anything from the book after the second chapter. Making pad thai, the Red Sox - A's series, masturbating in the jacuzzi ... it's all a little bit like a season of Friends, not what Almond so insistently refers to as literature and real art when distinguishing himself from his blogger critics (who he loves and hates and loves to hate).On May 12, 2006 Steve Almond wrote a letter to the Boston Globe, addressed to Boston College president William P. Leahy. In it he announced his resignation because Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was invited to be commencement speaker at the 2006 BC graduation. (Her speech is here.) Almond says he resigned from his position as adjunct professor to make a stand, a moral statement. He then engaged what he calls the ""Hateocracy"" - Hannity and Colmes, the AM talk shows, the conservative print publications. In other words, he got lots and lots and lots of publicity. It made him famous.The part of the book I enjoyed the most - the chapter that was written as if Almond couldn't help himself - was a wonderful essay on why Kurt Vonnegut should be taken more seriously. It was well-researched and the writing is beautiful. It is the sort of essay that you can tell has been trying to get out of Almond's cerebrum for years now.We learn on the last page of Not that You Asked that the entire book was supposed to be about Vonnegut, but that his publishers ""wanted a book of essays instead."" It speaks of Almond's sincerity that he would even admit it. But then it also points to his insincerity when, in a nod to Vonnegut that Kurt himself would not approve of, he shrugs 'so it goes.'...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2008","Jul 13, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/208616._Not_that_You_Asked_

My impression of his book is certainly colored by the fact that I find him to be a very decent person.There are dozens — if not hundreds — of books by Americans about Paris. Pulitzer Prize-winning author David McCullough even wrote a 500+ page tome about Americans in Paris. And yet, prior to 2008 there was not a single English-language book dedicated to the world's third largest metropolis, and the capital city of America's southern neighbor. As Richard Feinberg writes in his  of First Stop in the New World:If Mexico City were located in western Europe, it would be a must-see tourist destination in the same league as London, Paris, and Rome. The metropolis' extraordinary museums, architectural masterpieces, vast cultural scenes, and extravagant restaurants are world-class; many Mexican elites are refined and erudite, their dinner conversations unsurpassed displays of verbal virtuosity.Then, in 2008, David Lida published his first English-language book, which is built on nearly two decades of journalistic work in and around Mexico City. The following year John Ross, a self-described ""rebel journalist"" published El Monstruo. And in 2011, Daniel Hernandez published Down and Delirious in Mexico City, which I ed here. Why this explosion of English-language books about Mexico City by Americans after decades of disregard? Ironically, it has much to do with the city's cultural and economic rise over the past five to ten years. I say 'ironically' because none of the three above-mentioned authors chart the city's progress. Rather, they romantically portray the city as still stuck in the past: old men falling over in sepia-tinted cantinas, mariachis roaming back alleys, burlesque shows struggling to stay in business with the rise of US-style strip clubs. All three men make it their mission to preserve the 20th century capital that is slowly disappearing without paying much attention to the impressive social, economic, and urban planning progress the city has made over the past ten years. The result gives readers a glimpse of Mexico City through an Instagram vintage filter: exotic, seductive, but not the full picture.Hernandez's Down and Delirious in Mexico City is written in a vibrant, experiential prose that perfectly captures the energy and angst of the Mexico City youth that are making up a new set of social mores informed by new economic opportunities and greater global connections. David Lida, by comparison, has a more understated, mature voice that leaves much to be interpreted. Occasionally he falls victim (as we all do) to ranting about the worst aspects of the city, but in his defense, as Andrew Paxman writes in his :Mexico City is often so infuriating and so riddled with injustice (I speak as a former resident), it would have been easy for Lida to stray into sermonizing, but he never does … The tone is chiefly celebratory, at times meditative, often playful, as befits a city with an endless capacity for improvisation, in defiance of many predictions of collapse.Throughout the book, Lida proves himself a skilled ethnographer. His descriptions of daily life and the city's collective psyche are astute, yet rarely do those first-hand accounts seek sociological explanation. Lida is less interested in explaining why Mexico City is like it is (for that, I would recommend Mañana Forever and Why Nations Fail). Rather, he offers readers a compelling portrait of the city through the eyes of a longtime foreign resident. (The one exception is his chapter on sex, which is the most insightful analysis of Mexican sexuality that I have encountered.)Chilangos (as residents of Mexico City are known) constantly complain about their city, but they are notoriously sensitive to an outsider's criticism. I sympathize with the frustrations of young Mexico City change-makers that have done so much to improve their city and yet are consistently ignored by international writers that focus on violence or a nostalgia for the past. But that doesn't mean Mexicans should ignore Lida's writings. Just as many Americans revere Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America, Mexicans too can benefit from outsiders' perspectives without taking insult. For a book titled First Stop in the New World, it's ironic that Lida's only mention of the city's future comes in the book's final pages. He juxtaposes two alternative futures for the city, one utopian, the other dystopian. In the dystopian version, the city's urban sprawl continues in all directions, eventually encompassing Cuernavaca, Puebla, Queretaro and Toluca to create a mega-mega-metropolis of 40 million people that spend all their day in gridlock traffic behind bulletproof glass while choking on pollution and fighting for the diminishing access to water. In the utopian version, the city begins to grow upward rather than outward. Public spaces are recovered, and development becomes more inclusive. Access to public services expands throughout the city. Levels of contamination reduce year after year. Public transit and bicycle paths extend throughout the city. Entrepreneurs and independent designers create new alternatives to the big monopolies.The past ten years have made significant progress toward the utopian vision. But that story is yet to be told — both in English and Spanish....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 26, 2013","Mar 23, 2013","Jul 08, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3229817-first-stop-in-the-new-world

It's exactly the type of café that Roberto Bolaño pleaded his fellow poets to abandon in the 1976 infrarrealist manifesto ""Leave it all behind once again, throw yourselves to the roads.""There is no reason for me to copy and paste Wikipedia's biography of Bolaño's life. The man was a wandering poet, a bohemian, a lover of women, a confidant of men. Bolaño was the Spanish-speaking world's Jack Kerouac. Mario Santiago was Allen Ginsberg, or maybe Neal Cassidy. And the Infrarrealistas were, undoubtedly, the Beats.Just as Kerouac's bestsellers On the Road and The Dharma Bums offered a public portrait to the eccentric activities and philosophies of the Beat poets, Bolaño's The Savage Detectives is the accessible, almost addictive, account of a roving group of bohemian Mexico City poets in the 70's, 80's, and 90's. The fictionalized characters based on the poets gave reason for disgruntlement in both groups. In the United States, Gary Snyder will always be known as Japhy Ryder, a character from The Dharma Bums that Kerouac based on Snyder, rather than the Pulitzer prize winning poet of Turtle Island. Similarly, the poet Juan Esteban Harrington will now forever be remembered as Juan García Madero, the character who narrates the first and last 100 pages of The Savage Detectives.Unlike Kerouac's relationship with the rest of the Beats, however, were it not for Bolaño, the Infrarrealist poets wouldn't be known at all. Which, according to Natasha Wimmer's introduction to The Savage Detectives, seems to be what some of them would have preferred. One of the core tendencies, if not tenets, of Infrarrealismo seems to be fetishizing the obscure.Imagine writing down your entire life. Not through your eyes, but the eyes of those whose lives have for one reason or another intersected your own. What would they have to say about you? No, wait, that's not right. What would you choose for them to say about you?This is fundamentally the exercise that becomes The Savage Detectives. The first 150 pages of the novel is told by Juan García Madero, a narrator who you might not care for - slightly arrogant, but also appealingly honest. The first 150 pages of the novel, they actually annoyed me. Or maybe it's more honest to say that all of the raving  of the novel annoyed me. Why do we have to celebrate poets who smoke to many cigarettes, have read the Marquis de Sade, and constantly think about sex? What makes them the celebrities of the literary world?But then the second part of the book, which shares the title of the novel itself, begins and everything transforms. From page 143 to 588 we hear the multiple accounts of over 50 distinct narrators all giving their impressions, relaying their memories, of the novel's two main protagonists, Arturo Belano (Roberto Bolaño) and Ulises Lima (Mario Santiago). The fact that Bolaño can so convincingly write in over 50 different voices is a feat I've never before seen. (Natasha Wimmer should also be applauded for maintaining each narrator's unique voice so well in her translation.)There is so much more I could say about The Savage Detectives, about how Bolaño most definitely succumbs to the universal mistake of assuming we are more important and more talked about than we are, about the last drawing of the window on the last page of the book, about how he writes women's voices compared to men's, about Octavio Paz and Nestor Parra, and about the sublime search for one Ms. Cesárea Tinajero, but really, when it comes down to it, I most agree with Bolaño's conviction that literature is meant to be read, not discussed.

Issue number 26 of McSweeney's is split up into three different books - two 4 X 6 paperback collections of short stories and one 8 X 6 hardcover fictionalized dossier based on Wesley Clark's famous ""seven countries in five years"" quote. Clark has never named the seven countries so it was up to Stephen Elliot and company to do the research and imagine just what a ""the next seven countries we should invade"" dossier looks like.One of the 4X6 paperbacks is dedicated to ""new stories from overseas"", the other, ""new stories from our shores."" Given my affinity for global literature, it's no surprise that I picked up Issue 26 to read the new stories from overseas. So I was an unhappy camper when I opened my backpack to find that I had left that section in some cafe or park in Medellín.""Where to Invade Next"", I assumed, would be an hyper-ironic satire of U.S. foreign policy. Instead it was a deadpan exercise in realistic imagination. Given Obama's latest comments on Iran and the publication of McCain's '74 thesis on the lack of American faith in US foreign policy, it is a timely exercise in imagination.Where might the US invade next? Why? Some countries came as a complete surprise, like Uzbekistan which, despite all my years doing the Global Voices digest, I still know so little about. Some proposed countries to invade, like Venezuela, were a tough sell. Others, like Sudan, just about had me convinced that we actually should. I recently listened to a fascinating debate between Niall Ferguson and Peter Schwartz wherein Ferguson emphasizes the important of imagining alternative past histories to better understand both the actual history that took place and the present where we've arrived. ""Where to Invade Next"" is a wonderful little book because as you flip through each page you wonder, 'wow, what if we really did invade each of these seven countries within five years? Where would we be today? Where would the rest of the world be?""I assumed that, like the Words Without Borders book, Axis of Evil, one of the booklets of short stories would introduce us to writers from the very countries we might invade.

I've never had the right words to describe my life, and now that I've entered by story, I need them more than ever.But Eugenides, through the voice of the unforgettable Callope Stephanides, does find the right words. Over and over again.The artichoke heart of the 500-page-plus novel only gets going after page 400. It's as if Eugenides thought of a clever story to tell, but then decided to prepend it with 400 pages of prologue. 400 pages of very enjoyable prologue. In the end he's able to weave together a tapestry of events that begins in Turkey before it was Turkey, takes us to the birth of the automobile era in Detroit, puts us into the passenger seat for some prohibition bootlegging, into the heart of the Nation of Islam before Malcolm X even existed, into folk tales of Chinese princesses and silk worms, and ends with transgendered underwater sex shows in San Francisco.And, yet, what we're talking about here is a hermaphrodite's coming of age story in the epitome of American suburbia, Grosse Point, Michigan, where Eugenides himself went to a private prep school just like Calliope. Much of the book can feel like drawn out suspense until the moment when he finds out she's a he, but throughout the story there is a build-up of allusions to the book's most central thesis: that how we decide our gender, just like almost everything else, is both biological and social. Sure, some of us have Y chromosomes and others do not, but that's not the sole determinant of our gender identity. (And if that sentence has you scared that this is required reading for feminazi classes at liberal arts colleges, it's not that kind of book.)What impressed me the most about the writing is its gender neutrality. Despite the fact that the author of the book is male - as is the narrator - I often thought of the narration as neither male nor female. As if the writing itself - like Cal - somehow transcended the very concept of gender.

Joy because it is one of the best books I've ever read, superbly bouncing the writer's ball of observation and insight against the borders of love and fidelity; race and class; intellectualism and empathy; beauty and power; conservativsim and liberalism; theory and practice. Jealousy because it is precisely the sort of novel I would have liked to one day write myself ... and, because it's so glaringly obvious that - right now - I couldn't. Not like Smith; the believability of her characters and their interactions, her idiosyncratic descriptions, the way she masters dialect without limiting anyone to the way he or she speaks. Most importantly, though, is the frictionless and pleasurable impact of her prose despite - or because of - its crisp, clear, and cliché-free simplicity.With two bunched fists Kiki thumped the sides of her legs in frustration. 'It's all the same thing, I've been thinking about all of this - it's part of the same ... just veil of doom that's descended on this house - we can't talk about anything seriously, everything's ironic, nothing's serious - everyone's scared to speak in case you think it's clichéd or dull - you're like the thought police. And you don't care about anything, you don't care about us - you know, I was sitting there listening to Kipps - OK, so he's a nutcase half the time, but he's standing up there talking about something he believes in.Though less than 500 pages, the novel is encyclopedic in its scope. It's not fair to pick only one theme as representative of the novel - what I'm focusing on is much more representative of me. The above quote comes from an argument between Howard - the university intellectual - and his wife Kiki - a hospital administrator, whole and good and self-described as simple. Howard is a liberal relativist; an art history professor; a skeptic of all absolutes. Kiki has been a loving wife for thirty years until discovering her husband's affair with a fellow professor and family friend.At least a sliver of the novel deals with the egocentric, self-absorbed nature of intellectualism. The gladiator-like ideological battles. The deductive dismissal of morality to excuse obvious moral transgressions. Western, liberal intellectuals have long valued irony and articulate wit over sincerity and good behavior. Cervantes and Oscar Wilde and Voltaire become heroes not because of their contribution to a better, more fair society, but because they have sharp tongues and mischievous one-liners.They've long been my heroes as well. When logic chides against the foundation of absolute morality, young ambition searches for something other than righteousness. And in our society, it is much more fashionable to be young, clever, witty and worldly than to be simply good. Here is Zora, the over-achieving daughter of Howard and Kiki, talking with her friends about the affair between her father and her poetry professor.	'Are you serious? She totally can't look me in the eye - even in class, when I'm reading she's nodding at the window.'	'I think she's just ADD,' drawled Daisy.	'Attention Dick Deficiency,' said Zora, because she was extremely quick. 'If it doesn't have a dick, it's basically deficient.'	Her little audience guffawed, pretending to a worldliness none of them had earned.	Ron gripped her chummily round the shoulders.

They were smooth and bright, and their timing was wonderful, and they were young and hilarious. It was really something to see, they thought, and this was why they spoke loudly and gestured, inviting onlookers to admire.	'Tell me about it,' said Zora, and flicked open the carton.

It captures the turn-of-the-millenium, multi-culti, global reality of right now through the lens of Dominican New Jersey.Many people call this Oscar's novel, but Oscar - the fat lonely kid in high school we all felt sorry for, but nevertheless always avoided - is only one of a handful of memorable characters and, unlike his sister, mother, and roommate, Oscar never actually narrates himself. There were parts of the book that reminded me of an American version of Zadie Smith's very English White Teeth. Like Smith, Díaz uses completely contemporary language when describing the often violent mid-20th century history of a Caribbean island. He weaves the story between the lives of the children of immigrants trying to find their own purpose between the competing expectations between their pueblo and American society (Oscar with his sci-fi, his sister going punk, her boyfriend always weightlifting), and the tragic lives of their hardened parents and grandparents.My only beef is that it is (or will be) such a dated novel. I'll be telling my grandchildren what a phenomenal work of literature it is, but they won't understand. Díaz's New Jersey-centric Spanlish slang will be to impossible to decipher. (Díaz puts together some brilliant Dominican spanglish puns, but I have a feeling that he is just about the only one who understands them. I had to invest crazy time pulling them apart and Googling them just to get half an idea of what he's referring to.)I think that multi-culti immigrant novels (that don't read like 'immigrant novels') like White Teeth and The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao will be the genre of our generation. They give us understanding of the entire world through the eyes and hearts of characters who are already familiar to any American no matter what his/her color. (Díaz's footnotes are constantly reminding us just how long Dominicans have been part of American and international pop culture.)Finally, on a mostly unrelated note, I was surprised by Diaz's constant use of the word nigger. ""Nigger, please"" - claiming its own paragraph - is one of the book's more memorable rhetorical devices, Díaz's own ""so it goes."" But, as you can see in any picture, Díaz is one pale-skinned dude. In a Dominican context, there is no question, Díaz is as blanco as blanco gets. He is, some would say, blessed with skin tone privilege. As a local author writing in Spanish in the Dominican Republic, he'd never get away with using so sparingly whatever the Dominican equivalent of nigger might be. But writing as an immigrant in the United States he's automatically afforded ... what shall we call it? Urban entitlement? Of course there's nothing wrong with that - read his Wikipedia page, the man deserves all the success he's found. I just find it interesting how identities shift - and are allowed to shift - as they cross borders....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Aug 24, 2008","May 28, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao

The name, however, is somewhat (and I assume unintentionally) ironic as so many of the stories are grounded in nationalism - either with pride or with, as Horacio Castellanos Moya titles his story, revulsion. In fact, the dynamic between nationalism and global literature is touched on by Pramoedya Ananta Toer in his introduction to Seno Gumira Ajidarma's short story Children of the Sky:Unlike writers in the more developed countries of the world, third-world writers don't have the luxury of devoting themselves completely to the development of their personal writing style or technique. They have an extra task, what I would call ""nation building."" Perhaps a writer shouldn't have to have this task, but in the third world, participating in nation building is, I feel, an honor, not a burden.In start contrast to Pramoedya Ananta Toer's patriotism is Roberto Bolaño's introduction to Horacio Castellanos Moya:I have now read four of his books. The first one I read was Revulsion, perhaps his best work, certainly his most arresting, a long declamation against El Salvador for which Castellanos Moya received death threats that obliged him to leave the country for a life in exile.Revulsion is not only an adaptation of folktales or the expression of a writer's profound disillusionment in the face of his moral and political circumstances, but also a stylistic experiment that parodies the work of Bernhard; it is a novel that will make you die laughing.Unfortunately, very few people in El Salvador have read Bernhard and even fewer have maintained a good sense of humor. One doesn't joke about homeland. This is a popular saying not only in El Salvador, but also in Chile and Cuba, in Peru and Mexico, and even in Austria and some other European countries. If Castellanos Moya were Bosnian or Kosovar he wouldn't even have ben able to board a plane to leave the country. And therein lies one of the great virtues of this book: nationalists of all stripes can't stand it. Its sharp humor, not unlike a a Buster Keaton film or a time bomb, have an uncontrollable desire to hang the author in the town square. I can't think of a higher honor for the writer.Whether envisioning the pen as an instrument to prop up a particular nation or to lambaste the very notion of nationhood, Words Without Borders reveals that we have still yet to reach the era of what Eliot Weinberger describes as the ""The Post-National Writer."" The differing perspectives of whether literature should be rooted firmly in nationhood or should try to transcend it is, of course, nothing new. It is at the very heart of Gary Snyder's Pulitzer Prize winning Turtle Island. As I see it, it is also at the heart of the public response to the recent clash of egos between Derek Walcott and V.S. Naipaul. Naipaul detests nationalism and dislikes his native Trinidad and Tobago. Walcott has become the literary father of the Caribbean.Nationalism aside, Words Without Borders is one hell of a collection. I recommend it to every English speaker. The format of the book is smart; 28 literary heavyweights like Günter Grass, Ha Jin, and Roberto Calasso, introduce the works of 28 lesser-known writers - works which have never been translated into English before. Among my favorites were The Scripture Read Backward in which Bangladeshi author Parashuram imagines a world in which India colonizes Britain rather than the other way around; The Uses of English by Akinwumi Isola, which makes the reader feel like an observant resident of a rural Nigerian village in just ten pages; Vietnam. Thursday., which would have brought tears to my eyes if I didn't hold them back in a silly show of manliness; and Juan Forn's Swimming at Night, a must read for anyone who still thinks that Latin American literature is just multi-generational political stories from the jungle.Not only is the format of the book very smart, but so is the model of the organization. The foundation of Words Without Borders is its website, which it likes to refer to as an ""online magazine."" Then there is an annual print anthology. The 2006 anthology, Axis of Evil, features ""short stories and fiction excerpts from Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Sudan, and other countries from whom the government would rather we didn't hear."" I have put it on my ""to read"" list and I will most certainly do the same with their 2008 anthology, whenever it is announced. Words Without Borders also organizes reading events and is developing an educational curriculum ""for use in the high school classroom, including suggested readings, study questions, writing prompts, suggestions for further study and a forum for teachers to discuss materials.""The model intrigues me because I wonder if it might be the future model of Global Voices. As interest in the global blogosphere continues to grow, our annual Global Voices Summit will attract more and more people from all over. We are also making an educational curriculum. And for a long time now we've talked about producing an attractive print book from the thousands and thousands of posts in the Global Voices archive.

Friends and acquaintances and strangers spoke of her with a sort of ineloquent awe as if their own descriptions could never match her lucid prose or mental acuity.Now that I have actually read her own words I want to know, what is all the fuss about? I find Barbara Grizzutti Harrison's 1980 essay much more resonant than anything Didion writes in The White Album. The book is page after page of name-dropping. Hollywood stars, famous criminals, the super-wealthy, and anyone related by one degree. She mentions the names of the boutiques where she shops, the expensive restaurants where she eats. I couldn't care less.The book also over-intellectualizes the mundane and I found myself skimming through several chapters unable to find either beautiful description or coherent revelation. I assume that Joan Didion's popularity stems from the fact that East Coast high society wanted New Yorker-style correspondent in the midst of California's sex, drugs, and rock & roll. Or perhaps it's her strangely placed commas. But Didion isn't the correspondent for me and it's not like there is any shortage of wealthy baby boomers trying to figure out (or remember) what the hell happened in the 60's and 70's.That's not to say that there weren't any notes of interest in the book. I found her condemnation of carpool lanes (or ""Diamond Lanes"" as she describes them) fascinating. My generation grew up taking for granted the fact that carpool lanes were a universally good thing. Even in solitude at 4 p.m. on the 405, we didn't curse the carpool lanes, we cursed ourselves for traveling alone. For Didion, however, creating carpool lanes wasn't forward thinking by Caltrans, it was symbolic of out-of-touch bureaucrats spending millions of dollars on projects that the citizenry did not want. Lamenting the restrictions that Caltrans was placing on Southern Californian 'individual mobility' she practically cheers on the urban guerillas who pour paint and nails along the carpool lanes.I will try reading at least one other Didion book, perhaps a novel, but I won't be able to approach it with anything other than skepticism....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,not set,"May 25, 2008","May 23, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/299401.White_Album
