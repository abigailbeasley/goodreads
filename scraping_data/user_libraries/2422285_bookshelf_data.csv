Read many years ago, I've read much criticism since. Now it seems time to read it again along with a brief biography of Gaddis.In that brief biography, Joseph Tabbi commented that The Recognitons was a 2d The Waste Land. And about the same time I read the William Gass evaluation, ""The Recognitions was a thunderclap. It was a dull decade, the fifties, but here was a real sound."" Well, I've finished again, and I can still hear the rumble of that thunder like one of those heavy claps during a summer thunderstorm that persist in the distance after it's shaken the walls of your house. There's hardly anything comparable to The Recognitions today, so we can only imagine what astonishment it struck into serious readers who took it up in 1955. I was only 13 at the time, wasn't reading seriously yet and didn't hear such literary thunder until I heard Eliot's 4 years later. We know Eliot's thunder as the promising voice of God, and one of the themes of The Recognitions is a movement toward salvation through a return to a more genuine art and religion. ""...it seems the right way to be devotional, to worship at these elaborate altars of modernism."" I don't remember the source of this marginalia in my copy, or even whether or not it's a quote, but I'd continue the idea by saying that Eliot and Gaddis are a couple of my more important saints....more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Jan 10, 2019not set","Mar 17, 2019not set","Mar 31, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1310518.The_Recognitions

Most of them are comprehensive, all-inclusive, especially the biographies. Perhaps some of the best, though, are those which shine a light on a few elements of her life or work which represent what's best about her. When I read Dickinson's poetry these fevered days I read Helen Vendler's splendid volume which pulls apart and analyzes only 50 of her most representative poems. Martha Ackmann, who's a Dickinson scholar teaching at Mount Holyoke College, has written one of the better biographies, one that explains Dickinson's life and oeuvre very well through the microscope of only 10 widely-scattered days during her 56 years of life. They're significant days, to be sure, but Achmann has chosen so well and fleshed out so carefully that the Dickinson which comes alive for us is vibrant and authentic and human and likable. Ackmann has decided these are 10 days which define Dickinson. What makes them distinctive in forming the poetess that's come down to us today is that Emily was different at the end of them than she was at the beginning. Some of the moments are well-known, like the evening while attending Mount Holyoke Female Seminary she decided to not profess her faith in Christ. Another is the day she's forced to admit she needs treatment for her eye ailment. Other days provide less sharply-defined borders for us to see: the 1st publication of one of her poems, or the day she realizes she wants to be distinguished as a person. Truthfully, these are not so much moments in her life as periods. Her impaired vision, for instance, was iritis, and the treatment involved staying in Cambridge for several months of 1864 and coincided with an intense correspondence with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, an important literary mentor, whose influence is another pivotal moment.There are some surprises. The Dickinson Ackmann sees is perhaps less eccentric and reclusive than she's portrayed elsewhere. The story's here about her talking to visitors from the upstairs landing while remaining unseen. And there's the woman who eventually dresses only in white dimity. But if she stays at home she's also a woman who shows herself more open to those who come to see her, especially if they want to discuss writing. She even falls in love. In telling us the story of how this day or another 10 years later shaped her, Ackmann has to describe how that day was typically lived and organized in the New England society in which Dickinson lived. We learn quite a lot about Amherst itself in the mid-19th century as well as about those who lived there. Incidentally, the book includes a fine collection of contemporary photos, most of which I'd not seen before. Instead of the fragmented account you might expect from breaking Dickinson's life into 10 distinct parts, the book manages to give us a generous and detailed portrayal of her community along with her life and work. All of it makes one of the loveliest and most helpful books about Dickinson I know....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 22, 2022","Jan 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45894121-these-fevered-days

Though I recognized the name, I'd not read him until introduced to his work through his essay ""One Night's Dying"" included in an anthology published by Phillip Lopate. I was impressed with his comments on deep cosmic time and evolution and our place in them. And I was impressed with his stylish prose. This collection of essays doesn't disappoint. He proved to be a more interesting writer than I'd hoped. Concerned as he is with all of nature from the fields adjacent to his house to the expanding universe, he's able to make astounding leaps in thought in a few sentences. He writes about frogs' eyes protruding from ponds to watch the skies and moves to our probing the night skies with telescopes. Grass seed pods clinging to his pants and transported from field to field reminds him of the theory of earth seeded by microscopic spores carried by falling meteorites. Sometimes he writes of the violent feeding of animal on animal with the same powerful lyricism as Ted Hughes. There are many rewards in the book, but I felt blessed to be reading the essay ""The Judgment of the Birds.""The 2d book, The Firmament of Time, is essentially a history of evolutionary thought, of how man progressed inn his understanding of the natural world, how we learned to expand time from our near-current age to the billions preceding us. He writes metaphorically about how science feeds the imagination. And he concludes wonderfully by explaining how man has transcended what we understand as natural.

She's best known today as an essayist but also wrote novels as well as teaching and being one of the founding members of The New York Review of Books. Her literary criticism was admired and sought after. Her voice in literary New York and international forums was considered influential. She knew everybody in the writing business but was especially close to Mary McCarthy, Adrienne Rich, Susan Sontag, and Elizabeth Bishop. The stories of their friendships is rich with anecdote and insight. And, of course, she was the wife of the poet Robert Lowell.I suppose it's understandable that so much of Hardwick's story is entwined with Lowell's. In the harbor of American letters he was one of the bigger vessels, and he made big waves. But the Hardwick/Lowell saga is a familiar one, told many times by now through Lowell biographies, collected letters, and critiques of The Dolphin, his controversial volume of poetry about their estrangement. I was hoping to be told more about the Hardwick separate from Lowell, but Cathy Curtis seemingly found it difficult to pry her away from him. The last 30 years of her life, after his death, are covered in almost as many pages. And then the biography reads like a catalog of where she was and what she did. Curtis is conscientious in extracting the key pints from what she wrote during those years, but she doesn't go very deep into telling us who she was. Beyond such surface qualities as being a good cook and liking opera we don't learn what her real joys were, why people liked her, and almost nothing about her inner life.To be fair, I think Curtis's information was limited. An author's note reading like a disclaimer tells us Harriet, the daughter of Elizabeth and Robert, is ""a very private person."" The implication is that Harriet, who'll be 65 on 4 January, didn't cooperate with Curtis, and without her providing detail and insight the biography slumps into inadequacy. We're told that Hardwick loved gossip and was often judgmental. Harriet knows a lot she won't tell. But, then, we also learn that Hardwick herself was no fan of biographies leading Harriet to serve as a shield. Perhaps I'm placing too much of the biography's weight on Harriet's shoulders. My own view is simply that family members should feel more responsibility in insuring the biography is the one the subject deserves.At year's end I like to study various compilations listing what are considered the best books of the year.

Though unfamiliar with all but a few of the contributors, I was impressed by the essays. And was gobsmacked by the intelligence and breadth of insight shown by some of them. As you might expect, most of the essayists write about how they relate to Thoreau's example in living and being attentive to the natural world around us. Famously, Thoreau ""lived deliberately"" in his time and place. He studied and recorded the nature he observed, and most of the essays reflect on how his attitudes apply to our time, to what he's still able to teach us. My favorite essays--like Alan Lightman's or Will Eno's--dive into the purest philosophical interpretations of what Thoreau was actually saying. All are able to see him in a personal way. Rafia Zakaria uses him to help her find solitude. Stacey Vanek Smith, a reporter on modern economies, says Thoreau wrote about the economy of his day while also seeing lives as nature. ""For all our drilling and extracting and constructing and pillaging, Thoreau saw us as just another expression of a divine, living earth, like the fish and the loons and the bubbles in the ponds."" Pico Iyer is a longtime resident of Japan who even finds him appropriate to Kyoto. A couple of essays inveigh against the impact of modern recreation on Walden Pond. Several express worries about the ways Thoreau's world and ours is being altered by climate change. Ice is twice a subject: we're told how much Thoreau loved skating on the frozen ponds and rivers around Concord, and Tatiana Schlossberg remembers how fascinated he was with the harvesting of Walden Pond's ice for sale in the South and abroad before she sadly tells us Walden no longer freezes over.To read the essays is to learn something you didn't know about Thoreau. They're full of ideas about and ways of looking at him. I think it's probably true to say there are as many Thoreaus in the book as there are essays. And some are so beautifully written they'll take your breath away. If you're interested in what Thoreau stands for, an acute sensitivity to and curiosity about nature, and if you're interested in trying to live deliberately in the world, you'll be intrigued by what these writers have to say.

We covertly supported the mujahedin's resistance to Soviet invasion in the 1980s. During the 1990s we uneasily watched the embers of that war and the resulting civil war while the Taliban brought a harsh stability to the country. Our own direct involvement, of course, followed 9/11. Because George Bush decided on a course of nation-building after the Taliban were defeated we were required to become occupiers and participate in another civil war.Carter Malkasian's excellent The American War in Afghanistan details the history of our 20-year entanglement in the military and political affairs there. We've been following Afghanistan's news since before 9/11, our awareness of successes and failures sharpened by each day's news cycle. However closely you've followed the news and remained informed of developments in the country, you'll be surprised by many of the perspectives Malkasian will show you. His insider viewpoint and insightful analysis gained by many years in-country will fascinate you.Though immediate, this isn't journalism but carefully considered and interpreted history. It's more than military history. If America never truly understood Afghanistan, Malkasian seems to. He understands the impact deeply-felt Islamic traditions--even laws--and Afghan tribal politics had on the conduct of the war. He describes the major military campaigns. He discusses tactics and weapons systems and leadership qualities. But he spends more time explaining how these fundamental components of war were uniquely affected by Afghanistan's strongly-held Islamic faith, by the competition between tribes, by wildfire corruption. Every aspect of Afghan society, from farming to education to women's rights, becomes part of Malkasian's narrative history. The policy decisions of 4 American presidential administrations are itemized. Afghan politics and its impact on U. S. policy is cited. Your opinion of every Afghan and American politician will be nudged in another direction by what you read.Was it a failure? Yes is his final judgment. The reasons are many. His conclusions fill many pages, but it boils down to the fact that America's attempt to build a democratic nation out of the shattered Taliban state couldn't overcome the power of Taliban/Afghan unity held together by their desire to live under an Islamic rule which resisted occupation by a western power generally despised throughout the country. Any Afghan government aligned with the American occupier had a weaker claim to Islamic values than the Taliban who were inspired by Islam and represented it. That elemental outlook hung in the atmosphere of Afghanistan and impacted every level of politics and the military until both became ineffective. Islamic identity and values inspired more than the tenets of democracy and national service we were trying to instil. That's the essence of it. Malkasian expands this core thinking across 461 pages like blowing up a balloon.The book is comprehensive. It lays blame, Afghan or American, where it needs to yet is generous in praise while covering a war confounding 4 presidents. It's almost complete, too. About the time the book his the shelves in late summer Biden was finally doing what the 3 previous presidents had wanted to do, withdrawing all U. S. forces. The book expresses it as going to zero.

Without access to the subject's private papers and without the cooperation of family and many who knew him, a complete picture can't be drawn. Carole Angier's biography of W. G. Sebald is an example of such limitations. Angier is an experienced biographer--Jean Rhys, Primo Levi--but walls erected to keep others out are difficult to break through. The melancholy, reflective Sebald was a private man. His family has elected to honor his privacy as well as the deliberate obfuscations he threw up during his lifetime (he lied, a lot).So far I've read only a couple of Sebald's books. I admire them. My reading of The Rings of Saturn several years ago was so breathtaking that ever since I've been particularly attracted to novels--those of Esther Kinsky and Teju Cole are examples--which make me think they're written with the same meditative vision and wish to reveal the truths of natural and human landscapes. So I approached Angier's biography eagerly but had to be satisfied with the incomplete picture given. No doubt she does as well as she could. She knows his work well, has written insightfully of him in the past, but the constrictions show. Some people in Sebald's story cooperated, of course. Most appear to have been associated with his childhood. It's not surprising, then, that his growing up fills almost half the book. The conventional biographical narrative is followed, but as he ages and the biography covers the period of his life I'm most interested in, the last decade of his life when the novels were written, the details become fewer and less weighty.Angier is good at analysis of the novels. So interwoven are the facts of the life and thought with what he wrote she resorts to literary criticism and to conjecture. The criticism is useful for anyone wanting to dissect Sebald. The conjecture leaves us with a picture of someone seen from a distance. We can observe and learn a little while at the same time being denied access to the depth. The reader becomes entry vehicle whose imprecise trajectory causes it to skip off the atmosphere of a Sebald it's not allowed to penetrate. Some consider him to be the most important writer of postwar Germany. There'll be many biographies of him to come.

It was a recommendation: either ""if you like big, difficult novels"" (which I do) or ""big, older novels you may have missed."" I was aware of Yamashita. Some time ago I'd penciled her earlier novel Tropic of Orange into my mind so I wouldn't forget it. But I was still putting it off because these days I have to be in the proper mood for magical realism, so I snatched up I Hotel instead and began.I wasn't disappointed. While I didn't think it especially difficult, I did find it innovative and boldly daring a reader to engage in its varied styles and optics on the page. The structure is 10 novellas about the Chinatown/Manilatown section of San Francisco. Almost every character is of Asian descent but mainly Chinese, Thai, Filipino, Japanese, Korean. The International Hotel on Kearny Street was the focal point for the Asian artistic movement and for Asian political dissent during the years of the novel, 1968 to 1977. The novellas aren't linked except in casual mentions of a character who may have figured in earlier stories. Almost every character is motivated by activist feeling relevant to Asian Americans. Some of them are old communists, even Filipino Huks. Some characters are student activists in the university unrest of the period, some are union organizers and activists in support of migrant farm labor. Most of the Japanese characters were impacted by their forced detention during WWII. And one novella takes place on Alcatraz during the American Indian Movement's occupation there. Though the flow of time spans 1968 to 1977, my impression is that some novellas cover 10 years in themselves. Beginning with the student protests in 1968, it ends with the city's decision to use eminent domain to forcefully evict the International Hotel's elderly population of artists and activists so the area can be used for new development. The event is a moment of history, and Yamashita's primary concern is history. It's a loose history of Chinatown during the 10 years but also alludes to every aspect of the Asian American experience, from the coolie labor used to build the transcontinental railroads to the Japanese internment.Yamashita uses a variety of styles: film screenplay, news reportage, poetry, even graphic illustration. One novella has political manifestos sprinkled within a script to support the character dialogue. It sounds challenging, but it's not. It's easy to read, and it's a lot of fun. The only part I found onerous was the novella involving Korean pornography. I never quite got it. I thoroughly enjoyed the different styles and enjoyed the characters--communists, cooks, artists, union organizers, students--and their zippy dialogue enlivening the streets of Chinatown and the halls of the International Hotel, from the riotous Berkeley campus laced with tear gas to the final sad image of the artists and activists walking down Kearny after being evicted in the name of urban progress....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 29, 2021","Jan 13, 2022","Sep 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45045517-i-hotel

It's not a novel of ideas yet is convincing in the importance of what it says, and you hurry on, eagerly reading to find out what that is. The war for Gloria involves Corey, her son, and Leonard, her husband, as well as Adrian, Molly, Tom, and Joan, and several others. Not all of them survive. Wars have casualties.Having read and admired Lish's 1st novel Preparations for the Next Life a few years ago, I expected the grit and edginess of his themes. I'd been gripped by the earlier novel's story of people struggling in America to get by and propelled by need toward violence. The War for Gloria is a gentler novel. Its characters are a little better off, but it's still a breathtakingly hard look at people who live with some degree of desperation.I was surprised near the end to have decided it's a kind of coming of age novel. On the face of it the war of the title is the struggle between Corey and his father for Gloria's affection. In some ways it's a novel lionizing the blue collar work ethic, and it celebrates those areas of Boston, from Cambridge to Winthrop and Malden to Quincy, where that ethic has importance. Hard manual labor is an important theme Lish highlights throughout. His descriptions of construction work or making marble countertops or the rigging of boats almost become solemnly ceremonial. The prose is direct and true and fits the plain lives of hard-working people. What you see is what you read. At the same time what you may see may be what you as reader bring to this kind of realist fiction.I thought I found ways of religious understanding as I read deeper. Lish doesn't signal or feint in any direction to draw you in. He simply presents a rather elemental struggle between good and evil. The war for Gloria pits Corey's pride, filial obligation, and moral purity against Leonard's scandal, obscenity, and dysfunction. Complicating it is the fact that Gloria has been diagnosed with and is rapidly degenerating from ALS, which leaves her at the mercy of Leonard's malevolence while desperately dependent on Corey's pure devotion. She can only offer love. Part of the war is that Leonard wants to take her love while Corey wants to emulate it. The manual skills Corey admires and acquires while managing to keep the family afloat financially, along with the cage-fighting and strenuous physical training he endures, is homage to the saintliness of the Gloria he's dedicated to protecting. The last chapter is satisfyingly titled "" O Gloria,"" and we're reminded that the Latin word is used in certain doxologies in praise of God. But Lish leads us even deeper. All these themes are mere tributaries feeding a rapidly effulgent river flowing toward the end of the novel. The old brick districts and warehouses and labyrinthine streets of Boston may be as much questing ground as modern city. Lish provides no map but leads us to the idea that the blue collar lifestyle and the punishing physical training necessary for Corey's pursuit of a cage-fighting career are both devotion and preparation for the next life.I think this a terrific novel.

It's the story of Lamian, a Bosnian Jew who served the Germans at Auschwitz as a kapo, a prisoner who helped supervise and sometimes brutalize fellow prisoners in return for special privileges from the SS jailers and executioners. The greatest privilege, as David Rieff's ""Afterword"" makes clear, is the chance to survive. Lamian does. In the chaos created by the frenzy of removals and killing as the advancing Soviets threaten to liberate the camp, he's one of those who escapes. After the war he settles in Banja Luka and works for the railroad while living in constant fear that he'll be recognized and exposed as one who collaborated against his fellow Jews. One day--I think it's 1983--he learns about and sees one of the women he raped in the camp. Frightened he'll be brought to a reckoning as well as filled with guilt, he begins to search for the woman.Lamian's mind has never been able to let go of the war or the camp. He dwells on what he saw and the brutal acts he was coerced into committing: killing, carrying the bodies, feeding the ovens. The elaborate system he uses to wring sex from starving prisoners in exchange for extra morsels of food is outside German scrutiny and only possible through his status as a kapo. In what becomes a novel about guilt, Lamian constantly relives scenes from the camp. The novel swings back and forth between the horrific past and the guilty present. He relates everything he sees in his current life, everyone he meets, to the camps. As you might expect, it's a dark novel and sometimes not pleasant reading. Yet it's compelling as a story and always interesting as Lamian moves toward the forgiveness he craves. His furtive life after the war has been unhappy, too. He realizes his ruthlessness as a kapo allowed him to survive into the dreary postwar years, but he knows he was a victim, too.Dark as it is, I like this novel. Its prose is free and easy to sink into. I think the translation from the Serbo-Croatian by Richard Williams must be a nimble one because the book turned into a kind of page-turner for me. I was always happy to return to it and continue Lamian's nightmarish story.

I've owned several collections of his poetry and at one time owned 2 different translations of the fragmentary autobiography considered his masterpiece, The Book of Disquiet. So I was eager for Richard Zenith's huge biography of him. It disappointed me. Not the quality of the biography itself because it's clearly a thorough, balanced portrait of the man and his work. The book is probably much more than I need (or want) to know about Pessoa. As fine as Zenith's book is, he was unable to make him interesting to me. The portrait Zenith painted of the man away from his poetry showed Pessoa without the professional skills or will to become more than he was, a modestly-published but greatly-admired poet. Too private, too shy, too inept at publishing and other business ventures, Zenith has little character to work with and yet, so complete is his research, he makes an enormous book out of him. Even his eccentricities, like his dependence on horoscopes and his interest in the spiritual realm or his use of the many famous heteronyms, the many shards of personality attributed as authors of the writings (a useful description of 47 of them precede the biography itself), once fully-analyzed, become colorless and...well, unusual rather than thought-provoking. Another problem is the comprehensive descriptions of early 20th century Portuguese arts and politics. Most of us aren't steeped in things Portuguese, anyway, once we veer away from Jose Saramago or Antonio Lobo Antunes. So I had trouble relating to the in-depth news of the arts scene and artists around Pessoa. For all the above reasons and more, I didn't get much out of my reading. As biography it's an achievement. I found its subject less interesting than I could have known.Lately I've been rereading Virginia Woolf's Diaries and recently came to August 1922 when she was reading James Joyce's Ulysses and being disappointed by it for a variety of reasons.

It's a designation she disputes but which caught my eye because I'm always alert to fresh perceptions, to the current news and views of the region I consider my spiritual home if it's no longer my physical home. And so I began Late Migrations hoping Renkl would provide intelligent insight into the South's past and present.Late Migrations doesn't do that, though it doesn't disappoint. It's a collection of lovely, brief essays so perfectly and tightly written that they're practically poetry. They mostly alternate between recollections of her life in the South--what she calls Lower Alabama, Birmingham, and Nashville--and observations of the natural world. Both the narrative of her life and the snapshots of the nature in her life have the scope and vision of a world. What she does, I think, is equate the two. She writes about her family within the context of nature and sees nature as always nudged up next to her family. She spends a lot of time describing the nesting habits of birds but also sees her family environment as a nest. In this way she traces the span of her own growing into adulthood and motherhood through her journey from Andalusia through Birmingham to settle in Nashville. And along the way the natural world she observes becomes her personal world as well.If her book has a flaw--I'm undecided--it's that she focuses too intently on loss. She shades it with an accumulation of grief. One of the early essays is called ""Red in Beak and Claw"" in which she unnecessarily reminds us of nature's predation. She too often sees human lives through the same dark understanding she has of life in her Nashville back yard. Cancer is the red-tailed hawk falling on a chipmunk, a stroke is as unforgiving as a snake swallowing the bluebird's egg. ""This life thrives on death,"" she writes and insists that we not forget our ""central motivation is fear of loss."" Rather than a view of death as natural, humans are doomed to perceive loss as grief and --our invention--tragedy. So in the end she doesn't write about the South. Her observations are more universal. At the human level she beautifully expresses what we all experience: the aging and death of parents, the empty nest of kids flown away to school and lives of their own. At the natural level she beautifully expresses what most of us probably don't notice, the teeming flora and fauna around us. If I wasn't given a nostalgic picture of the To Kill a Mockingbird South I grew up with, complete with unpaved country roads and unpainted houses with breezeways and chickens in the yard, I did read some of the best nature writing to come my way in a while. Renkl has a sensitive eye and the verbal ability to convey beautifully what the eye takes in. She shows us that the small nature of home can expand in all directions to include all of us.

Krishan, whose story it is, does indeed take a trip from Colombo into Sri Lanka's northeastern districts, the last stronghold of the famed Tamil Tigers during the Tamil war for independence in 2009. It's a journey requiring travel by train, 2 buses, and a taxi. He's attending the funeral of Rani, the woman who was caretaker to his grandmother. Haunted by the war and the loss of her 2 sons, she'd returned home only to die in a fall into a well which may have been accident or suicide.Krishan's journey is also spiritual. He'd once lived in the north as a social worker, and he connects with the Tamil region as much as he does with his grandmother's caretaker. News of Rani's death has caused vast tides of memory and feeling to wash over him. The novel is rich in the meditations filling up his travel. The novel's structure is an expansive block of prose without dialogue and as dense and as abiding as the ocean, and, like it, filled with swirling currents of ideas and human feeling. While thoughts of death and war are prominent, he's primarily concerned with love, memory, and time. What he fears is that they no longer hold meaning for him. Traveling to attend a funeral, what he seeks, though he doesn't know it exactly, is release from the burden they bring to his life. Love in particular gnaws at him. He's grown distant from the woman he loves, Anjum. A large chunk of the novel recalls their relationship a few years earlier, and it's here that the novel's large theme of eyes and vision first becomes noticeable. All experience, Krishan thinks, is taken in through the eyes. The lovers' gaze he and Anjum share at several moments in the novel is important. Rani's seeing the death of her youngest son is described as vision destroying her will to live as surely as the shrapnel which killed the boy. Eyes record landscapes and death and women's smiles and, mostly, they allow us to see existence we're not able to participate in. And at the end eyes containing a lifetime's vision and experience melt during cremation. Krishan's realization of this seems to be the destination of his journey. Fire, as Buddhism teaches us, can be purification. Krishan finds it in the north.This is a beautiful novel, stunningly and poetically written in sinuous sentences which go in all directions at once.

It covers his childhood and early development into manhood in, as the title specifies, the Great War.J. Alison Rosenblitt's detailing of the life of the young Cummings is fairly conventional and, I think, offers little we didn't already know. And it's told well enough that all the relevant facts are brought to light. Most interesting to me was the time of his imprisonment by the French in La Ferte-Mace, the infamous episode he furiously related in his memoir The Enormous Room. Because I've never read it, mostly because in my browsing through many labyrinthine, dusty aisles of used bookstores I've never encountered a copy (New York Review of Books will publish a new edition next May, an event already on my calendar) Rosenblitt's account was engaging news. After La Ferte-Mace his return to America to settle in New York City and to begin writing the poetry we know him for is told without breaking new ground. It's the interpretation of his experiences in France that startle. Arriving in France as a volunteer ambulance driver with his close friend William Slater Brown, they had a month-long deferment of service in Paris because they were without uniforms. There Cummings had a romance with a prostitute named Marie Louise Lallemand. While he was at the front they wrote each other intense letters. Yet when he was released from prison and returned to Paris he couldn't find her and never saw her or heard from her again. It's Rosenblitt's idea that Marie Louise was a major love--maybe the love--in Cummings's life and that earlier biographies assigned her ""to the margins because she was a sex worker"" and refused to recognize her importance in Cummings's emotional development. Her other extraordinary point is that Cummings was a war poet and that ""his ideas about love, justice, injustice, humanity, and brutality"" flowed into his life's work from his experiences in the Great War. In my reading the book I didn't see where she provided contextual arguments supporting either of these ideas. She comments on other biographies and faults them for missing the point, but she herself doesn't make her point. Especially that as war poet, I think. It's true his experience at the front and in prison were too harrowing for such a naive and sensitive man, and it's true he wrote some poems about the war. However, I don't think his poetry addresses the total cataclysmic and human ruin that was the Great War. We have Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, David Jones, and Robert Graves for that, allowing us to keep E. E.

S. president James K Polk touched off a dispute on the Texas-Mexico border in order to provoke a war that would force Mexico to sell their northern territories--California and New Mexico--to the U. S. I had a sketchy knowledge of the battles, and I knew that some U. S. Army officers later prominent in the Civil War--Robert E Lee and U. S. Grant are a couple--cut their teeth and earned reputations serving in the war. To be sure Guardino's book is a military history. He does give the reader comprehensive accounts and analyses of the campaigns and battles. But his primary purpose is to provide a social and cultural history of the 2 opposing societies. As he outlines in his ""Introduction,"" he tells the story of the war by following 3 themes: gender, race, and religion. He explains how the basic forms of masculinity for Mexican and American men differed in the mid-19th century and how those perceptions affected the conduct of the war. A lot of emphasis is placed on the roles of women in Mexican society and their various influences on the armies. Race was important in 2 ways: because of American attitudes of superiority to Mexicans who they considered a race, and because an expansionist America hoped the territories won in the war would be an extension of the South's slave-holding culture. Finally, the war became a contest between an intensely-bigoted Protestant America and Catholic Mexico. America at the time was in the midst of a Protestant revival known as the Second Great Awakening that butted heads directly with a nation believing Catholicism was the only route to salvation, a nation which justified its formation by the need to bring such Catholic salvation to its indigenous population. During the war churches were the focal points for many important events.But all this barely scratches the surface of this exhaustive social record of 1840s Mexico and America. Guardino also explains the social and economic conditions for the opponents, concluding that first and foremost Mexico lost the war because they were poor and were attacked by an extraordinarily wealthy neighbor. What was it like to be a soldier in the war becomes clear through thorough analysis of the opposing armies. How much did American expansionism really contribute to the nation's attitudes toward the war? What part did the war and its results play in leading to the later Civil War in the U. S.? What is meant by nationalism and how were such ideas promoted in the 2 countries? These questions and more, questions I'd never before known to ask, are answered in this fascinating panoramic snapshot of 2 societies at war.

His concern is the global decline of democracy. As he sees it, the ubiquity of information, right or wrong, sincere or fake, is causing the crumbling of authority. Powerful points of digital reference held in common by like-minded groups within the public are causing a distrust of hierarchies felt to be failing them by not delivering better ways of life. The traditional centralized powers and top-down governance oriented toward the masses is giving way to a revolution in the nature and content of communication through digital platforms which are empowering the individual. Political discussion through digital space is direct rather than mediated through traditional outlets. It therefore drives opinion. The upswell of information in the hands of every citizen allows the public a longer reach with which to acquire new understandings, again right or wrong, which help to subvert the legitimacy of legal governments. Authority is eroding, sometimes with devastating effect. The general unrest of 2011 was one result of all this. That year saw the Arab Spring, similar protests in Tel Aviv and Madrid, and riots in the UK. The U. S. experienced the Occupy Wall Street movement. All these events were inspired by a groundswell of groups networking on digital platforms and using them as tactical tools in direct confrontations with established hierarchies.The book was originally published in 2014. It must have seemed prescient then. This new edition, published in 2018, contains a long final chapter extending these ideas as demonstrated by the the election of Trump and the Brexit vote. The ultimate result of the revolt is a creeping nihilism, already visible in leaders and governing bodies. Surprisingly, he considers Obama and Trump to be not as opposite as we'd think. Trump has always been in full-tile nihilist mode. Obama came by his in trying to accommodate a public rejecting his programs.I guess this is what you'd call a baggy book. One comment about it I agree with is that Gurri could've used an editor. He states his messages over and over until they become mantras. For that reason the book's too long and becomes a little tedious. Still, he's mostly convincing, even if we don't believe every word of it. After all, we can see on our television screens what he's writing about. Where this is headed, where our access to all this information and fake news and post-truths will eventually take us, he says, is a deepening of the nihilism and governmental paralysis. He offers remedies and adjustments, but they require hard work. I'm not sure he's confident our hierarchies are up to it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 22, 2021","Dec 02, 2021","Jul 16, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42286006-the-revolt-of-the-public-and-the-crisis-of-authority-in-the-new-millenni

I'd read his earlier history of the Comanche empire and was impressed with its treasure of historical perspectives new to me. I accepted his premise of empire in regard to the Comanche because I had no reason to quarrel with it and not enough understanding of the region and the groups competing for it to support a quarrel. However, I've read more widely about the Plains and was disappointed by Hamalainen's insistence on empire, on a sovereignty and even a nationalism for the Sioux. I thought the perspective of empire forced him into revisionism. It's true the 6 large kinship groups we combine as Sioux have always been the dominant peoples wherever they established themselves. His story of the Lakota and the sister groups is an epic one, as you might expect. When the Europeans first contacted them in their home in the western Great Lakes they were already prominent. As they spread west out of the woodland lake region onto the Plains, the Missouri River basin, and west to the Black Hills, motivated by the mobility of the horse and its improvement of hunting and warfare, they continued to dominate every indigenous group they encountered. This is the best part of the story, the description of how Lakota society functioned, how leadership structures regulated it, how it related to the land and its resources, and much more. How a society more complex than we imagined lived. Hamalainen writes that their supremacy over the river systems feeding the Missouri was possible through their sheer numbers and their increasing skill with horses. That supremacy also was possible because the U. S. didn't need the land. The 1st half of the 19th century saw the U. S. focusing on expansion into the Mexican southwest. After the Civil War, increasing migration into California and Oregon, the building of the railroads, and America's divine mission to expand across the continent changed that. He also makes the point the 2 cultures were incompatible. So, 2 antipathetic cultures competing for the same space meant one had to die. If the Indians didn't understand the treaties they signed, they understood the cultural death that came with the reservation system and with the end of the vast bison herds.Hamalainen bases Sioux rights on sovereignty. His claim is their holdings along the Missouri and Powder Rivers made then a sovereign entity, but the U. S. perspective was never that they were 2 national states competing for the heart of the continent. To the U. S. the Indians were always wards of the state, even if the many treaties (a word discontinued in regard to Indians in 1870 because treaties exist only between nations) gave them a sense of independence the American government never intended.The result of this dissonant point of view tended to divide the book into 2 halves: the 1st a history of the Sioux before the Civil War with which I engaged, the 2d their history after the Civil War which I came to disbelieve. It's all absorbing and informative reading, but I thought the 2d half flawed by Hamalainen's insistence on the land the Sioux occupied being considered a national entity. The record of U. S. treatment of the Indians is a sorry one. They were coerced into giving up a life providing sustenance for life on reservations dependent on government issue of food and other annuities. Their sacred places were taken because they contained resources the U. S. wanted. They were victims of deliberate infections and their way of life destroyed by the deliberate killing of the bison herds. And this happened because there was only one imperial organization on the Plains, not two.

Until now that's been my only exposure to her, though a compelling one. Robert Zaretsky's brief treatment of her life and works seemed to be a good primer on the woman today considered a kind of secular saint. And the book's proven to be that, a springboard into her rigid life and towering thought. The two will always need to be considered together because she was one of those rare individuals who practiced what she believed. In fact, in reading Zaretsky one learns that she lived awkwardly in the world, fueled by an idealism so uncompromising that it was, like her ideas of parachuting nurses into the front lines of wartime Europe and of abolishing all political parties, impractical. The biographical details are here and are generally sketched chronologically. Zaretsky stitches the life together with the threads of 5 ideas she concerned herself with: suffering so deep it turns individuals into things, the attention necessary to take possession of our minds, the need for rootedness or belonging, the importance of resistance, and the attainment of goodness as a way of combatting cynicism, cruelty, and callousness. I'm not sure how seriously Weil is studied today. The wary label mystic hangs on her like an odor yet she strongly influenced the thinking of Albert Camus and Iris Murdoch.

Instead I found a cultural history of the west during the 2 decades following WWII, particularly American culture, dominant at the time because American cultural institutions had been allowed to thrive during the war, unrestricted by the conflict. Postwar was a time of rapid social and cultural change in which the Cold War itself wasn't so much a competitive field as an enduring product of the freedoms the west's cultural dynamic reflected.There are chapters on abstract painting, literary criticism, the civil rights movement, feminism, Beat literature, dance, film, and much more. These and other iconic groundswells in western culture are distilled into clear summaries bringing them into sharp focus as elements in themselves as well as shifting parts of the cultural whole for the period. Such analysis makes this invaluable history.Much of it is related as story, the story of how individual disciplines progressed fueled by those figures most influential. How did Jackson Pollock become Jackson Pollock? How did James Baldwin and Susan Sontag become the enormously important influences they were at the time and remain today? Menand describes how their intellectual and artistic ideas became the cultural history of the period. And they represented areas--rock and roll, painting, dance--whose trends followed the individuals driving them. His explaining Duchamp of Warhol or Kerouac as figures behind their respective movements is not only useful but often provides new ways of seeing them.There were some surprises for me. Menand cites Beat literature as being more influential to western ideas--rather than being literarily innovative--than I'd previously thought. The anthropology of the period, too, had a lot to teach us about freedoms. Most of us are familiar with the rise of rock and roll but few of us, perhaps, think of it as an export we imported back from Britain in a rejuvenated spirit. Movies, too. At the end of the war Hollywood was by far the most important producer of movies and was filling European theaters with them for populations hungry for popular entertainment. But Menand convincingly tells how French auteur methods, best personified in the film Bonnie and Clyde, re-directed American films away from the big, empty blockbusters of the late 50s and early 60s to give movies new life and style.There's a light dose of politics, too. Where America was headed in those years was Vietnam. The book gives a sobering assessment of why we should not have fought there. It fits with Menand's message that America's 20th century artistic freedoms--embodied in Kerouac, Pollock, Betty Friedan, Lionel Trilling and Susan Sontag and all the rest--acted as a foil against totalitarian thought and as inspiration to resist an authoritarian future. Our work was to set the example, not to confront directly.

Like the others, Solar Bones--defined as the everyday rituals we live by--is written in a blocky yet broken form which casts an unconventional and seemingly difficult prose on the page. Yet it's neither difficult to read nor to understand. Nor is is electrifying because the phrases flow without being especially lyrical. Lack of difficulty may be a strike against it because we've come to think of modernism, no matter how the style breaks with tradition, as challenging reading. Solar Bones, 217 pages without any breaks at all, looks like a meditative whole. Each sentence of fragment is a paragraph without punctuation or capitalization other than proper names. The paragraphs form blocks of linked thought, beginning to end, but are more narrative than meditative, even though they're in the head of a man named Marcus Conway who's apparently sitting at his kitchen table. His thoughts are of his family: wife Mairead, daughter Agnes, an artist who paints with her own blood, and son Darragh who's gone hippie walkabout in Australia. Conway's a civil engineer who thinks of his work constructing bridges and buildings in County Mayo, his home in the west of Ireland. His memory brings up his childhood and his life as ""father, husband, citizen,"" what he boils down to. For all its prose novelty stamping it as modernist, the novel never achieved for me the ambition I want from this type of novel, connection of the modern with classical, even mythic, themes. Mark Conway can't represent modernism because he doesn't represent the broader ideas of progression in art and thought.

Germs themselves refer to ""the seeds from which a life grows,"" and at the end he refers to them as scattered grains he's poked through.Wollhem grew up the privileged son of an actress and a theatrical producer. His home environment included frequent visits by many well-known artists, performers, and writers of pre-war Europe. They receive their mention without any shocking details, if Wollheim knew any. Though his parents were naturally his primary influence, he lists a parade of nannies, governesses, and tutors from whom he learned a great deal mostly by observation. He remembers them as well as anybody in his childhood and has given them important space in his story by portraying them as among the most incarnate people of his development.The style reminds me a little of Proust. The young Wollheim's sensibilities and confusions often seemed like young Marcel's, particularly in how he perceives the details of the world outside the home. There are several moments of heightened awareness when things--fences, trees, shadows--come into a focus revealing secrets of existence not known before. He wanders wondering through his childhood to arrive in his teen years unexpectedly perceptive of girls, the nature of love and sexuality, and of the transactional necessary dynamic between teachers and the misbehaving students they whipped in the school system of his day.

She has an awkward relationship with her family made worse by her being hard of hearing. Just as this is improved by her friend's gift of a hearing trumpet, the family places Marian in a care home. Marian's adventures in the care home were comic enough to make me chuckle out loud. However, in the middle is a long fabulist tale within a tale involving the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, and a Goddess called Santa Barbara de Tartarus. The novel never recovers its earlier comedy and instead begins to take itself more and more seriously as it slides into the surreal and introduces such bizarre events as the earth shifting on its axis, Marian literally descending to Hell where she's thrown into a stew which cooks into her own self, and the eventual appearance of the Goddess as a woman with a wolf's head. Along the way there are evil potions, animal guides, and a near-hero Asian chauffeur acting as sidekick.Olga Tokarczuk provides an ""Afterword"" that sheds some light on it all. At work, we learn, is a deeply feminist text in which the surreal reflects an unconventional order opposing the old patriarchal one. The Goddess's role is to deepen the feminism in the world and to highlight culture while at the same time opposing traditional patriarchy. Tokarczuk explains it better than I can.

Auslin, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, Stanford University, has written 8 essays to help us understand the new competition for the Indo-Pacific region that's developed as a result of China's rapid economic and military growth over the last 30 years. China plays a role in all the essays, even that on the new role of women in Indian society and the one on the dangers posed by a nuclear North Korea. Another essay focuses on the direct competition between China and Japan, historically and now. Four essays deal with the strategic importance of East Asia and the Indian Ocean and why the U. S. and China are fiercely competing for dominance there. Auslin confirms the Chinese goal of becoming Asia's hegemon. The U. S., perceived as weakening relative to China's increasing strength, is determined to maintain its position as guarantor of peace and best friend to most in the region since the end of WWII. It wants to continue being the dominant influence. The final essay is a ""future history"" imagining what hostilities might look like were China, the U. S., and Japan to stumble into a shooting war in 2025. While the military results aren't surprising, the political consequences of the brief conflict, as Auslin guesses they might go, are. But his analysis of the competition for the region covers much more than military considerations.

Like him, Esther Kinsky writes about memory and about a character wandering landscapes in search of impressions and the meanings of her recent past which include the death of her partner, called M. The book's in 3 parts linked more closely than is apparent at first. The landscapes she immerses herself in are Italian, 1st in Olevano, a village on the southeastern outskirts of Rome. It's here she brings up the major topic of her thought, the great dichotomy between life and death and where she finds their representations in a cemetery and a grove of pines on opposite sites of the road approaching the house she rents. The 2d part is memories of childhood trips through Italy with her family, from Milan to Rome. Her father was interested in the Etruscans. The necropolises they visit and the stories told of Etruscan culture are central to her family memories. In the 3d part she visits Ferrara and the Po River estuary in the middle of winter. She's a careful, methodical observer of nature and Italian life. Everywhere she goes she studies the land and the way light and weather, animals and humans fit into it. She's in search of her own fit into the world following the loss of her partner. The seam between life and death is on her mind constantly. The herons and flamingoes looming in the landscape around Ferrara amidst scattered groves of trees and marsh grass are opposites in her thinking just as the cemetery and grove in Olevano. I remember that birds are often thought agents of death in our stories, ancient and modern, while groves are traditionally sacred sites and are repositories of memory. Certainly the novel's story most concerns grief, summed up elegantly in the final chapter, ""Lamentatio,"" in which the character closely relates to a 600-year old painting of Francis of Assisi.It's not exactly clear to me whether or not she's choosing between life and death. She does leave the Po delta, traveling through Bologna and Milan into the Alps, and her outlook seems to brighten along the way. Nor is it clear why this is called ""A Field Novel."" I wondered if we're meant to think of field in the context of an anthropologist doing fieldwork within a particular society to study its culture and mores.This is a beautiful novel. I'm drawn to these kinds of introspective, inner-directed passages where characters discover meaning and order through observation.

FaOne way to tell a story is through multiple perspectives, a chain of voices, which is exactly the title of Andre Brink's famed South African novel. Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is another example of a story told in this way. But history can use this method, too. A decade ago Peter Englund published The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, which narrates 1914-18 in Europe through the experiences and impressions of 20 ordinary people from 12 countries. Now Charles J. Hanley does the same thing with the Korean war. Ghost Flames covers the course of the war through the stories of 20 people who experienced it firsthand.Most of the ""cast of characters"" were simply typical citizens of their countries. Half were Korean and were from both sides of the 38th parallel. Fourteen were soldiers or joined this army or that. Three were young Korean women, and one of them a child. Elizabeth Hirschboeck was a doctor and Maryknoll nun with Korean experience who returned to run a missionary hospital in Pusan. Two were journalists, one of them a British reporter for the communist press in Peking. One man was a Chinese diplomat. Three were high-ranking generals, and 4 were Americans who served in the bloody actions up and down the peninsula. Two of the 20 became POWs.As Hanley weaves the stories into the loose outline of the war he creates a narrative that's not an operational or political history but one of people caught up in events they couldn't avoid or control. From the Pusan Perimeter to Pyongyang to Pork Chop Hill to Panmunjom, it's all backdrop against which the individuals glitter and illuminate, giving the history definition, expression. This history of the war is made from observations and oral anecdote of the 20 people whose stories Hanley chose to tell.Hanley makes a point of emphasizing the number or atrocities and mass executions that occurred during the war. I was unaware of the incidents he reports and was as surprised by their existence and unnecessary and sometimes casual brutality as I was by the fact that in the years since they've been confirmed by those guilty of committing them. They're not just North Korean and Chinese armies eliminating the intellectual classes of regions they occupy, but the South Koreans eradicating leftist elements within their politics and society and also American units shooting groups of refugees for fear their numbers contain enemy infiltrators. Aside from what I considered Hanley's sometimes gratuitous over-emphasis of such incidents, I think his method and chronicle is even-handed, weighing the attitudes, values, and perspectives of all his subjects, Korean, Chinese, and American, equally, without favor....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 19, 2021","Mar 07, 2021","Dec 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53054971-ghost-flames

Inevitably some fell by the wayside as my personal interests changed and aesthetic sensibilities became, hopefully, more enlightened.

The philosophic touch on modern ideas of evil and the nature of spectacle while other pools might be represented by an essay on the forms of the sentence the one on Auguste Rodin. Gass's discerning insight into subjects is only part of his strength. He writes a prose so delicious that it'll hook any reader into sitting up and taking notice.

I suggest Mikey and the surprise attending his liking a particular breakfast cereal, Life, because the ""Introduction"" to Divorcing by David Rieff suggests I won't like it. Worse, that it's not very good. I'd imagined an uphill slog to reading it but was pleasantly surprised how well I liked it, at what a gluttonous read it became for me.The novel's, after all, about life without the capital L, to deliberately return to the breakfast cereal, though it's also about leaving and about death. It's the story of Sophie Blind who emigrates to America from Budapest with her father just ahead of the Nazi pogrom against the Jews. There she meets Ezra Blind (modeled, we're told, on Taubes's husband Jacob, just as Sophie is modeled on Susan) and makes a life with him and their 3 children. Divorcing's main narrative current moves her back to Europe as an act of breaking up the marriage. The novel contains many split-ups: Sophie's aunts are leaving uncles, her mother leaves Sophie's father for a much younger man, Jews leave their homeland, Sophie leaves life. Divorce is everywhere and takes many forms. Much of it is a novel of interior feelings delivered in a dream-like style not always to be taken literally. However, it's my understanding Sophie's point of view for parts of the novel is from death. We're told by Rieff's ""Introduction"" that the working title was To America and Back in a Coffin, fortunately rejected by her publishers. Fortunately because it's a novel full of life. That's no better realized than in Part Three which is about her childhood in Budapest and about her wonder at the rich Jewish tradition so animatedly alive around her. This is the part of the novel I liked best. It's also the part of the novel least tainted by the surreal. And in the latter half of the novel Taubes best demonstrates what she's good at, writing strong, believable characters in progressive and confident sentences. It's fairly complex and interestingly styled and structured but in the final parts begins to almost sprawl into a family saga. And it's difficult to sprawl from a coffin. Breaking free from it as Taubes does is resurrecting.Why is the novel's reception so confused? Probably because it has an interesting background. A week after it was published to dismissive or bad s in 1969, particularly a savage one by the influential Hugh Kenner in the New York Times, Susan Taubes committed suicide. Susan Sontag, an intimate of Taubes, and David Rieff's mother, identified the body. I'm wondering if the young Rieff was told by his mother or intuited from her the idea the novel's not good, the idea later reinforced when he read Kenner's . We may never know, and perhaps should't. And probably shouldn't bother ourselves too much about it. It doesn't matter and, besides, today's s of Divorcing are quite good. What I know now from my reading is that I like the Taubes novel better than the Sontag novels.

Its translator Michael Hofmann calls it a panopticon, a vehicle telling the stories of its characters in every circumstance life can offer or throw at us, collectively a representation of humanity, individually every one an everyman. My dictionary defines the word as a circular prison with cells arranged around a central well where prisoners can be observed at all times. Hofmann may have been making a statement about the moral, financial, or spiritual circumstances of the characters' lives. We've read this kind of novel before, most memorably for me The Hive by Camilo Jose Cela which is a portrait of 1943 Spain epitomized by the interactions and social complexion of 300 characters on a single street in Madrid.Pigeons on the Grass has fewer characters--I listed 32 as I read--and takes place in Munich, Germany in 1948. The interior lives of these characters--it's a novel dense with monologue but no dialogue--form the narrative of a single day in Munich which in turn reflects much of European history, German folklore as well as classical mythology, and all of western philosophy Nazi-ism and the recent war hang over everything. But in this novel which seems to take place in one still-damaged square of the city of Nazi origins, the victorious American military has a heavy presence. Ten of the characters are American soldiers or a trio of American teachers on a tour. The rest are German men and women still living in the harsh hangover of the war and trying to maneuver the day-to-day realities of occupation in their favor. A railroad porter wants the money for a drink, a film actor wants some peace and quiet, a woman seeks an abortion while another carries her jewelry to a pawnbroker. Through it all strides an aloof visiting poet who wants to give a successful address and later to make a homosexual connection. Susanne imagines herself Circe and initiates a union with the Black soldier Odysseus Cotton. Another woman, by simply donning a peaked and feathered cap, begins to think of herself as Till Eulenspiegel of German folklore. The characters wander through a day in Munich and a narrative structured by Koeppen without a plot to show us the randomness of lives dealing with the myriad meaningless details of everyday existence. All the while they think they're free and all are unaware of Hofmann's panopticon. It's a novel a little like those of Henry Green, too. A lot happens and yet nothing of significance happens except to reveal the many sides of humanity. The significance of the day Koeppen chose to share with us is that it has no significance. He begins the novel's last paragraph: ""The church tower sounds midnight. A day is over. A page of a calendar is torn off.

One of tA long time ago, in my backtime, before I could afford to buy as much poetry as I read, I'd sometimes simply type a copy of a book I admired. One of those was Sylvia Plath's Ariel. I had no idea who she was when I first read her book, probably 1967. I was gobsmacked by her poems expressing lyrical beauty and anger at the same time. I wanted a copy, so I typed one. Later I became interested in her husband Ted Hughes, too. Since then I've always been tuned into the Plath/Hughes industry, have read (and now own) all of their poetry, the letters, journals, and several biographies, even the biography of Assia Wevill, Plath's dark rival for Hughes's love. I'd been feeling a little too saturated in the poets' well-known story until I dived into Heather Clark's new biography of Sylvia. It's a compelling read, an enormous--937 pps of text plus 177 pps of notes, bibliography and index--examination of Plath's life and work, filled with new information and perspectives.Unlike some Plath studies, Clark's work is refreshingly even-handed. She doesn't mete out blame for Plath's periods of madness or for her suicide. Hughes blamed himself. Aurelia Plath, her mother, blamed herself. Her London GP who was inexperienced with the combinations of drugs she was taking arranged a psychiatric stay too late and came to blame himself. Clark's conclusions are convincing enough: Sylvia had had a previous psychiatric breakdown, suicide attempt, and hospitalization, and she lived in fear of another hospital stay, one that might also involve electroshock treatment. The mind-fogging drug combination and fear of the psychiatric ward had much more to do with her suicide than the breakup with Hughes. At the time of her suicide there existed the good chance they'd reconcile.Not to ignore the fact that the marriage was troubled. One major problem was that Sylvia felt a sense of rivalry with Hughes. Both were gifted poets, perhaps genius, and she always put his work first. Her ambitions, however, seemed stronger than his. Or maybe it was that, being a woman in 1960s London, she had to work that much harder. Famously Plath painted a rosy picture for her mother in America and for her British friends, but her more honest journal entries show her to have been complaining and unhappy. Clark uses both the happy correspondences and grumbling personal jottings and points out the contrasts when they exist. Sylvia's reality and fantasy were frequently at odds. The biography overall shows her more troubled from the start than we knew. Yet as competitive as Plath was in her writing, I think it interesting that Clark finds Hughes considerably influential in the style and content of her poetry. And it was always she, acting as his agent, who drove the desire to expand his reputation, who helped make him an international poet. Hughes always acknowledged that she made him.This is serious biography that tries to say everything there is to say about Plath. One of the great things about the book is its detail. In covering certain periods of her life, like her June 1953 stint in New York City as a Mademoiselle guest editor that became the source for her renowned semi-autobiographical novel The Bell Jar, or her ""Mad Passionate Abandon, February 1956"" romance with Hughes, the book is a day-by-day record of events. Clark has looked under every leaf for fact, turned every page in search of new aspects. She has seemingly had access to every shard of the Plath/Hughes archive, including the unpublished works. The reader even learns the monthly amounts in Ted and Sylvia's bank accounts and what brands of diapers or soap powder she preferred. Even lovers: we've understood Plath to be very sexually active, but so complete is Clark's census that ""we had not thought so many had crossed London Bridge,"" to borrow from Eliot who borrowed from Dante. This is the biography of a major poet, too, and it's therefore complete and useful in its insightful analysis of her poems.Someone said the job of the biographer is to bring the deed to life. Clark certainly does that. Plath lives here with more realization and understanding than any other biography of her I've read. This is the definitive biography of her. There will not be a better, more complete understanding of her in my lifetime, and probably not yours....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Nov 02, 2020","Jan 12, 2021","Nov 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50607347-red-comet

I think they're terrific.Valentino tells the story of a young man given all the financial and educational resources his working class family could provide. His 2 sisters were denied any advantages so that Valentino could fulfill the family's expectation that he become ""a man of consequence."" While completing his medical studies he marries a woman of means who can easily support his entire family. The story Caterina tells of a brother who doesn't have to earn his way displays her generosity in the face of the bitterness and disappointment she and her sister Clara have had to accept. Sagittarius in the 2d story is the name of an art gallery the novella's dreamy, dilettantish mother plans to open with her new friend Scilla. Another story of uneven love, the mother navigates her precarious course toward an entry into the town's artistic life while neglecting and devaluing her own family.A lot of the success of these stories lies in the voice and points of view in which they're written. Both are told by youngest daughters in neutral tones helping to keep them some distance from the discord and disputes arising from the entanglements of plot. Also, Ginzburg uses the tension between rural or village origins and cities with great success to motivate her characters. The families are originally from smaller localities where their innocence fit easily into quieter lives. Their troubles begin with their moves into bigger towns where they encounter deceit and decay. There's not only the atmosphere of the homes with new activities outside them, like coffee bars or riding stables. Both stories balance the family home with that of the home that fascinates them. It's like the 2 ends of a dumbbell where emotion and energy flow along the bar. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 31, 2021","Feb 02, 2021","Sep 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55235026-valentino-sagittarius

The novel takes off, like light thrown into time and space by a single source, from an actual event, a soiree in 1928 Berlin in which the chance attendance of actress Marlene Dietrich, filmmaker Leni Riestenstahl, and the Chinese American film star Anna May Wong was recorded by Alfred Eisenstaedt's portraits of the 3 together, included in the paper edition. The novel's arc traces the careers of the 3 women from that moment to the end of the century. What links them is film. Also, very subtly, what they share is lives deeply impacted by the politics and culture of the 20th century, cleverly wrung by Koe from their actual biographies. Riestenstahl became close to the Nazi leadership of Germany as they used her to make propaganda films. Wong and Dietrich struggled with the politics of Hollywood. Koe makes Dietrich the agent through which the cultural and political movements at the end of the century reach affirmation. She watches and approves as the Berlin wall falls symbolizing the end of the Soviet Union while in Beijing Chairman Mao's huge portrait competes with the newly-arrived image of KFC's Colonel Sanders. Earlier in the novel Riestenstahl's assistants had helped her in using light to tell a story.

Where that novel had ended with its focus mostly on the oldest daughter Ursula, here Lawrence widens the story to include her sister Gudrun and the 2 men they love in early adulthood. In some ways, since Rupert and Gerald have entire chapters devoted to them, it's a novel as much theirs as the sisters. Lawrence's scope widens, too. He allows the characters' physical explorations to move away from the Midlands coal country to include London and even the continent while also diving deep within their own selves. Incorporating the stories of Rupert and Gerald also creates room for Lawrence to examine a theme central to him, the intrinsic contest between male and female. That tension energizes the novel, though with appreciations that might seem a little wrong-footed today. But this is Lawrence after all, and the novel is a hundred years old now. Most of those years rested heavily on my shoulders as I finished the novel. Late in it is a conversation between Gudrun and a German sculptor she's drawn to:""Pah--l'amour. I detest it. L'amour, l'amour, die Liebe--I detest it in every language. Women and love, there is no greater tedium,"" he said. She was slightly offended. And yet this was her own basic feeling. Men and love--there was no greater tedium.In my busy pandemic reading of Lawrence I've come to agree with Geoff Dyer's assessment that his essays and letters are more intriguing than the fiction.

It isn't in the end about John as much as it's about the son, one of the survivors of the family's violent abolitionist activities leading up the the American Civil War. The story Owen tells details Brown family life maintaining an important waystation of the Underground Railroad in Mt. Elba, New York in the shadow of Mt Tahawus, whose finned shape and height invited the sobriquet Cloudsplitter. Later John Brown's fiery faith and rhetoric so forceful it might split clouds and rain brimstone led the family to fighting encroaching slavery in Kansas and to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia in the expectation they'd incite a general slave uprising.This is all part of the history of the 1840s and 1850s United States fractured by slavery. Woven into the novel are historical figures we know and the satellite themes of romance and politics of the times. The dominant personality, of course, is John Brown, who's seen in the conventional portrayal he's come down to us, as the Biblically-inspired communicant with God expressing His wrath through abolitionist engagement. If John is not, Owen is subject to as much uncertainty and mistrust the politically-heated times prompted. All this makes the imposing father that much more towering, looming as intimidatingly over the novel as Mt Tahawus looms over the family farm and stands for the fiery father who speaks to God and considers abolition a prophecy and mission. A key moment is when father and son attend a lecture on the nature of heroism by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Owen comes away seeing John in the same heroic light, as a Puritan version of Emerson, an important part of how the story becomes Owen's instead of John's and helping explain why he and so many others would willingly follow a man who's led into such horrific violence by messages from God.

Perhaps it is, but only because its subject is unknown to all but a few of us. Mrs Meredith is much less famous than the 2 men with whom she's identified. And identified with them only because Diane Johnson brings it to our attention. She was Mary Ellen Peacock who married one of the lesser lives of the biography, Edward Nicolls of the Royal Marines. Widowed after 2 years, the young Mary Ellen married George Meredith. We know him as the celebrated novelist, author of The Ordeal of Richard Feverel. What makes Mary Ellen stand out is that she chose to leave him for another man, the painter Henry Wallis. We know him, too, the painter of The Death of Chatterton, a work in which Wallis used Meredith as the model for the suicidal poet Thomas Chatterton. Unhappy with Meredith, Mary Ellen's life with Wallis was clouded by the husband's refusal to let her see their son, Arthur, after the separation and by her advancing renal disease which killed her at 40, leaving Wallis with their own 3-year old son, Felix.The sons are only 2 of the lesser lives the biography concerns itself with. The poet Thomas Love Peacock, her father, George Meredith, and Henry Wallis her lover are the ""greater,"" famous lives of the story around which the lesser lives of Mary Ellen's story revolve. They include siblings, mothers, servants, friends, writers, politicians, and everyone else Johnson has dug up in her research to highlight as part of Mary Ellen's life. One of her purposes is to make us aware of these lives so that they share some of the prominence the famous enjoy. They're recognized as strands of the webs making up the other lives. Johnson has carefully made the effort to weave the facts of their lives into Mrs Meredith's. Another purpose, I think, is to describe the Victorian world these people--characters--lived in. Mary Ellen's bold decisions were unconventional in an age when women were overshadowed by their men, their work restricted to the domestic, the details of their lives hidden. They weren't allowed to own property, and in the unusual event of a broken marriage in Victoria's Britain, they weren't even, as Mary Ellen found out, allowed to keep their children. Johnson's masterly combination of biography, history, and feminism allows Mary Ellen to emerge from the Victorian fog and take shape in an age more forgiving of her actions.

It's supplied the biographical details of Eliot's life I wanted as well as information about how and why the novel was written. Much more, really, because it's also a combination of Mead's memoir of her personal experience with the novel along with a vast trove of literary criticism about it. It's everything Middlemarch, furnishing deep understanding of the novel and its characters, including ideas about where those characters were drawn from Eliot's own life and what events from her life inspired the themes. As you'd expect, Mead found many ways Eliot's novel and life touched her own and affected her growing insight into the text. Mead writes, ""A book may not tell us exactly how to live our own lives, but our own lives can teach us how to read a book."" Those realizations unveiled in the pages of her book make it all that much richer. In fact, as she notes, the universal humanity displayed by the characters has the ability to touch us all in some way.

Infinite Baseball is a disappointment.We like to read about baseball, of course, because we love the game. Baseball means something to each of us individually. It's personal, our relationship with it measured in degrees of affection and nostalgia. The image of fathers playing catch with sons in the yard or Michael Costa describing eloquently how it's a game about always coming home, both so movingly given to us by the Ken Burns documentary on baseball, strike a chord with us and are reasons we're so bound up with the game.I think one of the problems with Alva Noe's book, which also references Ken Burns, is that it's a cold, flinty look at the game. We love books in love with baseball which tell us why we're in love with it, that explain how baseball adds value to our lives. We like to be reminded what the game means to us because it means a lot. Noe, a philosopher, writes about what the game means philosophically. So he describes baseball as a forensic sport bound by laws. He describes baseball as a game which forces us to assign praise and blame for every action. He tells us baseball is about responsibility. Did that batter earn the hit or was a fielder's quick decision involved somehow? Are a pitcher's unearned runs truly unearned? He considers baseball infinite in that it's more a ""domain"" of life than a game, ""a field of thought."" Every component of baseball is necessary to it, even the umpires considered as players in the game's tableau, though they enforce the forensic laws rather than becoming part of the game's narrative. Noe discusses the nature of language by relating baseball to it. When he writes about religion he writes about Little League. Time after time he tries to illustrate what he's writing with examples of his personal and lifelong experiences with baseball (he's a Mets fan), but it seems a forced love.The book is oddly bifurcated. There's a long ""Preface"" in which he lays out his ideas on baseball's narrative constructed around praise and blame, the usefulnesses of scoring games, and the judgment of umpires not always agreeing with the batter's box and why. This ""Preface"" contains intelligent, even wise, perceptions of baseball elegantly presented. The body of the book falls sharply in quality. It's 32 brief essays expressing his opinions on such topics as the value of instant replays and why Tommy John surgery should be looked at the same way as steroid use. Noe writes as a philosopher but tries to tie in his love for the game. However,part of his book addresses the charge against baseball as boring. He writes, probably correctly, that those who're bored by it don't really appreciate the busy swarm of thinking and maneuvering going on in the game they're watching. And yet he's given us a baseball book in which there isn't enough baseball on the page to hold our attention.Writing good s here at Goodreads can be challenging sometimes. Writing bad s not so much--dissing is easy. Some books make it easier than others.Sometimes we have a nagging feeling something is wonky.

But I'm not proud enough to think I can say something here about it that'll be intelligently original or originally intelligent. That's all been said before. I'm happy to have appreciated it and to have perhaps found some of the power in it Lawrence intended.Like every young male reader I dove into Lady Chatterley's Lover at a tender age. In my case that coincided with the U. S. Supreme Court's overturning of the obscenity ban preventing the novel's publication and sale. I was in high school and loved it, almost certainly more for its open eroticism than its prose. And over the years enjoyed the several film adaptations made from the story of Constance and Mellors. Over those years I was unaware that Lawrence had written 3 versions of the novel. I found on a shelf here the 2d of those versions, published as John Thomas and Lady Jane by Viking in 1972. A dozen years or so ago when I read it I found that Mellors and Constance loved each other as much and as well as in my original read, but I was most impressed with the gorgeous prose.At first I was disappointed The Rainbow isn't composed in prose as fine. The 3-generation saga of the Brangwens, published 13 years before Lady Chatterley's Lover, is driven by a more fevered writing that sees everything amplified to a higher level of enthusiasm, even rapture in a couple of key scenes. Tom Brangwen's relation to nature is described this way. And Ursula, his granddaughter, is a figure of reverence to some. This is meant as praise. The power of Lawrence's writing grows on a reader the deeper you get into the novel. I began to understand that seeing the characters through Lawrence's luminescent prose is exactly the way they need to be seen to take their rightful place in the novel's landscape and scope. The longer I read the more at home I felt with it. If, at the end, I'd not found the fulfillment the rainbow probably indicates, I was at least more than satisfied....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 27, 2020","Aug 16, 2020","Jul 14, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10358216-the-rainbow

I've read only a few Dickens novels but can recognize in Tartt's character Theo Decker an affinity to David Copperfield and Pip of Great Expectations. There's the abruptly broken family followed by long years of growth toward maturity and ultimate success against long odds.

The details never tire the reader. They become this brilliant fact or that glinting glimpse forming a perception you didn't know you needed but are happy to have. Eventually, every piece of the novel, all the pools of dialogue and set-piece descriptions, fit perfectly into place. In only one section does the novel grind laboriously as if it could've used some lubrication, a despairing moment of psychological introspection near the end when the long wave of consequences set off in the novel's beginning wash around Theo.

Instead of a more conventional narrative focusing on the growth and perhaps moral reckoning of a protagonist, the novel seemed more a loose assemblage of events from the Thirty Years War, 1618 to 1648. True, the novel begins with the boy Tyll and ends in his maturity. But he makes only episodic appearances during the course of the novel, making me think it more about the war and its actual historical figures than about Tyll. It's a novel needing a better reader than I proved to be because I know so little about that war which began as a religious conflict between Protestant and Catholic states within the Holy Roman Empire and eventually evolved into questions about who'd hold the primary power in Europe. It ended in the Peace of Westphalia which organized the principles governing borders and national sovereignty still extant today. In fact, some of the hype surrounding the novel is that in writing about the chaos of the Holy Roman Em;ire, Kehlmann is reflecting our own times, specifically the 1st half of the 20th century.Through the smoky, torn landscapes and social fabric of the early 17th century moves Tyll and his companion Nele. At first they're part of a traveling circus in which Tyll perfects his skills of tightrope-walking and juggling, talents he performs at crucial moments in the novel. The real Tyll Ulenspiegel is a figure of German folklore celebrated in stories dating from the early 14th century. So it seems Kehlmann, wanting to conflate the birth of modern Europe with the restoration of European order in the mid-20th, has pushed Tyll's legend about 300 years in our direction, which is okay in a novel filled with fabulist elements. In a passage I thought key, Kehlmann has Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia muse that time never really passes. ""Nothing passed. Everything was. Everything remained. And even if things changed, it always happened in the one, same, never-changing now."" In a novel sprinkled with magical realism, Tyll is a trickster or shapeshifter and fits the role of those who illustrate events. I believe he acts as a kind of catalyst for the history of the period. Events may be caused by him much as young Oskar Matzerath of Gunter Grass's novel The Tin Drum causes things to happen in the Danzig of WWII by beating on his drum. At pivotal moments of the novel Tyll baffles those about him by picking up and juggling whatever's at hand. The circles around his head of balls, knives, and stray bits of whatever else is at hand may indicate the courses of influence and compromise making up history, the wheels of cause and effect. And just as little Oskar refused to grow up, it's implied that Tyll refuses to die. Who knows, maybe he's still active in today's Germany, keeping the balls aloft for Angela Merkel....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 28, 2020","Jan 18, 2021","Jul 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45990558-tyll

Either it's too thin as fiction to meet my need for complex narratives and characters or else I wasn't generous enough to accept its qualities. . Perhaps the blame isn't that important. Many faults of novel and reader play a part. I'm actually attracted to this kind of novel in which structure and narrative are driven by common events or motifs. I love the implied universality the structure brings.. Eva Figes's novel Waking follows the life of a woman waking at different times and situations from childhood to old age. Wrinkles by Charles Simmons traces the life of a man 44 times through topical words common to all lives, like movies, religion, sleep, doctors, mathematics. In the Language of Love by Diane Schoemperlen follows the progress of a woman's life through chapters devoted to the 100 stimulus words of the Standard Word Association Test.When I first learned of Forty Rooms I placed it in this category of incremented universality. The structure through which we read Mrs Caldwell's story is the 40 rooms she lives in during her lifetime. The scheme is partially explained late in the novel when her mother talks about the significance of the number 40: ""Forty is God's number for testing the human spirit. It's the limit of man's endurance, beyond which you are supposed to learn something."" And we remember the 40 days of rain Noah experienced and the 40 days Christ spent in the Wilderness. A little later Mrs Caldwell--the only name we're given for her--wishes only to complete her own trial of living in the 40 rooms said to be those the average person inhabits in a lifetime. And she herself remembers that a prophet said the human soul has 40 rooms.All that's appealing up to a point, but for me the novel has problems. For one thing Mrs Caldwell is subject to something like dream states or mental fugues where she's visited by people who seem to serve as mentors. Not surprising in the young girl, but Mrs Caldwell never outgrows them. Her grandmother sits on the handlebars of her exercise bike and talks to her. Mirrors are important because in them Mrs Caldwell is prone to seeing someone other than herself. Grushin tries to describe this as a layer of life lying near us but just out of reach, another layer of existence that's not quite magic, and she tries this in a variety of ways and a variety of understatedness. But it always intrudes. It was an element I didn't care for.Another dislike is that each story (room) finds a way to specify her age. I think Grushin intended something classical, too. Many rooms reference a classical deity. Apollo's arrow kills a friend, she receives ornaments for the temple of Hera as a wedding gift. Such calculated notation of age, such careful mention of divinities, lurking nearby and observing, causes the novel to lurch along mechanically. Instead of rolling easily from room to room, a sleek Corvette on wheels you never notice, it lumbers tank-like on treads you can't not watch. I think the lack of subtleties makes it inelegant.Another problem is that the rooms serve no individual functions in the narrative, which, to me, makes the structure a moot point. But the greatest fault is mine. I never warmed up to Mrs Caldwell enough to care about her. I never found her interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 06, 2020","Oct 13, 2020","Jul 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25716695-forty-rooms

Yes, I finally decided; it's an essay which flows thematically along its course the whole length. But along the way it pools and eddies, backs up on itself into swirls of ideas and digressions.The subject of this flow is modern European culture we recognize in the novel and symphonic music. Kundera conveniently teams them together as the novel form. His concern is whether we owe more allegiance to the artist or to his body of work. Betrayal, as I read Kundera, can fall on both sides of the fence. He begins with Salman Rushdie and The Satanic Verses, a novel he says is decidedly European in style and focus. One of the problems with the famous fatwa placed on Rushdie by Middle Eastern religious Diktat was that the whole dustup showed the west unable to defend its culture from unreasonable ideas. This is the opening salvo of Kundera's criticism that we're betraying our cultural aesthetic. Failures such as this, failures to support artistic work, can take many forms. His essay leaves Rushdie to discuss several other composers and novelists whose work has been amended or otherwise abused by critics and performers. So we learn that the great Jeffrey Meyers biography of Hemingway (the only non-European subject, if I remember correctly) caused the entire body of novels and stories to be erroneously viewed as roman a clef. We learn that the conductor Seiji Ozawa deflated a Mahler symphony by including a movement the composer has decided was inferior and had earlier deleted. We're convinced that Nietzsche and Beethoven can be paired together as novelists. More blurring occurs when we're faced with deciding when the novel becomes philosophy (Sartre) and philosophy becomes the novel (Nietzsche). And we learn that on the gradual shift from culture to journalism (an observation even more surprising when you remember the book was published in 1993), as Kundera seems to see cultural development in the 20th century, many masterworks like those of Hermann Broch and Robert Musil have been pushed to the margins of distinction by the aesthetic shift, which is another betrayal. Along the course of the essay's flow the discussion slows and pools around such subjects as Stravinsky, Leos Janacek, Thomas Mann, and Tolstoy. We leave them and return to them again and again.The great ocean this streaming essays flows into is Kafka. His betrayal may be the most famous in literature, that of Max Brod's ignoring his written instructions--testaments--that his manuscripts be destroyed. The tributaries of Tolstoy, Broch, Musil, Mann, Nietzsche, Stravinsky and Janacek and all the rest have been headed here. Kundera interestingly writes that Kafka's wishes were motivated by shame that his private biographical influences would be laid bare--another of Kundera's themes--more than by an evaluation of the works themselves. After all, when Kafka died he was still unknown and unpublished and without literary stature. Just as interestingly Kundera admits he would have acted as Brod did, would have betrayed Kafka's testaments....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 03, 2021","Mar 13, 2021","Jul 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44382.Testaments_Betrayed

What we do know comes to us from the accounts of Plutarch and Cassius Dio who wrote a couple of hundred years after her death and whose accounts were already blurred by legend and misinformation. Egypt herself produced no historians of their caliber to leave a record. Understandably, Schiff tells Cleopatra's story mostly through a Roman history of the years during which she lived, about 69 to 30 BCE. It was the peak time of Roman hegemony in the Mediterranean; Roman energy radiated everywhere. They were busy years, as we know: Julius Caesar's seizure and control of Roman politics, his assassination and the resulting civil war, Cleopatra's romantic and political alliance with Mark Antony, their war with Octavian resulting in their deaths and the eventual end of the Roman republic. Schiff can only relate the broad strokes of it all as told by Roman historians, garnishing here and there with sprigs of Shakespeare, Shaw, and Hollywood in the lovely vessel of Elizabeth Taylor.Still, there's lots to the story. If Schiff's unable to focus clearly on Cleopatra as woman, her portrait of sovereign, world class politician, and religious figure is more complete and thoroughly interesting. From her stealing into her own palace concealed in a rug to meet Caesar (maybe) to her death by asp bite (maybe), the biography tries to cover it all. When Schiff can blow away the fog of legend to show events as likelihoods, she does so. That she's able to do it frequently, to provide us such rich history, I think is impressive. My biggest quibble with the book is that she doesn't take time to chronicle how alien and unfamiliar the Egyptian and Roman worlds of 2000 years ago would be to us. I think she failed to capture a culture and a level of superstition and violence that would have discomfited us.

Brian Boyd here explains the sources and function of story by using evolutionary thinking. In doing so he discusses how culture in general and art in particular had origins in the human need to develop a self-awareness giving us advantages over other species. By using our ability to focus attention and to learn from pattern we've developed variety and option and creativity. Art produces variation from which flows option and new ways of thinking. Human purpose drives the creativity.Art and story, Boyd says, emerge from play as children develop social skills. We learn how to direct attention toward innovation in understanding and representing events, real and invented. We've developed fiction to give the artistic design of stories we tell some social function. Fiction allows us a myriad of ways to process social information. The end product of this process, the ability to create and narrate stories,Boyd calls evocriticism. The thinking of humans, so superior to animal thought, has ""decreed the world of human life to be entirely shaped by culture and convention and therefore distinct from the rest of reality."" Our greater sociability, information analysis, and thinking capacity added to our having evolved language has made it possible for us to develop far in advance of animals, and from Beowulf to Gravity's Rainbow.The examples he uses to illustrate all this is Homer's Odyssey and the Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who! About half the book is used for deep discussions of those 2 works and how they reflect the ideas he explains in the 1st 200 pages or so. Late in the book he tells us he'd originally intended to include Hamlet, Twelfth Night, Pride and Prejudice, Ulysses, and Maus in his analytical illustrations. I personally would've preferred one of these to Horton, but it's not surprising he was reined in by the limitations of space. Considering that his examinations of the Odyssey and Horton Hears a Who! cover 171 pages, adding another 4 or 5 books to his study would've made it enormous. As it is, it's a hefty, dense read, and I'm sure I didn't grasp all of it.

We're not always appreciative, though, of the challenging hardships of fronOur fascination with the stories of the American West has been a long one. We're not always appreciative, though, of the challenging hardships of frontier life. Inland is a realist western in which the extremes of environment and landscape play a significant part. I remember a Simon Schama TV documentary series about America in which he implied the nation would ultimately fail because there isn't enough water in the west to sustain it. In many ways Tea Obreht's novel is about the west's dependence on water, or the lack of it.Into this vast and dry myth-filled landscape plods the camel whose most prominent trait, aside from its absurd appearance in a country our imaginations have filled with cattle and Indians, is their ability to travel long distances and endure long periods of time without needing water. You'd think camels are a natural fit for the desert West of America. And, in fact, there was an Army experiment begun in 1856 to test the feasibility of using camels in the southwest as pack animals. They proved to be well-suited to the environment and to the work yet weren't, finally, embraced by the military as a practical means of transport. The circumstances of the Civil War undercut studies of their use, apparently. But camels were a fact of the historical West. And one of the original camel drivers, an Ottoman named Hi Jolly, is an Obreht character.She's more successful in incorporating the camel into her novel of the West than the Army was in using it as a means of hauling cargo. She employs them to not only transport water and salt and ore but to also carry the heavy load of irony present in this novel laid along 2 tracks. The 1st is that of a single dry day in the life of Nora Lark who lives in Amargo, Arizona in 1893. Her day is one of those memorable in fiction in which characters will later realize defines their lives because the day was the life. Nora's ""a tough, opinionated, rangy, sweating mule of a thing"" having to deal with a season of severe drought on her hardscrabble ranch while also holding together a family coming apart under the strain of a mysteriously missing husband and business competition in Amargo. The other track spans many years and follows the career of the wanted outlaw Lurie Mattie who hides in the Camel Corps where he befriends Hi Jolly. As you expect, Obreht integrates her 2 stories by bringing them together in a kind of southwestern crescendo. Another item of freight added to the camel's load is symbolism.I like this novel, I do. I'm one of the many Americans who have the occasional yen to reconnect with the great national mythos of the West. When I learned of Inland I knew I'd like it; it provides the reconnection while offering unique and literary perspectives. I found it more difficult than I expected, though. Not the difficulties of knotty ideas or metaphors but those brought about sometimes by elements of the story being obscured. Obreht isn't always clear. It's not made easier, either, by the character Lurie Mattie's voice being addressed to a camel. My paperback edition is splattered with rave blurbs praising Obreht's ""thrillingly rendered"" landscapes ""more convincingly Cormac McCarthy than McCarthy himself."" I didn't see that. For a western, I think, she doesn't write descriptively about the land or the settings so the thrust of her narrative is carried through dialogue. And characters being coy with each other are also being coy with the reader. But in a novel in which absence is important--the absent husband, empty country roamed by the living and the dead--perhaps it's intentional and works better than I think. A young woman named Josie who Nora's hired as help around the ranch can see into the absences better than most. She says, ""What we see with our hearts is often far truer than what we see with our eyes."" Having only just finished, I think I'm not done with this novel.In the end, the novel's totally satisfying. Obreht's unusual vision of the West is one not brought into focus before, I think. And that, in a novel where there's little water, is refreshing. To be honest, I'd never given Tea Obreht 2 thoughts until she wrote a western giving me a different ways of seeing.

One of the most interesting sections is his interpretation of what is actually meant by grass. He explains grass identifies with the dummy pages of random words set by printers--recall that Whitman was a printer--to check how well-designed and centered a page was. It's ""grass as hieroglyphics."" Words come out of a printer's (or writer's) unconscious to form a reality and then fall away.

For years, though, I've been in the habit of reading only the 1855 edition because a critic and poet I admire suggested Whitman's later editions weakened the book as a whole. Doty comprehensively glosses such later, iconic poems as ""Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"" ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,"" and ""The Sleepers"" with insight convincing me that the next time I feel the need to read Leaves of Grass I should read the later editions, too.A surprise for me was Whitman's acquaintance with Bram Stoker, author of Dracula. Stoker visited Whitman in America several times, and Doty's theory is that the character of the Count is modeled on his perspectives of Whitman.That man, Whitman as homosexual, clearly means a lot to Doty's own identification--even pride-- and lifelong practice as a gay man. Of course, he's now a 67-year old living in an age when same-sex relationships are accepted.

I thought the most difficult parts of the book were the opening chapters dealing with the hard-to-grasp intricacies of entropy, gravity, and thermodynamics. Once past this primer of Big Bang creation, the reading is smoother. In his middle chapters he writes about evolution, consciousness, and creativity. In these chapters he describes how the same particles that make up all matter form into the patterns we call thought and that we use in storytelling, myth, and art to bring meaning to a meaningless universe. In this section on consciousness is a revelatory discussion of free will I think one of the most interesting things I've read in a while. And it's also near the middle that I admired how agilely he straddles the gulf between religion and science, accepting and believing. The final chapters deal with projected ideas about the gradual loss of energy across the deep time of the future. His useful analogy for time is the Empire State Building where each floor represents an immense span of time. By this reckoning we're currently somewhere between the 6th and 7th floors. By the time Greene's writing about the dissipation of all energy and the death of black holes we're at the 86th floor observation deck in a year represented by a one followed by 86 zeroes. By the time we get to the 102d floor only a few scattered particles of matter will remain.In some respects this is a book about death. And sobering in its demonstration that everything dies, runs down. The thermodynamic force of entropy is universal. Mankind is a unique life form having an awareness of this. Our lives are lived in relation to knowledge of our end, all art and philosophy springs from our need to assign meaning to a barren, purposeless universe.

He may have been the best writer some of us have never read. He's famous for a couple of novels, but I suspect that, Nelson Algren was a good writer. He may have been the best writer some of us have never read. He's famous for a couple of novels, but I suspect that, like Jack Kerouac, his best writing is seldom read today. And also like Kerouac he preferred to write about the marginal regions of our cities and streets and roads filled with characters blasted by hard experience. Algren and Kerouac stayed in the shadows with the characters they loved so much rather than surfacing in the literary mainstream. And often, market be damned, they just wrote what they wanted to.""Yet once you've come to be part of this particular patch, you'll never love another. Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real."" Algren wrote that about Chicago, which was his particular patch and his great subject. He once told Simone de Beauvoir his job was to write about Chicago. And the city he knew was that of gritty streets, furnished rooms, small and smoky taverns, and poker games. Knowing his subject, he remained less concerned with the academic elements of the craft--structure, style, and symbolism--than with what he thought of as ""the things of the earth."" He was the ""bard of the stumblebum,"" those he set to walking the streets of his beloved Chicago.I read this to coincide with a simultaneous reading of Deirdre Bair's biography of de Beauvoir. I was familiar with the Algren-de Beauvoir letters and earlier biographies but was still intrigued by Bair's statement that Algren had been the love of her life. I wanted to read more of the affair between this man of Chicago's streets and shadows and the cool French existentialist. Algren's love for Simone was as white hot as hers for him I learned in Asher's well-researched telling. Its winding-down when he wouldn't leave Chicago and she wouldn't leave Sartre and the existential scene could be foretold.There's more to Algren's story than de Beauvoir, though. She may have been a classier dame than Algren usually gravitated toward, but if his wanting to marry her didn't work out, there were many loves and a couple of other marriages, good and bad, regrettable and sad. Before the women, though, before he began to write, he wandered the midwest looking for work. In Chicago he became involved in the Communist Party. This returned to haunt him for decades; he was a subject of FBI interest his whole life. He served in Europe during the war. Trying to provide for his 2d marriage he even tried his hand at teaching a couple of times. Algren believed that writing programs are a hustle and that all anyone needed to successfully write for commercial markets was to accumulate life experiences and draw on them. This section makes for some funny reading as Asher describes how a man who believed writing couldn't be taught tried to juggle those beliefs with the responsibilities of teaching at the Iowa Writer's Workshop. And always there was the writing. He never stopped writing.In the end, as Asher tells it, the story is sad. Alone as he reached old age he was drawn away from Chicago to live in Paterson, NJ and Sag Harbor, Long Island. By then the power of his prose had declined considerably and he was writing mostly journalism, unable to find in the 1970s the affirmations so evident to him in the 1940s. But he was happy being more writer than author....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 06, 2020","Aug 27, 2020","May 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45894072-never-a-lovely-so-real

But I was slow coming to it, thinking it a low priority in what to read. But dutifully, inevitably, as books submerged in my tbr lists do, The Parisian bobbed to the surface, and I began to read.I found it to be a delicious meal of a novel. There's a lot in it--story and style--to chew on. Isabella Hammad weaves her primary themes--love, Arab nationalism, and Palestinian politics, even the politics of love since this is a novel reflecting Arab society--into a powerful imagining of a man's moral awakening. The story the novel tells is well known by now. The young Midhat Kamal of Nablus, in Palestine, travels to France at the beginning of WWI to study medicine. While the war rages on the Belgian frontier Midhat embraces European ways of life and attitudes. When he returns to Nablus at the end of the war, Arab society and politics are in upheaval following the defeat of the Ottomans and the rush of colonial Britain and France into the vacuum they've left. He doesn't fit easily back into his community because his affinity for European attitudes causes him to be viewed as an other. These were the years of Arab discontent generated by the Sykes-Picot Agreement, increased Jewish immigration and Zionist activity, and the strict British mandate over the region. The Parisian becomes a novel about a man trying to straddle the 2 societies of his emotional state while caught in the middle of the struggle between colonial powers and traditional societies for the right to govern the physical state.As a 1st novel it's impressive. It's a love story interwoven with historical novel, and Hammad skillfully keeps the many balls of history and love in the air. She does so while expressing mood and emotion with an elegance approaching that of Ishiguro or Nabokov. She's a good stylist. She writes of big events and big emotions with confidence. Her handling of the characters' lives in her care is affectionate and assured. One of her strengths is the ability to enter scenes, even major plot developments from odd, surprising angles. It's a pleasure to read rich prose unspooling a narrative at such a slant that ambiguity becomes exactly what you thought all along. This is part of the fuel allowing her to bring the unfamiliar world of Palestinian society to life and to people it with characters who're interestingly complex and yet so easily understood because they're so naturally human.One quibble. The many Arab names and family designations are hard to keep straight, even with the convenient character list provided. I never stopped having to refer to the list to correctly locate a character in Midhat's wide web of relationships. Near the end I'd mostly given up the list except for scenes which seemed crucial. Some characters, of course, stand out and need no referral. And almost all, as I've tried to suggest, shine in the light of Hammad's love for them. Especially my favorite, Fatima. Fatima is a force of nature, gentle yet potentially stormy. Whether blowing gale or zephyr, we all need someone like her to lean into.This isn't the best novel I've read this year, but it's among my most pleasurable reads....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 08, 2020","Dec 06, 2020","May 06, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50756352-the-parisian

The setting is the Camargue region where the river flows into the Mediterranean. It's a wetlands area covering the Rhone delta. Some of it is cultivated but large tracts of it are wild and largely uninhabited except for birds and marsh grasses and wind.It's to this section of the Rhone that our protagonist, Martial, travels to begin the novel. He's inherited an island in the river from an uncle recently deceased. The terms of his inheritance are that he must take up residence in the isolated house on the wild island for 3 months. During his vigilant and meditative stay there he's assisted at first only by a shepherd/servant. But he soon learns he has an adversary in Dromiols, the notary who's represented the family and the deceased uncle for years. Dromiols would like to see Martial fail so the island can be claimed by historical rivals of the family.That good versus bad faceoff almost reminiscent of an American western (the rival family, the Rambards, are cowherds in opposition to the sheepherding Malicroix) is only the framework for what struck me as a kind of immersion into the classical world. It's as if something is barely hidden, waiting to be revealed. It has a pastoral feel to it, for one thing. Martial becomes deeply involved with the nature of island and river. We later learn he developed this interest from his family who're so attentive to the seasons and plant and animal life that Bosco's prose almost indicates they're necessary to it, responsible for nature's orderly progression. When we finally meet Martial's network of aunts, uncles, and cousins we're struck by how divine-like Bosco has structured their characters in the family seat high on a hill. Especially on the river, it's easy to see characters and this work as representing more than their appearance. Dromiols, for instance, may be seen as more than a notary. And Anne Madeleine, the young woman who comes to help Martial, may be more than a pretty face. And there's a ferryman, too, suggesting the Rhone may stand for a river in another, nether region.This thinking may be sound. It may not be. I began the book expecting to find these kinds of elements (we need a good dose of heroic myth to inspire us these days). I think the novel contains enough allusive material in its flow that I couldn't help but notice. One doesn't have to use or interpret the material seen. But I don't think the allusions are there by accident. Bosco himself says:  ""...I had crossed the water of an imaginary river, one night, outside of time, mingling my  everyday life with the figures of a half dream. What I had done, I must have done; what  I had seen, I must have seen--but by way of inexplicable states of soul, in that nether land  between the worlds."" This, one of the keys to the novel, illustrates the kind of novel it is. Still, I don't think my understanding is complete. I like that because I have a reason to dive into this interesting novel again....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 25, 2020","Jul 11, 2020","Apr 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51008403-malicroix

The Second World Wars may be his most ambitious. He writes a deep, thorough analysis oVictor Davis Hanson has written many books of military history. The Second World Wars may be his most ambitious. He writes a deep, thorough analysis of WWII without describing the military operations themselves. It's not a narrative but is, instead, an honest, open-eyed appraisal of how military operations during the war were conducted. It analyzes what men and machines, plans and objectives achieved as opposed to what was expected. As the title promises, Hanson brings his many years of study, especially that rooted in organized warfare's ancient beginnings, to bear on a weighty examination of how the war was fought and why what happened happened.He considers all the components of the war, the men and machines and how they were used and with what effectiveness. The war saw the 1st extensive use of airpower, expanded beyond its role in supporting ground operations to include destroying enemy materiel and his ability to produce more. The war was marked by the huge navies involved and by many amphibious invasions. They were both critical strengths in the Allied victory. The infantries of every major participant is appraised along with their weaponry. Finally he looks at the leadership of the major belligerents, political and military. This may be the book's most interesting section. The last part, ""Ends,"" tries to sum up exactly what resulted longterm from the war and why. Because it lacks real, fresh insight, I think this may be the weakest part of the book. The Allies won by being superior in all aspects of modern warfare, by being able to produce vast numbers of ships and planes with men more superiorly-trained to man them. They won by vastly outnumbering the Axis ground forces and by supporting the Allied units with the equipment needed to overwhelm them. Mobility was a key element, the ability to move substantial military forces and the necessary logistical support where they were needed. A major reason for the success of all this, of course, was America's production capacity which met most Allied equipment needs: weapons, ships, planes, aviation fuel, and all the goods to support the men using them.Hanson uses analogy and example to bring perspective to the war's events. Most are from the time of classical Greece, as when he discusses the qualities of leadership and statesmanship during the period 1939-45 compared to the Greeks of the Peloponnesian War, 431-404 BC, or when he points out the German hubristic tragedy at Stalingrad resembles the Athenian campaign in Sicily in 415-413. Hanson's knowledge and scope of research, as always, is impressive. I've enjoyed reading several of his books but found this to be a bit tedious, too often giving way to the litanies of numbers available to him: types of planes, production statistics, the immense tallies of the dead, the steady repetition of the fact the Russian T-34 was the war's most dependable tank....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 16, 2020","Jan 23, 2021","Apr 15, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41717498-the-second-world-wars

And so I imagined Tracy Daugherty researching Didion at a distance because she chose not to cooperate in his project. The story of her life is here, nevertheless, all the moments of the life pointed out minus some of the detail a cooperating subject would provide, though there's still much to chew on.. The result is a narrative of the life which serves as a comprehensive portrait.I admire Didion's writing. Earlier in the year I'd read or reread all her nonfiction, appreciating again her sharp observations of American culture and politics. I didn't know much about her, though, except she'd lost her writer husband John Gregory Dunne and her daughter, the exotically-named Quintana Roo, and her last books have been about the nature of grief. Daugherty connects the dots of her story and shows her life to be fascinatingly rich. Some of what I didn't know surprised me. I hadn't known, for instance, how deeply embedded in the movie industry she and Dunne were, nor how closely they collaborated on some writing assignments. Daugherty fleshes out the bio with many interesting facets of their life together in the LA/Hollywood society of 30+ years ago. They socialized with many celebrities familiar to us all, and Daugherty is willing to tell many of their stories relevant to Didion. He's a good writer perceptive of and easily able to capture the cultural climate of California. His book is full of digressions that emerge from her life story, including that of the Dunne family, as well as the recurring refrain of Didion's pioneer heritage, children's graves left along the wagon trail, hardened women settling west of the Sierras. In this way he reflects her ambition of making the story of California the story of America. As we know, she and Dunne relocated to New York City late in their careers. Her beginnings as a New York magazine writer and her present residence in the city frame the core of who she is and what she writes about best, the west.I think Daugherty has done a good job. Despite the limitations posed by Didion's non-cooperation, he's put together a thoroughly engaging portrait of her. We can forgive the binocular vision forcing him into surmise and rumor and into digressions about events that helped shape her career--hippies, Manson, Patty Hearst, Salvador, the Cuban population of Miami--because he digresses so absorbingly that they become clearly germane to the Didion we know. There will be other--probably better--biographies of her, but for now this is the one we have. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 20, 2020","Nov 15, 2020","Mar 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23014575-the-last-love-song

Such novels as Dog Soldiers, A Flag for Sunrise, and Damascus Gate are demonstrations of that greatness. And perhaps Outerbridge Reach, my favorite. Certainly he was one of the most important novelists writing about the festering crease where morality and politics and personal faith converge. Madison Smartt Bell in this masterful biography of Stone tells us several times that he wrote novels of convergence, of characters who come from far-flung places and mindsets to converge in moral turmoil, searches for salvation, and even violence. And always he wrote principled judgments of American actions, whether they concerned civil rights, Palestine, Vietnam, or Central America. Bell interestingly says that in one way or another Stone was always writing about Vietnam, but his unease for our age stemmed from religion, too.Bell and Stone were close friends. The biography has a personal touch Bell allows into his portrait and is valuable for that. Biography approaches memoir when he writes about the 2 trips they took into the dark heart of Haiti where Stone researched his novel Bay of Souls. Biographies by authors close to their subject are often interesting in the ways they can shape the story. I enjoy seeing what directions will be taken and what truths will be told. In this case Bell has enormous admiration for Janice Stone, the wife and muse for 55 years. Her strength and beauty of spirit shine throughout. Bell leans heavily on her version of events and motivations, making this a little like a biography of a marriage.

Those early books are more tabloid accounts of the outrages and dysfunctions of the administration no more substantial than what we learned on the evening news. This book by Susan Hennessey and Benjamin Wittes is also about those dysfunctions. What makes it different is that instead of anecdote it relies on detailed analysis of behaviors displayed by Trump through which he's challenging the norms we've come to expect from those who hold the office. Each chapter deals with a particular Trumpian trait and how his deficiencies or corruptions are changing, whether temporarily or permanently, the fundamental and historical nature of the job. They begin with the oath he takes on 20 January. It only works when the president actually means it. The following chapters include those on Trump's style in foreign policy, his rhetoric, his corruption of the justice system, his war on truth, and his feelings of absolute right in conducting the affairs of office in the impetuous way he does. Additionally, a central chapter deals with his decision-making style de-emphasizing structured bureaucracy and information-sharing process in favor of a more personal methodology based on impulse and opinion, called expressive by Hennessey and Wittes. The preceding examples imply disapproval. But the book isn't a blanket condemnation of Trump's presidency. The authors also point out those ideas of the president they feel are correct. Most of the time, though, they find fault with procedures by which policy is enacted. Lastly, there is a ""Postscript"" added as the book was going to press. It concerns the scandal and impeachment resulting from Trump's interactions with the president of Ukraine in attempting to generate an investigation harmful to Joe Biden, a political rival. While we know the outcome of all that, Heennessey and Wittes didn't at the time of their writing. But they're able to discuss in detail how each of the previously-discussed behaviors were manifested in his dealings with Ukraine.The book's a history lesson, too. It's comprehensive in citing historical examples from the earlier 44 presidencies which help us look at Trump's administration in the context of policies and the country's history. In every comparison, even with bad presidents like Andrew Johnson and James Buchanan, Trump's actions are made to seem detrimental to the office and our system of government. The whole process is so much more smoothly run if the president is an honest man who understands governing and our government.While reading this I was struck by a sentence from a novel I was reading concurrently: ""The higher the ape climbs, the more he shows the filth of his arse.""

It's the same story told, in fact, between the covers of other books. So Brands offers little new information. His reinforcement of our intuitions and the previous expressions of concern for our geopolitical moment, all the doom-crying analysis, is much the same as the talking heads of CNN and other foreign policy experts, as if they're holding up the iconic placard, The End Is Near.Brands does explain the history and the current events of our grand strategy with clarity. He spends considerable time on how the U. S., after WWII, constructed an international order based on alliances and an open global economy fostering positive-sum relationships. The order was designed to sustain a global balance of power and multilateralism through active military alliances, troop deployments, and American leadership. The system has been enormously successful. It has produced a stable geopolitical environment free of major war, particularly in notoriously fratricidal Europe, while at the same time the entire framework has always favored the United States and its democratic allies.  If it's always been America first, it has also been America as benefactor. Despite some hiccups along the way--wars in Vietnam and Iraq--and some more current hurdles like serious fiscal restraints and challenges from an adventurous Russia and a quickly-developing China, the past 70 years have been remarkably stable and prosperous.Brands's study, of course, is the foreign policies of the Trump administration. The turn away from globalization has been sharp. Generally, Trump rejects cooperative efforts. He rejects the notion that our helping others is also helping America succeed. He sees international relations as a zero-sum enterprise and sees little value in multilateralism. As he's often said, he feels the world has taken advantage of the U. S. and intends a substantial withdrawal from trade agreements and alliances. America the benefactor has become America the victim. He hasn't seen, as Brands has, that our traditional international order has our national interests at heart. He does see a weakening and bending of public attitudes away from globalization which align with his own ideas, and he's taken advantage of it. America is retrenching.Brands notes that he isn't yet moving directly toward a Fortress America. He mentions that Trump hasn't begun building his promised wall along the Mexican border or withdrawing troops from Europe. But the book was published in 2018. As we know, the wall is under construction. And a couple of weeks ago the administration announced the withdrawal of 9500 soldiers from Germany. Stay tuned.To Brands and other geopolitical wonks like him the abrupt turn in grand strategy away from multilateralism is an unraveling of the securities provided by the old system of alliances and trade. America's brash new posture has alienated many. We're thought unreliable by many friends. Combining his searing analysis with recent history, especially regarding our reduction of hard power during the Obama years due to budgetary cuts, Brands tries to peer into the near future. His view is that if we continue on our current track, America will be alone. More, our world without an actively engaged America, always a tense neighborhood, will become a dangerous one. And yet for every area of concern he brings up, for every turn of the screw, he offers solutions, ways we can correct.This is a thoroughly interesting book. It's not like other books about Trump's administration which portray its toxicity in tell-all fashion. This is considered and professional analysis, more upsetting because Brands is a highly-respected student and commentator on modern geopolitics. He's a serious guy.

Arranged in 5 sections, they cover the effects on the mind, the literature that war inspires, how individual participants memorialize their experiences, how war structures societies, and how armies adjust to changing technologies. The subjects range from the phalanx warfare of ancient Greece to today's drones. Along the way we're given a new look at captivity narratives on the American frontier, a discussion of how Rome fought asymmetric wars in Germany and Judaea, how soccer is used to oppose Israel in Gaza, and the tattoo as memorial.

I thought it a remarkably good novel spun from a boy's observations of the end of WWII in East Prussia. Twelve year old Peter describes the war's last months as it flows past his house, generally east to west, the direction of refugees and German units in retreat. Peter's family is eventually forced to join those on the frozen highway where the events making up the novel's climax become details haunting Jonathan, the protagonist of Marrow and Bone.The energy of Marrow and Bone flows the other way, west to east. Jonathan is a West German journalist offered an assignment to write a piece covering a car rally on that same highway, now part of Poland. He'll join fellow West Germans Hansi Strohtmeyer, the renowned race-car driver, and the overly-fastidious Anita Winkelvoss, who's loosely the organizer of the jaunt. Marrow and Bone becomes a road novel as the West Germans drive with a mixture of open-eyed wonder and open contempt through communist Poland. The setup invites humor and Kempowski provides it. But there's a compelling darkness in the journey, too. Jonathan isn't Peter of All for Nothing yet shares some of his biography and emotions about the highway. He remembers his family fleeing the Soviets in 1945 and can't help dredging up harrowing feelings of loss and regret as they travel the other way in 1983. In fact, on p161 of 1992's Marrow and Bone is the phrase ""all for nothing"" to be the title of the 2006 novel and seems to be Kempowski's verdict of the war.

I think it quite accomplished, perhaps the best new fiction I've read in a while. I have to say I'm aware aware that such rhapsodic praise might be colored by the fact that I love baseball novels, which this is. The Cactus League, though, is a different kind of baseball novel. It's not so much about the drama of the game, of any one particular game, let alone one that casts life-defining moments and lessons on unguarded characters ready to absorb them. Some of the characters are indeed players. In fact, every field position is represented at some point. But most are people only around baseball in some way. Nemens peoples her stories with players' wives, agents, an organist, concession workers, groupies, and many more. Their lives center around a game they don't play as they run the bases of life's circumstances.The stories (yes, there are 9 of them) of The Cactus League follow the spring training practices and exhibition games of the Los Angeles Lions (yes, it's a fictitious team) in 2011 around Scottsdale, Arizona. The roster of the Lions is filled with players at every stage of their careers. As you'd expect, there are crusty veterans who make up the foundation of the club. There are youngsters with raw talent trying to make the regular squad. As one established star says, every player there has spent a life being the best everywhere they've played, and now they find themselves in a place where they're not. The players are surrounded by coaches and equipment men, women who love them and women who want to love them, and the men who make money off their careers. The most prominent player is the all-star leftfielder Jason Goodyear. I believe he's penciled into every story in one way or another, though only a couple are actually about him. Just as Goodyear is the star and key to the L. A. Lions success as a baseball team, he's also the vein of mineral, sometimes bright as gold, sometimes coal black, running through the stories.An element of the novel I like is that each chapter has a prologue which acts as both foreshadowing and as a glimpse back into Arizona's geologic and evolutionary past. Written in the point of view of an unnamed character I take to be a sportswriter, they treat us to views of this ancient seabed now scattered with shark teeth, or the 2011 landscape sprinkled with verdant baseball diamonds which was once stalked by dinosaurs before the mountains around Scottsdale were lifted. If the sportswriter views the modern inhabitants with a disillusioned eye, he sees their forerunners--Pime, Maricopa, Hohokam--as authentic and resilient. Primitive life on the edge has morphed into the game the novel's concerned with, but it's still a life on the edge.The stories are gritty. The characters don't belong on a box of Wheaties.

I've read several of the revelatory books about what's been called a ""tabloid presidency."" But I believe Poniewozik's Audience of One is the most interesting and one which breaks new ground. Other books I'd read offered little analysis. They mostly retold the administration's outrages and provided little examination behind what we'd intuited between the lines of CNN coverage. Poniewozik, though, doesn't spend time recapitulating the litany of Trump's offenses. He analyzes American television and he analyzes Trump to show us where and how they intersect. It's simultaneously a political analysis of our present moment and a critical analysis of the history of television.The premise is simple: Poniewizik explains that TV has shaped Trump's outlook on the world and his approach to everything he does. One can easily see TV's influence in the examples used to demonstrate this. The 1st part of the book is mostly about Trump's origins. The middle section is a history of television and the ways what we watch shapes taste and national character. The final section describes how Trump essentially mirrors the character of current TV. The history begins in the tranquil days when there were only 3 or 4 networks and the fare was family-oriented. We all loved Ed Sullivan and Lucille Ball just as we later loved Happy Days and The Beverly Hillbillies. These segued into edgier material bringing us antiheroes like Ralph Kramden in The Honeymooners and Archie Bunker in All in the Family, flawed characters who brought America's problems screaming into living rooms. A watershed time for TV was the advent of cable. This is the event which Poniewozik describes as the fracturing of America; it provided us dozen of different bubbles and niches to interest us and allowed for wider program diversity. HBO and everything after allowed themes the networks couldn't. The antihero went on steroids in such shows as The Sopranos and Breaking Bad by redefining who the protagonists of TV shows could be. Tony Soprano, Don Draper of Mad Men, and Walter White were all magnetic characters, powerful and aggressive. They were sometimes monsters, but they were winners, a quality Trump extols. Survivor, American Idol, and The Apprentice are examples of the next wave of television capturing our imaginations and interest, reality TV. Everyone knows that The Apprentice was the vehicle most responsible for making Trump a celebrity.To Poniewozik it's clear that in the past few decades the evolution of television has changed America in ways making someone like the obnoxious Donald Trump not only palatable but electable. How easily TV and Trump blended into American politics is scary. It's a thoroughly engaging story, how Trump the businessman begat Trump the brand (like oatmeal's Quaker or Aunt Jemima selling pancakes) who begat the reality TV star who begat the presidential candidate who ran as an antihero. Always a fan of TV and later immersed in it, he now manipulates it for his purposes and governs as he controlled the competition on The Apprentice. More, Poniewozik concludes that Trump has developed into a man who's always performing. He doesn't know any other way to interact in public and, since he lacks the necessary background, can't seriously engage in the business of the country other than as performance. So you can see the way in which the 2 tracks of Poniewozik's story come together today produces an alarming state of affairs. As I say, other books on Trump I've read can demonstrate his unfitness but none I've read has successfully shown how he came into our lives as the character he is....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 11, 2020","Mar 24, 2020","Feb 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43726540-audience-of-one

In this historical novel set in the 14th century it'sI thought it'd be interesting in this time of our modern pandemic to read a novel about another. In this historical novel set in the 14th century it's the bubonic plague or Black Death, called the pestilence or qualm by the novel's characters. It's a novel about a journey and as the characters approach the English Channel it looms over the horizon. The pest is rumor to them, but we readers know how real it was and know that as this small band moves east they'll meet it sweeping west like a weather front.The year is 1348. It's 2 years after the decisive battle at Crecy in France where the new English longbow shooting arrows with hardened steel points easily decimated the flower of French knighthood before the English King Edward moved to Calais where he allowed his army to be besieged. Calais is where our travelers are bound. They include a lady escaping an impending marriage of convenience, a young archer assigned to a company of longbowmen who'd fought at Crecy, and a clerical proctor carrying documents to the Papal authorities at Avignon. Many others come and go as they travel the road to the coast. Adventures come and go, too.It's also a romance, an important notion to the characters. Romance is a goal and a guide to their conduct. They're inspired to the heroic qualities in deed and emotion romance teaches them through music, literature and the social mores of the 14th century. And they believe it's intricately seamed with their Christian faith. This is all part of the culture Meek writes for us. It's an alien culture presented all-inclusively without any translation to ease the modern reader's comprehension of it, as noted in Hilary Mantel's cover blurb. We're tossed into the 14th century world, and we're on our own.An important element in this experience is the language. We're familiar with Elizabethan English. The dialogue is a couple of hundred years earlier and I suppose the syntax approaches Elizabethan. Many of the words, though, are unfamiliar. If Meek had provided a glossary, it would've been a big one, but without it one has to kind of learn how to read the novel as you go. It's difficult, learning how the strange words and usages carry the strange sensibilities of the characters. I can't be sure that in the time it took me to achieve a certain proficiency that I didn't miss or misunderstand some critical information. For example, I was slow to realize one female character is male, a role similar to some members of Plains Indians people where some males not desiring a warrior life functioned within their society as women. Meek's character is referred to as she throughout the novel in her society's acceptance of a role that's not in any way a confusion of gender as in a Shakespearian play.This is a sort of road novel that provides adventure, romance, the pageantry of a fair and joust, and humor as well as violence and superstition and death. I hoped it might turn into a novel of ideas. But Meek would've had to connect in some way the thinking of 14th century England to our philosophical and literary conventions 600 years later. The attempt to combine them might have diluted, even falsified, the authenticity of his reconstruction. What we have in common with them is a shared Christian morality. The moral weight of the novel is carried in the thoughts of Thomas the proctor who writes a kind of journal intended for acquaintances or family in Avignon. In this way the journey is both physical and moral. Traveling by foot and horse and cart, the band moves from peace toward war, from innocence toward carnality, from clear English air into a dark air of plague that's recently jumped the Channel. Through all this, Calais beckons like redemption.I enjoyed this. I'm looking forward to it again in a few years because, as I said, learning to read it takes time, and I found the early going confusing. A reread will be fun. That alone, just the wish to reread, says positive things about this interesting, imaginative novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 06, 2020","Apr 24, 2020","Jan 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49599326-to-calais-in-ordinary-time

The facts of the story that follows become more visible or more hidden as if viewed behind a flow of smoke. Characters have the same tendency to recede from view or become more visible. Nathaniel's sister Rachel is lost to view as his mother materializes out of the murk of clandestine activities. All of Nathaniel's coming of age and explication of memory covering many years, the arc of the novel, impressed me as taking place entirely at night or shrouded in fog.So, when I pressed the last few pieces into their proper places, the picture puzzle became complete.

The Peanuts Papers is a collection of critical and memoirist pieces explaining why you love it. The writers of these essays have a relationship with the strip that's steeped in a nostalgia that triggers our own. From it they've extracted a meaning of life presaged by the title. Most of them agree its meaning involves loneliness and unrequited love. Even failure. Some use the word existential to describe its overall essence. A few cite the example of haiku to describe its day-to-day enlightenment.Easily as important as the book's subject is the strong collection of writers represented. There are 29 essays here, 2 poems, and 2 comic strips in tribute. I especially liked Umberto Eco's piece on how the Peanuts characters demonstrate the whole range of the human condition. Another highlight is Ann Patchett's memories of Snoopy. She calls him a novelist, much more writer than dog, and says he taught her many lessons about writing. I was touched by how much Elsa Schappell identifies with Sally Brown. Sarah Boxer, a cartoonist herself, provides a darker picture of Snoopy.

I loved it.There's much more here: Maxine Hong Kingston, George Saunders, and the book's longest piece by Jonathan Franzen. But whether well-known writer or relatively obscure, they all agree on the cultural importance of Peanuts. Most consider the strip's golden age to be the mid-'50s to the mid-'60s. Many agree that Snoopy is the irrepressible heart of it, yet some comment that his ultimate dominance of the strip overrode the interactions with the kids so that ""the air just went out of the strip.""

So Dreams of El Dorado is the story of the American west rather than its history. All the iconic events are here, framed by 2 presidents: Thomas Jefferson who sprung the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the newly-acquired Louisiana Purchase, and Theodore Roosevelt, the 1st modern president to see the west's potential for both industrial and recreational development. We're familiar with the events recounted here: the story of The Alamo, the story of the wagon trains, of the gold rush, of cattle drives and the building of the transcontinental railroad, much more. The stories are told using firsthand accounts and language. It's an acceptable way of doing history, but in my opinion using only firsthand accounts roots the stories in a narrative layer where facts may have been misunderstood or even missed, therefore inadvertently obscuring key elements and ultimately meaning Brands doesn't tell the story well. My best example of this weakness is the Custer massacre at the Little Big Horn. We know quite a bit about the events of that June day considering most of the story has come down to us through Indian oral traditions. Brands lets the legendary Black Elk tell the Little Big Horn. Black Elk was there, 13-years old, but his telling amounts to a vague sketch of the fight viewed through his own terrified actions. Brands is satisfied with this version of the Custer fight, but I think it illustrates his difficulties in telling the story of the west completely and accurately in this way, and it makes a reader question the accuracy of other stories. The overarching narrative in its entirety, a century of history in that immense landscape crisscrossed by a diversity of peoples and motives, is far too big to be told in a single volume of 481 pages, anyway.

Halfway through the earlier novel reference is made to the heroes of the Iliad being discomfited by the silence of the girls--Briseis and others--they're arguing over. Barker apparently had the theme in mind in 2007 when she had Elinor Brooke, the woman at the heart of Life Class, make reference to the silence of the girls. Elinor is a young Slade School of Art student at the outbreak of the Great War. The men of the novel have competed for her before they go to the fighting. They return damaged in body and spirit. Elinor, saddened at the end, engages in a dialogue Briseis might have had on the shore near Troy. Asked if she thinks we choose the people we love, she shakes her head. Further, she doubts that men can love women.I wasn't that impressed with Life Class, but my experience with The Regeneration Trilogy leads me to believe Barker's going to build power in the 2d and 3d novels of Life Class. Also, I liked what might be the Briseis theme in Life Class. While there are no guarantees this is an underlying idea of Barker's, I'm looking forward to seeing what she's going to do with her material....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 03, 2020","Jan 16, 2020","Jan 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1342650.Life_Class

He first flew into Siberia's Far East from Alaska. Later he took a road trip from Moscow to the Pacific. Wanting to experience Siberia during the winter a few years later he flew into Vladivostok intending to drive in the opposite direction during winter but farther north in order to see parts of the old gulag system. And around Christmastime in 2009 he flew into Novosibirsk for a short visit because he wasn't sure he'd traveled Siberia enough and he felt he should go ""if only just to breathe the air."" He went back to answer the tug. His descriptions of his trips and the people he meets make for absorbing reading. It's made even better by his feeling obligated to explain to the reader many major moments of Siberian history. The two trips into the teeth of the Siberian winter were arduous and as strange as I'd imagined. He was successful in finding some of the old gulag camps and, despite the reluctance of his guides, did spend some time poking around in them, more unsettled by the visits than he'd expected. Though he doesn't complain much, the rigors of travels through what he calls an ""incomplete grandiosity"", from the intense swarms of mosquitos prevalent everywhere to the uncertainty about some foods to the frequent breakdowns and jury-rigging of the van as they travel through a sparsely-inhabited landscape, were a trial for him but a delight for readers....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 02, 2020","Feb 02, 2020","Jan 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7966160-travels-in-siberia

A girl who boards out to attend a high school near Bordeaux is bicycling home for an unscheduled visit. For a long time there are no other characters other than Galla and her bike, which she considers a faithful companion. She talks to it, and she nurses it along, mindful of its broken-down state. The road is long and the rain is cold. Galla displays a Beckettian stoicism, resolute in the face of harsh conditions and disappointments. In fact, her pluck is the reason we have the impression we've read something like Free Day before. We expect a revelation because of the girl's superheated version of reality. We can understand her remembering again and again the deaths of the family's animals. And we share her objections to her father's cruelties. We notice she fears the creek and the marshes bordering the road. So we're led to believe there's an uncompromising reality behind this girl who zigzags down the road singing to her bike and harboring Pollyannaish thoughts of her mother.

At the beginning of 1970 the American poet Robert Lowell, his wife and literary critic Elizabeth Hardwick, and their daughter Harriet were in Europe. Hardwick and Harriet returned home to New York City while Lowell remained in Britain to take up a teaching fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford. That spring he met and began an affair with the British novelist Caroline Blackwood. Eventually, probably under the influence of one of his manic attacks which had plagued him his whole life and for which he occasionally underwent treatment and hospitalization, Lowell decided to remain in Britain with Blackwood, divorcing Hardwick. Bound together loosely by literary ties including the sale of Lowell's papers and bound more tightly by care for Harriet, 13-years old when the saga began, Hardwick and Lowell communicated frequently by mail and phone. Hardwick was at first terribly hurt, confused, and angry. Lowell's mental state constantly fluctuated with treatments as needed. He later regretted having hurt Elizabeth and Harriet. He loved them fiercely while also loving Caroline and the son, Sheridan, he had with her. Over the remaining years of Lowell's life the letters continued. The notoriety of the triangle involved more than circumstance, however. It was magnified by Lowell's using quotes from Hardwick's letters to him in a book of sonnets he wrote, The Dolphin, in which Caroline served as his oceanic muse. The letters are not just Lowell's and Hardwick's, though. Included are those Saskia Hamilton refers to as ""the circle."" They were friends like Frank Bidart, Adrienne Rich, Elizabeth Bishop, Mary McCarthy, and more, who thought Lowell's use of the quotes from her personal letters a betrayal of trust and privacy. Correspondence from them to Lowell show their strong objections to The Dolphin's content and support of Hardwick. What Hamilton, who edited these letters, shows is that Hardwick also used phrases or fragments from the letters in writings of her own, particularly her 1979 novel Sleepless Nights. My impression is that this isn't commonly known.This is a well-worn story, familiar through biographies of Lowell and studies of his poetry. What makes this collection so valuable and such an enjoyable read is that Hamilton has brought the focus of those 9 years of letters onto how they impacted The Dolphin. A comprehensive ""Introduction"" explains their story, a ""Table of Dates"" details their activities across the years, and the letters are accompanied by generous footnotes which further explain events and motivations. She's made getting inside the heads of Lowell, Hardwick, Harriet, and their friends a fascinating read. The deeper we dive into this familiar story the more we learn about it and the more we're riveted and emotionally engaged.

All the technological advances in organized violence, from barbed arrows and chariots to stealth aircraft and nuclear weapons, make war deadlier. To avoid those wars societies have to be better at cooperating, have to work toward being internally peaceful and prosperous. The new stability makes a governed unit which produces a better, more peaceful life for its citizens. The paradox of war is that its violence makes the world safer and richer by reducing violence. The problem is the process of progress and civilization being cyclic. When governments find their influence declining they also lose the ability to prevent the mass organized violence we call war.He uses most of his book to present a general history of warfare. The course of history illustrates his hypothesis. I believe in his argument while realizing his line of thought is only one way of presenting it, the distinction between productive war and unproductive war, the use of Hobbes's Leviathan to demonstrate productive governance versus Carroll's Red Queen effect in which a conflict results in little progress. My only quarrel with the book is its tone. His style is chatty, informal and given to the arch aside accompanied by a wink and an elbow nudge. Though his lessons and conclusions are convincing and backed by serious thought, he's chosen a way of explaining I find a bit flip and jargon-driven. This observation is in line with the--I think--unfortunate title. In fact, I'd tried to read his earlier study of civilizations, Why the West Rules--for Now, and had abandoned it halfway through because of this offhand style.I did make it to the end of War! What Is It Good For? Though offering little new information, his perspectives became more interesting as he approached the 20th century, his analysis more thought-provoking. And by the time he was discussing conflict in my lifetime, I was seriously caught up. Part of our reasons for reading such a book is to learn what we already know. Morris may be a flip writer and a little redundant at times, but he clarifies circumstances and focuses views we already have. His analysis of the 40-year spiral toward WWI is probably as good as you'll read anywhere. Related to that particular era is our own. He thinks America's decline of power in the last 20 years of so parallels that of the British Empire as the 19th century ended and carries the same historical scope and magnitude. The idea of the globocop is an important one to Morris's thesis. One nation maintaining global order through military strength and trade alliances is an essential role in providing peace and prosperity and in moving us all in the direction of Denmark, Morris's ideal nation. The decline of the globocop encourages mischief and makes for instability that may ultimately result in war. Morris thinks the declines of such world orders, Pax Britannica and Pax Americana, take a very long time and can even, if the right steps are taken, be reversible. His book was published in 2014. At that time Trump was just a gleam in our TV sets.The promise of his title is kept. Following his history of warfare he discusses violence among primates. It's no wonder we're violent, he says. Look where we came from. He ends by showing where we're going: robotics. He sees in the decades not too far in our future such technologies as brain-to-brain interfacing and the transhuman. We can be optimistic because he's shown that technological advance brings a reduction in organized violence. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 18, 2020","Jul 04, 2020","Dec 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21853743-war-what-is-it-good-for

An important part oI thoroughly enjoyed Deirdre Bair's memoir of her years writing her first 2 biographies, of Samuel Beckett and Simone de Beauvoir. An important part of her early story is that she'd never written a biography before. Especially not a heavy duty one like Beckett's would require. So she had to learn as she progressed. I remember knowing at the time that someone was writing his biography and had even read that there was some resistance to it from Beckett himself. That wasn't exactly true. Bair writes that while he didn't wholeheartedly approve of her researching his life and work, he did cooperate when he was available. His reluctance was felt in his tyrannical hold on friends and family whose interviews and letters she needed. Each trip to Paris and Dublin unfolded almost as adventure. Her accounts of meeting the individuals in the huge cast of characters making up the Beckett circle are engaging. And in the years of research and writing she had to travel back and forth between Dublin and Paris and Philadelphia where she was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania while juggling a full family life at the same time.Simone de Beauvoir was an easier subject, if temperamental. De Beauvoir had admired Bair's biography of Beckett and welcomed the book she'd write about her. Bair was attracted to de Beauvoir as subject because she held her work promoting feminism in high esteem. In fact, Bair references her feminist sympathies many times in the book. She's sprung from the feminist seed de Beauvoir has sown, and that can't be a bad thing.Part of Bair's story also relates the ups and downs of her personal academic career. While she wrote the 2 biographies she was struggling for tenure and a full professorship. During the writing of her Beckett book, and after, she had to tolerate a certain amount of disparagement from other Beckett scholars and from male academics in general who thought she was intruding into their scholastic bailiwick and overstepping her own qualifications. Most of the time she holds her own against the slings and arrows and snubs.Of the 2 biographies that are her subject here, I was eager for that on Beckett, way back many years ago. I liked it. Later I read the biography James Knowlson wrote (he was one of those who snubbed Bair) and thought it perhaps treated him a little too gently. I preferred Bair's book. I haven't read her biography of de Beauvoir, but now I think I will.In the meantime I appreciate her memoir of the years spent writing the 2 biographies. Her experiences and her views gained from her work are always interesting. And her observations of Beckett and de Beauvoir and those who were part of their stories are probably invaluable to anyone interested in them.

It describes how Americans understood the oceans during Melville's lifetime, and it explains what whaling was like during the age of sail. While every aspect of the ocean is discussed--wind, navigation, chemistry--most of the chapters examine the many kinds of life and what the sailors knew about them in that pre-Darwin time. Most detailed, of course, are whales and particularly the sperm whale. The structure of the book roughly follows the voyage of the Pequod. Early chapters discuss cetology in general. Soon the chapters tie in the various forms of life encountered as the ship sails through the Indian Ocean. Storms greet the Pequod as it enters the Pacific. The 3 days of Ahab dueling with Moby-Dick is contained in a long chapter called ""Sperm Whale Behavior."" And the conclusion necessarily, I think, covers some of the environmental changes which have occurred in the last 150 years and those to come. King even deftly weaves in considerations of Ishmael as an environmentalist.I've always been attracted by the idea of the young Melville on deck looking out at where there's only sea and sky and realizing they just go on and on, out and out, ""immortal and indifferent,"" in King's phrase. I can't imagine he could've written the Moby-Dick we have without that kind of understanding. But King doesn't spend much time speculating on the metaphysical world of the novel or the spiritual motivations of characters. He barely brushes up against meanings but mentions that Melville was aware of new ideas on deep time and how they might affect one's concepts of divinity and creation. He was still a century away from the discovery that whales evolved from land mammals or any of our understanding of the Pacific's geology. King simply quotes scholar Elizabeth Foster: ""At some time between Typee and Moby-Dick, Melville's universe changed: the benevolent hand of a Father disappeared from the tiller of the world,"" and he leaves it at that. In the end it doesn't matter that Melville and Ishmael and Starbuck and Flask knew so much less than we know about the ocean and whales.

This is such a lovely memoir, deserving of its near-classic status. Johnson was 47 years old when she first wrote about her love affair with New York City and with Jack Kerouac. Sometimes I think it's her writing about the city I keep returning to, sometimes I think it's her remembering the people, now famous or even legendary, she knew when she was a very young woman and included in the coterie around Kerouac. Johnson genuinely loves New York City but loves the young bohemians of her past, too, and recognizes her debt to them. Her fond regard for people like Allen Ginsberg and Hettie Jones and Elise Cowen allows us to see them as she did, not as heroic Beat figures, because they weren't heroic, but because they needed and deserved her love. It's lovely, but it's sad, too. She nostalgically recalls her passage from teenage wanderings in Washington Square searching for a bohemian lifestyle to early jobs in publishing and connections with the Beats and love with Kerouac. She burns through some years with him as he burns himself up in the flame of his early fame, unable, finally, to follow her when she walks away.

By far most of these essays were written after the Great War which Lawrence rarely mentioned yet felt deeply. The mankind he saw in Australia and New Mexico was a kind of portal into the elemental primitiveness connected to a nature he saw as a remedy to man's baser attributes unleashed by the war. He saw in primitive society links to governing principles of nature to rival his own ideas of the female principle creating a kind of divinity.

The actual Workshop we know was established in 1941 by a poet and wayward clergyman named Paul Engle, who stumbled into teaching and was heavily influenced by Iowa English professor Wilbur Schramm's teaching method. Today it's arguably considered the world's finest institution teaching creative writing.The title of the book gives a long way toward explaining the highly competitive environment of IWW. The teaching philosophy, as preached by Engle, was to dissect and offer criticism in open classroom forums the ongoing work of students, all of them enrolled and all embroiled in the contentious free for all. The criticism was expected to be unsparingly honest and humiliating if necessary, the classroom atmosphere intended to prepare writers for the intense pressures of the publishing world. This feisty analysis and discussion was meant to drive out bad writing habits rather than allowing time for developing good ones. The overall method was a competitiveness and harsh criticism which set students against each other rather than fostering cooperation and mutual support. One characteristic of the program is that it's always been less interested in intellectual insight than in competitiveness. Dominance is more important than technical development and ideas. It's a Darwinian system. Not all survive, but some thrive.One who thrived is T. C. Boyle, one of the program's most successful students and a kind of poster boy for the IWW because of it. Like Robert Lowell, who used Iowa to stabilize his mental condition, Boyle used it to help rid himself of his heroin and quaalude addiction and unleash his creativity. His is only one of the stories here. Dowling's history of the school is told through chronological chapters which are each centered around a well-known writer or faculty member who passed through the IWW, nun-like Flannery O'Connor being the 1st and perhaps the most famous. But the stories of Sandra Cisneros and Joy Harjo are also here in a chapter focused on describing the sexual exploitation of female students common there, as well as some racial discrimination. Jane Smiley and Rita Dove each get a chapter. Kurt Vonnegut, John Irving, and John Berryman are examples of distinguished faculty. So is Marilynne Robinson whose late chapter and mystical sensitivities kind of link with the chapter on O'Connor to form a frame. These are all successful writers, of course, and have in common their association with the IWW. But each experience Dowling relates is different, meant to reveal the many sides of the Workshop.What's apparent in this parade of writers we admire is that IWW's program is enormously successful. Whether or not we agree that the discipline of hypercriticism is the best method, the Workshop does produce quality writers.

Actually, that sShark is one of those novels which begins abruptly with a sentence continuing from the last page of the novel, circling like a shark. Actually, that sentence begins about a dozen pages from the end and reads a little like the LSD-inspired hallucinatory content of some of the characters' stream of consciousness. I mention these as indicators of the novel's challenges because the headline about Shark is that the structure is a single block of prose unbroken by chapters or even paragraphs. Scenes shift without warning from London to the Pacific, from a character shaving (a nod to Ulysses) to terrified sailors adrift in the middle of a shark attack, from a young woman on the prowl for drugs to a movie theater. Often the shift is mid-sentence. It looks formidable and confusing but isn't because it reads fluidly, even lyrically. The energy of Self's style and imagery creates fun and compels the reader to keep moving just as (forgive me) the shark has to keep moving in order to stay alive.The novel's the 2d in a trilogy about the psychiatrist Dr. Zack Busner who, in the 1st novel, Umbrella, treated catatonia in the aftermath of the Great War. That novel told the story of Audrey Death, finally helped by Busner through the use of LSD. Her brother, Albert, returns in Shark where Busner continues to use LSD to treat those suffering from PTSD. His patients include Claude Evinrude, an American who was aboard the USS Indianapolis, the ship which delivered the atomic bombs to Tinian and was later torpedoed on 30 July 1945 while returning home. The Indianapolis, in a story well-known, sank quickly spilling 900 men into the ocean where the waters they swam in became a feeding frenzy of sharks. Michael Lincoln, another of Busner's patients, was apparently a British observer in the Enola Gay over Hiroshima a week after the Indianapolis went down. Both of these events, Hiroshima and the Indianapolis sinking, are central to the novel, and Self writes brilliantly about them.Sharks swim freely through this prose. They're most evident, of course, in the waters where the Indianapolis sinks, but they're often alluded to in other ways, in the way characters look with prominent snouts and predatory teeth or in the several recurring scenes in which Busner and his son watch the Spielberg film Jaws. Seen from the air, a shark-shaped Hiroshima boiling beneath its mushroom cloud seems to make the shark an emblem of history and death.I've had this novel for a long time. Even remembering the enormous enjoyment I got from Umbrella, I kept putting it off in favor of easier reads because, as I say, it looks more challenging than it is.

The ideas of ethnologists like Franz Boas were the signposts to my thinking. The field research of Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands was a frequent topic of classroom discussion. Margaret Mead was at the peak of her reputation. Her famous field study in Samoa published as Coming of Age in Samoa was required reading, and we were encouraged if not expected to read her other books. Based on the success of scientists such as these, immersion in and analysis of primitive (or more primitive) groups in distant, often isolated, locations became the proven method of research. Gods of the Upper Air tells the story of the birth of this field we now know as cultural anthropology.Whether or not the story of cultural anthropology's origins can be told exclusively in this way, King chooses to assign Franz Boas as the figurehead of the discipline plowing into the 20th century as he mentors 4 talented disciples who happen to be women. Boas came to America late in the 19th century via field work among the Inuit of Baffin Island. Eventually establishing a department of anthropological studies at Columbia University, he guided the work of Ruth Benedict among Northwestern Indians, Mead in the South Pacific, Zora Neale Hurston in the colorful folklore of the American South and Caribbean, and Ella Cara Deloria's work with Plains and Southwest tribal languages.King channels the beginnings of cultural anthropology through the lives of these 5 individuals. Because it traces the life of Boas from his European beginnings as well as the lives of the 4 women, ending his book with the death of Mead, it's largely a biographical work. King knows how to tell stories. A few years ago I read Lily King's novel Euphoria fictionalizing Mead's love triangle with Reo Fortune and Gregory Bateson while they worked together in New Guinea. I enormously enjoyed Charles King's nonfictional account of those events. Hurston is equally fascinating. I'd known of her primarily as a novelist. But she did important work for Boas and Columbia gathering folkways in the South and Haiti. The lives can't be told without relating the ideas driving them and the conclusions arrived at through their field work. Boas's own findings over a century ago on the value of immigrants makes me think we've taken a step backward today. Collectively the group made important determinations refuting the physical and psychological differences of race. Though the extended title is a bit sensational and overstated for my taste, we come to see the subjects of King's book as the gods of the upper air, those scientists who wrote cultural relativism, the idea than any given culture reflects the family structure, religion, food habits, aesthetics, sexual mores, and political system most logical to that society.

I don't like her fiction that much,, but I do like her essays, though I haven't read all of them yet. She was an interesting essayist and thinker, and was an interesting woman. Benjamin Moser's biography is the full Susan. It's comprehensive in covering the events of her life. It also offers fairly expansive critical appraisals of her work, and therefore her thinking. It's a biography which gives us the picture of Sontag we wanted and expected. Moser presupposes a ""provincial"" background overcome by Sontag's persistent intellectual approach to whatever interested her. That persistent curiosity and her ability to parse whatever she decided to turn her attention to resulted in a kind of ""deux ex machima"" personality sweeping everything cultural and intellectual before her.All of her life, her loves, and her projects are on view and discussed here. Along the way Moser exposes her warts. Probably an apt word for her would be difficult. She was a difficult friend to many, and a difficult lover. She was a problematic mother, even diffident at times. She was argumentative, intimidating, haughty, untruthful about herself and disdainful of others. But Moser also celebrates her, especially her writing and role as public intellectual. He makes clear why she's admired for her intellect and her advocacy of high culture. As he points out, the meaning of our culture changed constantly during her lifetime. She was always knowledgeable of the changes and our relationship to them and helped us stay enlightened.Moser's portrait reveals many warts, but I still think the most beautiful women are the smartest women. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 05, 2019","Nov 21, 2019","Sep 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43309540-sontag

I'm attracted to novels written in big blocks of unparagraphed, unsentenced prose, anyway. But knowing the author Lucy Ellmann is daughter to the man who wrote the definitive biography of James Joyce whose novel Ulysses famously ends with the Molly Bloom soliloquy, a 45-page, 8-sentence block of prose guaranteed that I'd take up this novel to discover other Joycean parallels. The headline of the  grabbed me, too. It claimed Ellmann's 988-page novel contains 8 sentences. I was eager to connect all the dots.Is it worth it? Yes, it is. It's time-consuming, reading all those pages solid with words, but it's not particularly difficult reading. Its density is the prose style, not the prose content. What you read flows as easily as the nearby Ohio River.Ducks, Newburyport is the interior monologue of a wife and mother who lives in Newcomerstown, Ohio. She has 4 children ranging in age from 15 years to preschool. Leo, her 2d husband (remember that Molly's married to Leopold Bloom), is an engineering professor. She once tried teaching herself but now spends her time baking pies and pastry for restaurants and stores in nearby communities. The fact that they keep chickens to supplement their income gives me the impression they live on the edge of town. She has some health issues: she's a cancer survivor and as a child underwent surgery to repair a hole in her heart. She has enormous responsibilities in the novel because the burden of point of view is hers alone. It's an extended, complete portrait of a rather ordinary woman living in the American midwest. I'm not sure a universality of time and place and character is intended. Perhaps it is. There are enough specific topics--Trump is one--to locate the time as now, as well as many geographical references to Ohio. Other than Trump she doesn't think about current events or news from other parts of the world. She's busy baking and caring for her kids.I didn't see much Molly Bloom in her. Maybe I wasn't supposed to, though I couldn't help all those Joycean dots making me wonder. Whereas Molly was a randy, rough earth-mother type of woman who'd call an arse an arse, Ellmann's narrator (if she's named in the novel, I missed it) is a little bit demure. She's not given to sexual fantasies or even thoughts. Profanity never flits through her mind except, as I remember, near the end when she thinks the word boobs (gasp!). Rather than say ass she uses the term ""sit-me-down-upon."" And yet she doesn't seem unusually upright or proper. It's just that she's not in the habit of thinking erotically, even in the moments she expresses to herself the fierce love she feels for her husband. There's a character named Ronny who delivers chicken feed to the house and is too friendly. She understands what he wants without being curious about it. Some might think this a false note. I personally think women are more erotically-minded than Ellmann's narrator. But she wrote the character she wanted and made her believable.The most obvious fact of the novel is that it's written in one sentence. Without getting into the technicalities of locating subjects, verbs, and objects (without getting over my head), I can say it reads like a single sentence. Many of the narrator's thoughts begin with the phrase ""the fact that..."" and I suppose it might serve as a substitute for a period. It's tricky without being clumsy yet reads easily enough. I was expecting within this single sentence for there to be obvious hiatuses or gaps in the flow of words to distinguish sentences within the sentence. There aren't. But neither is her thinking continuous in time and space from the 1st page to the last. There are gaps in time providing us with characteristic and individual episodes. Perhaps these episodes can be thought of as sentences. One episode concerns delivering pies. She has a flat tire and is stranded on a cold, snowy highway. Another is days later when she shares breakfast with her family. An episode relates a grocery buying trip with her kids. The final episode of the book reminds me of Molly. She lies in bed at 3:33 AM, unable to go to sleep, her mind racing with thoughts. Perhaps there are 8 of these episodes. Anyway, by the time I began to think along these lines I was too far into the novel to backtrack and identify, in that thicket of prose, such landmarks. Ellmann doesn't scatter many breadcrumbs for us.I don't want to give the impression it's only a block of random, disjointed thought. There's a narrative, and there's even a climax. But the story we read is filtered through this woman's consciousness. And floating in this ocean of monologue are the associations and rhymes that spring from individual words. They often suggest lists to her, another relation to Joyce who thought that lists create reality.There are individual sentences. An equally well-known element of the novel is the parallel story of the lioness and her cubs. Ellmann injects 22 short snapshots of the lioness at intervals outside the frame of the narrator's interior monologue. Written in conventional prose, they describe the lioness's journey through Ohio. Reviewers I read seemed puzzled by the purpose of this alternate story. I thought she's a parallel to the woman. The fact that the physical and emotional circumstances of the woman and mountain lion run parallel is to me most apparent on 2 pages that might be said to mirror each other, 926 and 927.That mirroring points to the novel's primary theme, love of family. Just as Ulysses is about love and ends with Molly's affirmation of her love for Leopold, so is Ducks, Newburyport about the profound love the narrator feels for her family.

So when I became aware she was publishing Learning from the Germans comparing Germany's anti-Semitism and the American South's white supremacy, I knew I'd read it soon after publication. Neiman has roots in both countries she writes about. She was born in Atlanta and raised Jewish there during the civil rights era. She's lived in Berlin since the 1980s.I was expecting a comparative analysis of German and American racism and more of her philosophical penetration into the nature of evil. But she has said her book is about comparative redemption, not comparative evil. What she finds is redemption in Germany--their word for it is 26 letters long and means working-off-the-past--but not in America. Germans have made great strides in atoning for the Holocaust, she says. They're taught as a population that the Holocaust was an event of national disgrace. Their memorials to WWII reference the victims of the Holocaust. In the American South, where monuments honor those who fought for the preservation of slavery and were mostly erected in the Jim Crow era, the work of atonement is proceeding much slower. The difference, Neiman says, is shame. Germany, as a nation and society, recognizes the shame of the Holocaust. America doesn't yet feel ashamed of its racial past. Guilt, maybe, regret, but not yet shame. She mentions Native Americans only in passing. It's generally acknowledged that America was founded as much on the genocide of Indians as it was on the enslavement of Africans, and I would've welcomed her thoughts on the subject, but that would have required a much larger book containing much larger arguments. Neiman's method is personal. She uses her knowledge of having lived in Germany, and she records her experiences while traveling through the South, primarily Mississippi, I think, in a text which reads a little like reportage. Her own philosophical reflections on evil and how memory influences popular myth, her interviews, and her personal contacts are how she comes to the truths about such topics as reparations, Confederate monuments, and the face of the new racism in Germany aimed at immigrants. Sometimes her method makes it easy to make blanket statements she probably can't support. At one point she says it's impossible to eat well in the Delta. In another place she writes about Mississippi weather conditions in a way that makes the residents seem constantly threatened by extreme heat, tornadoes, and lightning when the truth is the residents consider the conditions just a fact of living there. She finds the common Southern phrase ""Bless your heart"" a curse rather than an expression of sweet empathy. As if recognizing she occasionally may be guilty of overstatement, on p206 she says that philosophers don't have to be accurate in the same ways historians do.But, bless her heart, these are minor quibbles about a book that's confidently presented, wise, and whose arguments are convincing.

It's the 1st novel I've read in a long while that I wanted to start again as soon as I finished.There's little story to it. It's a meditative work told by a young (I think) woman in a somber tone that'll remind you of W. G. Sebald. The woman is a seasoned traveler who's now living in the industrial margins of East London. The River Lea and the Thames and several canals move through the landscape of her wanderings. They stimulate thoughts of rivers she's known in her past, but the great river of the novel is memory. Rivers are analogous to the flow of memory within her, standing pools are collective reflections on her own past. In addition, she tells us rivers are borders forming an other; we have to stop and observe the other side, an important action for a woman who wanders. The idea of borders makes the recurrence of words like homeland, refugees, and exile that much more significant. As she's from somewhere else, she notices people who share her feelings of being different. The few characters of her neighborhood, which is largely Jewish, are obscure and identifiable by impressionable traits, like the Croat or the King. It's from the Croat's used-goods store that she acquires an old Polaroid camera with which she takes snapshots of the marshlands and river scenes scattered throughout the book. Individual chapters recall other rivers she's seen and reflect different periods of her life. In Toronto, in a chapter about the St. Lawrence River, she apparently gave birth to a son. She recalls the Neretva River in Bosnia and the stinking Yarkon River in Israel. The novel's longest chapter concerns a journey to Kolkata and the mighty Ganges.Her journey down the Ganges with its burning ghats on the shore and floating garbage adds weight to the novel's atmosphere of a wasteland which has been building chapter by chapter. Googling the River Lea to acquaint myself visually with the region, I found photos of attractive, well-appointed suburbs. However, Kinsky's descriptions make a reader aware of an area of depressed industrialization. In this transitional boundary between city and country are broken sidewalks, the shells of old factories and warehouses. Flocks of crows throw shadows over the land and darken the woman's vision. The plaintive songs of early Neil Young--the albums After the Gold Rush and Harvest--pour out of the Croat's shop. Everything seems to be suffering. The atmosphere of waste and neglect is emphasized by the use of words and phrases like rusty remains, battered, infested, long ruinous decline, musty acrid fetor, cracked, derelict, and wan, scrubby grass. Because this is at odds with the pretty Wikipedia photos, I began to wonder if her mental funk caused her run-down vision.A book is a river. We cast off into its current with vague anticipations but not otherwise knowing what we'll encounter and learn along the way. Sometimes at this point or that we begin to wish we'd paid more attention, particularly at the moment you begin to realize memory is in the wingtips of birds and poetry in the empty holes of windows.

It's 86 short, autobiographical stories, snapshots the Soviet Gulag in the Kolyma Region of eastern Siberia where gold and coal were mined using the slave labor of political and criminal prisoners serving unbelievably long sentences. Shalamov himself experienced what he wrote about, serving 15 years there.I was impressed by the stories. First, Shalamov offers more variety than you'd think possible about men considered ""human refuse"" and ""human slag"" who're worked to the limits of their endurance, and often to death, in conditions of extreme weather while provided only starvation rations. I thought almost every story interesting in its own way. I'd read a gloss of the book which complained of the sameness of the stories, and even Donald Rayfield's ""Introduction"" hints at tedium, but I found none. Secondly, I thought the stories more hopeful than I expected. I'd recently reread Richard Flanagan's The Narrow Road to the Deep North about Australian prisoners of war being forced to build a railroad through Thailand for the Japanese. Shalamov wrote of harsh conditions and slave labor which included random killing and yet his stories didn't strike me with the same tenor of suffering that Flanagan's POWs faced. The prisoners of Kolyma are a hardy lot. These stories cover every facet of their lives, how and what they ate, how they bathed, how they dressed, how they tried to manipulate the system, the importance of bread, and much more. Stories of deprivation, fear, and cruelty, sure, but stories of the unassailable human spirit, too. Not all the stories can be classed as rigorously fictional. Shalamov sometimes wrote pieces which told how things were rather than telling a story, though they still carry characters. Those describing the conditions under which they lived and worked and the functioning of the Gulag system were for me among the most interesting. One story's about how and why prisoners were killed, another about how equipment was obtained. There's a long one describing many attempted escapes. ""Maxim"" is about the pleasant relief a lend-lease bulldozer brings to a work site. Especially these, but all the stories, ring with plausibility because you know Shalamov lived the moments of danger and wretchedness he wrote about.Sketches of the Criminal World: Further Kolyma Storie will be published in January in a matching NYRB edition to complete Shalamov's stories of the Gulag.

He felt the need tBarry Lopez wrote about many subjects and even wrote fiction but is best known for his books about nature, particularly the Arctic. He felt the need to travel as much as to write, and Horizon is a kind of recollection of places he considered significant to a lifetime of travel and reflection. Not a memoir, the book nevertheless looks back on what he's learned about landscapes, about the wildlife and different kinds of societies he's seen. Sometimes he's writing about events that occurred decades ago. That the time shifts aren't always clear never diminishes the sharp revelations he writes.He always approaches and observes everything he contacts with a sense of wonder. Wonder and curiosity are necessary elements in the imperative toward the next boundary from which he can see another beckoning horizon.The book begins at Cape Foulweather, Oregon near his home. He's most interested in the weather there as it comes off the Pacific. Lopez is always aware of indigenous inhabitants, past and present. On Skraeling Island in Canada's Arctic he helps an archaeological team uncover an ancient Thule site. In the Galapagos he writes about evolution, Darwin, and Capt. James Cook's 18th century explorations of the Pacific. In Kenya's Rift Valley he's engaged in the search for man's hominid ancestors. He's disturbed by the changes man's progress our current Anthropocene period has had on landscapes and indigenous people. He uses Australia as his example in writing about our overuse of the land and its resources. In Antarctica he writes about the ways science studies the continent's icy desert.Lopez writes sensitively, poetically about it all. Given the wealth of insight he has into these relatively remote places and the enormous historical and scientific influences at work there, we'd forgive him more pedestrian prose, but his lyricism becomes part of what he experiences, as if one couldn't exist without the other. Sometimes the writing itself and the penetrating understanding of what he sees reminds me of the best of Joan Didion. I thought this especially true in the section on Australia. There's a lot to take in, but he makes reading it a pleasure.Adventure is a work he uses only once in the book, on p488, and not about himself. Mostly he thought of himself as a traveler. He takes part in the work wherever he goes: he helps harvest meteorites in Antarctica, he searches for prehistoric remains in Kenya, he's part of the archaeological dig on Skraeling Island. And he takes notes and writes constantly. But the reader may think the word adventure when he describes diving under the Ross Ice Shelf or taking off in a small plane in Kenya where there's no airstrip.Sadly, Lopez died this past Christmas Day. He left us some wonderful pictures and perspectives of nature and man. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 15, 2021","Feb 15, 2021","Jul 29, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40818612-horizon

Mercer's book on Joni Mitchell came to me handed down from someone who didn't want to read it. And I, in turn, treated it kinda cavalierly as a quick read on my way from lectures on Proust, where I was, to postwar Japan, where I'll be going next. I found, however, there are many things to like about it. It's more interesting than not.I came to the book familiar with Mitchell's music. The Blue Period Mercer writes about covers the years 1971 through 1976 and the 5 albums she recorded during that time: Blue, For the Roses, Court and Spark, The Hissing of Summer Lawns, and Hejira. I have the albums and have listened to them for years without the need to analyze the music or the need to understand their autobiographical content. That there are autobiographical elements to the music--old lovers, old grudges, travels, childhood--is one focus of Mercer's book. She spends considerable time explaining how the influences of St. Augustine and Bob Dylan helped move her toward writing more personal music, beginning with Blue. The flat Saskatchewan landscape of her origins is also a subject. The significance of this Blue Period is that during this time Mitchell transitioned from her early pop and folk-heavy style into the role of singer-songwriter-poet to take her place beside her 2 primary influences, Dylan and Leonard Cohen. More than criticism, the book is also a biography of Mitchell up to 1976, the end of this Blue Period. The emphasis of the Saskatchewan years is used to demonstrate how her music came from them, how a tomboy who wasn't so good in school nevertheless became a performer and writer some consider genius. Mitchell's well known for her many affairs. That Mercer drops their frequency and many of the names, I assume, is to allow her to show how Mitchell uses them in her songs. One of the juicier bits of the book is the comment that when she moved to Los Angeles she was known as El Lay. Her fondness for smoking and for drugs is also a topic. And many of Mitchell's extended quotes included display a frequent bitterness about some personal aversions. She disparages modern culture, for instance, some contemporary songwriters, and the Catholic Church. Mercer offers a ""Coda"" at the end which serves as a kind of mitigation for Mitchell's outspokenness. The ""Coda"" itemizes some of the things Mitchell speaks positively of: pinball, Nietzsche, Van Gogh, metaphor, her home in British Columbia. She's not all bad, and the book's not, either. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 15, 2019","Dec 17, 2019","Jul 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6172859-will-you-take-me-as-i-am

As sometimes happens, once I was into it I decided I wasn't in the mood for it. Maybe Orner's tone didn't fit with whatever else I was reading at the time. Or maybe I simply wanted a weightier discussion of reading, perhaps even something academic. The vagaries of why we choose to read which books and when are as myriad as the types of books available to read. You know how it goes. I seldom give up on a book, though. I found this 2d attempt to be pleasant and fun as well as informative about the books and authors Orner discusses.A heavy reader myself, I'm always interested in others who consider reading to be a way of life. Their relations to books and reading often reflect my own. Orner's long title suggested to me his book would offer me comments about reading and the love of books I could identify with.As the title indicates, Orner's life is reading and reading is his life. These are linked personal essays, each centered around a particular book or author and each serving as a fragment of memoir. As important to him as books is his father and his marriage. They weave through the essays at various stages of health and circumstances.If he can't write the perfect sentence, toward which his ambition pushes him, he can be a very good reader. I got the impression he does most reading in the garage where his books are kept. But he reads wherever he finds himself because he's seemingly never without a book. He reads on trains and buses, in the hospital, in coffee ships, and, naturally, in his garage. There's a hilarious story of his reading in a canoe. In the final essay, while eating a burrito in a Pancho Villa's Mexican Grill and reading Elias Canetti, he reveals why he likes to read in public: ""I think it's about anonymity. You read a book in public and it's like you don't exist. I'm nobody, just another guy in a flannel shirt with a book, which is what I am."" I got from the book what I wanted, so this 2d attempt at reading was enjoyable as well as worthwhile in providing stimulating thought about books. He doesn't try to be a major league critic. He's primarily a reader. I think that's what he wants to be. Still, he offers interesting insight into authors and books we're familiar with. John Cheever is here. So is Gina Berriault and William Trevor and Virginia Woolf. There's even the suggestion that James Salter doesn't always write perfect sentences. Perhaps my favorite of the essays was his ""Stray Thoughts on Kafka."" Truth is, not much about Orner is stray.

I finally decided it's a close cousin to Joan Chase's novel During the Reign of the Queen Early on in Three Summers I wasn't sure what I was reading. I finally decided it's a close cousin to Joan Chase's novel During the Reign of the Queen of Persia. Both novels are about young girls observing the world of adults around them and coming to an understanding of that world and their place in it. While Chase's novel, which I reread last year, takes place in rural Ohio, Liberaki's Three Summers tells of 3 Greek sisters who live in a suburb of Athens. Though 5000 miles separate Greece and Ohio, and though 20 years separate the lives lived with a world war intervening, all these girls share similarities. They're aware of romantic love and wonder about sex and observe animals and adults with the same fascination. What's different is what's learned. What's different is the degree of astonishment.The story of Maria, Infanta, and Katerina reels out over 3 summers in the late '30s. Perhaps it's romantic. Katerina, the youngest and whose point of view the novel is, mostly sees the world that way. Even as her perceptions are widened by events around her and even as she interacts with characters whose complexities point to discoveries she couldn't have been aware of when the novel opens, I think she remains dreamy. That's probably best represented by the Eden-like summers of the novel permeated with floral scents and warm breezes across suburban meadows. The lives of the Krauss girls in Ohio are also blessed by their summers until an abrupt family crisis in hard, iron winter forces them into a realism Katerina in Athens doesn't have to face yet. It's beautifully written and not at all sweet but still perhaps a bit soft for me.

It's essentially an adventure story, the first attempts on Mt. Everest. As you'd expect--as I did--it's full of man against the elements, British pluck, and all that. The book delivers. Partly because, I'm sure, I knew little of the story, I found it enormously engaging. I couldn't put it down.These days we're used to photos of climbers in long queues on the face of the mountain waiting their turn at the summit, reports of $11,000 fees (I'm told) charged by companies that provide the experience, and intense media interest when something goes wrong up there. These days it's hard for us to imagine a time when Everest was unknown. We're surprised to learn that no European saw the mountain until 1903. We're not surprised that once its height was calculated and it was established as the highest point on earth that men wanted to climb it. We're not surprised that the British were determined to be the first in the proud interests of empire. Their Royal Geographic Society and the Alpine Club had the organization and resources needed to attempt it. Wade Davis's book tells the story of the 1st 3 expeditions in 1921, 1922, and 1924. What took so long was the Great War interrupted their efforts. Because nothing was known about Everest the 1921 expedition was a reconnaissance designed to map the area and to find the best access onto the mountain itself. The 1922 and 1924 expeditions were attempts to reach the summit. We know they failed, that the summit wasn't reached until 1953 by Edmund Hillary and the Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. So in a way this is a book about failure that nevertheless highlights indomitable spirit and courage.There are many stories told here. The title indicates 3 grand themes. I was confused at first that Davis gave such prominence to the Great War. I even thought the Everest story could have been told without its details. But these climbers were all veterans who'd seen a great deal of action. Early going in the book spotlights their experiences, familiar to us because we've all read of the general nature of the war and the horrific environment it created. Davis's descriptions raised my eyebrows. They're among the most lurid and sensational I've ever read and, to me, served no real purpose because he didn't underline the war's later influence on the men. Only twice does he mention lingering effects: a climber named Wakefield, broken by the war, sought redemption on Everest, and another suffered wounds which restricted him to administrative duties. Such graphic writing on the war becomes heavy fruit in the mind of a reader who's read widely on the subject; it bends the branch of the reader's acceptance and might later breed questions about Davis's descriptions of conditions on the mountain. It's only toward the end of the book that some signals emerge to explain Davis's motives. Some of the men compared the danger of climbing mountains to the war. Even today it's common to hear the phrases ""assault on the mountain"" and ""attacking the peak"" used in high-altitude climbing just as those men spoke of it in the 1920s. One of those on the 1922 attempt wrote, ""In a struggle between man and mountain, such as this, as in any other battle...the moral effect of turning away from the enemy, after having once challenged and opened the fight, is fatal."" In addition, one thing I learned about these attempts on mountains is that they're generally organized using military methods and disciplines these men were familiar with. I feel it's probably true today.The third theme of the title is George Mallory. I'd begun the book with the idea it's partly his biography. It's not. Details of his life, including wartime and climbing experiences, are included, but so is the same information on every other key member. Mallory's importance was as perhaps the preeminent climber of his generation. He was expected to be the one to succeed. He was a member of all 3 expeditions, made serious attempts up Everest's face, and his fate has made him legendary.My quibbles with what I consider sensational descriptions of the war don't detract from an entirely satisfying read. Maybe magnificent is a better word, reflecting as it does the subject. There are many stories in the book woven around the 3 large themes. In the end the scope of it encompasses so much more than the 3 expeditions to Everest. Davis's descriptions of Tibet with its unfamiliar culture and spiritual practices make it a marvelous travelogue. British imperial reach is a part of it, as is the nature of early 20th century media coverage, British climbing culture, and so much more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 26, 2019","Jul 09, 2019","Jun 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13414738-into-the-silence

Two years ago I was traveling in the South and browsed through an offbrand bookstore selling used and remaindered books. I passed up the copy of All of It Singing I looked through there. I bought instead the only copy of Maurice Manning's Bucolics I'd ever seen. I gushed to my daughter some nonsense about serendipity and the alignment of stars and the random intersection of book and reader. But the thought of Gregg's book, not bought, never went away. Regret took on its own authority. Months later I reread all of Jack Gilbert's poetry for the umpteenth time and longed for the Gregg I knew would help me experience more of him because I was in awe of their legendary relationship in the Aegean eons ago. I figured Linda's poetry would be pulled from the same well of perception and delicacy as Jack's. Tasting the same olives in the same rooms, feeling the same stones underfoot in this village or that, walking the same beaches, I thought, would give voice to the same shared sensitivities. In the meantime, the poet had died, and I missed her though I'd read little of her. I returned to that bookstore in April but All of It Singing was no longer there. Serendipity had bounded away and the stars had misaligned, meaning I had to order a copy. My hunch about her had been correct. She's a terrific poet herself, of course. She writes with the quiet power I admire. She's somehow unadorned yet cosmic, and she writes a poetry which spans both our world and the ancient. What she says is permanent. And yes, Jack is here. I'd thought Gregg's poetry might be similar, and it is in form, though she also keeps her distance and stays in her own head. Jack is here sometimes as a remembered love and trusted counselor.

In the final chapter he calls it political philosophy. In his ""Introduction"" he'd called it an attempt at philosophical anthropology and an ethics of attention in that his primary interest is in finding ways we can best express ourselves outside our cultural moment filled with such things as television, urban cacophony, and our digital technology. That it stresses the need for individuals to concentrate on their preferences away from big data makes it about acquiring freedom. Those who can focus on what most interests them find those things to be more worthy and that their acquiring that focus amounts to an education and a move away from excessive adherence to cultural norms developed into ritual.In correcting our attentional focus saturated with technologies we rescue our mental lives from being seized by outside influence. It's an act of rebellion in our age, becoming an individual, moving away from the ""wiki mentality"" and the ""wisdom of the crowd."" By acquiring new objects of attention we experience joy in new sources of energy. Instead of striving toward a reality through a representation of what's expected we're more open to the beauty of being drawn outside of established molds.In some ways this is an expansion of his book Shop Craft as Soulcraft in that it invites us to become more individual by developing an excellence and worthiness through craft and skill, therefore finding distinction through individuality and the difference between him and me.Crawford's title and what I've written here sounds like a self-help book. It's not that but a discussion of our present cultural moment which seems so dangerously to be consuming individuals and chewing them into crowds, preventing us from seeing beyond our heads and finding advantageous paths. Whether he intends it or not, some of his dialogue is disheartening, such as his writing about gambling and other elements of our culture designed to addict.

Just as it happened that the paper edition of There There was published 8 days ago, Greg Grandin's The End of the Myth, a history of the meaning of America's frontier which necessarily discusses the troubled relationship with America's Natives came my way in April. And it happened that Bernard DeVoto's The Course of Empire about the exploration of North America and the many points and ways of contact with Indians came my way recently. Most impressive was The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee by David Treuer, a history of Native America since 1890 combined with his own and other memoirs of modern Indian lives. Treuer's book was written in counterpoint to Dee Brown's famous Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee expressing regret at a people reduced to reservation lives of squalor and poverty. Brown saw a buried culture, Treuer sees a vibrant, beating heart.Tommy Orange seems to be in the encampment with Brown. As we all know by now, There There is about Indians who live in Oakland, California. He spools out his narrative through the points of view of 15 Indian characters connected by and destined to come together at the Big Oakland Powwow, one of those events where the tribes gather to celebrate heritage and a shared community. They're all struggling in some way with being Indian, and they all hope for a kind of affirmation and new meaning to be found at the powwow amid the dancing and artwork.Orange writes his characters as if foreseen by Dee Brown. They struggle in different ways with being Indian, and it's implied that the disappointment flows from their way of life being overwhelmed by the American population and expansive growth of the 19th century. So Orange sees his characters as relentlessly unhappy, tied to jobs--if they have them--with little chance of advancement, and everyone feeling alone because they're part of families shattered by drugs and alcohol and absent fathers. Some suffer from the sins of their parents: some are born heroin babies or with fetal alcohol syndrome. In addition to the occasional dialogue of characters, Orange gets his points across through a ""Prologue"" and ""Interlude"" in which he reminds us of the genocide and slavery of the past, the slaughter of Pequots and Cheyennes, just to mention a couple, empty urban lives (Treuer reminds us that 70% of today's Indians are urban) where powwows like the one in Oakland are used to remember a lost culture and spirituality but where they still fear the bullet which will spill their blood.I don't agree with the message of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee but forgive Tommy Orange's Brown-like vision because he's written a savagely impressive and powerful novel filled with engaging characters you can't look away from, you have to follow them on their journeys which flow into the Oakland Coliseum. I like the structure of this novel, the 15 stories braided together into a point of denouement. And I liked that Orange can write with energy. As you read you get flashes of what he can do.

His book is an overview of global history and geopolitics broken down into 7Tim Marshall reminds us that geography determines the destiny of nations. His book is an overview of global history and geopolitics broken down into 7 regions plus 3 chapters dedicated to studying Russia, China, and the United States. Every nation has geographical features which limit or help advance economic development and strategic planning in regard to other nations. Russia, for instance, famously is limited by its lack of a warm water port and lack of access to blue water ocean in event of war. This need helps explain its foreign policy. Did you ever wonder why it's important for China to own Tibet? Marshall explains why. I'd read before how the U. S.'s isolation by 2 oceans and its fortuitous river systems (particularly the Mississippi basin) ending in ideal locations for ports made it possible for America to become great. Marshall enlarges this idea.Other chapters discuss Western Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India and Pakistan, Korea and Japan, Latin America, and the Arctic. Some of this material is familiar. Some of his analysis is obvious. Still, most of it makes engaging and informative reading. Jared Diamond's studies of social development as influenced by geography and climate is mentioned twice, in regard to Africa and Latin America. Those who've read Diamond will see confirmation of his ideas here, though Marshall's emphasis is much more political.The material on the Middle East and on the Indian subcontinent were the most interesting to me. His explanations of the geopolitical dynamics of the Middle East offered clarity of the muddied events making the news every day. Pakistan and India are paired in a chapter. The 2 members of the nuclear club glare at each other across the flashpoint of the Kashmir region, with India's industrial muscle and size giving it the greater edge. Marshall gave me new perspectives on Pakistan by clearly explaining the tensions between her and the Taliban next door in Afghanistan. Pinned between threatening India and the hostile Taliban, Pakistan has many security challenges.I was grateful for the information on the Arctic, too. We all understand the melting of the permanent ice pack is opening up new sea lanes and that sometime this century the entire Arctic Ocean will be ice-free during part of the year. All of the 8 nations bordering the Arctic are preparing to harvest the enormous mineral and petroleum wealth to be found there. But only Russia is seriously and vigorously preparing to take advantage of the military opportunities. There are many sovereignty issues waiting to be uncovered in that cold water and ice.I was surprised and disappointed at the exclusion of Australia and New Zealand from Marshall's analysis. I'd think them 2 of the principals in any considerations of South Pacific geopolitics.

Sometimes calleHal Brands and Charles Edel are concerned that the liberal order created by the United States following World War II is breaking down. Sometimes called Pax Americana, the system of alliances and financial props was designed to perpetuate and promote liberal governance while providing a strong deterrence to the expansion of authoritarianism. Geopolitical partnerships coupled with a general worldwide prosperity would, it was widely thought, prevent such dictatorial challenges as arose in the 1930s and would lessen the tensions leading to big power conflict. The system with such familiar features as the United Nations, the World Bank, and NATO has been largely successful. One measure of that success is that the number of democratic governments rose to 120 by the end of the century. The result has been a period of 74 years without a major war, a period rivaling the Peace of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years' War, a peace lasting from 1648 to 1789, and the Concert of Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, 1815 to 1914. The problem is democracy is receding. The number of democracies is now only about 75. At the same time Russia and China consider themselves geopolitical competitors of the U. S. and are using coercive means if not outright force to reduce the influence of the American order. Freedom of navigation in the oceans is being restricted, groups such as radical jihadists are actively disruptive. Countries considered rogues or predators, like North Korea, are intruding into international relations.The great analogy Brands and Edel use is Greek theater. The Greeks used tragedy as a means of public instruction in moral and political matters. Tragedies warned of institutional fallibilities and overreach, hubris and complacency. Tragedies were wake-up calls prompting awareness and constructive action. Realization of a tragic vision helped the Greeks avert disorder, chaos, and war.The message of Brands and Edel is that long periods of peaceful norms and political order without big power conflict--such as the Pax Americana--cause us to forget the horrors of past tragedies, like those of the 20th century. They fear the liberal order is breaking down because of our short historical memory. More, America's tragic sensibility has eroded, partly because the collapse of Soviet communism ending the Cold War allowed the U. S. to assume a role of hegemon while encouraging that peace could be maintained through prosperity and cooperation. The current shift in the balance of power is underway partly because America's position as gatekeeper of the liberal order is being abraded by fiscal restraints, a general ambivalence felt in the West about the value of traditional international norms, and geopolitical pressure by Russia and China through direct military intimidation and undermining of the liberal system through a variety of compulsive means. At the same time core democratic values are being chipped away, trade and military alliances are being abandoned, and the geopolitical world, always a rough neighborhood, is becoming meaner and more dangerous under leaders who're more openly autocratic. Brands and Edel caution that only through a careful consideration of the 20th century's tragedies can we avoid those in our future....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 23, 2019","Oct 29, 2019","Apr 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40887358-the-lessons-of-tragedy

My problem with it, I think, is the character of God. He isn't panoramic enough. I remember an essay by Arthur Krystal in which he wrote the Christian God is more like the mayor of earth than lord of the cosmos. So is Santori's. For all His grand descriptions of the cosmos, the supernovas, colliding galaxies, black holes, and all the rest, He seems too preoccupied with earth which, we know, is insignificant in the scheme of things, not even a mote in God's eye.We've all read stories in which gods feature as characters, or else are represented by humans. What makes them interesting is how they intersect with accepted human morality. The prime moral concern of Santori's God seems to be with evil, the presence of which He blames man and the reason He dislikes us as a species. Even in this novel where atheism is a theme, He strikes me as being unconcerned by faith Still, He doesn't interfere in things, has left earth alone to develop as it will. This is a God without purpose. The ironic tone in which Sartori has God deliver His monologue, however, lacks the seriousness we'd assign to evil. He's a whimsical God. Even when we become aware of what's on His mind--His upstart Son, the mechanics of creation--they're what we imagine He thinks about because we created Him. Therefore He becomes cute because Sartori didn't make that imaginative leap into a character transcending our familiarity. In the end He's like you and me.The conceit of the novel is that God has fallen in love with a mortal of earth. At least He keeps His distance, doesn't, for instance, turn Himself into a swan and force Himself on her like one of His peers. To me the emotional urge He feels for Daphne amounts to more of an obsession than love. He's particularly interested in her sex life and, because He doesn't physically approach her, is more voyeur than lover. God's emptiness is a shame because I'm sure Sartori intended to create an interesting God. On p78 is the sentence best expressing what I felt while reading: ""It's all very well being God, but it's one thing to turn out cheesy stuff even if it's perfectly technically sound; it's another to produce pieces that belong in the best art galleries.""

After her marriage failed and her children were grown she found herself living in a remote rural location. Isolated, she began to realize how much she appreciated the silence her new life afforded. She began to cultivate silence as something she desired in life and began to look deeply into the nature of it. She sought it in the Sinai Desert, on a lonely Scottish moor, and on the remote Isle of Skye. She learned that silence is hard to achieve. Yet in its ""purest"" form it's almost palpable, not at all featureless as you might expect but marked by discernible colors and tones. Silence collapses time and space, she says, and it eliminates the personal narrative because the passage of time gets lost in the rhythms of the physical world, which become more manifest.She necessarily explores the eremitic life. She's forced to try it on for size but thought it harder than the actual silence she was looking for. Even though deeply religious herself she knows she doesn't want to live as a hermit practicing self-discipline and denial yielding the silence she seeks. She does get rid of most modern conveniences like clocks and phones. She keeps her computer. She's a writer, after all, and she intends to spend her days writing as well as in prayer and observing the nature and the silence around her.Her chapters discuss silence in different cultures, especially in myth and in the tales various peoples tell themselves. This includes the many examples of those who were deliberately or accidentally stranded, like Robinson Crusoe. Others chose to endure isolation through solo sailing contests or by traipsing the Arctic by themselves. Such people fascinate Maitland, just as Thoreau's choosing to live alone at Walden Pond draws her admiration. As an author (novelist, too) she's vitally interested in reading and writing and their relationship to silence. She wants to know how language and silence are connected. They seem to be independent of each other. Only death, she thinks, produces absolute silence.A spiritual person, Maitland has written a spiritual book. Not religious myself, I still accept her views and admire her convictions rather than holding them against her. I believe someone looking for God might find Him on the Scottish moors where there's nothing but grass and wind. There's the idea of vision quest about her project of finding silence, anyway. Still, she made my eyebrows shoot up at times. Chapter 4, called ""Silence and the Gods"", is an example. In it she discusses various creation myths and how all creations derive from silence. But her considering the currently accepted Big Bang theory simply another myth is a breathtaking leap. It's okay that she's a literal creationist, but I simply don't agree with her claim that man invents science to explain the mythic reliability of such events as creation and why the sun rises. Another eyebrow-raiser is her claim that the mobile phone is a tool of the Devil who views silence as counterproductive to her ends. That said, believe me, little else in the book is as outrageous as that. It's an informative and absorbing read, and quiet.

The shape of the text looks like poetry but reads like a prose narrative. Unreasonably, I suppose, expecting both, I was put off because it seemed to land solidly on neither side of the fence. I finally leaned more to its being prose liberally and wonderfully sprinkled with poetic phrase and imagery. Having made up my mind what kind of beast it is, I grew to like it, even admire it.The subtitle on my edition states what it certainly is: a noir narrative. Robertson writes an edgy story about 3 inner cities of America during the years best known for noir fiction and film, the 1940s and 50s. From the period black and white photos illustrating the book to the hardboiled language to the pervasive fatalism shared by all the characters, the book is a noir experience and impressive for the control Robertson has over his material. Adding to the noir atmosphere is the frequent mention of noir film classics of that time, 1946 to 1953 and after. A long take is a movie term for an extended, uncut scene, and I think probably Robertson invites us to see his narrative that way. Walker (he walks), the protagonist, is a fan of the film genre and notes the movies he sees being made on the streets. He even meets some well-known directors. The cultural references build on what is largely atmosphere until the big changes at the end. It's black and white prose to go with the world Robertson describes.I'm not particularly a fan of noir fiction. I don't have much experience with it or with characters like Mike Hammer or Philip Marlowe. So I'm not sure how closely Robertson stays within the genre's lines. What I read is a blasted landscape filled with people damaged by alcohol, drugs, and the war, which is one of the primary themes. Walker himself fought in France and suffers from PTSD, as do others, and his haunting colors the story in many ways. Flashes of wartime horrors reel out to Walker as vividly as do the films he admires. He watches as the famous Bunker Hill Urban Renewal Plan is enacted, the removal of all structures in the Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles to make way for the development of the modern downtown. This destruction energizes Walker's wartime memories. ""Cities are a kind of war, he thought: sometimes very far away, then, quickly, very close.""To help make this point, the final period photo in the book is of the partially demolished Melrose Hotel in 1957. It resembles bombed-out buildings in Baghdad or Sarajevo, and as the last bit of information the reader receives from the novel, even following the final words, must serve Robertson's point of the devastation of men and cities. Walker's an observer, and often Los Angeles at night reminds him of the war--neon in the streets and the rivers of auto lights flowing down the highways make him think of a city burning.The fiery image rhymes with hell. Robertson's Los Angeles and San Francisco are visions of hell whose inhabitants wander hopeless and damned. Rather than being about private eyes, it's been written, noir is about losers. And here we have a novel about the down-and-out whose landscape is being destroyed, not restored. As I say, I'm not sure this is a regular theme of noir, but it's Robertson's trope.The book earns respect. We can appreciate what Robertson has done. This is the 2d novel I've read in the last week in which Satan, as I interpret what I've read, is a character.

I love a challenging book and am not afraid to read anything. I feel this one, however, is poorly written. The content itself isn't hard to understand. It's just that in my opinion Hagglund overthought his explanations. It's written in such a convoluted thicket of prose that I found it difficult to stay focused on whatever point he was making. Many sentences are interrupted by a clause set off by hyphens--I'm often guilty of this myself, though I don't write in the rarefied cerebral regions Hagglund does--continuing to the end. Plus, many sentences begin unnecessarily with an adverb: moreover, therefore, and the like. He's redundant, too. He says everything 2 or 3 times, often in the same paragraph. The book is an annoying read.He writes that secular faith is the only kind that matters because it's concerned with finite time, the only time we can experience. Religious faith is based on the eternal. Hagglund says it can't be experienced since nothing would matter in eternal time. Everything becomes pointless without the tension created by an endpoint. His best example--and an interesting one--of secular faith is the work of novelist Karl Ove Knausgaard who he regards as a worthy respondent to Augustine, his example of an apostle for the eternal.Part II discusses spiritual freedom. Hagglund's argument is based on economics. He offers substantial discussions on the thought of such people as Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill and Maynard Keynes before he reaches the economic ideas of Martin Luther King. The main thrust of his thinking is an objection to capitalism. He writes that it stunts spiritual freedom by making necessary our dependence on wage labor which, he writes, creates the drive for profit. Our dependence on wage labor decreases free time, and the amount of free time we have determines our spiritual freedom. He advocates the economic model of democratic socialism. By making profit-making unnecessary, it allows more free time and, therefore, more spiritual freedom.This only sketches the main points. There's much rich material here braided in with the redundancies. I believe what he writes. I'm a lay reader. I read in order to learn, not to critique. I just wish he hadn't made it so difficult to keep his ideas straight while having to weave between all the flowery adverbs and the hyphens.

But then Scibona wildly diffuses his novel as if that 1st chapter is a Big Bang. For me, the novel didn't begin to coalesce again till p247. But the narrative bringing us to that point is made of prose which propels itself with the relentless purpose of a locomotive, stitching all the elements together neatly as a zipper.That relatively quiet 1st chapter, fraught as it is with an abandoned child, abruptly erupts into Vietnam. For the novel's purposes it's the original sin troubling America and America's presence in today's Middle East.For me that powerful prose is the strength of the novel. A er has suggested it's Denis Johnson-like. It is that, particularly in evoking characters on the margins of convention, or descended into the substrata of an America where most of us don't go. However, Don DeLillo is here, too. The furtive enterprise underlying the narrative reads a little like DeLillo's sinister coercions we can't control. Scibona's characters have conversations reminding me of DeLillo characters. The narrative voice compelling the characters' Freudian actions is most like Johnson. When they speak, however, they often speak DeLilloese. And occasionally I caught a whiff of Cormac McCarthy's strong evocations of the southwest, where this novel sometimes goes. So you can imagine such a heady goulash of prose can make for delicious reading.If the novel breaks apart like the early universe, Scibona skillfully reintegrates it into a masterfully told and intellectually stimulating whole.

Primarily because of his 3 linked novellas featuring the larger-then-life politician Arthur Fenstermaker, modeled on Lyndon Johnson and published in a single book, The Gary Place. His sybaritic lifestyle, particularly his dependence on drugs, is also part of his legend. He's perhaps not as well-known outside Texas. He's certainly not as well-known as he should be. Tracy Daugherty has taken a giant step toward remedying his lack of recognition. He's written a fine biography of the man and writer.Much of Brammer's story centers around his association with Lyndon Johnson. He was a staffer for him in Austin and Washington, and he wrote most of his only book, The Gay Place, while working for him. The book soured their relationship. Johnson didn't care for his portrayal as Fenstermaker. Brammer's book is gritty and cuts to the bone in many ways, not only shining a light on some of Johnson's unscrupulous characteristics but also Brammer's own life and marriage. He was also linked to Jack Kennedy through a common lover. So in telling Brammer's life Daugherty has to also include parts of the stories of Johnson and Kennedy and those around them. As you can imagine, there are juicy stories here about many who're famous or notorious. Not only are such notables as Janis Joplin and Larry McMurtry here but also the shadowy Jack Ruby. Daugherty makes absorbing reading out of their stories, all relevant to the biography because Brammer always seemed to be knee-deep in the juice. Their stories skirt the thicket of folklore that's Brammer's life. It's all beautifully, impressively written. Daugherty captures Texas very well, I think, gets down into the seams where all these spheres of Texas politics, journalism, and literature meet. He particularly evokes that common social ground where the South meets the west. All that razor-like observation does the biography good service, perhaps because the stories of the region and its towns and people are rich in their enormity and Daugherty understands exactly how Brammer fits into it.I reread The Gay Place last year and thought it still holds up very well. The chapter-long gloss on the book is impressive and should interest anyone who admires robust literary fiction.When I was a kid there was a country song about living fast, loving hard, dying young, and leaving a beautiful memory. Billy Lee Brammer did that. His biography follows that destructive arc of dissolution we're so often made aware of. In fact, Brammer the writer was often compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald, another who burned out in the same way. It becomes a sad book as it traces the broken trail of drugs Brammer followed to his end. But the man himself, Daugherty shows us, was loved and admired by everyone who knew him....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 29, 2019","Jan 18, 2020","Apr 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37863803-leaving-the-gay-place

I remember his 2008 book-length essay on death, Nothing to Be Frightened Of, was probably as good as anything I read that year. The Only Story is a novel which meditates on love and memory.Paul and Susan, thrown together as tennis partners, fall in love. A large part of their story is that Paul, who tells the story, is a 19-year old student and Susan a 48-year old wife and mother of 2 grown daughters, but as love story it's a bit familiar in its arc of fresh, breathless beginnings, complicated middle, and sad end. Barnes tells of innocence ""defaced"" by the realities of making a life out of the everyday. More troubling is the fact that the characters have faults which begin to buckle and shudder the relationship. At one point Paul says as a boy he'd wanted more complications in life. Being in love and living with Susan gives them to him. He learns that complications can sometimes be ugly because everything for Susan is clouded by life before Paul. And for Paul everything after Susan will be clouded because love, especially 1st love, is the only story.Paul expresses it best when he says ""far too much middle had overhung the beginning."" The realities of living with Susan transformed from lover to partner cast a shadow on the radiance of their beginning. I felt pretty much the same about my experience of reading the novel. It's in 3 parts, and in the middle the complications are ugly and oppressive. The middle section for me was a descent into a fissure between the bloom of new love and the luminous meditation on love and memory of the final section. In that 3d section among the things the older, wiser Paul muses on are that the past is one thing you can't change, and that there will always come a time when one has to say ""and now it was too late.""

But the best things in Lopez's book are his meditations on the topography. His enthusiasm for the varieties of the land, the conditions of weather, ice and tundra, his gratitude at being allowed to be a part of it with the other life forms, becomes ecstatic as he writes how the Arctic both takes over and feeds the imagination of those who live, work , and travel there.

It makes sense to me that these I'm drawn to books about the idea of America's westward movement as its foundation myth and reason for its greatness. It makes sense to me that these historical narratives of expansion taught to me in school as manifest destiny and essential purpose used to hide imperialism and the exploitation of peoples (and simpler tales taught to young minds) can be explained today in mythic terms. I like the history and the interpretation of realities I've known about my whole life, and I read everything on the subject as myth I can get my hands on.However, I had a love/hate relationship with Greg Grandin's The End of the Myth. Mostly it's what it says it is, a history of the idea of the American frontier and how it's been used by various factions, political and social. It introduced me to some new says of seeing, particularly in regard to the southern border and the attitudes of nativism clinging to it. I admired Grandin's discussion of the frontier and expansion as a safety valve, a way of letting the settled east free itself of the pressures of increasing population growth and the need for more land while also encouraging our more extreme elements to move west. Such issues as the Free Soil movement which made public land available to immigrants and the idea of moving freed slaves to Texas made for interesting reading.Also interesting was his explaining the idea of how North and South were reunited by the patriotic fervor created during the Spanish American War. In addressing how enthusiasm for this war and the new imperialism was generated at the expense of the civil rights of African Americans, this chapter probably began what I perceived as a shrillness in tone which became a piercing scream in the chapter devoted to the Vietnam War. I believe Vietnam blunted the progress of domestic social programs intended to improve civil liberties for racial minorities, but I don't believe his claim that the proliferation of the Confederate battle flag during that war and every subsequent war signifies that flag as the banner of Lost Cause white supremacy or that those sentiments were widely expressed in Vietnam. I've read many Vietnam War histories of all kinds--diplomatic, social, military, anti-war--in the past decade, 40+ at my rough count, but I've never encountered any discourse to even suggest Grandin's assertions of the war as a racial war, one that can be seen in terms of the Lost Cause rather than one of an extension of manifest destiny vaulting the Pacific to wash up on the shores of the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. I've never read any views like those Grandin writes. They seemed bubble-headed and unnecessarily sensational to me. And because I feel myself so familiar with Vietnam and reacted so negatively to his analysis of the war as it relates to America's myth of westward movement, I wondered if I should question earlier chapters whose material I was less familiar with. And it caused me to question the chapters following.I think the shrillness, though not as piercing, continues in the final 4 chapters discussing such topics as the policies of Reagan, NAFTA, and the nativism, sometimes violent, at work today along our border with Mexico. Grandin's arguments are loud, that we have nowhere else to go and are imploding because we're losing the ability to channel extremism outward, that our resources are finite after all, and that we're closing the circle by building a wall which limits our expansion just as well as it tries to keep others out. And that, finally, the wall admits our disenchantment. In Grandin's notes on sources he acknowledges a particular debt to historian Richard Slotkin, an interpreter of the west and the frontier who has written that the single most important point of issue in American history is our relationship to race. And having read Grandin's book I realize I've read a book which explains our westward movement with that understanding. While I don't agree with everything he writes, the fascination of his arguments still merits 5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 13, 2019","Apr 23, 2019","Mar 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36743029-the-end-of-the-myth

You know that kind of novel, the ones where the city's distinctive features are signposts defining characters and steering their actions. The descriptions of Bangkok are there: sounds, water in every color and clarity, smells, foods, and allusions to government all form a backdrop in front of which the characters live out their lives and perform their individual dramas. In fact, the city doesn't need to act as character--this is a novel awash in them. I wrote down 38, knowing I was missing some who'd be significant later. They represent different times from the 19th century to a future decades from our present. The characters come and go as time advances or recedes.

The nature of lives in Bangkok is coping with the busy hive in which they live. It's oppressive, the heat and monsoons and periods of government instability. The characters cope and hope but few have success of some sort or find fulfillment. To me all seemed weighed down by discontent. The doctor in the mission is confused by Thai preference for traditional medicine. The jazz pianist longs for his New York City past. The condo manager is haunted by friends lost in protests against the government many years ago. All of the above may help explain why I never really warmed to this novel. It's not a difficult novel, or an elaborate one. Yet I was slow in becoming involved with it, figuring out the structure and the unique ways times moves back and forth. Once I settled into its rhythms--maybe they're a little like ripples from a boat's wake lapping the banks of a canal--the surprise at the time jumps and other confusions went away. But neither the narrative nor the characters ever solidified for me. It's as if all Bangkok's water dissolved characters and their stories and prevented their taking a substantial form. It all remained shapeless. But one of the novel's blurbs and the end flap suggest memory and its unreliability as one of its themes.

This continues the thinking of his previous book, Straw Dogs. His core message here seems to be that technological progress doesn't mean progress in civilization because increases in knowledge don't neutralize man's innate irrationality. That irrationality accounts for our barbarity. Animal nature can't be overcome by our technological advances. Knowledge isn't enough to control it. Therefore, Gray says, progress is a myth. In our age of declining religion, since man can't live without myth, we've come to think of science and knowledge as salvation. Science has become the secular myth of progress which is replacing religion.The answer we strive for is silence. The most manifest difference between man and animals is our possession of language, through which we perceive the world.

Treuer's book is more balanced. He sees the sentimentality, too, but he also criticizes Brown for his portrayal of Indian life as ultimately descended into poverty, 2d class citizenship, and reservation squalor. Where Brown's title suggested a surrender to victimhood and the death of a way of life, Treuer sends a message that the Indian heart today strongly and confidently beats.This is a history of Native America during the 129 years since the fight at Wounded Knee, South Dakota between the Lakota Sioux and the 7th Cavalry, considered the last resistance by Indians against the westward-reaching modern society overrunning the continent. It's thought of as the moment when America's frontier period ended. It's true that the estimated population of 5 million indigenous peoples had been reduced to about 237,000 by 1900. It's true that by that same year Indian ownership of the land, once continent-wide, had been reduced to about 3% of it. But Treuer's stories of Indian life today show the beating heart and a strong recovery. He doesn't ignore the familiar stories of the violence and poverty once associated with reservation life. But he shows that a century of progress has taught the Indians assimilation along with the need to retain their original cultures. The many portraits of individuals Treuer presents show a fascinating blend of old ways and new ways. Apparently Indian use of smartphones surpasses the national average by a lot. I was surprised to learn that 70% of Indians live in cities. At the same time many still participate in traditional ceremony.There's a lot to tell in this history. From the era of the Indian boarding schools and religious conversion to the times of stumbling, inept Indian Bureau programs, service during the world wars, the rise of the American Indian Movement and the protest years surrounding that organization, right up to the casino boom and the most recent confrontation over the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock Reservation. I found some of this, like the discussion of government programs, dry reading. The book is vibrant, though, when Treuer writes individual portraits of Indian lives today. Those he profiles are resourceful and ambitiously active in our modern world while at the same time deeply, proudly Indian. These anecdotes and portraits are my favorite parts of this interesting book....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 11, 2019","Apr 27, 2019","Feb 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41574287-the-heartbeat-of-wounded-knee

Personally, I've always preferred his work portraying those dangerous margins and particularly the beautiful stories of the collection Jesus' Son. Comfortable with this Denis Johnson, my favorites of The Largesse of the Sea Maiden were ""Strangler Bob"" and ""The Starlight on Idaho"", whose narratives were built on the sands of this familiar desperation.

I promise I'll still like you even if it's garbage. Maybe I'll like you even more! Some chicks dig bad writers."" So we learn that early work can refer to one's writing as well as one's character. Both become central in the novel.I came to Early Work through Ann Patchett. On one of those end-of-the-year panels where writers and critics discuss their favorite books of the year, Patchett cited this 1st novel by Andrew Martin. One of its qualities she brought up is that it's a dirty book. And it is. It treats sex with a frankness I don't usually come across these days since my hormones have grown up. The young characters in Early Work are aspiring writers who work at developing their craft with varying degrees of real work, ambition, and success, but they're also absorbed in their sex lives. They even sit around and discuss among themselves the merits or not of the poly life or multiple partners. Maybe their intake of alcohol and drugs inspires their attitudes. The characters are always high or drunk. In fact, they feel good about themselves when sober and bring it to he attention of everyone.As you might expect of aspiring writers they're well-read, and Martin has broadcast the seeds of literary references throughout his novel. They're sterile seeds, however, because he doesn't allow them growth beyond the quiet reference. So James Salter can be mentioned at a party as the writer of Downhill Racer or a character can spend time reading Blood Meridian, but they don't figure in the novel.Actually, the most likeable character is the dog Kiki. Some might argue that a writer who could get a dog's character and behavior down so perfectly must've gotten his hedonistic humans right, too. Maybe he did, but I didn't find them interesting. Their characters need to develop beyond their early work....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 03, 2019","May 11, 2019","Jan 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36263594-early-work

Beginning a rerThis book is marketed as biography, and I began it as such, though I also knew much of the book's focus is criticism of Gaddis's work. Beginning a reread of The Recognitions, I thought a familiarization with everything Gaddis might inform another reading of the novel. The book does trace the biographical arc of the man's life, beginning with family origins and ending with his death. However, the biographical details are sketchy, probably no more illuminating than the 2013 edition of the Gaddis letters. Those thirsting for news of the life lived will probably finish the book unsatisfied; while biography reflects the work in the life, this book mostly tells how the life relates to his novels. That he wrote somewhat autobiographically, particularly the 2 great novels, The Recognitions and J. R., allows Tabbi to bring elements of his life to the surface. It doesn't help that Gaddis avoided publicity, never reading from his work or even permitting his photo on his books.I didn't mind that the book's more instructive as literary criticism. It really is a fairly deep dive into the intellectual foundations of his fiction, and it's valuable for that. In fact, I think it's probably a significant examination of his 5 books and of Gaddis's ideas overall. While I didn't get that much more marginalia for my heavily marked-up copies, I do think the book's comprehensive and convincing in its discussion of the thinking driving the novels. If Gaddis learned from his reading of T. S. Eliot and from extended personal contact with Robert Graves, he showed himself to be ahead of his time in grafting their ideas onto his own views of the devaluation of art or of the intrusion of corporate market values into American culture. Tabbi's discussion of all this is extensive and fascinating. He shines light on well-trodden paths into these huge complex novels as well as showing us new ways to fathom them. So I was more than satisfied, even if I didn't learn what Gaddis was doing in the Panama Canal Zone or the details of his marriages....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 08, 2019","Jan 14, 2019","Jan 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23705709-nobody-grew-but-the-business

I too, dislike it, though when I began reading I anticipated liking it a lot. My better half read our copy before me. I heard and took note of the many times the word brilliant came from the corner where she reads. She was so delighted I wouldn't have been surprised to see arms raised in hosannas or feet tapping out a lively fandango. So I began it eagerly. But in many ways the novel wasn't what I expected.I'd been attracted to and bought the novel because I'd read it's meditative, a property of fiction I like. The novel's 1st revelation to me is that it's not meditative. One thinks of the meditative novel as perhaps a Beckett character standing, muttering in an empty and meaningless place, or Virginia Woolf's Lily Briscoe solving art outside a house in Cornwall, or Proust writing about memory. Milkman is more first-person narrative, and it's more commentary, as opposed to evaluation, because though it swings on hinges of feminism it's not backed by any other ideas. Novels do create worlds through language and ways of looking at the world, but ideas explain it. This is a novel about Northern Ireland's Troubles, set in the 1970s. We do have a grasp of the events so nothing is lost when the novel doesn't explain why that particular situation existed. That there's a sectarian divide centered on religious differences is something the reader brings to his reading, not information Burns provides or writes about. There's danger, dislike of the British, ordinary murder, as it's called. There seems to be no foundation for it. I will say that some think Burns was trying for a universality here, a comment on tribalism, but it seems to me Milkman is too specifically Northern Ireland.Another surprise was the relatively little weight sexual predation matters to the story. I'd read it was a major theme. It's true that middle sister, as the 18-year old protagonist and generator of all these words and phrases is known, considers herself stalked by the older Milkman. Many others in the novel think her fortunate.. Middle sister being the source of our perspectives we necessarily have to consider she's being sexually harassed. In this regard, a er commented Edna O'Brien would've (could've) taken this material and turned it into a 20-page short story. Actually, the story was written with many masterful tones by Joyce Carol Oates, ""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?"" She later wrote a novel on the theme, You Must Remember This. Both are fairly straightforward, with the story playing at metaphysical ideas.Rather than a meditative work on memory or the condition of man, or the politics and religious polarities of the place and time, Burns has given us a wordy, atmospheric, and digressive description of the Troubles through the lens of misandry. It's a sectarian divide fueled by a gender divide. We read a novel of a teenager rationalizing to herself in first person and in language which turns and turns round on itself like a cat chasing its tail. In contrast to the refinements of Lily Briscoe or Marcel, middle sister's meat and potatoes telling of the Troubles mostly sees men breaking the world while women apply bandaids. It's viewed a little like a premodern society where the men are engaged in hunting and warfare while the women hold households and the fabric of lives together through the use of makeshift pharmacies and personal support. I don't want to use the word knights, however there is that sense of men running roughshod over lives (Damn it all! all this our South stinks peace. as Ezra Pound put it), and of women and children enduring. In a novel containing little dialogue Burns late in the novel has Milkman speak using such antediluvian words as yon, squiremen, princess, erstwhile, and misesteemed. The community's districts are sometimes called fiefdoms. In Burns's world men loom menacingly and are at the heart of the Troubles. Near the end of the novel middle sister looks out a window to see the children of her neighborhood playing in the street. The girls dance together beribboned, petticoated, and resembling chandeliers. The boys take turns at martyrdom, gunning-down, and other acts of violence engendered by enforcement and politics.To be fair, I was warned that Burns's strong vision might affect my reception of the novel.I do agree with my Goodreads friend Karen who suggests that the novel's real milkman, representing good, acts as a counterweight to the bad Milkman.I don't agree that the novel's language, delivered as it is in long sentences and paragraphs that loop over and over again in the voice of an 18-year old through repetition after repetition, is effective. It might work better in a novel in which such style serves as evaluation rather than commentary. Here I'm reminded of the Paul Kingsnorth novel The Wake, a novel of 1066 England written in his version of Old English. What one notices in reading The Wake is that the author's limited in his word usage because Old English was less supple than our English and contained fewer words and phrases. It seems to me Burns has limited herself in the same way. By having a young middle sister's voice recreating the Troubles atmosphere she's constructing a prose built to reflect the place and time. Her unwillingness to veer outside lines of that construct demands her phrases, not so much words, be repeated time and time again. This limits her ways of seeing, allowing little room for variety. And it's for this reason I do agree a much shorter novel, maybe even a story or novella, might've been more effective.As I read, it took me about 200 pages to gain any traction in this swamp of prose. Then it took hold and earned a 4th star between p200 and late in the book when the issue of real milkman's romance was so throughly deliberated and the swamp rose above my shoe tops again. The fence became unsteady then, and the star tottered a bit. I did, finally, let it stand. I do know there have been many hosannas raised about this novel, and perhaps a fandango or two. Everyone I know likes it enormously. I bow to their sharper perceptions....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 15, 2019","Feb 24, 2019","Jan 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42121455-milkman

He considers using tools a requirement of our nature. An important point he makes is that humans view tools as potential instruments and are capable of imagining all the advantages of their use, which in turn allows us to see the good in them. The use of tools encourages us to reverse what he sees as our increasing disconnect from manual work.To be sure, part of this is cultural and due to the prevalence of today's cubicle work. He spends considerable time near the middle of the book writing about the emphasis of higher education in the modern world, even for those not suited to it. Students adapt themselves to the market of institutions and are removed from hands-on work and from craftsmanship. Our ability to be practical problem solvers is reduced, and the increasing complexity of technology designed to make our lives easier increases our dependence while rendering us unable to work with it. Those employed in office work are often involved in teamwork making it difficult to assign responsibility for good work as well as bad. Individuality is lost. It's only through craftsmanship, he emphasizes, either through manual employment or leisure activities, that we can express individuality by putting a personal stamp on our work. It's best if we can combine leisure with work, what we love with how we earn a living. We can find not only our true self but a more meaningful life. We also find community because we learn the most from what we want to know and gravitate toward others who share our interests.His arguments carry more weight because Crawford himself works at motorcycle repair, which he uses to best exemplify his ideas.

Sometimes he was homeless and sometimes he was hospitalized for various mental issues. But he was known for constantly writing a book--he considered himself a historian--written in hundreds of school composition books, some carried around with him, others stored in locations he kept to himself. Some parts he lost and apparently wrote over and over again. He called this the longest book ever written, An Oral History of Our Time.He was known in New York City literary circles. He knew such notables as editor Maxwell Perkins (who actually looked at his writing as a candidate for publication) and critic Malcolm Cowley, who published a chapter of it in 1923. E. E. Cummings knew Gould well and wrote poems about him, including the following sonnet:little joe gould has lost his teeth and doesn't know whereto find them(and found a secondhand set which click)littlegould used to amputate his appetite with bad brittlecandy but just(nude eel)now little joe lives on airHarvard Brevis Est for Handkerchief read Papernapkin no laundrybulls likes People preferring Negroes Indians Yousen.b. ye twang of little joe(yankee)gould irkethsundry who are trying to find their minds(but never had any to lose)and a myth is as good as a smile but little joe gould quote oralhistory unquote might(publishers note)be entitled a wraith'sprogress or mainly awash while chiefly submerged or an amoralmorality sort-of-aliveing by innumerable kind-of-deaths(Amerique Je T'Aime and it may be fun to be fooledbut it's more fun to be more to be fun to be little joe gould)Most famously he was acquainted with The New Yorker writer Joseph Mitchell who wrote extensively about him and who, after Gould's death, led a search for his great oral history. He concluded that it never existed. Now Gould's story has been taken up by Harvard historian Jill Lepore who applies all her research skills in poring over every scrap of Gould's story still contained in letters, diaries, and notebooks he left in various places. Her judgement is that there was a huge oral history collected in hundreds of those composition books. She has seen a few that can be traced today. Her story is a fascinating one. I believe she began the book in search of the truth about the oral history, but in the end it struck me more as biography than historical work. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 20, 2018","Nov 22, 2018","Nov 09, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28967445-joe-gould-s-teeth

I've read other histories by Max Hastings and so expected this one to be comprehensive, analytical, full of insight, and wise. It is.This is narrative history, the story or events. His style is to combine the historical record of events with close snapshots of personal experiences, both those directly involved and those responsible for the planning and circumstances. But aside from the narrative, Hasting's brilliance is that he, better than most, has the ability to decode the meaning of events, the overarching history and takeaways from it in a couple of pages. These are the great kernels of insight and combinations of kernels making this one of the most balanced analyses of the war I've read. His perceptions approach the level of wisdom and is particularly acute in assessments of U. S. motivations and communist political vision. He seems to see everything clearly, from our our decisions to enter the war until our decisions to not intervene in North Vietnam's final offensive 10 years later. The ability of Hastings to make clear in a few paragraphs a complex subject others have devoted pages and even chapters to and yet still muddled, makes his achievement even more remarkable. He explains that victory was never a given for either side, and much of what he tells across 752 pages are variations of this uncertainty.It's not a military history that details the maneuvering of battalions so much as a history of decisions. And their impact. Obviously many pages are spent on such pivotal moments as 1954's Dienbienphu or 1968's Tet Offensive, or even events more shadowed, like the North Vietnamese cleansing Hue of its intellectual class. These are familiar topics. But Hastings has written of well-known, well-traveled events and made them engaging and new. It's in his telling of each phase or step of his long history that he best displays his skill at moving from the broad overview of, say, strategic planning down to individual experience. He describes and analyzes it deeply at the same time. Understanding that history is the interpretation of events directed by personalities, he includes the personal perceptions of those involved, and of both sides.As I say, a familiar story. I've read quite a lot of the war's history and yet still came across subjects which are neglected in other writings. Aware that media coverage and the antiwar dissent were largely responsible for negatively impacting the morale of our units in the field, I found fascinating Hastings's rather thorough discussion of the topic. He discusses the moral implications of almost every aspect of the war. I appreciated his views. In fact, this was most interesting to me because a week ago I'd finished Henry Kissinger's book Ending the Vietnam War in which he admits the immorality of abandoning South Vietnam to eventual defeat by the North while also deserting a cause in which we lost 58,000 lives. I thought it interesting that Hastings agrees with this assessment while also savaging Kissinger for his duplicitous role as a peace negotiator and National Security Advisor intent on getting America out of the war rather than bringing peace to South Vietnam. He tells us the story of a Marine who served in Vietnam and later became a general commanding troops in the 1st Gulf War who says the great lesson he carried home from Vietnam was ""Tell the truth."" Hastings does, I think.I was impressed with the book's closing chapter, ""Afterwards,"" the analysis of results. What we're left with today is that tragic loss of millions of lives, including 58,000 Americans, the damage to America's image and credibility, and the ultimate bankruptcy of communism. What we have today is an austere communist Vietnam now, 43 years later, even more under the huge cultural influence of the west. And that cultural center of gravity is in the South where the name Ho Chi Minh City is steadily losing ground to the old name, Saigon. It's in his ""Afterward"" that Hastings explains what I've felt for a long time, that Korea and Vietnam were the same geopolitical situation. The final point made is that of Truong Huy San, who was 13-years old when the war ended. He tells us that South Vietnam ""has proved to be the historic victor because its values increasingly dominate the country."" Obviously I like this book because Hastings shares many of my own views. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 08, 2018","Dec 29, 2018","Nov 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36099654-vietnam

What we've been doing for 30 years is seeking to use American power to spread the traditional liberal principles of our democracy, meaning our way of government, our pursuit of individual freedoms, and a market-based economy. It's thought that what's good for the U. S. is good for the rest of the world and that the U. S. is the ""indispensable nation"" best able to spread these ideas and to bring others into these systems and alliances promising peace and prosperity. But, he argues that the strategy has failed, that it's poisoned relations with many nations, embroiled us in wasteful and extended wars, encouraged allies to take advantage of us, and led adversaries to block our initiatives. Our proselytizing democracy to the world didn't make the U. S. safer or stronger. Nor did it make the world we intended; some parts of the world are more chaotic, and indicators show there are fewer democratic institutions and less democratic governance today than in the 1990s.All this is laid out in 6 chapters explaining why the grand strategy was flawed and why it's failed, the role of think tanks and media and their influence on the foreign service community. There's also an analysis of the Trump administration, which is essentially a repudiation of liberal hegemony, and why it's also failing.The final chapter is Walt's solution, which is a return to offshore balancing. It calls for a much less active role in the world, particularly in projecting power. Instead of trying to make every other country in America's image, we need to focus on our position in the global balance of power and ways of preventing other nations from threatening our interests. Walt claims that 3 regions matter to the U. S. strategically and have the potential to threaten us in the event a rival state is rising as a potential hegemon: Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian Gulf. The rise of a dominant state in any of those regions should draw an obstructive response from the U. S. I found his argument for this shift in thinking (which isn't really a shift) convincing. He spends considerable time covering America's foreign policy history and demonstrating that offshore balancing--that is, letting regions solve their own problems unless the rise of a hegemon seems eminent, as Germany in the 2 world wars of the previous century--was how we built a powerful America and established our own Western Hemisphere hegemony by 1900. He writes that a return to offshore balancing would be a return to diplomacy and a turn away from military power.I needed the convincing of that final chapter. I'd feared Walt's arguments would descend to the level of polemic, and I think in some areas he does. He can be strident and exhausting with his agenda. The last chapter smoothed some of the edges of his attack on those he blames, the administrations of Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. (Actually, he believes the American electorate saw the foreign policy problems he describes and that the election of Trump was a direct reaction and indication of a desire for change, but that the inexperience and incompetencies of the current administration have made matters worse.) In this final chapter he diagrams a way out while at the same time writing that our achieving a new foreign policy direction may not be as onerous as previously thought. Though he does admit the ideas of the liberal hegemony philosophy are imbedded in our foreign policy service and will have to be overcome....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 20, 2019","Jan 30, 2019","Nov 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37941858-the-hell-of-good-intentions

Admittedly this isn't a work of history, but where I think the book falls a little short for me is that by not placing Grant squarely within the enormous history of which he's a part, Chernow failed to always make him interesting. His influence on that history seems to be passed over. We're given the facts, but maybe I would've preferred Chernow's take on the operational plans around the complex campaign at Petersburg, Virginia rather than the awkward interactions between Julia Grant and Mary Todd Lincoln, or more detail about the Vicksburg Campaign and why its execution is considered a masterpiece. We know the history--that's why we read a 900+ page biography of a man who was so much a part of it. We want to know more about how the subject fit into it. It's not always explained how this homespun general impacted such events.

Eighteen years later, now a philosophy professor, he returns with his wife Carol and small daughter Becca. He's still learning what Nietzsche has to tell him.The return is a key concept of Nietzsche's work, and Kaag uses it to great effect as he tells the story of his family's trip into the mountains. It's a kind of Nietzschean pilgrimage, their stays at inns where Nietzsche stayed and tramping the trails around Sils Maria where it's likely Nietzsche hiked and worked out his ideas. The book's a brief examination of some biographical details and the major works, particularly those written in the mountains. And Kaag records his critical evaluations of the works. He rereads them during the trip and is eager to describe what it's like to read Thus Spoke Zarathustra in a hotel where Nietzsche lived and wrote for a season or to read Ecce Homo on a lip of escarpment overlooking the valley of Sils Maria.Two definitions of pilgrimage can be applied here: life viewed as a journey and also a journey to a place held in reverence. Kaag was interested in his reactions to Nietzsche now compared to his views as a boy. Early on he states Nietzsche's idea of becoming who you are involves, at least at first, falling into depression. And something like this happens to Kaag hiking in the mountains with Carol. His breakdown is part of the process of Nietzsche's ideas of death and rebirth, that a life goes dark before it can live again and return you to your authentic self, who you are.Kaag confuses me. I read this book because I'd so enjoyed his first, American Philosophy: A Love Story, about Emerson and William James and others. My impression is this book is a meager study of Nietzsche.

Lepore's history is the evolution of ideas the country was founded on, the truths which endure through changing perceptions of society, their resilience proven through their resistance to destruction. It's a history told through the values we claim to hold dear. The early going concerns itself with the civic and political theories which are the foundations of what America became and is. One of the strengths of her book lies in her insisting those values have always been and remain true.What I found interesting is that she shows, perhaps inadvertently, perhaps deliberately and wisely, that many of the same conditions we experience today have always existed, though conceivably in less virulent forms. Disinformation has always been practiced by political opponents, just as there has always been confusion about what to believe. There have always been politicians who displayed cruelty and moral shabbiness. Racism has always been a stain on the country. Yet even as these dark currents and others have flowed through America's narrative, there has always been the endeavor toward the ideal and the common good.I was impressed with how well Lepore writes. Her commanding prose helps to make this a grand, authoritative and poetic history of America. Her analyses carry persuasive substance yet she's best when she lets the material swing into story. She writes with clarity and understanding. I found this a thoroughly interesting read. I enjoyed being able to revisit all the old stories and personalities not focused on for a while. Lepore explains everything, every issue, especially those barreling down to influence our current day. As I say, it's a grand story. She's proud of it, and she encourages you to be proud while reading it. The only darkness is the final chapter which she calls ""America Disrupted."" It's the period covering the lives of most of us, a time marked most perceptibly, as she points out, by the victory of conservatism over liberalism. She says conservatism has won history for now, but she also leaves us with the thought that ""a nation cannot choose its past; it can only choose its future,"" leaving us the hope that racism and partisanship and our appetite for violence will fall away....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 29, 2019","Aug 25, 2019","Sep 28, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38212158-these-truths

The cover of my edition labels it American history. More exactly, it's a cultural histThis is one of the most fascinating books I've read in a while. The cover of my edition labels it American history. More exactly, it's a cultural history of the concept of cool from its general origins around WWII to its transformation by civil rights activism in 1963. There are many definitions of the word cool. ""To be cool was to project a calm defiance."" ""To be cool was a walking indictment of society."" It's a strategy ""for maintaining dignity against oppressive authority."" Cool ""suggests the embodiment of dignity without social status, of integrity uncoupled from authority."" And ""cool is a subconscious method for negotiating identity in modernity through popular culture."" ""American cool became synonymous with a certain stylish stoicism: emotional self-control carried off with signature style."" These are only a few. Dinerstein explains the concept and its many facets through a detailed analysis of the genres in which the artists' cool demeanor replaced the quality of virtue as the primary sensibility of the American hero. Music, particularly jazz, which can be considered the ground zero of cool, film, and literature are his focus. The creator of cool is said to be Lester Young, the great jazz saxophonist. His career straddles WWII, and he's considered the 1st musician to display the mask and attitude of stoic self-presentation as defense against oppression in a biased society. Film noir came out of the 30s led by Humphrey Bogart. His example morphed into Brando, James Dean, and Elvis. The ideas expressed by Camus helped fuse the thinking of writers like Kerouac and Ginsberg and the Beats, who were also enthusiastic about jazz. Women were influential, too. Billie Holiday strongly affected Simone de Beauvoir, who helped carry cool seeds back and forth between America and Europe.As you might expect, race and existentialism are 2 of the heavier elements combining to produce cool. I think Dinerstein is thorough in explaining why African American jazz musicians found it a necessity to develop cool in order to achieve distance from authority and move their craft toward affirmation. And also to avoid the white gaze, exemplified by the shades worn by Sonny Rollins and Miles Davis.  The usurpation of European musical ideas by the jazzmen was influential as was, of course, existentialism arriving partly because the French stoic response to Nazi occupation was transported from a war-weary Europe to New York City, which became the new center of western culture.These are just a couple of the interesting aspects in what Dinerstein says is the 68-year history of cool. The book is filled with engaging discussions of music, film, and books influencing the concept. The people, too, most of them iconic: Miles Davis, Camus, Paul Newman, and many more. It continues today. So who now discharges the cool we need? George Clooney is cool, Dinerstein says. So's Barack Obama. Who knows? Maybe you'll find the descriptions of cool fit who you are.

We're familiar with Mussolini's rise to power and with Italy and Germany's alliance during the Spanish Civil War to help bring Francisco Franco to power. In the story of the runup to WWII, amidst the chest thumping and the wishful thinking Italy gets a smaller story on page 4, and below the fold at that. Italy was being aggressive--Abyssinia and Albania--yet wasn't considered a threat to European peace. The mood of the Italian populace was for peace. Germany and Germans were despised, Origo writes. Italy had no appetite for becoming involved in a large general war.This is the concern of Iris Origo's diary, 27 March 39 to 23 July 40. She doesn't record personal events. In fact, it's only near the end of the book that the reader learns she's pregnant when she's whisked off to Rome in labor. Origo records the political and social events of the 2 crucial years at the beginning of the war. The question hanging over these entries written during a time of great anxiety is will Italy go to war allied with Germany? Origo seems to believe they won't. The Italians didn't want war and were confident their beloved Duce would keep them out of the one that was clearly brewing in Europe. But the arc of events her diary records shows that Mussolini was becoming more and more infatuated with the Nazis. Origo asks herself the question in her 9 June entry: ""Is it possible to move a country to war, against its historical traditions, against the natural instincts and character of the majority of its inhabitants, and very possibly against its own interest? Apparently it is possible"" The next day Italy declared war on Britain and France.It's a sobering story. Origo was well-connected, had intellectual and diplomatic sources in Rome and was the goddaughter of William Phillips, the American ambassador. As she was her whole life, Origo during the period of this diary was closely in touch with those circles as well as the peasantry of the countryside. The way she records government explanations of policy, the use of the press to bolster public opinion, the heroic stature of Il Duce's personality by some segments of the population, remind me of today....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 24, 2019","Dec 27, 2019","Aug 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38528799-a-chill-in-the-air

On the surface it's his writing about his 81-year old father, Jay, sitting in on The classicist Daniel Mendelsohn's An Odyssey is a beautiful memoir. On the surface it's his writing about his 81-year old father, Jay, sitting in on the undergraduate seminar in which he taught the Odyssey at Bard College. But, as the Odyssey he teaches, it's a book made up of many stories.First of all, a natural way of approaching his father's audit of the seminar is through the father/son relationship. Fathers and sons across the centuries united by the Odyssey is his primary theme. The 2 sets of fathers and sons--Odysseus/Telemachus, Jay/Daniel--are the cardinal points radiating from the heart of the book. In discussing the relationship of Telemachus to Odysseus, he's caught up in currents of memory which allow him to see Jay's paternal qualities and his own filial devotion as universal. As Telemachus searches for Odysseus in the Mediterranean, so does Daniel search for his father's true identity in the pages of his memoir. Identity becomes another way of telling the story. As Odysseus was skilled at disguise, so, too, we learn through Mendelsohn's telling, was Jay. And his search to learn the true nature of his father matches Telemachus's search for Odysseus in the Mediterranean.The story of the seminar is itself a wonderful gloss on the Odyssey. Mendelsohn details his seminar's discussion of the poem and how they tease out the significance of its many parts. I found this aspect of the book fascinating. I'd never read analysis of the poem, and I learned quite a bit about ways of looking into it and reading. I learned to connect dots I'd not known were there. Reading Mendelsohn will encourage you to pull Homer down from your shelf and read again.The central section of the book tells the story of the Odyssey cruise Mendelsohn and his father took the summer following the spring seminar. This travelogue tracing the cruise's itinerary through the Mediterranean visiting the locations of the poem--Troy to Ithaca--is another way of telling the poem's story, and another ingredient in the father/son theme. It's another correspondence, too, in a book made up of correspondences, odysseys within odysseys. Just as the cruise retraces Odysseus's original journey home, just as the seminar follows the poem chapter by chapter, just as Daniel's relationship with his father is seen in many ways to mirror that of Telemachus to his father, just as there is theme laid on theme, the structure of An Odyssey follows that of the Odyssey, its parts made up of Proem, Telemachy, Nostos, and so on.Finally, the book Mendelsohn wrote is an homage to the father he found on this epic seminar become cruise become search become meditation on the nature of fathers and sons. He finds that the frail Jay--teacher, mathematician, longtime Grumman employee, stay-at-home husband--who sat in the corner of his seminar room is as much hero as the bold Odysseus. Mendelsohn's Ithaca is that realization at the end of the voyage which began when his father sat in the first class....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 09, 2018","Aug 28, 2018","Jul 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40847152-an-odyssey

Malouf explains in his ""Afterword: A NThe imaginary life Malouf writes is that of Ovid, the Roman poet who wrote during the beginnings of the empire. Malouf explains in his ""Afterword: A Note on Sources"": ""We know very little about the life of Ovid, and it is this absence of fact that has made him useful as the central figure of my narrative and allowed me the liberty of free invention, since what I wanted to write was neither historical novel nor biography, but a fiction with its roots in possible event."" Though we don't know why, Ovid the poet was exiled by the Emperor Augustus to live out his days in Tomis on the northern shore of the Black Sea, the margins of the empire and imagination. Just before his exile he'd written the work for which he's best known, Metamorphoses, in which he'd imagined humans subsumed into the natural world of animals and plants. Such transformations continue to be a focus for Ovid as he struggles to come to terms with losing a life in comfortable, cultured Rome and taking up a new one among a rustic people he barely understands. He recognizes this as a metamorphosis itself but becomes caught up in one more explicit, that of a young boy in the area who's been raised in the wild, seemingly by wolves. Ovid's attempts to civilize this Child while he himself is being immersed into a natural order of the world unknowable to him before is the story, one of 2 polarities moving toward each other to forge some unity at which the natural world and the human can be whole. Some of that is captured in a passage reflecting Ovid's imagined possibilities but also triggering the reader's appreciation of the transformations taking place in the novel. ""Slowly I begin the final metamorphosis. I must drive out my old self and let the universe in. The creatures will come creeping back--not as gods transmogrified, but as themselves. Beaked, furred, fanged, tusked, clawed, hooved, snouted, they will settle in us, re-entering their old lives deep in our consciousness. And after them, the plants, also themselves. Then we shall begin to take back into ourselves the lakes, the rivers, the oceans of the earth, its plains, its forested crags with their leaps of snow. Then little by little, the firmament. The spirit of things will migrate back into us. We shall be whole.""I've read this is considered a novel that's very Australian in its address of the ways civilization connects with the natural world, and in particular with the ways in which the Child can be thought to correlate with Australia's indigenous people. I feel like these things must've been on Malouf's mind, but they're ways of thinking I can relate to only in the most general way. Knowing this as I began the book, I was reminded at times of a couple of books of the pseudonymous James Vance Marshall and the wonderful film made of the 1st of them, Walkabout.What I know for sure is that this novel has let me taste some of the most beautiful prose I've read in a while. Particularly as the novel's winding down and Ovid marvels at the steppe landscape he's come to feel a part of. Malouf imagines the sensitive poet interiorly charged by what his senses take in just as he also portrays him panoramically trudging the vast grasslands under the high blue dome of sky in his new country. Ovid's transformation into new ways of being in and seeing the world, his mental and physical journey far from Rome, are passages of great beauty....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 18, 2018","Jul 20, 2018","Jul 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6240.An_Imaginary_Life

Samuel P. Huntington'sWritten in the mid-1950s, this study of how American military culture interfaces with the broader society still seems relevant. Samuel P. Huntington's project is monumentally ambitious but succeeds decisively. He works from the premise that any state's military needs to be made up of professionals. Certainly the complexities of our armies after the War of 1812 necessitated that. He explains how a professional officer class arises from those who bear responsibility and have the necessary expertise coupled with dedication to the service. The early republic realized these needs. Most of the central chapters form a history of the development of military and governmental relations from that original concept, from civil control of the military as set out in the Constitution through the shift from an Army primarily engaged in civic projects to one focused on security in the Civil War era and after. He explains the necessary tension between a conservative military and a liberal democracy. The ideas of Admiral Alfred Mahan and General Leonard Wood were instrumental during the transition around the turn of the century leading to WWI. A long chapter covers WWII, and the closing chapters deal with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the organization of the Defense Department within the government.The ideas Huntington writes seem complete even today. Yet one has to wonder what significant tidal shifts have occurred since the 1950s, particularly after 2 watershed eras, the Vietnam War which brought the end of conscription and 9/11 which in a way seemed to validate a time of perpetual war. Huntington, for instance, notes the U. S. fought wars to preserve the balance of power. He couldn't have foreseen the corruption of the ideal. Some of the book is dry reading, like the chapter describing ways Congress allocates funds to the military and oversees them. But there's much more here to fascinate than to bore. One aspect of the Army I was unfamiliar with was the rivalry between the Macs and the Ikes following WWII. There were 2 traditions within the Army supporting either the imperious, cold leadership qualities of Douglas MacArthur or the folksy, inspirational leadership of Dwight Eisenhower. Huntington even discusses 3 great war novels at the end of WWII--by Mailer, Wouk, and James Jones--which illustrate the main tenets of his discussion. But he leaves the reader with the important point that in a Babylonian society there must be maintained a Spartan institution separate yet responsible to it, the military.I've had this book a couple of years, unread because the moment never seemed right.

I and others I served with followed with interest the ominous runup to the war, the movement of Egyptian units into the Sinai, the harassing border incursions by the Syrians, and the disturbing late alliance of Jordan with Egypt. When the war did erupt we followed it closely on television at headquarters. In those days of scheduled broadcasts rather than the constant coverage we enjoy today, we gathered eagerly and regularly over the 6 days to watch as new developments unfolded. And we cheered enthusiastically at each announcement of Israeli success, as if at a ballgame. We appreciated what we felt was masterful execution of the military doctrines and principles we were schooled in and knew ourselves to be expected to practice. As soldiers we didn't think there was anything perverse in our taking such avid interest in a savage little war, or in so openly taking the Israeli side. Today I can't remember why we were pro-Israeli. It was probably because great power support for the warring nations followed Cold War interests. Our partiality owed as much to how we understood national interest as anything else. The U. S. strongly backed Israel, and so did we.That was a long time ago. Memory is fuzzy and only partly accurate, I'm sure. Guy Laron's history supplies a mind-clearing appraisal of the war. My primary interest in the history was in the military operations. Laron's history is of the diplomatic and political maneuvering and national aspirations which led to the war (the history proper ends with the order to attack and military operations are sketched in the book's ""Conclusion""). And it's fascinating. This is one of those books difficult to put down. He writes history as a riveting narrative and one involving people who display all the traits of humankind, good and bad. We often forget that historical event is fueled by the motivations of people. Laron doesn't. So in these pages Nasser and King Hussein come alive. The famous Israeli names and faces we remember from news broadcasts take on new textures and depth. Perhaps the eloquent Abba Eban, Israel's Foreign Minister, is less persuasive than we thought. Perhaps David Ben Gurion and Golda Meir are less politically dynamic than we thought, military leaders like Dayan and Rabin less heroic. The intricate weave of event was made by people displaying all the foibles of human behavior. The story I read in Laron's book is quite different from the one I watched develop on the news in May and June of 1967. The armies of the Middle East--Arab and Israeli--were the prime movers, not governments. The Israeli Defense Forces were interested in expanding Israel's borders. Their enormous success in large part was the result of their aggressive approach to the war. The Arab armies were not offensive in nature. Their primary function was to protect the regimes sustaining them, probably still true today. Laron's right that the war transformed the Middle East. The expanded borders the Israeli generals sought and achieved are today considered the natural borders. The IDF remains the predominant institution in Israeli society, and its ""cult of the offensive"" continues to guide Israeli military doctrine. We just didn't realize all this 50 years ago, standing around, young and slenderly-uniformed, watching it on television....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 23, 2018","Aug 07, 2018","Jul 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36125227-the-six-day-war

In fact, ""The Afterdamp"" is the title of the 1st part of the novel. Albert Fraser is a soldier serving with Canadian forces at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. That acts as a brief prologue and to establish what Fraser has to overcome in a novel dealing with the horrific effects of war on the human spirit. At the Somme Fraser is blown up, an explosion buries him underground. He survives, his lungs coated with dirt and his body filled with shrapnel which migrates over the years to pop out from under the skin at times, another evocation of emerging from underground. Mentally he's haunted by what he's seen and experienced.Fraser's recovery is framed by 2 wars. Hutton uses the time between to show him caught up in the history and social movements we associate with the 20s and 30s. Returned home to British Columbia, he finds himself seduced by the left-leaning labor activism surrounding the coal industry. Though he'd not been able to return to his prewar job underground in the mines, he joins the campaign for better conditions and wages. He manages to get into enough trouble with the authorities that he has to hide underground for months beneath the streets of Vancouver, a development allowing us to see the interesting dual nature of underground as a place of safety as well as danger. The Depression years and their forcing him into a vagrant life alongside so many others is another form of underground. Still on the run from the Vancouver police, he joins the leftist elements volunteering to fight for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. And it's there, under another name and under an ever-bright Spanish sun that Fraser begins to rise, Lazarus-like, from his afterdamp.It might appear that I've given away much, but this is a novel busy with many more events and rich characterizations. I've suggested a long recovery and used that word, but I don't want to give the impression of a dark story of Fraser's psychological interior. It's not that. To me it's a kind of adventure novel, a novel of a journey toward being whole. It's a journey encompassing a Great War battlefield, all of western Canada, a trapper's life in what's left of the frontier, hobo towns, parts of Europe, and the dusty battlefields of Spain where fascists and communists struggle for the ideological soul of the country and the century.

I'm aware that the end of this week will mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. It's also occurred to me that perhaps it took that long for such an encyclopedic, all-inclusive one-volume history of the war to be published. Leonhard's study is amazing in its exhaustive analysis of all aspects of the war. I've read many books on the subject but was gobsmacked by the thoroughness of Leonhard's history and his incisive interpretation of events. There aren't enough stars in the Goodreads system for this book. If you're going to read a book about the war, it should be this one, probably already the definitive history of 1914-1918 and probably the only history of the war we need at this time in the 21st century, his assessment of the events, causes, effects, and aftermath of the war almost everything we need to know.This isn't a military history. All the major military operations are touched on, even to describing conditions in the trenches, even a few details of individual experiences. However, for the most part military operations of the war are reported from a bird's-eye view. Politics, diplomacy, social pressures, economic instability, the rise and fall of national cohesions, the development of new technologies, and the rise of new ideologies are only some of the topics receiving wide-ranging focus in the book.As I say, I've read a number of books on the war but was surprised time and again by new perspectives presented to me. Just considering the end of the war--and the end of the book--we've always read that America's entry into the war created the added military forces and brute industrial power allowing Britain and France to withstand the German 1918 offensives. I've never read a clearer, more thorough analysis of how and why than that Leonhard writes. Have you ever thought of Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as an ideology? The case is made for a Europe caught between the ideologies of Wilson and V. I. Lenin and that in the end Germany opted for the idealism of Wilson because they feared Bolshevism. The book told me many things I'd not considered or known before. One aspect Leonhard spends time on is his explanations for why the war ended in western Europe yet continued in the east until 1923 in some cases amid the turmoil of collapsing empires and the rearranging of ethnicities into new states. These are only a few of the fascinating analytical frames of reference brought into focus to describe how the war ended.One thing that sets Pandora's Box apart from most other histories of the war, I think, is that he writes without moral agenda. Because Leonhard, as historian, is forced to think--and to make us think--of fatal landscape not only in terms of the desolated western front but also of the blasted politics unearthed in the period 1914-1918, his history seems a vast confessional leaning toward redemptive promise, though the historian knows transgression is repetitive. He knows where we've been and why we were there, and he offers no excuses for the relapse 20 years later, only reasons for it. Other histories of the war are left delinquent and profane in the majesty of his scholarship. After reading all the First World War histories of our past, we realize Leonhard's clear conclusions are our logical destination.I'd say this is essential reading for anyone interested in the war. Though physically big at 907 pages of text, it's also enormous in its understanding of the many influences and pressure points determining events during the war.

He was a painter and poet and had been a soldier wounded at the Battle of the Somme. My interest in him is primarily as a poet and as the author of In Parenthesis and The Anathemata. I hoped that through reading his letters I'd gain more insight into that stunning poetry.Turns out I didn't. I did enjoy the letters and came to have a greater appreciation for Jones as a man and artist. I got the sense of someone left fragile by his wartime experiences yet more spiritually complete. This comes through in his correspondence in ways not evident from the couple of biographies I've read of him. I found myself liking him enormously.One thing I found fascinating was that he had to defend In Parenthesis and his writing of it. It obviously rhymes in many ways with The Waste Land because it occupies the same mythic space, just as Jones occupied the same intellectual space as Eliot, who was also a personal friend. Jones admits the possibility that his reading The Waste Land influenced the form of In Parenthesis. What surprised me, though, is that some critics think he was influenced by Ulysses. Maybe the surprise is unwarranted because there's a thematic link between the Joyce novel and the Eliot poem. The Finnegans Wake chapter called ""Anna Livia Plurabelle"" is cited as influence, too. Jones states in his letters that he'd finished In Parenthesis before being exposed to Joyce.I forgive any coloring by The Waste Land. After all, some of our headiest fiction can be found in what are essentially (and famously) Waste Land novels: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Catch-22, Empire of the Sun. Jones, to his credit, doesn't offer explanation, but as readers of these letters we can intuit that when The Waste Land was published Jones, an intelligent man seeking some meaning for what he'd experienced in the war, saw those experiences in close relation to Eliot's work. Eliot's poem explained what the world appeared to be when the smoke from the war cleared. And showed him where his own personal and spiritual outlooks were centered.In some ways, Jones was always a soldier. Even near the end of his life 40 or 50 years after he'd returned from France he was writing letters describing events and alluding to aspects of the military in the Great War. Maybe seeing his experiences through a religious/mythic filter allowed him to cope with the emotional upheaval. This book doesn't include the whole Jones biography, only the letters to a handful of close friends. But having come on it by chance, I now consider it one of the happy essentials in my understanding of him. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 30, 2018","Dec 11, 2018","Jun 14, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9781900-dai-greatcoat

Kennedy at the same time he managed the dangerous and better-known crisis with the Soviet Union over their positioning nuclear-tipped misssiles in Cuba. I was aware of the war between China and India in the Himalayas, having read Neville Maxwell's excellent book on the subject, India's China War. I had not, however, connected the 2 events as simultaneous in time though hemispheres apart. Or had not considered the Sino-Indian War in the light of Riedel's main focus, the pressure on American diplomatic and presidential crisis management.As interesting as the history is, and as serious as the crisis was, Kennedy was less pressured than we might imagine. There are 2 reasons for this: he had an excellent man in New Delhi in Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, and the war itself was in 2 phases, the 2d and most dangerous occurring after the Cuban threat was past. The president left the diplomacy and American responses to the October phase of the war to Galbraith. When the Chinese resumed their attacks in November Kennedy was able to give it his full attention.This small book's valuable for that story alone but even more so for providing a history of American-Pakistani-Indian-Chinese relations from the 1950s to the present. Riedel explains more than how Kennedy's diplomatic responses and quick aid to India caused Mao to suspend the Chinese November attacks threatening to cut northeastern India away from Bengal. The full history of American diplomacy in the region is recounted, as well as the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India, including their 1965 and 1971 wars, their development of nuclear capabilities, and the state of national competitions in the region today.Two minor grumbles with the book. Riedel's prose is a little clunky. But his background includes 33 years with the CIA, and I allow him the possbility that there's no need for a fine prose style in the Agency.

It's the story of the relationship of Eilis and Stephen, characters who aren't named in this, another verbally gymnastic Eimear McBride novel, until after p200. Love's progress is fairly conventional. There's the meeting and another chance meeting in which they discover they're happy to have happened on one another. There's the elation of serious attraction and a need to be with one another. The first stumbling sex later becomes practiced and comfortable. There are arguments fueled by the pressures of lifestyle and personal histories. There are breakups and reconciliations. Eilis and Stephen in some ways could be stand-ins for the characters of the Alain de Botton novel On Love which explores the nature of love and its many circumstances.McBride's love story is also unconventional in a couple of ways. First is the romantic couple. Eilis is 18-years old and Stephen is 20 years older. She's an inexperienced Irish girl come to London to attend a drama school. Stephen's an established actor with some successes in his resume. You think it unlikely an 18-year old drama student could hold the interest of an older actor with an established career and, as we soon learn, a rather full history with women, a marriage, and other vices. So did I. Eilis, however, has her charms. They appeal to the reader just as they appeal to Stephen.The 2d unconventionality is the prose style. Those who're familiar with McBride's 1st novel A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing won't be surprised by the choppy language of The Lesser Bohemians. Most will probably find it more accessible than the previous novel. But because she's still breaking sentences if not their words, it's still a difficult read. McBride has said the style is influenced by her own experiences in method acting. But one does learn, and keeping up with the chatter and what's going on becomes easier. That chatter, the dialogue, is continuous on the page, unbroken by new indentations or quotation marks. Often it's unclear when someone new is speaking, and who spoke. These features are ingredients stirred into a kind of prose goulash resembling stream-of-consciousness which drives the narrative. I suppose one could imagine that method acting requires the rapid, intuitive observations expressed here. It's less adventurous than A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing but still dares, defies, and challenges.If we learn to read her and are able to ride along at a brisk clip, there are still longueurs. This is Eilis's telling of their romance, but McBride has also chosen for Stephen's story to be told. So in a novel with one voice it has to be told through the dominant interior consciousness, Eilis describing Stephen's monologues. There are 2 of these, and they're quite long. I could see the purpose for the first, but the 2d lengthy story Stephen tells essentially becomes the novel's climax, and I thought it too drawn-out. These 2 sections are a bit tedious; I think we're primarily interested in their story together. Because we learn almost nothing about the earlier Eilis, I thought I got too much Stephen. Still, I think McBride's to be given credit for pulling the whole thing off as well as she does, even if I lost interest in a couple of places.So, a familiar story, a love between 2 more or less typical people, but told with a ferocious originality which brings new flame to stock emotions.

However interesting those answers can be, the book's revelations were a surprise because, as an old diehard revisionist, the answers weren't those I'd expected. The biggest surprise was that Moise assigned the most fault for the ultimate outcome of the offensive to U. S. optimism. Putting a good face on the war for his superiors and for the public, the commander of U. S. forces in Vietnam, William Westmoreland, supplied low estimates of enemy strength along with exaggerations of their losses to demonstrate real progress in our prosecution of the war. He even claimed we'd achieved that crossover point where VC losses exceeded their ability to replace them. Considerable attention is given to how he expected intelligence reports to him and disseminated to the public to show numbers reflecting that the U. S. and South Vietnam were winning the war. It's not so much that the intelligence was flawed, but that the reporting was fudged to show that infamous light at the end of the tunnel. That single aspect of Tet, more than anything else, explains the crashing disappointment experienced at home when the country-wide attacks were mounted. An enemy shown to have such offensive capabilities, 180 degrees from what was being reported, led the public to perceive the offensive as showing we weren't winning the war and probably weren't going to. The other answers fall into line behind this: the surprising length of the offensive, extending into summer, the mistaken claim that the Viet Cong was destroyed as a fighting force, their place taken by the North Vietnamese army for the rest of the war, and Moise's assessment that rather than reporting Tet negatively and therefore helping to turn public opinion against the war, the press coverage was positive. The book's a dry read, though.

Noir can apply to the psychology of characters, I suppose, and as it probably can be applied here. At first, though, the novel's fairly straightforward. Shirley Kaszenbowski is having an extended affair with the secretive Coenraad, who works for some government's Agency. She travels to meet him in distant locations all over the world, all destinations arranged by an intricate code passed between them through issues of the National Geographic. Now she's arrived in Toronto, Canada, which also happens to be her home, and where she sets out putting the clues together to complete her rendezvous with him.Near the middle of the novel the reader begins to realize there's a deeper mystery to Shirley. One begins to think of the David Markson novel Wittgenstein's Mistress. And so it's with satisfaction that the reader finds in Sarah Weinman's ""Afterword"" the insight that Helen Weinzweig was also aware of the similarities between her Shirley Kaszenbowski and Markson's Kate, and kept a copy of his novel on her shelf. Markson's novel was published 8 years after Basic Black with Pearls; it's not known if he'd read Weinzweig. I see less clearly another harmony pointed out, that of Shirley with Marjorie Morningstar of the 1955 Herman Wouk novel.There are more pleasures here for me than the rhyming of heroines. Also near the middle of the novel Ariadne is mentioned. The daughter of the Cretan King Minos, she helps Theseus find his way out of the Labyrinth after he kills the Minotaur. The Labyrinth in Weinzweig's novel is Toronto. In searching for her lover, Shirley's several passages through the high-towered streets of downtown Toronto is described in detail. As one who lives near Toronto and has walked down those cool streets and has descended into the warm breath of subway entrances Shirley enters, I found myself relating keenly to the novel. She captures the diversity of people on the street, too. If Weinzweig doesn't do for Toronto what Joyce did for Dublin, her love for the city shows even as she recognizes how it may weigh down some with a fragile spirit. I've made it sound dark because it is. Her search through the sunless, labyrinthine streets, the identity of the man she's trying to connect with, her past so much on her mind, are all shadows on the novel. But like any good mystery, it's solved in the end. Resolved, made clear. In the end Shirley Kaszenbowski isn't like Wittgenstein's mistress; she has found other rendezvous and has lit the beacon of her feminism to guide her....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 13, 2018","Dec 17, 2018","Apr 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35835756-basic-black-with-pearls

I'll enjoy any book about baseball. Still, this revealed itself t0 be not hosannas for the game so much as a meditation on its challenges in our current culture.As aware as anyone else of today's appetite for and focus on our digital devices, I didn't know it's affecting baseball. What's wrong mostly is a general decline of interest in sports, not just baseball. And this is due in large part to the short attention span of most of today's digital-hungry public. This predicts a smaller fan base for the future, too. Teenagers today are more interested in video games and social media than in sports. Age isn't the only demographic affecting change, though. There's a decreasing interest among African Americans and a marked decrease in the number of African American players. Jacoby cites the drought of African American stars since the 1980s as one reason black youngsters tend to gravitate toward football and basketball rather than baseball. She says she's puzzled by the lack of female fans, another group not generally engaged with baseball.She writes that the pressures of what she calls our current age of distraction will force change on the game. Baseball is resilient enough that it can make sharp adjustments as it's done before, as shown by changes brought about by the advent of free agency or of the use of steroids necessitating drug testing. The challenges today are serious. The nature of a baseball game itself, its demand of concentration in order to fully appreciate it, is at odds with America's dependence on digital technology.Those who own baseball and are responsible for sustaining its value as a game America will continue to love--the owners themselves and players' associations--are aware of the problems and are thinking about remedies. The changes Jacoby writes about are scary. The whole debate about the length of games and the need to shorten them is really about the lack of understanding of baseball's finer points by younger fans saddled with a short attention span. Some changes are truly drastic. She writes about the idea of having ties after 9 innings go into some sort of home run derby, kind of like a hockey shoot out. And she mentions one idea is to have any foul ball with 2 strikes count as the batter striking out. To me it's the end of civilization as we know it. Our current baseball season is already abuzz with the unusually high number of home runs and strikeouts and then we read Jacoby's report that those who create adjustments in the game are suggesting more home runs and easier strikeouts as a way to make the game more palatable to a large segment of young fans. This is the way the world ends.It's obvious that Jacoby is knowledgeable about baseball. The many inclusions of details of her own experiences watching games (she's a Mets fan) speak to her appreciation of the game and her wanting what's best for it today. She articulates why it matters through values. She quotes Bill Lee, the former Boston and Montreal pitcher: ""Baseball is the belly button of our society. Straighten out baseball, you'll straighten out the rest of the world."" Jacoby associates the belly button with nourishment of values and entertainment. Baseball has always been integrated with the American virtues we cherish, just as it has helped to shape healthy attitudes and behavior. She reminds us that baseball today is played the same as 50 or 60 years ago. What's changing is that baseball's popularity isn't being carried over to younger generations.

The opening piece, carrying the title of the book, describes the old Silk Road that Marco Polo traveled to China and his return via the Indian Ocean. Kaplan is an adherent of the ""World-Island"" school of geopolitics which thinks of Afro-Eurasia as the most important land mass on the globe and the Indian Ocean as the most important body of water. The geopolitics of the last century or so, since the idea was first advanced, has increasingly become more aligned with it so, to Kaplan, the world has returned to that of Marco Polo's experience. Eurasia is under the strong influence of the modern Silk Road, China's One Belt, One Road project linking them to all of Europe and Africa while the nations of the region are jockeying for trade and naval dominance in the Indian Ocean.The collection of essays, which have previously appeared in periodicals, range in time from 2006 to the present. As one might expect, the more recent events in crucial areas like North Korea or naval developments in the South China Sea have greatly changed since Kaplan's conclusions made 10 years or so ago. Other essays have been in print only a year or two.What makes Kaplan so interesting is that his work--and this book, certainly--provides many aha moments. He convincingly articulates history and our current world and how they intersect. Reading him is to learn from him. Each page offers a perception to catch your eye and your mind. He has smart things to say, for instance, about the influence of the internet on politics, how America's geography fates it to be a world leader, the burdens of imperialism, and the important blend of liberal ideals backed by conservative force.

What she gives us as answer is this book made Christa Wolf tells us this book began with a question: Who was Cassandra before anyone wrote about her? What she gives us as answer is this book made up of a historical novel and 4 essays about the character and her aspects as woman and myth. As we know, the Iliad calls her the loveliest daughter of Priam, king of Troy. A priestess of Apollo, she asks the god for the gift of prophecy, which he grants, but when she refuses his advances he punishes her by ordaining that her prophecies won't be believed, though they're always correct. A good bit of the tension of the Troy legend exists in her predicting that Paris's abduction of Helen will result in the destruction of Troy. The belief that Troy won't fall helps to dupe the Trojans into bringing the famous gift horse inside the city's walls. The rest, as they say.... After Troy has been sacked, we learn from Aeschylus's The Oresteia that Cassandra's taken by Agamemnon back to Argos as part of his spoils from the war. She's killed along with him by the wife Clytemnestra who still grieves for her daughter Iphigenia, sacrificed by Agamemnon so the gods would give him wind to propel the Greek fleet to Troy. The novel tells this old story through Cassandra. All the familiar characters and key actions are remembered. Because we're so well-acquainted with those characters and their relationships to the gods, their motivations and the lessons learned from the destruction of Troy, for me the novel was the least interesting part of the book. I like the 4 essays. The 1st two are a kind of travelogue describing a trip Wolf took to mainland Greece and Crete. She's looking for Cassandra in the rustic atmosphere and splendid archaeological sites of 1980s Greece, and I thought both essays thoroughly interesting. The 3d essay is in the form of a journal meditating on Europe, history, and how ancient Greece has continued to have an impact. The times--1980 and '81--with its tensions between the Warsaw Pact and NATO and the shrill perception of a movement toward war on the continent allows her to develop a consideration in which modern Europe parallels Greece/Troy. In writing about the dangerous leanings toward war, Wolf herself seems to take on the role of a present-day Cassandra. Last is a letter explaining her own relationship to Cassandra and to other depictions of her story, particularly that of Goethe. Though a little above my head, to me it rounds out the picture Wolf has given us of Cassandra and defines her position within fiction, myth, archaeology, and ancient history, a position also pointed out, I understand, by Robert Graves. But Wolf uses the position to look backward to women as shapers of history while anticipating the feminism of our time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 22, 2019","Apr 07, 2019","Mar 11, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153482.Cassandra

It's rich in its comprehensive investigation into his work and his manic-depressive illness and how the two affected each other. And it's finally an homage to the great poet he was despite his affliction. Kay Redfield Jamison makes clear early on that the book isn't biography. Rather, it's a psychological study of his life and mind and a history of his illness. Since his hospitalizations began in 1949 and he underwent 16 periods of treatment for his mania, the book is a record of his illness across his entire life as poet and teacher. There was no facet of his life not touched by the illness, no relationship not seared in some way. Though Jamison is a psychiatrist and not a literary critic, all her previously published work has involved the relationship of psychology and art. I think her knowledge of both fields are shown to good effect here. I was impressed with her discerning analyses of Lowell's poetry. Her glosses of the poetry don't have to concern themselves with the influence of his mania in order to show how adept she is as a critic. One of the things I like best about the book is what I think is her clear understanding of the man and poet Lowell was.

Such a long span of time helps explain the story's blurring. Much of what we think we know of the Aztecs and the Spanish conquest of Mexico is wrong. Restall calls his history a revisionist one because he tries to correct the misperceptions and exaggerations which have grown from the various histories written about those events. He explains that those blurred lines are history.In effect his book explains how the Cortes story has hurdled history to become mythohistory. Restall doesn't tell the story chronologically until the end of the book. Nevertheless, all the essential elements are here as he spends time with the particular facts which make it up. So here are detailed discussions of Cortes's mission, the famous burning of the boats, who Marina, Cortes's Nahua translator/lover was, the politics of Mesoamerica and the politics of the Spanish, conquistador mentality, and much more. Most interesting and surprising is the description of what's perhaps the most famous event of the conquest, the moment on 8 Nov 1519 when Montezuma met Cortes on the causeway leading into the city situated on an island in what was then Lake Texcoco and how what the Spanish called a surrender was in fact a captivity. And how the 2-year war unfolded from the Aztec and Spanish misunderstanding of their respective cultures and intentions, resulting in, essentially, the destruction of both.Restall excavates many layers of history and legend to get to the bedrock he calls the truth. Much of his history is explaining how the events of the past are remembered and chronicled in ways reflecting the agendas of the many factions involved. His history is a sifting through the inventions and inadvertent distortions and inevitable blanks in the record to get at the bedrock of what really happened.

But in trying to enter London on a layover, he's detained by immigration and questioned at Heathrow Airport. Between periods of interrogation and the boredom of waiting, he ruminates on his own personal past and family connections with America and Iraq which point to their own asymmetries, the dichotomies of the West and Middle East, of a man raised a Shiite Iraqi now an American citizen. Even the nature of the 2 stories, Alice's and Amar's, so jarringly different, provide part of the asymmetry.

I prefer the intellectual ground of considering serious fiction. And his subjects are those most would agree deserve penetrating attention. Vladimir Nabokov, Philip Larkin, and Saul Bellow are among his subjects here. Amis writes about literature as if ideas and insight are swinging around in his prose on a trapeze. And we like him, I think, because he says what we already think, though he'll sometimes surprise us with an angle of vision we're not aware of. For instance, while I understand that Nabokov wrote several masterpieces, I didn't realize he'd written so many--6--novels about ""the sexual despoilation of very young girls."" Another asset in his critical essays is that he knew some of those he writes about and can offer firsthand impressions. Larkin and Iris Murdoch are examples. The reportage pieces are, I think, slighter. Or at least less interesting. I don't care about the World Series of Poker, the first of the essays I was bored with. And soon after I was surprised at how quickly I tired of his report from inside the porn industry. Others are less tedious, but we know that Amis is a man most comfortable in his study. I think it was Amis who said that it didn't matter what he did in his study, if he was there he was working. I think fields such as Las Vegas casinos and John Travolta's current set are less fertile ground for his writing.Amis's strongest suit is that the man can write.

The presence of French prisoners among those fleeing through the snowy landscape suggests Tolstoy. In fact, the many nationalities flowing through the novel suggest all of Europe. There's a lot of death, too. Every death is matter-of-fact. This long column of people is heading toward a vision of Charon, in Kempowski's version perhaps seen in the novel's most officious representative of the Third Reich, helping refugees cross the Styx.Because all these ideas were spotlighted as I read, I liked this novel a lot. Aside from what I saw as correspondences, it's thoroughly engaging, a fascinating story intelligently told in a prose which is slightly detached in tone which mutes the horror Kempowski shows us, making us see it wryly. And it helps that the story outruns the Russians....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 07, 2018","Jul 29, 2018","Feb 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36620274-all-for-nothing

We understand what kind of book will resonate with us, and that interest is the spark. We also think we can recognize the qualities of literary fiction that we prefer and that make something we're enthusiastic about rise above other books. For a time I've been nostalgic about my family's humble roots in rural Alabama. And for a time I've been reading and loving Wendell Berry's poetry, much of which is about the Kentucky landscape where he was born and where he still lives. Learning of Berry's stories and earlier novels collected in this handsome Library of America edition, I knew that reading them would connect with my own past. I told myself I was revisiting the pastoral, which is how I seemed to remember it. But, of course, neither Berry's world nor mine were quite that idyllic. Berry does, however, get it right. What he writes in his declarative, magically-spun sentences is authentically country.I read only the 1st 8 stories and the novel Nathan Coulter, leaving 15 more stories and 3 novels for later. In the Port William saga that's Berry's fictional oeuvre, what I read runs from 1864 to 1941. These are stories of farmers working the land, living in the small community of Port William and the surrounding countryside hard by the Ohio River. This is small town America and family-owned farms before mechanization became common. Mules still pull plows, cows are milked by hand, and Nathan Coulter's family loads hay onto a wagon with pitchforks. Some of the stories are humorous. I felt like I've known the characters--I've certainly known people as plain yet as colorful and sagacious as these. The novel is told from the pov of Nathan between the ages of 5 and 14. A Bildungsroman, I suppose, a story of how he learns from those around him, particularly the men of his family.In the final 2 chapters are Berry's larger themes. The worldview that the young Nathan learns might be considered existential. His father and grandfather already know what Nathan comes to realize, that a man spending his life working the land can, in the end, only do his damnedest. That's all a man can do. The stewardship of the land is passed from generation to generation, son replacing the father over and over, each working the dirt for a lifetime until one day it's shoveled in your face.I'm gonna make myself wait before reading more, but I'm looking forward to learning what happens in Port William and to these good people in what remains of the book.Reading again in April I'll read the next 11 stories and the short novel Andy Catlett: Early Travels.I did that, reading the next 11 stories and the novel--novella, really, or long story--Andy Catlett. I still find it very good and realize that one reason is certainly that I'm immersed in industrial nostalgia because it's a rural world I remember visiting from time to time as a kid, just as Andy does. The novel recalls a few days between Christmas and the New Year of 1944 when he's 9 years old and his gone to his grandparents' homes to visit, his early travels. The voice in the novel is looking back from 40 years on, presumably 1984 when Andy is 49. It's a kind of still point. It's paradisal as the older Andy Catlett remembers it. This remembered paradise combine with the remembered people to form an example from which all men, no matter the sophistication of their learning, may benefit. This is much the same perspective of the 1st novel in the volume, Nathan Coulter. It's going to be interesting to see if, in the later novels--there are 2 more, and longer--Berry allows the serpent into his garden. Though World War II is angrily boiling offstage and several characters we've been introduced to are involved, the world Andy sees is without conflict. What he remembers is a world of honesty and deep attachment. As Andy is on his way back home Berry has him reflect, ""And now, as often before, I am reminded how grateful I am to have been there, in that time, with these I have remembered. I was there with them; they remain here with me. For in that little while Port William sank into me, becoming one with the matter and light, and the darkness of my mind, never again to be far from my thoughts, no matter where I went or what I did.""Berry is writing small town Kentucky as he remembers it and which he probably misses. He clearly admires the people he writes about and their lives on the land at that time. Berry has Andy express that admiration by reminding us that those who lived by the work of their hands, close to their animals and land and plants and the weather were living in the true world. Our new world, he says, is mostly theater. The world which came after this is a muddle of scenery and props which stretch belief. Nature seems distant.And now in December I'm reading the final novel, A Place on Earth. (And concurrently, a small volume of poetry to Berry containing an extended essay, The Presence of Nature in the Natural World.) I've finished A Place on Earth and this huge volume of novels and stories about Port William. The milieu of Berry's work presented in this Library of America volume is pastoral. A Place on Earth may be the most pastoral of these novels because what little conflict between characters Berry writes about has been replaced with the characters' relation to the land and community. It's 1945, and even in small Port William and environs the wider world of the war is being felt in loss and, finally, in the war's ending, even as the seasonal provinces of crops and weather foreground the characters' attention. Mostly the novel's made up of vignettes of those who inhabit this community and work the land around it. Though misfortune can occur, Berry's locale is almost an Eden and its population largely innocent and accepting. And big-hearted.I tell you, I love this collection. These are people I've known in my life, and reading Berry is like visiting them....more",Notes are private!,0,9,3,"Dec 26, 2018Apr 23, 2018Feb 06, 2018","Jan 07, 2019May 09, 2018Feb 22, 2018","Feb 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36475653-port-william-novels-stories-the-civil-war-to-world-war-ii

Her story begins with the Japanese attack on Hong Kong and continues well past the communist victory in the Civil War.The novel is described as a ""dark romance."" It's probably a fitting label because much of the novel's narrative follows Julie's romance and marriage to Shao Chih-Yimg, a collaborator with the Japanese and later a romance with a movie star, Yen Shan.This was an interesting read. Not that many Chinese novels are available to westerners, for one thing. Chang writes as if it wasn't tailored at all for a western audience. Little is explained about Chinese kinship, for instance, or about social attitudes, leaving the reader to figure it out. The novel covers turbulent historical times, too, the final years of the Sino-Japanese war and the Civil War which followed and ended with Mao and the communists winning the country. All those events background the characters without really playing a part in the novel, so Chang doesn't spend time explaining the history. I liked it that she didn't feel she had to. I thought it a difficult read because of the names. Characters often have a kinship designation as well as a name and are referred to interchangeably by either throughout the novel. Julie's mother's name is Rachel, but she's also called Second Aunt. Family members may be referred to by either name or kinship, and though the book does contain a comprehensive character list and kinship identifier, I had to constantly refer to it to learn, for instance, that Third Mistress is Judy, Julie's aunt, or that Second Master is also her father....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 30, 2018","Feb 24, 2018","Jan 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34857576-little-reunions

I believe Peter Nadas may be telling us something about his designs when on p 253 he writes, ""Stories about the soul and about social relations scarcely touch each other; rarely is there a direct connection between them; they are two different categories written side by side. At every moment they must be peeled apart. Which is what everybody does, all the time."" This can serve as a mini-description of the novel, even though I think there are many direct connections in it. I did find the ""stories"" of the title to be misleading. While not expecting short stories, I did think I was going to read stories which run parallel in time but are disconnected from each other while at the same time forming a narrative, a little like the works of the great Spanish novelist Camilo Jose Cela's points of dialogue form a novel. Parallel Stories is a little like that. Some stories are paralleled in creating a narrative in the Cela way. Other stories are paralleled by time or by character. Some chapters carry more than one narrative progressing simultaneously, even if separated by 20 years. Perhaps the correspondence could be to scifi films depicting vast armadas of starships aligned side by side on the same course, here moving through the cosmos of Nadas's novel. The stories are parallel but they're not. They move parallel in time or theme or character, but they also swerve and juke so that they touch. They're all connected in a myriad of ways but usually by character. I wrote down the names of 71 characters to be able to keep up with them. Every one is connected to another character in another of the novel's threads.Did I mention this is a difficult novel? In addition to a more extensive character list than I usually make, I had to keep notes about the chapters because a narrative may be dropped to be picked up many pages later. The end of the chapter at p179 isn't continued, for instance, until p822. Many of the chapters are novella-length. ""The Quiet Reasons of the Mind"" at the end of Volume I is 100 pages long and consisting of 2 threads, one of which is an act of sexual intercourse so long and detailed it left even me jaded. Another chapter 3d from the novel's end is 97 pages long. There are no line breaks or other divisions in the chapters, either, though Nadas was good enough to write paragraphs. Other difficulties include stream of consciousness breaking into the middle of a narrative and leaving just as abruptly. Shifting points of view are tricky, too. They come without a warning, from one paragraph to the next. Characters go by different names or titles with no apparent pattern to their different usages. It's such a long and complicated read that it's hard to contain the essentials of story and character until you need them again. And so my fairly detailed notes. Perhaps it's best to think of it as parts, even as they slip from side to side out of their expected tracks to collide with other parts. But then the difficulty is to contain the sum of its parts in your head.I was impressed. I think it well-written and interesting from beginning to end. This is one of those novels you hear about in which there's a story on every page. One thinks of Proust; Proustian is another description for this novel. Within a chapter's progression each page offers its own currents adding colors and scents and angles which expand without distracting. Each page is a satisfying read. And if you think of each as a story, well, in these 1100+ pages there may well be that many stories, or at least the opportunity to think about each page in that way. Parallel Stories is that rich. This isn't the world. It's Hungary, and mostly Budapest, and while Nadas doesn't make it easy by telling us when, clues indicate 1938 to the early 1960s. The last chapter alone is set in 1945 and sometime after 1961. The picture Nadas gives us is a panoramic one. There's much history touched on. These characters have much on their minds darting this way and that across politics and personal rivalries, crimes major and petty, romance, espionage, family memories. It's an impressive novel and yet, I think, I didn't enjoy it. Not quite. It's a dark novel. Not parts of it, this part or that thread--all of it. Every character is unhappy in some way, as if they're under some oppressive force angering and scaring them. This is a novel in which, as I'm remembering now, every character is having his or her dark night of the soul. Every character agonizes. Many have been touched by the war or the Holocaust. All of them have been touched by the 1956 Revolution. Not all of an 1100+-page novel can take place at night. At least the character Gyula Balter walked beside his pond in gorgeous sunsets. Yet my impression was of a novel taking place at night or, worse, at the bottom of a dark pit. I read somewhere that in Hungary Peter Nadas is a kind of hero and his novels revered. That must be because he captures the essence of the Hungarian people to their satisfaction, the shell of their character cracked open to reveal their meaty souls. Well, this is certainly a meaty novel. Not exactly enjoying it, unable to find much joy in the many characters--unless it's the hopeful Gyongyver Mozes--I'm still glad I read it, this novel become project. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 17, 2018","Apr 13, 2018","Jan 17, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10821772-parallel-stories

I'd had Margaret Fuller for a long time but hadn't been inspired enough to read it until I read her splendid biography of Elizabeth Bishop. My enjoyment of that was the motivation I needed, and I was rewarded.I didn't know much about Fuller. The primary interest for me was her association with Concord, Massachusetts and its community of writers: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Bronson Alcott. I have no doubt that Fuller was their equal. I was a little surprised at the dark pictures of Emerson and Thoreau. Waldo, as he was called by those close to him, as Fuller was, is painted as one who perhaps used her work to further his, and as one probably too critical of her writing and ideas. Thoreau would have been hurt by Marshall's calling him a ""poetical handyman."" However, my understanding of those in Concord through other works may explain the surprise at her characterizations. I'm less familiar with 2 others who played prominent roles in Fuller's life--Horace Greeley and George Sand--and I found her views of them thoroughly engaging. And Marshall makes Margaret Fuller herself unforgettable.I thought it not an easy read. I often have trouble with the style of biography which incorporates many quotes of letters and journals and the spoken word into the text. i would much rather the biographer explain to me while attributing facts to sources I can look at if interested. But Marshall's method here is to make each page busy with quotes. Often there are 2 or 3 quotes in a sentence. I found this distracting. Having to register each quote made my mind stutter. But this is a minor grumble about a life made otherwise completely absorbing by a biographer's ability to present such a comprehensive and intelligent record of a fascinating woman. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 07, 2018","Feb 04, 2018","Jan 07, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18222852-margaret-fuller

I didn't see that at all. It's probably unfair to begin reading a book judging how it compares to one of the finest story collections of the 20th century, which Dubliners undisputedly is. But once it's in the air.... I had expected to see some kind of unifying idea or development. I looked for some kind of integrator in Yates that would bundle all these stories up into a whole, some trait they all share, some idea they all carry. Nothing stood out for me. Not all the stories take place in New York City, anyway, making it arguable whether or not they're representative of the city. In my opinion not all the stories examine loneliness. The characters, to me, seemed to lack emotional awareness. There's a sterility about them rather than loneliness or isolation or a disconnect. And unlike Joyce's characters who know an epiphany when they experience it, Yates's characters don't realize their stagnation. But that may be saying something about the 50 years separating two sets of characters in different cities. Anyway, by the 7th or 8th story I was bored. But, you know, I always think the fault is mine rather than the book's. Perhaps there was some set of circumstances affecting my reading. Maybe it wasn't quite what I wanted to read at the time I chose to read it. Maybe it conflicted in some way with another book I was reading at the time. Maybe it was something I'm not aware of.

I've read several histories of the Peloponnesian War and appreciate how difficult it must be to pack all of it into one volume. Jennifer Roberts, though, has approached it in a different way, and one I think successful. She does relate the military course of the war, and she does give the proper weight to the 1st grand historian of the war, Thucydides and his recognition of the dynamic between states we can recognize in our own time. Roberts's history goes outside the military scope of the war to emphasize how it interacted with Greek political and social developments during those years. Much of her book concerns how the war affected society and how society affected the war. She writes of the war's effects on philosophy, drama, politics. For instance, she spends time describing how religion influenced military operations. Her explanation of how individual dramas were used for political impact is fascinating. There's even a detailed account of the trial and hemlock-laced death of Socrates. It's all terribly interesting and skillfully done, rubbing the society and arts so smoothly into the fabric of political debate, decision-making, and military operations that it becomes a whole.The book is flawed by the inadequacy of its maps, though. There are maps, of course, but not enough. Some maps are of events which are relatively unimportant, too.

Lawrence Freedman, one of today's leading academic thinkers in military affairs and the nature of war, has given us this book explaining how nations of the recent past and today expected to conduct the wars they understood they were going to have to fight. His primary lesson is that it's always different from what's expected, both by the militaries whose mission it is to keep their forces ready as well as by those who only imagine war, like novelists and filmmakers. Freedman spends considerable time describing how the countries who fought the big wars of the 20th century expected them to be over quickly and therefore were forced to make major adjustments in resources and doctrine when they were drawn out. Many wars during the period he writes about, the past 150 years, might've been avoided if leaders had known they were going to go on so long and drain resources and societies. But he thinks this underlying optimism is a fundamental trait of those who plan war. Another major topic is the reasons many of the post-WWII conflicts have been relatively small. He explains the rise in the number of civil wars in recent decades, and he writes about how the growth of mega-cities may breed violence--as in Central America today--between competing factions outside the control of the national authority. The final chapters deal with new doctrines and methods in use today and being readied for the next wars: cyberwar, robots and drones, and doctrines incorporating climate change. The end of the book is a brief survey of what today's think tanks and academics see as potential flash points in the near future. Freedman is convincing in his argument that we can't begin to really know the future of war without knowing its history. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 03, 2018","Jun 19, 2018","Dec 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25898135-the-future-of-war

However, I had read other histories in the Landmark series of translations, such as Thucydides and Herodotus, so I knew the new translation and presentation of Caesar would be a first-class achievement. I wasn't disappointed. It's a delicious read, authoritative in its information, complete, as are all the Landmark publications, with extensive maps, explanatory footnotes, and many appendices (both in the physical book and in online links) supporting every page of the text. Like the other Landmark translations, it's impressive in every way.Only the histories of the Gallic War and the Civil War were actually written by Caesar himself. The commentaries of the Alexandrian War, the African War, and the Spanish War were written by subordinates who'd served with him. I was mildly surprised that I thought the prose of the other--unknown, as it turns out--authors to be more fluid and engaging than that of Caesar. And maybe a bit more honest and less self-serving.More than the story of Caesar's military campaigns, this is masterfully-presented history. Reading the book is like visiting another time and place. It's that detailed, though admittedly this is essentially military history and doesn't offer much insight into the social, religious, or commercial life of 1st century BCE Rome. I did learn some things about Roman politics and about everyday life in the military of the time, especially tactics and weapons. The maneuvering of large units, as described by Caesar and the others, reads much as modern accounts might read. Another surprise for me was how up-to-the-minute it came across, Caesar's considerations in the field the same as any modern commander.

The idea lets Diaz say some interesting things about the west and allows him the opportunity to have his character exposed to most of the things with which we associate the old west.That character is Hakan. He's Swedish and on his way to New York from Gothenburg with his brother. They're separated along the way and Hakan finds himself on a ship sailing for San Francisco. Once ashore he sets out to cross the continent to reunite with his brother.A theme of the novel is how myths emerge. Hakan is a mythic being, literally larger than life and capable of remarkable feats of strength, endurance, and ingenuity. He reminds us of other legendary heroes of America's west--Paul Bunyan, say--but also, I think has Biblical qualities suggested by the wilderness and his ability to fight single-handedly against overwhelming numbers. And as hero Hakan's journey becomes quest. Though his brother is the goal, a promise of reunion with the stability and safety of family, Hakan realizes the farther east he goes the more he meets a deterioration of social order, corruption, despair, and chaos. Wandering for years, he learns he's safest when alone and fending for himself. There's a remarkable sentence on p206 set by itself in a large blank space of the page's middle: ""Through countless frosts and thaws, he walked in circles wider than nations."" It's in a chapter devoted largely to survival. To keep going is the way of least resistance, to avoid having to make a decision. To simply be is the only purpose. The business of being becomes the adventure. And the adventure becomes a rhyme for the westward movement.This novel has qualities you come to admire. Hernan Diaz writes prose big and lavish enough for the landscapes Hakan moves through. The novel builds power that slowly overtakes you and sweeps you along for the journey. It's a journey that begins with the book's cover, a gorgeous panoramic landscape photo of mountain and high desert that's identical when turned upside down. The photo is seamless. Detecting the point at which up becomes down and vice versa is impossible. Hakan experiences the same thing in one of his shelters, the upside down projection of the setting sun and trees against the wall opposite. Hakan's fascinated by it and waits for each's day's sunset to bring the phenomenon back to him. Hakan's experience is like ours in looking at the cover photo, a kind of trick you wonder at.

Paul Kingsnorth has blended Old English with the English spoken today to create what he The most obvious characteristic of the novel is its language. Paul Kingsnorth has blended Old English with the English spoken today to create what he calls the shadow tongue spoken by the characters of The Wake. He wanted his novel to read as Old English sounded, and he wanted to avoid a historical novel written in contemporary language. He says his shadow tongue moves the language out of the modern mind and into that of people whose attitudes and truths were different from our own. He wanted as much authenticity as he could manage, so every word used existed in Old English, and he doesn't use any letter which didn't exist at the time. Thankfully, the novel's working vocabulary seems small. Thankfully, there's a glossary. It reads like this:a great blaec fugol it was not of these lands it flown slow ofer the ham one daeg at the time of first ploughan. its necc was long its eages afyr and on the end of its fethra was a mans fingors all this i seen clere this was a fugol of deofuls. in stillness it cum and slow so none may miss it or what it had for us. this was eosturmonth in the year when all was brocAs you might expect, there's a learning curve involved. But it's not difficult. One quickly gets the hang of it. I thought that reasonably soon after beginning I was reading and pronouncing in my head what I saw on the page as something close to the sounds Kingsnorth intended. At any rate, I was reading without difficulty.A simpler language spoken by a simpler, uncomplicated people calls for a simpler, uncomplicated story. It opens in 1066. England is threatened by foreign invasions. King Harold defeats a Norwegian incursion at the Battles of Fulford and Stamford Bridge then hurries his battered force back south to the English Channel to meet a French invasion mounted by Duke William, soon to become the Conqueror. As we know, the English are defeated at Hastings, Harold is killed, and the French slowly overrun the interior defeating the rest of the disorganized English forces.These events, now a combination of history and myth, happen outside the novel's narrative line and the life of the protagonist, a free tenant farmer named Buccmaster. He's a man of some wealth--he owns 3 teams of oxen--and standing in his village. When the French come through, he suffers like everyone else. The destruction of his life and family is the incentive for his taking up his grandfather's sword and forming a war band to join the growing rebellion against the French.What smolders within this simple story is a web of contrasts. The French represent, with their knights on charging horses, a kind of technologically superior Other who dominate a more rudimentary England. There are new, more sophisticated lords building imposing castles to dominate the rustic English. And within English society itself is the conflict of the newer Christian faith and its priests competing with the old Norse gods. Buccmaster has not shaken his belief in the latter.As interesting an experiment as it is, I think it goes on too long. As reader I did appreciate the challenge, but I think the language is limited by its small vocabulary so that, since the story itself lacks punch, monotony sets in....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 29, 2018","Jul 17, 2018","Nov 02, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23848506-the-wake

It's also a novel about 2 sisters, Liz and Alison. Liz is a teaching anthropologist who joins a BBC crew making a documentary about the ""world's newest religion,"" a cargo cult called the Story which has sprung up around a dynamic Melanesian woman named Belef. Alison, the younger sister, works for the family estate agency in Ballyglass and is getting remarried.It's a novel of many parallels. Laird carefully points to the similarities between 2 cultures we'd normally think aren't alike. He equates the giving of wedding gifts for an Ulster wedding, for instance, with the exchange system of Melanesian peoples, calling them both gift-based cultures. Obviously there are religions in conflict. Not just the Protestants and Catholics in Ulster but Belef's cargo cult the Story is in desperate competition with the missionary Christianity on the island. Just as obviously, Ulster is violent. But so is New Ulster in these times not far removed from the stone age with its peoples intoxicated by the materialistic promise of the modern as well as by the friction caused by 2 contrasting religions rubbing together. If Liz is an anthropologist studying primitive culture in the field, so is a man named David Boyd who interviews Stephen, Alison's new husband, about atrocities committed against Catholics in the past. Laird connects the 2 islands, the 2 cultures, and all the divergences and correspondences of religion in ways I expected. Certainly one reason I like this novel so much is that it performed exactly as I felt it would in mining the veins of my own thinking and beliefs. I began it eager to follow the path of its ideas to the food for thought I hoped for. It delivered, and Laird laid it out with an elegance I appreciate and admire. He skillfully shifts his narrative almost 180 degrees back and forth between Ulster where the night stars are ""exit wounds"" and the older skies of New Ulster, ""Galactic time, nighttime, deep time, the time of stars, time of the moon.""

A later edition was brought out by the University of Chicago Press. My curiosity was the gravity pulling me into the novel like the black hole the novel alludes to. One wants to see what the ballyhoo's all about.Well, it's not Thomas Pynchon or Don DeLillo or David Foster Wallace, whose works it's generously compared to. The novel's too long and too out of control with pointless dialogue and digressions. There are allusions to philosophers and philosophies which serve no more purpose than the circular conversations they're embedded in. There's a chapter in poetic tercets and an epistolary chapter, both as bland as broth. The novel's mostly dialogue. The protagonist is a NYC public defender and much of the novel takes place in court. Anyone who's ever served on jury duty can easily understand how tedious courtroom procedure can be. It's also partly a crime caper novel. When the characters become involved in their caper the pace does begin to gallop a bit but then settles back into the steady plod of a mule going around a millstone.Much could have been left out. The poetry is clumsy. The letters all say pretty much the same thing until the last one. Then we see where the author was going, just as we see he should have gotten there another way. There are 4 digressions which chronicle the boxing career of the Puerto Rican Wilfred Benitez. I never figured out what function they served in the novel. And we read too many conversations which seem to have no point.I read that one is meant to hold in mind William Gaddis's opening from his novel A Frolic of His Own: ""Justice?--You get justice in the next world, in this world you have the law."" The protagonist, the young lawyer Casi, spends the length of this long novel trying to see his clients receive justice rather than law. The process of law is contained in so much of the endless dialogue. But unlike Gaddis in his famous novel J. R., which is all dialogue, De La Pava's dialogue doesn't establish motif or promote theme. All the talk seems to go nowhere.So in the end, is it good? In my opinion not very. There's a better novel in its 864 pages, maybe a good novel, but one severely pruned of the excesses I read. Two moderations: first, I agree with those who think De La Pava's next novel will be much better, and, second, I read the 864 pages without throwing it against the wall. Whether the failure to appreciate is mine, such as my inability to find a reason for the Benitez digressions, or De La Pava's in not making his designs easier to see I can't say. It doesn't matter.

On the cover the book's blurb says it stands in counterpart to the politically-focused Homage to Catalonia of George Orwell and Hemingway's death-extolling For Whom the Bell Tolls. I think Uncertain Glory more complex that either. The characters are neither fiercely motivated--no matter the slogan spouting--by the Republican ideas for which they serve nor surrendered to the futility of those ideas. I finally formed the impression that the big engine driving the novel is love. At its heart is a love triangle, and the triplet structure is contained in the triptych of voices telling the story in journal entries, letters, and 1st person narrative. I began to think it primarily a love story when I read what's perhaps the most powerful image of the novel, a female mantis devouring a male immediately after mating. (It's a novel much more beautiful than that shuddering vision.) And finally maybe it can be thought to be primarily a love novel because though taking place during the Spanish Civil War there's little fighting until the end. This is the Aragon Front beginning in the summer of 1937 and continuing into the spring of 1938, also the place and time of Orwell's volunteer service. In this high, dry environment plays out the dense weave of relationships. The Aragon Front is a quiet zone most occupied by the constant scouring for supplies, regrouping of units, and even some fraternization between the 2 sides. These are characters driven by desperation, too. They're young, the world's blowing up around them, and they cling to what order they can salvage. They know they'll never again love as deeply or have opportunities to turn commitments into reality. This inspiration supports another descriptor of the novel--epic. Not in the landscape or the ideologies of the war so much, though, because in this novel the characters are bigger than the war. When the triptych folds in on Lluis and Soleras and Trini and Pico and the rest we don't think of the bull in the ring which suggests the tragedy of Spain or the fatalism of the mantis but the continued determination of individuals to endure, to overcome and triumph. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 30, 2018","Jan 22, 2019","Oct 15, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34014400-uncertain-glory

But this another of those gems from NYRB that transports the reader into unfamiliar territory while delivering a fertile and hugely entertaining fiction. The Communist is a novel about a deputy in the Italian parliament and a member of the Communist Party, the ICP, which at the time of the novel's setting was the 3d largest Communist party in the world. Walter Ferranini is from a Communist family and has been a Party member his entire adult life. But now in middle age he's suffering some disillusion. He's begun to think the Party more self-serving and counterfeit than devoted to a better world order. Because he's suffering a crisis of belief which shows in his actions and writings, he's in disfavor with the Party. Just as important, the Party disapproves of Walter's romance with Nuccia, who's separated but not divorced. The Party is forcing him to choose between his politics and his love.Paraphrased that way the novel seems lighter than it is. It's about Walter's midlife crisis, an often-visited theme to be sure, but it's impressively rich in character and circumstance. At first I struggled with reading it. In the early going, maybe as much as the first third, I was immersed in the details of ICP doctrine and technical jargon. I was unable to engage in the political maneuverings swirling in the parliamentary proceedings around him as characters argue this position or that, let along the Communist doctrine and theory they discuss so intensely. I found it difficult to relate to these unfamiliar topics, and so I struggled with making sense of it all. Once the lines of conflict became clear, however, both those within Walter himself and those exerting political pressure on him, I began to sympathize with him. I saw him as a man grappling with issues and opponents he's not certain he can overcome.

People like Eliot and Auden considered him the most important poet of the 20th century. His paintings are well-regarded and treasured. He was an excellent engraver who learned the craft from the famous Eric Gill. I think he'd consider soldier the least important as well as the least desirable of his distinctions and would've been happy to forget his experiences during the Great War. Whatever reasons Dilworth had for arranging them in this order, Jones was certainly all of them.The book itself is a delightful thing to read. Aside from the comprehensive study of Jones as artist and poet, it's full of color reproductions of his most important drawings, watercolors, and inscriptions. To return to this beautiful book each day and to hold it in my lap and turn the pages revealing the art woven into the printed account of his life was a pleasure.He was a fascinating man, and he wrote 2 of the most significant expressions of myth in the language, which is my primary interest in him. Dilworth fills his telling of the life with wonderful stories. One I liked was the visit by Auden, the celebrity, to meet the more monkish Jones, another of Jones having to correct the awe-inspiring and upright Eliot who wanted to call him Davy. I smiled at Dilworth's writing that David Jones was no Davy. Interesting, too, was his early decision to forego marriage for the sake of his art. But he was strongly and romantically drawn to several women in his life without, apparently, entering into a relationship with them.Reading Dilworth has inspired me into another--3d? 4th?--reading of In Parenthesis. I'm reminded of the critic Frederick Turner's comment that in postmodernism we find only yesterday's newspaper, but for wisdom we have to return to tradition, and it's there that we find David Jones. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 06, 2018","Mar 26, 2018","Aug 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5317906-david-jones

Now he'Tom Nichols first wrote about the increased acceptance of ignorance in the west in a 2013 blog post and later in an article in The Federalist. Now he's expanded his ideas into a book which tries to explain why the advice of experts is debunked and resented, why Americans are often not only misinformed but ""aggressively wrong,"" and why access to so much information has led to a widespread belief that knowledge is easily attained through tablets and phones, therefore making everyone as smart as experts. He discusses how the growing problem has come about through almost universal use of the Internet itself creating an atmosphere where interaction between individuals is becoming less frequent, meaning less discourse and cross-pollination of ideas, or even thought. The Internet gives us an enormous amount of information many consider knowledge. Higher education has become consumer-oriented as more and more people seek degrees. Institutions compete for the tuitions of the masses attending college today, and that competition means student bodies, as customers, are always right. As a result, adulthood is essentially postponed while at the same time students aren't challenged and graduate believing themselves educated and knowing more than they actually do. Competition is also at fault in today's journalism. News markets compete for viewers by catering to specific groups wanting specific slants. That and the glut of news that tells people what they want to hear is actually making the people of the west less informed. This is a terribly interesting book which helps verbalize the dumbing down of the west we see occurring around us and attempts to explain why....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 26, 2017","Aug 16, 2017",,Pocket Book,view (with text),/book/show/26720949-the-death-of-expertise

He calls it The Accidental Life because he began his career as a photographer. Instead of following a straight path, though, as he describes it, he tried writing a novel, tried making a documentary film. Nothing was working until he became a combination reporter/editor at San Francisco Magazine. In the years since he's worked on and edited some of the biggest magazines in America, including Sports Illustrated, Rolling Stone, Esquire, and Newsweek. For me the chapters on writers are the most interesting parts of the book. McDonell's accidental editing life has allowed him to become friends with and swim in the same currents as some of America's best writers. His material on them is richly anecdotal and honest. He has many wonderful stories about each, about what it's like to spend time with them, about how they approach writing, particularly for his magazines. Here are chapters about playing golf with Hunter S. Thompson and hunting with Richard Ford and fishing with Jim Harrison. But Peter Matthiessen is here, and so is James Salter, George Plimpton, and Thomas McGuane along with a generous broadcasting of others we're familiar with. I didn't know, for instance, that Jimmy Buffett can write, but McDonell likes his work very much. All these people are friends, too, and so they're fondly remembered and written about, even their warts. My sense is that this kind of remembering of writers he's known and worked with accounts for over half of the book.

I'm not a particular fan of the noir genre, though I've read a few in recent years I liked. Here I thought the language stilted and sounding like the dialogue from a 1930s movie. Originally published in 1947, I think it hasn't aged well, unable in 2018 to overcome some archaic language. However, the ""Afterword"" by Megan Abbott offers sharp perspectives. This novelist and authority on the hard-boiled genre is able to pinpoint the extent to which paranoia and misogyny drive the crime fiction we call noir. This is especially true of the postwar novels, such as In a Lonely Place, which consider men who feel emasculated by the return home following the war and having to adjust to a life without a sense of wartime power and excitement. Corralled by the need to return to domesticity, women are to blame. Despite Girl Fridays and femme fatales, noir, according to her, has always skated along the knife edge of the threat some men think women pose.

The strength of Walls's portrait of Thoreau is that she writes him as a man who knew some things about how water flows and about birds, who understood the leaf and the way of squirrels, but who was still humbled by the natural world. Her book is the biography of a rather unaffected man who spent his whole life observing the details of the surroundings he inhabited, mostly around Concord, his home, but he also knew Maine and Cape Cod well and even made a trip as far as Minnesota near the end of his life. What impressed me is she allows him to be a citizen of Concord like any other, a man who worked at making pencils or surveying land or helping neighbors, even as he was always studying berries or ducks.She says she wrote the biography because the life she sought, that of Thoreau the writer, was not in any book. So she wrote this life. It does emphasize his writing. She says Thoreau wanted to be taken seriously as a writer, to be admired for his work in the same ways Emerson was admired. She describes how hard he worked at it, publishing 2 books and many essays in his lifetime. I'd not known before how much he wrote for magazines or how many lectures he wrote to give before gatherings in the region. I'd not understood before how intensely he wanted to be known for his poetry and how deeply disappointed he was when he wasn't. His successes were in the book Walden and in his essays. And the Journal which became famous after his death.This biography goes with others I have to help form a more whole picture of the man. I doubt it completes him. It is a comprehensive look at Thoreau the writer. The earlier biographer I most admire, Robert D. Richardson, wrote such a lengthy and glowing blurb for Walls's book that anyone reading it has to acknowledge that she does justice to her subject....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 07, 2017","Oct 19, 2017","Jul 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31939387-henry-david-thoreau

Much more in depth lives of Churchill and Orwell have been written. Each of them suffers here for having to share the 270 pages of text. At the same time Ricks too often clutters the slender biographies in condescending unimportant additions and asides which the reader already understands. Essentially it focuses on how they individually experienced the 1930s, the subsequent war, and how those experiences affected their own worldview and the perceptions of those reading their work. If the narrative of the lives isn't adorned enough it does tackle the complexities of the 2 men: Churchill's complicated wartime relations with America and his fingerhold on empire alongside how Orwell developed a distrust for all forms of government.There are clumsinesses here brought about by omissions. At the same time there's some fine history and analysis. The section describing fascist sympathies in Britain during the interwar period, a subject I know little about, is fascinating. Ricks's account of the postwar years is equally engaging.

He reflects that what he sees through his telescope is not only fire but also the past, the light having taken uncountable years to reach him. Down below his tenants--priest, neurosurgeon, naturalist, photographer, schoolboy, and traveler--sleep. Each of them has a chapter in the novel which follows, their stories heavily weighted with memory and the past light which shined on what defines them. The landlord's meditations on fire and the past act as the spark setting the novel alight. It's more than that, though, because in the basement an undetected fire has begun inside a wall. The house is on fire.As the individual stories of the 6 tenants are unfolded, many parallels come to light. Memory plays a part of every story, each being set in the past. Loss of memory is a concern, whether cannabis-induced in the photographer's case or surgically extracted by the neurosurgeon's removal of a brain tumor. Some of the later stories incorporate elements that allude to situations or characters in earlier stories, as the actress Linda in the photographer's story playing the part of a lesbian biologist recalls an important character in the naturalist's memory. The burning smell often experienced by epileptics, butterflies, and death by hanging are repeated. The layering and accumulation of themes build into the traveler's story where he remembers viewing cremations at the ghats alongside the Ganges in Varanasi. As the heads of the dead burst in the fire, as brains are spilled to flow into the Ganges, memory is released and the fire destroying the bodies is equated with the fire destroying the house. It's a terrible beauty framed in the end when the final landlord section unites all the themes and characters of the novel. This has been described as Thubron's masterpiece.

Kleinzahler is a poet and critic and so writes conThis is an engaging collection of essays which were mostly published in the London Review of Books. Kleinzahler is a poet and critic and so writes convincingly about the craft and about the poets of our time. However, some of what he writes is surprising. He says, for instance, that E. E. Cummings is not only over-valued as a poet but that many of his poems are simply bad. I've read the charge before, though stated more softly as Cummings not always choosing his strongest work to publish. But Kleinzahler is on the attack here, and I thought him a bit unfair. One thinks of Cummings as a lyrical poet, and I think to not judge him from that angle is to miss the mark. A little sally and romp of my own. I recently read a small volume of Cummings called Erotic Poems (they are that, I was in the mood, and I was delighted with them) and was reminded that few can write about love so breathtakingly as Cummings did. Kleinzahler is also savage with Richard Brautigan. I'm not familiar with his work and so can't defend him.If a defense is even needed, because, as I say, Kleinzahler writes convincingly about poetry and poets. He heaps praise on people like Lorine Niedecker, James Merrill, and Christopher Logue as well as many others. But one of the strengths of the individual essays is that the larger names of poetry keep recurring and help to make this a collection about contemporary poetry. Ezra Pound is a star here, and so is Robert Lowell. Also running through these essays is Kleinzahler's home, San Francisco. Perhaps you know as well as I do, it's lovely, and he clearly loves it and loves to write about the city and its well-known poets. His essay on Thom Gunn is one of the best in the collection. That particular piece about his long friendship with Gunn, a longtime resident of San Francisco, is a personal essay. A couple of the best essays are personal, too, one about working in Alaska as a young man and 2 love letters to San Francisco. One of the essays, and a strong favorite, serves as both personal essay and as criticism, his account of lunching with Allen Ginsberg. It's a portrait of Ginsberg I've never come across before but which I don't doubt is an accurate portrait. Ginsberg as something other than poet, legend, Beatnik. Why, he's almost cuddly.He ends with a nostalgic essay about the Palisades section of New Jersey where he lived as a kid. Maybe he'd been working himself east the whole time, stopping in Wisconsin to look at Niedecker and again for lunch with Allen before visiting his old home. Maybe it's a frame, the opposite coasts. He'd begun with a description of thick San Francisco fog and ends with the clear autumn air above the New Jersey Palisades, air so clear he can see his whole boyhood. In between is good literary traveling. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Nov 2017,"Nov 11, 2017","Jul 16, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31451137-sallies-romps-portraits-and-send-offs

He cut and arranged the pieces into the 26 poems which make up his ""Injun."" It's followed by a section of ""Notes,"" and that by an ""Appendix."" The ""Injun"" section is the most accessible, where his plan and meaning is most plainly shown in phrases displaying racism and injustice and colonialist attitudes. The 2 final sections were harder to understand, and their disjointed character made less music.The book was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize this year and I heard Abel read from it on 7 Jun. His reading was as experimentally difficult as his text. He broadcast his reading somehow from a computer in an act of performance art. It began normally but then began to be more than one line or one poem read together and overlapping. Increasingly added lines and poems ran together to make a cacophony of echoed phrases merging into an incomprehensible babble of sounds and a wall of indistinguishable words. It helps to know that Abel is of the Nisga'a peoples from British Columbia and that he's a PhD candidate researching digital humanities and indigenous literary studies.His book Injun won the Griffin Poetry Prize as the most outstanding volume of Canadian poetry of the year. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 12, 2017","Jul 02, 2017","Jun 08, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26196111-injun

S. competition in the western Pacific, Destined for War vies with Christopher Coker's The Improbable War as being the most scholarly. Both rely heavily on history for their analysis of the present.All I've been reading refers to what's called the Thucydides Trap, the phenomenon existing when a ruling power is threatened with displacement by a rising power. The situation, which is how all these analysts view the current China-U. S. rivalry in the Pacific, usually slides into war, as did the rivalry between Sparta and Athens 2500 years ago, famously recorded by Thucydides.Allison is more pessimistic than most. He says for the west there's no solution to the China challenge, no solution to the reawakening of a civilization 5000 years old with a current population of one and a half billion. The history Allison sees in the Pacific revives Samuel Huntington's ""clash of civilizations."" He sees the cultural and ideological gap between the two that far apart. And the rivalry is only the latest in a string of 16 Thucydides Trap situations which have arisen since the 15th century. Twelve times the opposing sides have resorted to war. Like Christopher Coker, Allison sees many analogies between the current Asia and the period in Europe preceding WWI. We can stumble into war through a combination of fear and miscalculation. But he sees America's greatest opportunity resembling that of the British at the start of the 20th century when they saw they couldn't match the potential power of America in the western hemisphere and accommodated the U. S.'s rise in order to address challenges in other parts of the globe. This is one way of avoiding conflict in the Pacific. Another is some kind of bargain, a trading of interests, which will allow the two to share responsibilities in the western Pacific. Allison doubts it's in America's character to yield, and he thinks China too embittered by her historical grievances against the west to forgo becoming the outright hegemon.Destined for War seems to assemble most of the ideas I've come across concerning the great geopolitical rivalry in Asia and places them in the context of the last 600 years of history.

The big piCarroll's book is ambitious, and ultimately it's impressive because he achieves--at least as far as I can determine--what he set out to do. The big picture is the nature of reality explained by contemporary science. He describes how the universe works in every scale from the cosmic to the quantum and how the current understanding of such elemental foundations make clear concepts like the arrow of time and entropy and unite in our heads as consciousness and language and even notions of morality.Intended for the layperson, like me, some of his book is necessarily spent explaining how to think about the science and the phenomena he describes. Many of these ideas are head-splittingly knotty. The diagrams and charts are helpful, sometimes even clarifying a text too difficult for my knowledge and experience to grasp. Working forward and downward from the Big Bang and cosmic scale to the mysteries of quantum mechanics he details existence as we know it today. Sometimes it was like trying to understand magic. Existence may be a human perception, but Carroll still had to explain how consciousness is a physical process defined by the activity and motion of quantum particles and how ultimately all of it affects such philosophical ideas as determinism, causality, and free will.This was a difficult read for someone like me who doesn't have a background in science. But I rode this beautiful, muscular animal of a book, clinging to it, refusing to be bucked off. And by the time Carroll got to consciousness I felt like I knew how to ride a little bit.

He's written a terrific book about baseball and about the Mark Kingwell is a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto and a baseball fan. He's written a terrific book about baseball and about the philosophic tones it's always inspired, from The Simpsons (referenced more than once here) to A. Bartlett Giamatti. This isn't the 1st book about the obvious kinship between philosophy and baseball, nor is it the 1st by a professional philosopher, but I may have liked this the best because it not only addresses the game academically but also nostalgically, historically, morally, and poetically as well as memorially. Kingwell writes about what the game means to him personally as a philosopher and as a lifetime fan. I found myself questioning at times if it's a book about baseball or a book about philosophy. And the answer is both, but mostly about baseball, particularly as it applies to life, Kingwell's and ours. So there is heavy discourse on the balk considered in the light of Aristotelian or Galilean physics or striking out seen through Hume's formulation of moderate scarcity or how Kant's Critique of Judgment anticipated the aesthetic beauty of baseball. But these are balanced by Kingwell's own personal experiences as a fan and reflection pulled from his vast knowledge of the game and those who've played it. Despite his assertions of baseball as transcendence and the ball park as spacetime, he manages to show us everything else baseball is and how it fits into our lives.His great theme is that of failure, that baseball shows us that even by failing most of the time--as, famously, getting only 3 base hits in 10 at-bats--we realize great success. But in such failing we learn that failure always carries a vision of perfection. Ultimately, it's how baseball as well as the lives we lead matter, by using failure as inspiration to achieve better and to change our lives. He agrees with others that baseball possesses Zen qualities. Early in the book he writes about the Zen archer and effortless excellence. Near the end he shows us a Zen archer, Ichiro Suzuki, an outfielder capable of laser-accurate bullet throws from right field to 3d or home. He once commented on a throw-out at 3d base, ""The ball was hit right to me. Why did he run when I was going to throw him out?"" At the end he brings us to the notion of ""purposiveness without purpose,"" that baseball only means the beauty we derive from it. ""Baseball is just baseball...and entirely without purpose. Baseball achieves nothing. That is why it is so important.""

I thought it a verse novel, a form and idea which interests me. I later read somewhere that it's more a series of episodes rather than a narrative of lives lived. It's true the poems center around one small town, Cold Springs, Alabama, between the years 1950 and 2015. It's true they relate the actions of 6 characters who rise from boyhood to manhood there. But Jones has decided against the sequential narrative. Instead he tells his story in what he calls portals into memory and the past as they wash forward and backward in time. ""It is a portal or it is a switchboard,"" he explains at the very beginning. ""A big party line, each must wait a turn.""As the boys grow into men and age, the poems--there are 110 of them in the 9 sections--concern themselves with America during the postwar years and reflect the events that colored all our perspectives: the Cold War, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, 9/11. They reflect, too, all the individual passages of love and growing up, the loss and accomplishment we all experience. That itself, the dedication of the poems collectively to an expression of America viewed from a small Southern town, is impressive. I can't recall it being done before in verse, though I may be ignorant of other work sharing the theme. What also makes an imprint in the mind of the reader is the variety of verse forms Jones uses. Most often in quatrains and couplets and most often a pentameter line, he sometimes switches to a prose poem or ""postcard critiques"" or Facebook posts. For fun, there's even an abecedarium.Because it's interesting, because it's impressive, and because its density requires more examination, I'll be returning to the book. But this 1st reading kinda upended my own bias. I often struggle with stories about children. In general I find them less interesting as characters than adults. But I thought the 6 characters inhabiting Jones's poems to be more interesting as boys. I'm not sure what this says about Village Prodigies or about my tastes as a reader. A return to Cold Springs in a couple of years will tell me more about the book and about my reaction to it.

She was a student of Bishop's during the timeMegan Marshall has written a beautiful combination of personal memoir and biography of Elizabeth Bishop. She was a student of Bishop's during the time of her lecturing at Harvard and also studied under Bishop's close friend Robert Lowell as well as Robert Fitzgerald, lovingly recollected here. She was unsuccessful in Bishop's course and turned away from poetry to eventually become an accomplished biographer, evidenced by her earlier Pulitzer Prize-winning Margaret Fuller: A New American Life and this, her fascinating brew of memoir in the shadow of Bishop and exhaustive biography of her.The title informs her structure. It comes from a sestina Bishop wrote in the mid-1930s, a form of 6 stanzas and 39 lines re-using the end words in the place of rhyme. A final 3-line stanza uses 2 of the end words in each line. Her biography of Bishop is in 6 chapters titled after the end words of the poem ""A Miracle for Breakfast"" followed by an envoy, or afterword. The spaces between the chapters is filled with her memories of how she connected with the poet over the years of study, trying to become a poet and writer in her own right.Everyone around Bishop during her life receives attention, one of the facets of the book making it such an engaging read. Bishop had close relationships with not only Lowell but Frank Bidart, Marianne Moore, James Merrill, and others. But the whole story's here, her alcoholism, the intervals of awkward teaching, the need for her analyst Anny Baumann, her years famously spent in Brazil with Lota de Macedo Soares, lesbianism and her attitudes toward the gay rights activism of her later years. In fact, Marshall spends a lot of time chronicling Bishop's love life in greater detail than I've encountered before. Of course the poetry is discussed, too, particularly in the ways it originated from the events of her life. If Marshall herself couldn't write poetry and even failed at a job as first reader of poetry submissions at the Atlantic, she seems to have understood Bishop's well.I've read other available biographies of Bishop but think this may be an advance on them. Marshall claims to have had access to some papers locked away until after the death of Alice Methfessel, Bishop's last lover, in 2009. At least there is information and perspective here I was unaware of, and for that reason I'm tempted to say that in her quiet, admiring book Marshall has added to the scholarship on Bishop. She's given us a fine read about an interesting poet, and she's won my own quiet admiration, enough that I was inspired to dig out my unread copy of Margaret Fuller: A New American Life and put it in a place of prominence, assured of another good read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 20, 2017","Jul 17, 2017","Apr 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28114416-elizabeth-bishop

S. and the realCrouching Tiger is the 4th book I've completed this spring to help inform me about the increasing competition between China and the U. S. and the real dangers of conflict in the western Pacific. Peter Navarro's focus is on the military buildup underway in China and their usurping of scattered island groups in order to create a defensive shield, all of it made possible by their huge economic gains in the last 25 or 30 years. Navarro writes what everyone else is writing, or at least what I'm reading. There's a concern that a real danger of conflict exists. But Crouching Tiger is organized differently than other studies. It's presented in short chapters, each of them dealing with a specific issue--military budgets, for instance, or the feasibility of a ""grand bargain"" with China. The chapters begin with questions which the text answers. As you might expect, this use of concisely written explanations to specific questions (there are 45 of them) neatly isolates the many issues and makes their understanding easier. His assessment, like the others I've read and am reading, is sobering. The Chinese sense of having endured a century of humiliation at the hands of the west coupled with the American unwillingness to give up its primacy as the leader of liberal order in the western Pacific may make some kind of confrontation inevitable. He spends some time discussing the now famous Thucydidean Trap, the idea 1st written about 2500 years ago during the Peloponnesian War in which an established power (Sparta) resists the rise of a new one and its threat to its primacy (Athens). That political dynamic has arisen many times in history and is said to exist today in the western Pacific. Navarro's emphasis is on the militaries. But he explains that China hopes to win by soft power, by a war of comprehensive national power in which the strength of its economy, the skill of its labor force, its stable political system, its unlimited natural resources, the quality of its education, technological innovation and the strength of its political alliances overwhelm a weakened America and convince it that military force is useless. The final point in the important Chapter 41 is that the perception in the region is that America doesn't have the capacity at present to enforce the rules we have been the caretaker of all these decades. Sixteen pages later Navarro reminds us that weakness always invites aggression. This is unsettling reading but enormously informing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 27, 2017","Jun 13, 2017","Mar 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25982736-crouching-tiger

He sees the current disadvantage in which the U.

S. has been preparing for the last was while China is preparing for the next. The U. S. has lost sight of technological developments. The U. S. has been planning on projecting power and using it the old way, that is by the traditional doctrines of aircraft carrier use and the types of weapons associated with them. The strategic thinking of the Chinese, meanwhile, has been more innovative and focused on national goals in the region. Their grab of offshore islands and their developing them into fortified bases bristling with air and rocket power, what they call ""salami slicing,"" is meant to create an economic exclusion zone which denies shipborne transit of China's Near Seas if they feel the need to enforce it. And they have the military means to do it as well as the military means to strike the U. S. bases and those of her allies while the old aircraft doctrine of the U. S. has become obsolete because the range of China's rockets will prevent, it's thought, our naval forces from getting close enough to be able to use the limited range of our aircraft. The range of rockets is 4 or 5 times greater than our planes. And the Chinese think the expenditure of a few million dollar rockets will severely damage if not sink a multi-billion dollar ship. For the U. S. it's cost prohibitive. The types of weapons we've been building and replacing in the Navy are being made irrelevant by the Chinese doctrine and their weapons.And now we have to hurry to come up with new hardware and new methods of being able to strike the Chinese mainland if we have to. We've taken the Pacific for granted all these decades. Now the Chinese threat is the most serious we've ever faced in Asia. And interpretations of Chinese intentions are that they intend to use the vast military they're building. While at the same time the U. S. and her allies are in a time of fiscal stress. One danger is that the Chinese can perceive our weaknesses and may choose to create a crisis in which their leverage could improve their dominance in the region because the U. S. is unprepared to confront them militarily. In addition to building equipment, we and our partners in the Pacific have to come up with strategies and diplomacies that will make China's use of its military too expensive in regard to her neighbors and its standing in the global community. Haddick doesn't think time is on our side. The true answer is a diplomatic and peaceful resolution of the issues dividing China and the U. S. Both countries recognize the divide, recognize the rise of a power and the dangers as it confronts the interests of the prevailing power, recognize that trade and the continued stability of shared interests in the region will be the glue of the China-U.

I liked it, but I liked Living even more.It's a kind of novel of the universal. This is suggested by Green's omission of the sentence articles ""the"" and ""a"". So the reader comes on a sentence about Lily Gates and Bert Jones visiting his aunt and uncle: ""Lily Gates took pleasure in feeding chickens, it was infinitely amusing for her, and she had on new dress."" It reads like Gertrude Stein, an observation I believe Adam Thirlwell made in his ""Introduction"". It's also like Stein in that Green writes the humdrum moments of his characters' lives--work, pub, meals, sleep-- in dialogue and everyday actions one after another in a stream of repetition which gradually collects, layer on layer, to create reality.Christopher Isherwood called this a proletarian novel. The story is of characters who work day after day for their living in an iron foundry in Birmingham, England ""till we're too old. It's no manner of use thinking about it, it's like that, right on till we're too old for them to use us."" Mr Craigan in the novel had gone to work when he was 9 years old and every day of his life had worked the daylight hours until the time of the novel--the late 1920s, I think--when he's due his old age pension. Not all the characters are working class, though. Richard Dupret, an owner and manager of the foundry, feels the same inescapable controls of fate and vocation: ""He thought how he would sit in office chairs for another forty years, gradually taking to golf at the week-ends or the cultivation of gardenias."" For Green the characters are representative of living in the modern world.The reader thinks there's no underlying meaning, no metaphor. He thinks Green has given us only the monotony of day-to-day surface accumulating to recreate our living. But I believe Green loved these people of Birmingham so much that he even gave some of them the affirmation of attendant angels.

I wasn't aware of her until the publication of her 9th novel, Young Adolf, in 1978. Still, I didn't read her until the 1991 novel The Birthday Boys. Today I think of Bainbridge as a writer I admire and am always tempted to read more of, yet I've read only one other of her novels, According to Queeney. I guess you might say that my interest in her biographical details means she leaves an impression. So the Brendan King biography of her quickly caught my eye upon its publication. It didn't disappoint, either. I don't particularly like biographies which take too long in getting their subjects grown up. Just cover basic highlights and influences which will figure later in their work and quickly get them to the heart of the story we know them for and want to read about. But King lingers almost lovingly while Bainbridge grows up and portrays her as an appealing girl and young woman. I was surprised at how receptive I was to reading about her early years. They were years in which writing appeared not to be in her future. She was an actress for many years and only turned to writing when she saw the rich veins of material her relationships and family offered. I suspect she was a better writer than actress, but she had some successes, and her work in theater gave experience she later used well in television. When she did turn to fiction, she was prolific. This isn't a critical biography and therefore little analysis of her novels is provided other than ways they revealed herself and her own life. In fact, she said late in life, ""I can't write fiction, my life's in all my novels."" The relatively scant gloss on her work leaves room for what King emphasizes in his subtitle ""Love by All Sorts of Means"". Bainbridge gave up on marriage fairly early on, but there was always at least one man in her life, always lots of alcohol, and always art and artists filling a life hard-lived. And out of it came the well-regarded fiction she's famous for. Brendan King, who worked for her from 1987 till her death in 2010, is familiar with the complete Bainbridge and tells her well....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Apr 22, 2017","May 25, 2017","Mar 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25663567-beryl-bainbridge

In recent months a study of war through a critical appraisal of the world's most famous fictional characters followed by his brief book on the inevitability of war. Here Coker, who's sometimes called a philosopher of war, writes about the logic of it and how nations give in to it even while recognizing war's irrationality. Coker, who's a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, thinks the world's about to enter the most dangerous phase of great power competition since the end of the Cold War. His reflections of the nature of war in our time leads him to focus on what is probably the most dangerous situation of our time, the possibility of a conflict between China and the U. S. Equally a student of history and one who believes we can learn from the past, he thinks the most convincing historical analogy is the time leading up to the First World War. He approaches the problem as a series of questions, such as how logical the 2 adversaries are in their grand strategies, what roles do honor and reputation play, and whether or not they're capable of absorbing the lessons of the past. The dangers are manifest, and Coker spends considerable time discussing various elements of American and Chinese character which may drive the onset of war, ideas which I'd not been aware of before. He thinks, for instance, that China is in the same emotional space as Germany in 1914 in that the Communist Party's narrative of the past locks China into a time of past humiliations at the hands of the great powers, and that the resentment fuels an inability to move out of the darker past to make their way into a peaceful future. In the U. S., our energetic history and westward expansion, the nature of our bi-party political system, and the whole huge commercial enterprise which is America itself creates a society in which confrontation is ""the American default mode, its unique cultural style."" These are only 2 of the fascinating perspectives in a book about the nature of war which discusses it in terms of national mythic narratives, dignity, and Aristotle's ends and means rather than the aircraft carriers or cruise missile strengths of the adversaries.I find Coker to be fascinating reading because he gives you so much to think about. He asks questions without making predictions or providing answers. Instead, he presents his material by telling stories which the reader can explore.

Lorine Niedecker wasn't reclusive like the great poet of Amherst but lived most of her life on rural Blackhawk Island (not an island but a peninsula) near Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. She actively pursued publication and contact with other poets rather than the obscurity in which she lived her writing life. Moderate success came to her only after a late marriage and a move to Milwaukee freed her from a lifetime working at janitorial work in a hospital and as a proofreader. Another resemblance to Dickinson is her poetry, pared to shading where power lies coiled, like Dickinson's, in spaces and hidden behind words. She was heavily influenced by Louis Zukofsky (also a lover), William Carlos Williams and others in the objectivist group of poets active in the 1930s. Today much more is known of her and her work. This biography by Margot Peters helps to bring her out in the open for closer critical examination. Not only do we learn about the woman Niedecker was but this is also a thorough investigation of her poetry.

The concept isn't supernatural but literary, and it isn't a matter of interpretation because Herrera makes it plain in the 1st paragraph when his questor Makina says ""I'm dead,"" later followed by references to souls, perfect circles, the underworld, and hell as a sinkhole opens in the street where she's walking. Makina's journey and search involves crossing over from Mexico to the U. S., written and understood as a crossing of the Styx led by a Charon-like figure. From there she makes her way through a land of the dead punctuated by 9 signs pointing to the world's end, as I understand it.Herrera isn't cryptic about what he's doing, and, to be honest, I'd been prepped in what to expect and so was accepting of a character's passage through the underworld. This very short novel is written in a language as austere as the landscape it describes, yet it's verbally plump at the same time. It's a quick read for 2 reasons: the prose is fluid, and you won't want to put it down.Lisa Dillman translated the novel, and she provides some useful comments in her ""Translator's Note."" Already having referenced Dante as I read, I learned from Dillman that she primed herself to translate by reading Aztec mythology and Alice in Wonderland. I don't know enough to discern the former, the latter gave me an aha moment. Another aid she used in getting the language and tone right, but also because of obvious thematic similarities, was the work of Cormac McCarthy, particularly his novel The Road. Her comments are welcome and are placed, I think, in the right place, at the end of the novel.My thanks to my Goodreads friend Teresa Brader who recommended Signs Preceding the End of the World to me, knowing I'd enjoy the underworld journey and the novel's hearty metaphoric mix.

Wallace was finishing the publicIn March 1996 Rolling Stone assigned the young reporter David Lipsky to do an in-depth story on David Foster Wallace. Wallace was finishing the publicity tour he was doing for Little,Brown, the publisher of Infinite Jest. They spent 5 days together talking and sharing space and meals during the drive from Wallace's home in Bloomington, Illinois to Chicago, a flight to Minneapolis where Wallace has his last tour appearance, and the drive back to Bloomington. They talked in the car and on airplanes, hung out around Wallace's house and around hotels, ate takeout, and all the while talked, talked, talked while Lipsky probed Wallace's conversation for his ideas about everything from writing literary fiction to McDonald's french fries.David Foster Wallace comes across as a genuine young man (he was 34 years old--Lipsky was 30) who was a little uneasy about his huge success and new fame because he wasn't sure how to deal with it and was afraid it'd become more important than he wanted it to be. He understood why he wrote and talked freely about it. He detailed the various stages in the writing of Infinite Jest. However, his conversations with Lipsky won't provide help in interpreting it or tips in how to read it. He did say twice it's about loneliness. But a major concern of his was the fear he'd written a novel whose difficulties would turn most people away. Rightfully, he was proud of what he'd done, yet was self-effacing and shy about it. We know he was incredibly smart--reading his conversations here displays what we'd already heard--but he was funny, too, and caring about everyone he knew.As you might expect, 2 writers talking for 5 days would have much to say about literature. Both were published novelists, and Wallace was teaching creative writing at Illinois State at the time. The comments Wallace makes on culture weren't limited to books, though. He had a fondness and understanding for popular culture and, though an intellectual writer, wasn't above being absorbed by our culture's less ambitious forms. He was a television junkie, for instance, willing to sit watching for days, literally. And he talked knowledgeably to Lipsky about pop music. A sign of his intelligence was that he understood and could discuss what he liked and found meaningful in such forms while 2 pages later commenting intellectually about an author or philosopher. Wallace and Lipsky reached high and low.The book's endpaper calls this a ""biography in five days."" It's biographical material but limited mostly to the time of Wallace's writing of Infinite Jest and its post-publication. A reader will have to look elsewhere for details of Wallace's life. Lipsky's book is more like a 300+ page interview.

Like Goldbarth poems, these essays are sinuous and weave in several directions across multiple planes of thought until they come together at some point of wisdom you didn't know you were ready to receive but are glad you did. You could make a case for a Goldbarth essay being much like a Goldbarth poem. A different form, as he'd probably point out, but slightly different content, at least most of the time. This is the nature of his essays, each of them seeming to address how the form and content of his subjects rhyme and disagree. Some subjects have form but no content like the shape of a hand painted on the wall of a prehistoric cave in France. Or the drawing of a glove on one of the book's covers. One essay concerns an astronomer who studies heavens with content but no form. The essays consider the doubleness of everything. Such varied subjects as cave art, how John Keats and the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh were searching for the same thing, a single mother in the Midwest, and nicknames demonstrate his line of thought. This doubleness is first noticeable in the design of the book. Remember the old Ace paperbacks of science fiction novels published back-to-back in the 1950s and after? They were 2 novels bound together yin and yang style with one spine so that the book you hold in your hands has 2 front covers but no back. One half of Goldbarth's book has 3 essays, the other 4.

Though I enjoyed Twain's book, I didn't know untiLast year I reread The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to help prepare me for Coover's Huck Out West. Though I enjoyed Twain's book, I didn't know until actually reading Coover's that rereading couldn't really prepare me for the imaginings of myth and new personifications of America to be found in the characters grown up as perhaps only Coover could spin them. There are, I understand, 3 other continuations of the Huckleberry Finn story. The only other I've read is Greg Matthews's The Further Adventures of Huckleberry Finn which lands Huck and Jim in California during the Gold Rush. Coover doesn't get them that far. There's gold in his story, too, but it's in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. That's the epicenter of the events which catch us up to the man Huck has become after he and Tom Sawyer rode for the Pony Express and after Huck had made a life with the Lakota tribe and a wife named Kiwi who had no nose. This is one of those novels in which historical moments figure and to which the characters are convenient witnesses.Scattered throughout are reminders of the original Tom and Huck and Jim and the anecdotes about them which have become iconic. Huck himself remains an innocent soul willing and wanting to do what's right, a man who still sees the best in people, white, red, or black. Tom has changed. Tom is one of those characters Coover has used before as, I think, a kind of catalyst. The Tom who persuaded friends through guile to paint a fence for him now persuades with a gun. He's become a mythic figure, a larger-than-life persona who stands for America's imperialist impulse. He can shoot straighter than anyone else, his heroism seems to glow as bright as his white hat and gloves, and when he sleeps he hovers a foot above his cot. His qualities and abilities are magical. But when he takes off his hat his bald spot is noticeable. Called sivilization in the novel, Tom's bent on the destruction of the Indians and the settling of their land. Becky Thatcher's in the Territories, too. Once married to Tom, she's since taken up the oldest profession in the mining towns. And Jim? Jim was sold to the Cherokees because an escaped slave couldn't ride with them in the Pony Express. And lurking most of the time just over the horizon is Huck's nemesis General Hard-Ass who's a stand-in for Custer. We know what happened to him.I hope this sounds like fun because it is. Part of what makes it fun is the language. I like novels which are verbally agile and risk-taking. I call them language novels. It's probably more correct to call Huck Out West a dialect novel, told as it is in Huck's voice and written in Coover's version of the uneducated drawl of the 19th century west. An example that's representative while not given to some of the style's extremes: ""That story turned poorly and we never seen what was left of them afterwards, but ending stories was less important to Tom than beginning them, so we was soon off to other adventures that he thought up or read about in a book or heard tell of. Sometimes they was fun, sometimes they warn't, but for Tom Sawyer they was all as needful as breathing. He couldn't stand a day without it had an adventure in it, and he warn't satisfied until he'd worked in five or six."" The passage is deliberately chosen for its use of the word fun. That's early in the novel and serves as a kind of explanation for what they've been doing in the Territories. Two pages from the novel's end the word appears a final time in regard to an Indian folktale regarding Coyote's making a new creature from parts of Jack Rabbit, Porkypine, Mountain Goat, Turkey Vulture, Rainbow Trout, Prairie Dog, and Whooping Crane so Fox's sexual fun wouldn't be ruined. Which is what Coover has done, continued the fun by making a new creature from parts borrowed from Twain.

Here's a very general essay on how the arts help us to live. I always find Vendler challenging. Sometimes she soars way above my head where I can't go, and then she's a grind.

War, he says, is still evolving in that it can maximize the competitive edge of this group or that. War will continue as long as that's true. The geopolitical divide of have and have not nations, the continuing economic inequality, will always contribute to war. Human values differ widely; there's no single vision of peace which can have meaning across all cultures. In fact, going hand in hand with Coker's belief that organized violence is an inherent evolutionary trait of man, is his explanation that peace isn't a value built into our species in the way of other traits, such as language or the need for esteem.Coker writes well about the will to war as an element of our evolutionary trajectory and the natural order of societal competition. He's most chilling when he writes not of biological but of technological evolution. Our wide use and dependence on digital technology in militaries requires less reflection, therefore leading to a general inability to empathize. In future combat soldiers will feel and think differently. The current rush toward robotics--most apparent in the use of drones by more and more militaries--is merely a logical step in the history of technological development. He maintains the aim is to make war more humane by reducing human interaction and therefore increasing the accuracy of weapons. While such weapons reduce the emotion of war, they increase consistency of behavior while also providing more humane actions by removing hatred from the equation. All these ideas are steps in warfare to reduce human casualties and add efficiency to battlefield weapons that advanced militaries are enthusiastic about. But they lead to his disturbing question: ""How long will war still need us?""He writes that the thing about present and future wars is that such digitized technology requires soldiers with rich imaginations and perceptions, and I wondered if the varied states of educational systems would leave some societies, including some in the old guard of power, at a disadvantage.Christopher Coker is called a philosopher of war. While I'm not sure what that is, I see he's a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and that he writes widely about war, using as sources many philosophers from Aristotle to John Gray.

They turn out to be a massive diary begun in 1952 and continued until a few weeks before they were found. Masters, a biographer, begins studying them to determine what happened to the diarist and why they came to be thrown out. He assumes the person died and whoever was left with the diary simply threw them away, not wanting to be burdened with them. Masters takes on the task of piecing together the record contained in the 148 notebooks so that the diarist's life can be told.Essentially it's the biography of an unknown person. In order to be the biographer of someone nameless and faceless, he has to become part sleuth. And the story is revealed slowly as he works for over 4 years to bring it out of the moldy notebook pages, revealed bit by bit as a mystery Masters is solving. The thing is, Masters's study of the diaries and how he finally put all the pieces of the puzzle together are much more interesting than the abundant quotes from the notebooks themselves. These aren't Virginia Woolf's diaries full of mischievous gossip and literary anecdote or Alfred's Kazin's journals crowded with bookish critique and sex. They're merely the humdrum everyday events of a woman (I'll reveal that much) to whom nothing much happened at all, even though she had serious aspirations in music, art, and writing. Masters admits the diaries are agonizingly tedious but compares them to a group of deer he unobtrusively observes in the forest near his home. The woman and her diaries are a true thing, unaware they're being observed, and the strength of their unaffectedness gives them their value. ""Her drama is that she is not fiction,"" Masters writes.It's difficult to write impressions of a book like this without disclosing key details. The book is Masters's story as much as it is the diarist's, how he was able to connect all the dots and be able to tell us what he's learned about the diaries and who wrote them and why. Part of the biographer's task, though, is to make his subject interesting, and that Masters doesn't do. Not only are the diary entries not interesting, but when we have the whole case laid out before us--identity, life story complete with loves and aspirations and accomplishments, the motivations for keeping a diary for 50 years, all that--it's anticlimactic and hardly seems worth the effort and the resulting book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 17, 2017","Dec 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26198497-a-life-discarded

The primary interest is Simone de Beauvoir, with whom Algren had a long-distance romance for several years during the '40s and '50s involving visits back and forth between Chicago and Paris for both of them.

I think she understood them both and therefore explains their genuine love for each other as well as the relationship's dissolution into acrimony at the end caused by what they expected from the other and what she wrote about their amour. Their collection of letters--Algren kept all of hers in a metal tobacco tin--calls it a Transatlantic love affair, and it fills up a huge chunk in the middle of Wisniewski's biography.But she makes Algren fascinating, too. She provides in-depth examinations of his well-received novels of the underbellies of Chicago and New Orleans and characters disadvantaged by drugs and gambling and prostitution who live in the margins of such places. Wisniewski's treatment of A Walk on the Wild Side, which I haven't read and haven't been tempted by in many years, convinces me it's time that I become acquainted with it.

It's there that we associate the existentialist movement which included Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Raymond Aron. Out of that core the wave of existentialism in mid-century lapped at the feet of such writers and thinkers as Arthur Koestler, Stephen Spender, Richard Wright, Iris Murdoch, and Norman Mailer. It's the anecdotal character of the book which adds such charm to its serious discussion of the philosophical currents at play. Bakewell is good at explaining the basic ideas behind phenomenology and existentialism and how they've influenced feminism, gay rights, the dissolution of class barriers, and the anti-racist and anti-colonial drives of recent history. This is an in-depth tour of how these philosophies developed and the meat contained in them. But it's also an engaging narrative of these people who've become almost legendary, every one of them fascinating. Ultimately, the ideas are interesting, but the chorus singing them are vastly more so.Bakewell impressively braids all this heavy thought with the human stories of its being practiced, taught, and written by its existential cast so that it's all clearly explained. Especially clear, I thought, were the differences in thinking between Husserl and Heidegger causing their ideological split. She also comprehensively explains the famous break within the Parisian nucleus as Sartre's Marxist application of ideas wedged him away from Camus, Aron, and Merleau-Ponty. I'd never understood their arguments as well as through Bakewell's explanation.

The Earth Is Weeping is history and good history, but there's much more narrative, description, and biographical portrait than there is analysis. This story has been told before but perhaps not with this clarity and understanding of the cultures in such frictioned contact that it resulted in the death of one and the rush to greatness of the other. Cozzens demonstrates that the result couldn't have been any other than the one we know.We learn early on that the author intended his history to offset the influence and distorted picture created by the popular Dee Brown history Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Nevertheless, many of these familiar episodes he tells about show the United States in a poor light in their treatment of the native population. However, he emphasizes, most of the Army's senior command understood the hopeless situation the Indians faced and sympathized with them. Those who mistreated the various tribes and hastened the end of their way of life were the Indian agencies and those who worked in the Department of the Interior.Cozzens doesn't make a case for the disparity in population sizes between the Indian and European societies being a factor, or the fact that the United States felt it had a right and a national imperative to expand to the Pacific. It's implied. The railroads are cited as a direct cause and so are the economics of buffalo hides which destroyed the Indian primary natural resource. In Cozzens's telling there was no deliberate destruction of the buffalo herds and therefore the Indian way of life. There's no mention of distribution of blankets infected with smallpox. I don't remember the word genocide being used. Most importantly, in the end the Indians were unable to deflect the changes forced on them by an expanding United States and the loss of the buffalo. They could no longer resist. Given the nature of the 2 societies in contact across the west and given the advantages of American technological complexity, what else could have happened? What's probably true is that you can read 30 books about the subject and not arrive at the ultimate truth. However, I think with this clear, understanding, and comprehensive account of the 2 cultures in contact Cozzens has come closer to the truth than Dee Brown.

But as a post-doc professor at the University of Massachusetts he has doubts whether or not it really matters. His marriage is foundering. As he wonders about what direction he should take in his life and career, he discovers in rural New Hampshire the old estate of the Harvard philosopher William Ernest Hocking. Called West Wind, the house is dilapidated yet still filled with thousands of valuable books which are also gradually decaying in the fusty, untended environment. Not only books are at the Hocking Library at West Wind but also letters and papers of such notable writers and scholars as Whitman, Frost, Emerson, and William James. The library contains a comprehensive working collection of all of western philosophy, including all the books by American philosophers, particularly that period of the late 19th century and early 20th, called the golden age, the time of Emerson and Thoreau leading into William James, Josiah Royce, and Charles Sanders Peirce. Kaag sets himself the task of cataloging and restoring these neglected books. As he relates the progress of his work in the library and his reading there he gives us biographical accounts of the thinkers he found on the shelves and deep reflection on their work. Because the library was Hocking's, the richest veins are those of his contemporaries and their ideas on transcendentalism, pragmatism, and idealism. The love of deep thought is only part of the love story, though. He enlists a colleague from UMass, Carol, to help in the cataloging. Their personal love for each other develops amid the dusty, wormy books. On p210 Kaag calls philosophy ""that epic love affair with wisdom."" That idea helps to wed the potent emotional experience of handling and learning from the valuable books to his love for Carol. This love story of the title makes it easy to relate his and Carol's story with the love of Charles Sanders Peirce and his wife, the May-December love of William James for 24-year old Pauline Goldmark, and the late life affair of William Ernest Hocking and Pearl S. Buck.Ironically, perhaps the most important message he takes from his experience at West Wind comes not from an American thinker but from the French existentialist Gabriel Marcel, who believed that the true aim of life isn't to come up with all the answers but to be open to them so one can remain in touch with and receive what life can teach.

It makes the charge, startling for the time of its publication, that despite the sacrifices made at the front and at home the German effort during the Great War was characterized by a misguided strategy and fought by soldiers who were not only poorly led but were less than heroic themselves. Finally, it implied the Kaiser was a coward. Published at about the same time as Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, another anti-war novel, Schlump never caught on while Remarque's novel was a phenomenal success.Much of the 2d half of the novel is made up of several long stories by other soldiers Schlump the protagonist meets. It's like Grimm tries to capture the brutality and suffering of the war--hardships at home as well as in the trenches--through a variety of experiences which reflect all experience. At times I thought it approached polemic. On p240 is perhaps the main theme expressed by Schlump: ""This entire war is nothing but the cruellest, vilest slaughter, and if mankind can put up with such an atrocity for years, or stand by and look on, well, it deserves nothing but contempt. But he who fashioned mankind, he ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself, for his creation is an utter disgrace!"" This is counterpointed by the view of his captain, a kind of ur-Nazi who predicts their suffering will ensure that a leader with a ""superhuman soul"" will arise to lead Germany in uniting Europe in distinction and glory, prefiguring the political atmosphere between the wars.The cover blurb of my edition suggests that Schlump, the young soldier whose story this is, is ""maybe even a new type of man."" To me he's as old as fiction itself--though I'd first seen him as a kind of blundering sad sack, I came to think of him as a Sancho Panza without a Don Quixote. He's an optimist, a man who has a native intelligence backed by resolve and resourcefulness and a belief in the basic good of humanity. The trouble is I grew tired of Schlump before the end. Sure he possesses all the practicality of Sancho Panza, but in the end he's innocent (in fact, the ""Afterword"" by Volker Weidermann calls the novel a fairy tale), and innocence isn't always interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 15, 2018","Jan 29, 2018","Nov 08, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29236427-schlump

What Reese's remarkable boIf you admire Flannery O'Connor and enjoy reading her, you might find Rita May Reese's volume of poems about her essential. What Reese's remarkable book gives us is a linked set of poems based on both the narrative of O'Connor's life and philosophy and a story of hers called ""Good Country People."" Briefly, in that story, an educated young woman with a prosthetic leg (Joy, who'd changed her name to Hulga) and her mother are taken advantage of by a Bible salesman. Manly Pointer lures Hulga into the hayloft where he shows her that his Bible has a scooped-out interior and contains only a bottle of whiskey, pornographic playing cards, and condoms. Hulga rebuffs him, so then he steals her prosthetic leg. Pointer tells Hulga he's an atheistic nihilist, but Hulga, who has a PhD, arrogantly feels superior to him and others while believing in nothing. We're shown a Hulga who holds both a devil and a dove where her heart is. This is another Flannery O'Connor story about the modern world being shown to be without true knowledge or insight as evil invades a family, their naivete allowing disorder to be unloosed. Hulga's meeting someone as nihilistic as herself is a revelation to her.The poems are informed by the writings of Simone Weil. Her quotes are scattered throughout the book. The ones concerning nothingness stand out for me, and may indicate O'Connor. As we read the poems Hulga the young woman matures into the dying woman living constantly in pain, always approaching God but never arriving. On p35 is a key:""is the nothingness from which she flees& the nothingness toward which she goes.The volume is enhanced by the illustrations of Julie Franki. They show a Hulga who gradually, I thought, comes to resemble O'Connor, and they show Hulga's prosthetic leg transformed into a machine gun, say, or a tooth, just as Hulga in the poems can be Sleeping Beauty or anesthetized for surgery.There's a lot going on, as you might expect in a series of poems braiding together a Flannery O'Connor story, O'Connor's own life, and the philosophical writings of Simone Weil, where Hulga and O'Connor constantly blur into each other. Sometimes holding meaning still long enough to grasp it is as difficult as seeing shape in a mirage. But this is appropriate to the book's subject--O'Connor's own ideas of morality and ethics bound up in her stories of the Southern grotesque are often slippery. The difficulty is part of the exhilaration we feel with Reese's book. A student of both Husserl and Heidegger once remarked the latter was the more exciting because he was the more difficult of the two. So here--its sometimes being tough adds to its effect.Two complements to this book: First, there is the sense that the linked cycle of poems form a circle. Only a couple of weeks ago I finished the Don DeLillo novel Zero K and wrote here that one of the ideas the novel proposes is that birth and death converge in the same place. And here I found the same thought. After the final section of the book, 4 harrowing poems about Flannery O'Connor's dying, there's the single page with one of Julie Franki's illustrations and a brief note from Simone Weil: ""Nothing can have a destination which is not its origin."" This returns us to the beginning but also darts into the middle, returning us to p35 and O'Connor's slow approach to God. Second, maybe some of you are familiar with the volume of poems by R. T. Smith, The Red Wolf: A Dream of Flannery O'Connor. They're also poems about O'Connor and her work, and they follow the arc of her life. I highly recommend it as well as The Book of Hulga. I think together they'll probably make a fine companion read. They're both powerful, perhaps brilliant, tributes to one of America's great writers and much better than my inadequate attempt to describe them....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 09, 2016","Dec 06, 2016","Nov 07, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27276838-the-book-of-hulga

A couple of the early essays support that impression, an essay calling physical exercise a tyranny and one in which he writes about the constant bombardment by media of the values of nutrition and eating healthily. Rather than grumble, though, most of these essays can perhaps be best seen as providing new and insightful perspectives on the cultural facets of our lives.Pornography is an early subject, and so is in vitro fertilization in an essay which focuses not only on the famous Octomom but also the desire of some celebrities to adopt many children. There's a section on music, and in one essay Greif enthusiastically praises rap as being the significant new art form replacing all popular music which has preceded it. There's a section on television discussing the popularity of reality shows.For me, the closing essays are the strongest and most interesting. In one he startlingly compares the modern American combat infantryman to Homeric heroes, Baghdad to Troy. The next, on the nature of police work, offers eye-opening or -popping new ways to look at what the police really do.Scattered throughout the volume are 4 essays called ""The Meaning of Life"" concerning themselves with ideology, experience, and legislation. These are the most philosophical in the collection. Greif grew up near Concord, Massachusetts and identifies with who's arguably considered its most famous citizen, Henry David Thoreau. This fact might explain his pose as contrarian. He compares Thoreau's living alone at Walden Pond with the recent Occupy movement which took over Zuccotti Park in Manhattan. Just as Thoreau occupied that small plot of land on Walden Pond trying to find the kind of life he wanted to live, the gentle modern protesters occupied Zuccotti Park with the same motives. In the end, pursuing the life you want to live may be life's ultimate reward. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Oct 10, 2016","Nov 11, 2016","Sep 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28186093-against-everything

Conflict on the American frontier, according to the myth, eHoly War is another of those books addressing what Anderson calls America's creation myth. Conflict on the American frontier, according to the myth, established a cultural framework of an energizing nation destined to expand, to embrace its sense of divine mission and realize American exceptionalism. Anderson uses chapters on the Mexican War, the Custer massacre, the Mexican Revolution, Caribbean intervention, Vietnam, and Reagan's Iran-Contra affair to explain how the myth has abided in American history as an allegorical device for explaining how culture and manifest destiny and imagined American exceptionalism support each other. Aggressive behavior in our past, he writes, exemplifies the idea of our need to not only fight but to portray our conflicts as defensive maneuvers against some Other so as to use them as regenerative stories emphasizing our innocence and sense of right. It's how America experiences rebirth--expressed by Anderson as highly religious--conceived in violence. The original seeds, of course, were the Indians. One consequence of the many Indian wars--and particularly of those in the late 19th century and after Custer could be reimagined as a Jesus, according to Anderson--is that Indians became archetypal, allowing for Mexicans, Filipinos, Vietcong, Muslims, Saddam Husseins, Manuel Noriegas, Augusto Sandinos to act as stand-ins and therefore inherit the role of America's spiritual and mythical enemies.This isn't a new idea, this recognition of the myth of America's frontier and struggles against an Other being employed in popular culture as a way to nationalize American aggression, particularly those involving intervention or expansion. His final chapter uses 3 films as examples of what's gone before to illustrate his points: Dances with Wolves, Avatar, and The Walking Dead. They show how pervasive the idea is in our popular culture, how accepting we are to the mythic idea without realizing its hold on American imagination and attitudes.My problem with Anderson isn't with disbelief in his arguments at all. I'm familiar with the notion of regeneration through violence and the transformation of historical events into myths which resonate in our popular culture and affect national attitudes. But it's my opinion that Anderson presents them inelegantly and in ways which cheaply stretch points and unnecessarily manipulate perspectives, therefore becoming polemic. Anderson comes across as an unhappy man. He's unhappy with America, and he lets it show.Generally, his book, his study has value. But it's most flawed and its rhetoric most polemicized around Vietnam. His perception of the Vietnam War as another Indian war serving to regenerate America, his claim that we became involved in response to a falsified attack at sea, the branding of Richard Nixon as a criminal president who didn't have a secret plan to win the war yet later declared victory in defeat is all too pat and simplistic for such a complex arrangement of events strung across 20+ years. While the foundation myth can be seen as a component (even I've considered the Korean and Vietnam Wars as expressions of manifest destiny), I think to hang the entire history of our involvement in Vietnam on that label and to discuss the war in those terms across 24 pages is to misrepresent, misunderstand, and to mislead those less familiar with the history and with history's mutability. And admittedly I know less about other subjects he touches on (and too cynical to believe Custer was a Christ or his mission holy), but I can easily understand how his treatments of such complexities as Iran-Contra or the Mexican War might carry the same burden of oversimplification. He begins the book at the end of our history and the attack on 9/11. He writes of the cultural response to the attack symbolized ""the reopening of the American frontier and the collective reinvestment in our Manifest Destiny."" The beginning, or the continuation, of an Indian war. Well, maybe.As I say, this isn't a new idea, and to try to address it in a meaningful way in a text of 225 pages subverts any grace or refinement in his arguments and creates a shallow pool rather than deeper reservoirs of rewarding substance advancing the concept of regeneration through violence and our dealings with the Other in our past....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 29, 2017","Sep 13, 2017","Aug 30, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27433726-holy-war

But it is an engaIt may be that my being captivated by David Foster Wallace and his work at this time is why I thought this biography so captivating. But it is an engaging, riveting read.There's a sobering section deep in the funny interior of Infinite Jest, Wallace's magnum opus, in which he drops his satirical voice for a couple of pages to write about clinical depression. What impressed me most about this tiny slice of a 1079-page novel, aside from the abrupt swerve away from irony, a swerve I thought indicated a searing honesty, was his statement that for some people depression is so overwhelming they feel they have to die in order to get away from it. Knowing this insight is embedded in his most famous novel helps explain Wallace's own sudden end because the biographical portrait D. T. Max draws of Wallace is so consistently grounded and nourishing that the reader, knowing Wallace hanged himself in 2008, wonders how the biographer is going to adequately explain how a man who'd been so dependably treated for his own depression for 20 years was so precipitously eaten by it. But he does make it clear. Wallace's horrific decision to die is a tiny slice from the life of a man known for his enormous intellect and talent as author and teacher. That's the story Max tells for 297 of 301 pages, providing a detailed picture of who Wallace was and what his ideas of life and writing were. The many quotes from Wallace's work and correspondence as well as the biographer's understanding and ability to put it on the page makes the reader's connection to Wallace an emotional one. This understanding includes discussion of the novels, essays, and stories, too, though there isn't room in these few pages to even begin to gloss the complexities of what he wrote and how he thought.Earlier this year the critic of popular culture Chuck Klosterman published a book called But What If We're Wrong?: Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past in which he projects that in the far future 200 or 300 years from now Infinite Jest will be the novel from our time still being read and appreciated. It would seem to me that a reader interested in Wallace the writer, his work, and the possibility of a literary importance such as Klosterman predicts would find this biography to be an essential path to the man. This is only the 1st biography of what I feel will be many--with, I suspect, the publication of his letters (he was close friends with Jonathan Franzen and Don DeLillo) and journals to back them up.

It's fitting that such a fine novel will be one of the ways I'll probably come to define my experiencing 2016. War and Turpentine has been compared to the novels of W. G. Sebald. It looks like a Sebald novel on the page, the scattering of photographs, the blocky paragraphs building page on page without dialogue so that they serve as meditation and memory. Stefan Hertmans has written the life of his grandfather Urbain Martien, a boy who grew up watching his own father paint church frescoes and who dabbled at painting himself but whose life was interrupted by service in the front lines of Flanders during the Great War, and who spent the long remainder of his life remembering those years while trying to paint, eventually filling notebooks with his memories. Stefan's 1st and 3d sections of the novel carry his memories of his grandfather. The 2d, middle section of the book is Urbain's written memory of his wartime service. He fought with courage and distinction and was wounded 3 times. He remembers the 1914-18 years with pride. As with many men, though, it haunts him and becomes the watershed from which the remainder of his life flows. This section of Hertman's novel is some of the most finely-written descriptions of that war I've read.Imagine time. It's never still. The past exists, the future waits. In between the present is a continuously sweeping boundary we experience but still find impossible to put our finger on because...it's both the future and past before we can fix on it. So War and Turpentine. It's hard to establish exactly where and how fiction and biography, meditation and memory fit together. Like time we accept where it takes us, thankful, for the exquisite spirit and art with which we're guided through Urbain's life. Stefan writes him with delicacy and abounding devotion yet the meditative prose shows the confident sturdiness of its subject, even as Urbain was, we're told, unable to live the life he wanted, haunted by the war he was forced to fight and by the turpentine of art he tried to master.This is an immensely moving novel. It's Sebald-like in its meticulous study of a man's past. It's Proustian in its observance of how a man learns from that past. Deeply satisfying.

Kapuscinski is a Polish journalist and traveler who writes here about his 1st trips outside Poland in the mid-20th century. He was given a copy of Herodotus as a companion on his 1st assignment abroad. It touched him deeply, as his own book touched me.Kapuscincki uses The Histories as a way to gauge his own sense of wonder as he travels, as his own sense of being an other in strange societies. He tries to see his own reactions to strangeness in light of the way he thinks Herodotus reacted. In seeing himself intently observing the places to which he travels--India, China, Iran, much of Africa--he uses Herodotus as a guide in how to see and understand, even though Herodotus traveled and wrote without maps and without a large collection of written resources. Kapuscinski constantly reminds us how deep in history Herodotus lived and chronicled his travels--he writes that the Persian armies described in The Histories existed 24 centuries before Napoleon, that the Middle East written about was one a thousand years before the arrival of Islam--yet still finds ways to see their experiences as similar.One of the elements he learned from The Histories was contrast. The ancient world in which Herodotus traveled could easily be seen as divided into east-west, Asia-Europe, Persia-Greece. Kapuscinski observes contrasts of his own. Besides his own obvious east-west, that of the Cold War, he compares the open character of India's population with the closed nature of the Chinese. In Algeria he sees 2 Islams, those of river and desert, or the new vs the traditional. The book itself is halved between Kapuscinski's travels and Herodotus's.The final chapter is thoughts on history, which he sees, like Herodotus, as created by people through the continuous flow of their everday lives. And the history created today is mirrored by the history Herodotus found because human nature is a constant. This chapter on the meaning and uses of history is terrific.Thanks to my Goodreads friend Lyn Elliott whose  of Travels with Herodotus was the inspiration for my coming to the book.

Though it's full of beautiful poetry and language, it also references a science beyond my understanding.Simply stated--so I can understand it--Christian Bok (pronounced book) has begun a 2-volume experiment to encode a poem into a bacteria--it worked in E. coli--and which will then generate another bacteria which may survive all other life on earth. Immortality. It begins with a sonnet called ""Orpheus,"" which, when translated into gene form, can be inserted into a cell which will then ""read"" the poem as instructions for building a protein to encode another sonnet called ""Eurydice."" All this is wrapped snugly into pages of chemical equations, molecular schematics, and diagrams of Watson and Crick's double helix structure for DNA. I can only assume these pages of chemical drawings representing beehive cells and molecular formation can be read as poetry. All this is preceded by 50 beautiful sonnets closely corresponding to Virgil's Georgics and having to do with beekeeping. It's the pastoral combined with science, and I understand that this works and actually caused E. coli to glow. I don't understand it, though.I know Bok from an earlier book called Eunoia. It's equally beautiful, a volume which twists word arrangements into a kind of scriptural chant. It won the Griffin Poetry Prize in 2002, and my pleasurable experience with Eunoia encouraged my reading of The Xenotext even though I'd read it's heavily science-based and intimidatingly difficult. I don't regret reading The Xenotext because the 50 sonnets about bees are extraordinarily breathtaking to read. Exquisite language. My trouble is I can't fathom how they fit into the larger scheme of the poems (the experiment), or even how the poems progress from that point to reach whatever conclusion we find in that final beautiful poem whose context in the whole I couldn't understand.I do accept pure language. One doesn't necessarily have to understand Finnegans Wake in order to enjoy it. Reading Joyce's verbal acrobatics can be enough until one is able to make sense of it and detect the narrative. I know I'll eventually form an understanding of The Xenotext. I remember many years ago when John Barth published the novel Letters. I'd been reading Barth for years and eagerly awaited it. But the s were so congested with references to postmodernisms and epistolary densities and an author presence in bed with his fictional characters that I couldn't even make sense of the s. (The s of The Xenotext were unintelligible, too.) So I was a few years getting to Letters, but when I did the fog blew away instantly. I expect the same to happen with The Xenotext if I return to it enough times.

I decided to read it after its publication 9 years ago because I'd recently come across two polls which ranked it the best novel of the 21st century...so far. I'd always been aware of it and knew of the high regard for it. I figured I ought to see what all the applause was about.I did like it. I liked the energetic prose style I'd heard so much about. It's a language spicily flavored by Dominican Republic sensibilities, including many phrases and words in Spanish left untranslated. I wasn't discouraged by this but let myself skip lightly over and ignore what I didn't know. Oscar is a product of Paterson, New Jersey, so there's that urban American argot combining with the Caribbean verbal vigor to make a musical prose. Many notes of this music is made from the popular culture Oscar swims in. He surrounds himself with role playing games and comics and popular science fiction, all of which, in turn, swirls on the page to become part of Diaz's language. The novel reminded me a bit of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay that way. I liked the narrative. I didn't expect more than the story of a hopeless nerd and was pleased that it's at least as much family saga and love story spooled out under the looming menace of the Trujillo years in the Dominican Republic. It's that combination of family history and the omniscient presence of Trujillo and his government which gives the novel its powerful binary eloquence. I deliberately exclude Oscar there because to me the prime movers of the novel are its women, Lola, his sister, Beli, the mother, and La Inca, the grandmother back in the Dominican Republic. Considered against the wonderful snapcracklepop style and the steamy maternal histories, the story of Oscar the geek and his hopeless journey into manhood and love while forced to lean into the mean-spiritedness and dismissal he met in the world I thought a little thin. That thinness is redeemed by love, the most delicious sweet and sour ingredient in this meal of history and language. It comes down to the love of Yunior for Lola and of Oscar for Ybon. And Diaz gives us a wonderful sentence near the end which says worlds: ""She was the kind of girlfriend God gives you young, so you'll know loss the rest of your life."" The novel's filled with gorgeous sentences and sentiments like that.And here's another: ""Neither Captain Marvel nor Billy Batson, but the lightning,"" says Yunior of Lola's daughter at the end. And by then, on page 329, that's what I'd concluded, too.

Katherine Mortenhoe is a celebrity because she's going to die in middle age at a time in the near future when death by any cause except old age has been eliminated. She signs away her rights to privacy to a TV network that will broadcast coverage of her final days in exchange for a substantial payment leaving her husband comfortable.

The reporter detailed to record her dying is a cyborg whose eyes have been converted to cameras providing a visual feed to his network. His unique ability unknown to Katherine, he joins her flight from the frenzy of attention surrounding her condition. His pov in alternating sections is almost equal to hers, and his increasing sympathy provides a tenderness offsetting the moral ambiguity of almost everyone else. These include Vincent the TV executive and the novel's evil center. Katherine's doctor, Mason, wants to gain fame from his proximity to her unusual medical circumstance. There are Katherine's 2 husbands. And there are the many types of people she and Roddie the reporter meet as they try to hide in the countryside, from bohemian dropouts on the fringe of society to upperclass swingers.

The book delivers so much more than an examination of walking in the woods, though. Moor is a hiker himself, what he calls a thru-hiker, one who hikes long distances over established trails of great length. He describes some of his own experiences in spending 5 months hiking the entire Appalachian Trail from its beginning in Georgia to the ending on Maine's Mount Katahdin. Moor writes interestingly on why people hike and what they get from it. Most of the 2d half is taken up with an ""exploration""--his word from the title, more appropriate than meditation--of hiking itself and the love of some people for extended hikes like the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, or the Great Divide Trail. He understands those who love--sometimes need--to get out of their everyday lives and onto a trail which leads them into whatever nature, vision of wilderness, discipline, or solitude they seek. For me, the book became stronger and stronger as I read. Moor writes quite well and intelligently, so he moves eloquently through such topics as humanity's historical relation to wilderness and the impact of our newer technologies on hiking culture. By the end of the book what he's learned from a couple of his heroes, Thoreau and the Chinese poet/hermit Han-Shan, has caused him to become philosophical. The hiking trail, he writes, is merely one of the paths our lives take. He considers walking a trail to be an ""untethered state."" He agrees with Thoreau that walking the woods is the ultimate freedom. In describing how the hiker pares down what he carries from his life in the greater society, he writes, ""In walking, we acquire more of less.""As I say, the book delivers a lot. Moor discusses not only trails like the Appalachian Trail and its history but the forerunners of every modern trail, animal trails--even fossilized ones--and Indian trails. Because trails are always the lines of least resistance used by moving animals and later followed by Indians, most of our modern highway system has paved them over in using the same routes. He spends time in explaining how the internet is also a trail. I was aware of the extension of the Appalachian Trail into Canada but didn't know that it'd recently been extended to even vault the Atlantic by engineering trails through the same Appalachian geology existing in Iceland, Spain, and Morocco. Moor's account of his part in mapping the new end of the trail in Morocco is fascinating. There's much more to this interesting book: the time he spent among Navajo shepherds studying how sheep create trails, the complexity of insect trails.

It seems important to me to A reread, a project.There's always been something attractive to me about being close to a novel I think is extraordinary. It seems important to me to be able to know something about how certain novels work as fiction and use systems of ideas and a range of prose styles to become fiction significant enough in my admiration to have bearing on my thinking. Such deeper understanding is a kind of intimacy. It's a mutual acceptance. People often are resistant to such close readings, but I think books are receptive, embracing, and reader-inclusive if you push to get inside.I'd first read Infinite Jest about 20 years ago. I now think that reading inadequate to the novel's qualities and clumsy, even lazy, on my part. For this read I used a critical guide called Elegant Complexity by Greg Carlisle, a comprehensive--in fact, exhaustive--discussion of the characters, events, and themes of the novel. It's invaluable, though, to be honest, a reader willing to sink deep shafts of observation and focus into the novel's vast encyclopedic seams of language, image, ideas, and metaphor, should be able, through hard work, to mine it, should be able to dig out the rich deposits of literary ore buried there. Carlisle does make it easier. I call such guides Virgils, even though the works fueling Infinite Jest are Hamlet, 1984, and A Clockwork Orange rather than Dante. Still, the journey in the reading of it is to go underground. It's an underworld of addiction, and many of the characters there are as damned and lost as those Dante met. Those to be saved must first be savaged. Dark as it sounds, the world of Infinite Jest is wonderful to experience. One of its strongest properties is Wallace's skill in writing many different styles, in being able to get into the head of every kind of character, from the desperate 5-minute address of a crack addict in a substance abuse program to the more refined conversation of an academic. To stand away and look at it, it's as magnificent as a galaxy. Yet a thing of beauty fragments into many beautiful parts. What's true of Infinite Jest is that you can hold up each shiny shard of it, much as Hamlet held up the skull of poor Yorick, for an examination that'll reward you as reader.It's a novel which mixes philosophy and grand insight with humor. I'd forgotten how funny it can be. Inserted into a character's anguish may be a scene of madcap comedy, like the fat woman who got her bum stuck in the bathroom window of a bus. Elegant prose describing the balletic pace of boys playing tennis can contrast sharply with a slapstick fight among addicts outside a rehab house. Some of it is harrowing, as a chapter in which characters discuss depression. All of it is wonderfully written. The prose is impressive, expressive, a prose of clarity and honesty, each section capturing the nuances and sensibilities of the character point of view being expressed.It'd been a long time since I'd read a big fat book in this way, with a Virgil, carefully annotating, taking time to understand and to connect all the dots. This almost became more project than read and was a little consuming. I found all my reading time taken up with the densities of Infinite Jest. As much as I enjoyed it, as much as I admire it, and as flushed with pride as I was to slide it back into the big space on its shelf which had been empty for the 72 days it took me to read it, I'm happy to have completed it, ready to sit in my chair and let momentum throw me back as I return to the reading speed I cruise at....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 19, 2016","Aug 29, 2016","Jun 23, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/544063.Infinite_Jest

Charles DuquAnnie Proulx has written a family saga double-helixed like DNA embedded in the novel and which carries all the novel's vital information. Charles Duquet and Rene Sel arrive in New France together in the late 17th century and work together briefly at clearing the magnificent forest around them. But the work is hard and the mosquitoes predatory, and they separate when Duquet runs away to engage in the softer work of a voyageur, which leads him into the trade and business of the new land. Rene Sel stays, falls in love with logging and with an Indian woman, Mari. And so the 2 strands of the novel are charted, the Duke family come to work in the forest industry as managers and owners, become entrepreneurial and corporate-minded. The long family history descended from Rene and Mari become working-class loggers living in camps deep in the woods, cutting trees and driving them down rivers to sawmill or papermill. The Dukes carry clipboards and sit in boardrooms. The Sels, for the most part, carry an axe and sit around an open fire or in the cookshack. The Dukes are wealthy, privileged. The Sels are laborers, marginal, and marked by their Mi'kmaw blood.Those are the 2 nucleotide strands informing the novel's development. As she often has in earlier novels, Proulx writes about the wilderness. Here she traces, through these 2 families, the history of the timber industry in North America. And, as you might expect, one of her concerns is the destruction of the huge forests. She writes about the logging's denuding the continent, beginning in Maritime Canada and Maine and sweeping west through Michigan's great timber to the majestic forests of giant trees in the Pacific Northwest. Following the money and the work Proulx's characters even vault the Pacific to harvest the noble kauri tree of New Zealand. The double-stranded information tells of the hunger for acquisition, despoliation, waste, erosion and gullying, ""the ruin of the forest world with no thought for the future--the choppers considered the supply to be endless--there was always another forest."" But not only the forests suffer. Lives are uprooted with the trees, the landscape forever altered, and cultures, like that of the Mi'kmaw, overwhelmed and obliterated. The course of the novel is from 1693 to the present, and the Sels and Dukes who live among us today are looking at an ecology in need of restoration.I don't want to give the impression of darkness and catastrophe. She hasn't written a polemic pronouncing ""American carnage,"" but she does seed her novel with warnings that resources once considered infinite won't last forever. Her Duke-Sel double helix is actually fun because she's peopled it with interesting characters and seems to care for them and to bring to our attention their quirkier traits so we'll care for them, too. The names might make you think of Dickens--there's a Will Thing, Mr. Pye, Goosey Breeley, the Mrs. Brawn and Trame, just to name a few--except this isn't the wilderness of London but the dense boreal timberlands of North America.

I found this very difficult poetry, found that I got nothing from it. Little about Howard's poetry resonated with me. Yet I know the book has merit. It won the Griffin Poetry Prize this year, judged the best of 500+ books by the judges Alice Oswald, Tracy K. Smith, and Adam Sol, who made Howard the youngest winner in the prize's history. I understand the failure isn't hers in reaching out to me, reader, but a failure on my part to work hard at digging away at her layers of language and chipping away at the hard surfaces of meaning to find the vein to mine for understanding. So I did what I rarely do, I immediately got the book back off the shelf and started it again. Part stubbornness and unwillingness to admit failure, part faith in the book's value and my being able to appreciate it. When you revisit landscapes, you always see things you missed before. It was only through a careful rereading of the book, the notes and glossary Howard provides, and a couple of s that this difficult book began to come into enough focus that I could distinguish shape and sense. Her own notes suggest a kinship with the harmonies first heard in Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha. Howard is partly of Anishinaabe descent, those Indigenous peoples from around the Great Lakes. Her poetry combines the Indigenous/European combination in herself, I think, in directly referencing Ludwig Wittgenstein through an epigraph to ""Thinktent"" and a direct quotation from the poem ""Standard Time,"" as well as the coyote trickster figure appealed to in ""A Wake."" These poems are autobiographical, I think. She's the citizen here in what's certainly a central poem of the European/First Peoples combination allowing her ""to dream a science"" while, at the same time, staying""inside my own head perpetuallynot simply Wittgenstein's girlbut an infinite citizen in a shaking tent"",the tent where, her notes tell us, ""spirits are consulted to obtain beyond human knowledge."" I unscramble this to mean her poetry should be seen as looking for what's beyond human knowledge, which would be a spirituality integrating place and cognition.Some poems are made up of word associations that reference the Canada we'd see north of Lake Superior, the geology we find there and all its life forms. I'm guessing the region was Howard's original physical home--she's based in Toronto now--and continues to be a spiritual home. These imagistic portraits use the words of that country to not only formulate the ecology, landscape, and heritage there but also to absorb the case that's the other world making Liz Howard.I've read that in the layers of these difficult poems are also Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Plath, and Keats. I'll have to let another reading try to lift them into a ground high enough to expose the seams where they're hiding, and hopefully bring a greater understanding of the whole. Maybe in a couple of years.

Laing found herself alone in New York following a failed relationship. Her experience of being alone in the city, adrift in its enormous anonymity without benefit of a network of contacts or even an acquaintance, had given her time to think about what loneliness is and how people cope with it. Her research led her to zero in on how artists experience the condition. She's written a book in which she meditates on her own New York loneliness but also that of such artists as Edward Hopper, Greta Garbo, Klaus Nomi, and Andy Warhol.A key understanding she came to early on, and one which led her to study artists, is that people make things as a means of expressing their need for satisfactory human contact. Or their fear of such contact. The artists she writes about fit easily into that grouping. Something else they have in common is a weakness in language, either through a refusal to use it or an inability to effectively use it. This lack of language is a critical element of individual loneliness. Some kinds of art, she writes, is intended to repair our broken connections with and separations from others. The art people make, what they write, the way they expose themselves as entertainers, often acts as a point of contact, however fragile, with other people.Ultimately, she concludes, tackling loneliness is realizing it's both personal and collective, that we need to protect ourselves while at the same time seeking solidarity with everyone around us because we have obligations to one another. It's a powerful message to end with when you, as reader, remember that only a few dozen pages earlier Laing had written extensively on the current powers of the internet to hold our attention in any environment. It not only allows us to be potentially connected with the rest of the globe, but the way it's most commonly used as a connector today, with phone and pad, also requires us to be isolated, alone....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 04, 2016","Oct 31, 2016","May 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25667449-the-lonely-city

The Comanche finally were forced as a group onto reservations in the 1870s after a 20-year drought, the breakdown of their pastoral economy and lifestyle following the demise of the huge bison herds of the plains, and military pressure from the expansionist United States. They were largely ignored on the reservations until the 1930s. When they again began to be studied by ethnographers they were described as a warrior society, which they were to a large extent, as were most plains peoples. But the description reduces the true scale of Comanche economic and social power over the southern plains, what's now western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The Comanche did follow a lifestyle similar to that our history most commonly ascribes to the plains Indians--they rode in bands to raid and steal, they moved seasonally following the bison herds, hunting them in dramatic running style from horseback, lived in tipis. But for 200 years the Comanche controlled their vast Texas-New Mexico base with a trade economy organized around a pastoralism which provided the U. S. to the east and Mexico to the south with horses, mules, and animal hides in exchange for guns and other metal products like knives and kettles, textiles, and foodstuffs like corn and other grains. Their ever-increasing pastoral economy demanded more horses and mules demanding more raiding to acquire them plus more captives to be enslaved as herders. Texans, Mexicans, and neighboring tribes formed a symbiotic relationship with the Comanche. They all needed what each provided. Need fed upon need. The huge Comanche population used their ability to raid in mass formations to sustain large herds to be traded to meet the needs of neighbors for horses and mules--cattle, too--who in turn provided material goods and carbohydrate-rich foods. The powerful Comanche trade economy was backed by an equally powerful warrior ethos that allowed them to flourish and dominate their neighbors. Empire.What I've described only scratches the surface of the Comanche history Hamalainen tells. His study begins with their origins in the interior Rocky Mountains and follows their migration to the southern plains, their adoption of the horse and horse culture, their wars of conquest against the Apache and others which gave them dominance over the region, their advantageous trade relations with the Mexicans, and their political dominance over the early Texans. It's an engaging story, and it's remarkable one because it's a story we haven't--or I haven't--been aware of before. It gives us a new perspective of a historical era we thought we knew. Larry McMurtry's blurb calls the book ""Cutting-edge revisionist western history."" My favorite section of the book, though, isn't concerned with Comanche economy or politics. I was fascinated by the long Chapter 6, ""Children of the Sun,"" which describes in detail Comanche culture and way of life. Ever wonder what it would have been like to live as a Comanche on the southern plains in the mid-1700s?

The fact that he was a member of the Resistance and that he and his companion Suzanne Deschevaux-Dumnesil were forced to flee Paris in a harrowing journey that took them to Rousillon in Provence where they lived out the remaining 3 years of the war are matters of biographical fact. Not everyone knows it, however. It's important because I don't remember the protagonist of Baker's novel being named. Those familiar with Beckett will recognize him right away; those who've read up on the novel will know it's Beckett. I wondered, though, if the novel would resonate as powerfully with a reader not familiar with Beckett. The characters are rather inconspicuous in the large events of the time. Their personal events are relatively quiet ones. Then, too, so much of the novel takes place in the crowded mind of Beckett himself. I wonder if the protagonist can be significantly engaging if he can't be Beckett. His identity is the fuel powering the novel. Here is Beckett imagined, a character in a novel. We're obliged to look at him in a different way, as someone in a story filled with conflict of some sort or another and with the push/pull of interaction with Suzanne. They're both wonderfully imagined as are the other historical characters like James and Nora Joyce and Ann Beamish. It's possible the novel's only of interest to those eager to read more about Beckett, even if imagined. But it's a delight for that.As I say, there is story and plotline, but nothing much happens even though Beckett is seen in Dublin and in Normandy as well as Paris and all the long route to Rousillon. We read a lot of Beckett thinking. He doesn't seem to be mentally filing away material to be written about later. Still, the whole atmosphere of the novel is Beckettian. The protagonist even has a sucking stone. And he pays attention to trees. A seminal moment is his memory of hiding with a friend high in a tree. This scene repeats itself at various points in the novel and then Baker frames the story as Beckett notices 2 boys sitting in a tree as he arrives in Saint Lo in 1945. Because you know you're reading about Beckett, you're on the lookout for 2 tired figures on a road at night waiting near a tree. You're rewarded near midpoint of the novel when the protagonist and Suzanne wait in just that way. There's no indication it has significance other than to the reader who knows one of those waiting is Beckett who'll later place the characters Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot.I thought Baker's writing poetic, whatever that means. What pleased me about it was finding metaphors embedded in sentences describing ordinary occurrences, such as letters of denunciation to the Gestapo being intercepted by the Maquis, which Beckett thinks of as flames which do not catch. Miss Beamish, a character in Rousillon, recognizes the protagonist's need to write. She tells him just as a snail leaves a slime trail, so the writer has to leave a trail of words. The book's full of such lovely ways of seeing.I'm a Beckett fan and came to the novel because I'd read it's about his and Suzanne's time hidden in the country. The title itself carries associations with Waiting for Godot. I believe you can never have too much Beckett. So I was spellbound by it and by Baker's imagining of these people who're so familiar to me. I enjoyed my reading of the novel. In fact, I was moved. I didn't mind that he's not named. He would've wanted it that way, too....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 24, 2017","Jan 07, 2018","May 21, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26109042-a-country-road-a-tree

I have and enjoyed the fine 2-volume work on him by Joan Richardson, the first volume of which was published in 1986. Reviews of the Mariani biography, however, made a case for its high caliber and also reminded me that since Richardson's biography was 30 years old that Stevens needed a fresher look. It's a quiet biography because Stevens was a quiet man. It's not fair to say he wasn't an interesting person because his towering intellect and literary gifts demonstrate otherwise. And it's not necessary for a poet to be a drunk or a philanderer or an adventurer in order for his biography to engage us. The fact of his quiet pattern of behavior, the way he lived his life, simply makes it more challenging for a biographer to keep us absorbed in the subject. Stevens is always linked with how he earned his living as a vice president of the Hartford Indemnity and Insurance Company. The particulars of his daily life is always a combination of his spending his days in insurance and his nights at home writing poetry. It's good poetry, but it's easy to understand how a man who lived a quiet, private life, one not marked by any unusual circumstance, any breath of misconduct or even anger, can cause a biographer to have to work hard to maintain interest in his subject. One way, of course, and especially in the case of a great writer like Stevens, is to provide informative critical analysis of the man's work. Mariani's gloss on Stevens is detailed, but I'm not sure it adds anything to that of Harold Bloom or Helen Vendler, meaning we're left with a book which doesn't offer any new biographical material or new, insightful perceptions of the work. After 30 years, the biography by Joan Richardson is probably still definitive.At the end of the book Mariani comments that 60 years after his death Stevens is considered one of the most important poets of the 20th and the still young 21st centuries, sharing a place with Rilke, Yeats, and Neruda. That comment, I felt, mitigated the misgivings I felt at questioning Mariani's criticism of Stevens's work.

Not just their contexts, but even some titles drive the point home: Underworld, End Zone, White Noise. And Zero K, which is literally death represented by a facility in Central Asia called the Convergence where people are cryogenically frozen and stored to await reawakening in a future of advanced technologies and biomedical progress. At the heart of the story is Jeffrey Lockhart who joins his father Ross, one of the planet's incredibly wealthy men, at the Convergence to witness the launch of wife and stepmother Artis into the holding pattern of cryopreservation to await resurrection into a new life. Later in the novel, when Ross decides to join her, we enter a novel of loss and desertion whose keening echoes down the long halls of the Convergence and the canyoned streets of New York City.In another chamber of the novel's heart is a cliche. DeLillo describes the storage area in which the clients await their reawakening. Each is encapsuled in a liquid-filled--nitrogen, I think--tube, all body hair removed. The capsules are kept upright in a huge underground room, long ranks and files of them, an image made familiar to us by science fiction and dystopian medical suggestions. But DeLillo is also thinking of birth. The novel floats the idea that death and birth converge to meet at the same point, much like the image of ouroboros, the mythological snake eating its tail and one of the many zeroes pointed to in the novel. Storage for death is also storage of the embryo-like remains for life. One character comments each tubed and dormant passenger is waiting, all the time in the world.DeLillo's stark prose is appropriate to its subject. Sometimes reading a DeLillo novel can seem like reading classical Greek drama, setting reduced to essentials and elementals foregrounded by character, dialogue, idea, conflict. So here in Zero K, where time and fate and death matter so much, every word weighted with significance. In the long sterile hallways of the Convergence, broken only by mysterious doors, and in the hollow--somehow--New York City streets lined with buildings distinguished by doors, there's always the sense of starting over, of entering a new orientation. Names have to be reassigned to everything in order to generate existence. As Greek dramas explain character and vulnerability to fate, so DeLillo's cryogenic facility is a place where one is scrubbed clean, depilated, erased, and introduced into a new phase of existence.This is a thought-provoking novel, and deeply satisfying in its philosophical currents. I forgive DeLillo the clunkiness of his storage area cliche and his sailing of zeroes through the novel like frisbees--the zero of the famous 2013 meteor strike in a frozen lake in Chelyabinsk, Russia, the absolute zero suggested by cryopreservation and its bodily state, the zero of the sun converging with the earth's horizon. This is one of the truly fine novels I've read this year. But I expected as much. Of our lifetime's dazzlingly significant writers, many have left us and some are writing more modestly than they once did, perhaps leaving DeLillo as il miglior fabbro of our age....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 16, 2016","Nov 28, 2016","May 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26154389-zero-k

Originally shortlisted as a biography, it was moved by the Pulitzer Board to the history category and given the prize in preference to the other history candidates. That along with the rather grand subtitle, A Life on the Frontier of a New America, led me to believe T. J. Stiles's concern was history as much as the man. I thought this might be a different look at a familiar subject. We all know the Custer story and are steeped in the glory and legend of the Last Stand. That perspective didn't interest me. What I knew about Stiles's biography cum history suggested it offered something different.Stiles doesn't disappoint. He begins by saying that Custer has always been defined by his spectacular death. His aim as biographer was to tell the story of his life as it was caught up in the swirl of the monumental modernist revolution America itself was undergoing. Custer's times, Stiles says, defined him: the Civil War and its technological innovations, the birth of American capitalism, the westward push of the railroads, the epic change in western territories as European culture displaced that of native Americans, and the great racial shift of the African American population. It's the Custer swimming in this great tide of American industrial and social growth as it approached the end of its 1st century, struggling to keep his head above the flood and to succeed--just as many other Americans--that Stiles writes about.To show that Custer lived a life in this mad swirl of history rather than a man simply pointed toward a rash act one June afternoon in 1876, Stiles goes to great lengths to describe the huge historical shifts he was a part of, whether the emancipation of slaves, the leap of railroads into the western landscape, or the realistic nature of Indian society which found itself in the way of America's leap. The man lived in times of social upheaval and industrial expansion. He became a war hero and therefore a public man, as he desired. His involvement in the currents of the American upheaval beginning in 1861 followed his ambitions. In order to accurately describe Custer's activities in his time Stiles has to describe his time. When Custer dabbles in the stock market, the economy and beginnings of post-Civil War capitalism is explained. We're made aware of changing perspectives of America's conflict with the Plains peoples. I'd not before been made to look at native Americans in a nationalistic way. Stiles's view of the great Sioux-Cheyenne alliance is as a kind of empire won through conflict with lesser tribes and emphatically consolidated as a regional power without an organized governmental structure, and when the Army entered traditional tribal lands it was an invasion. In the book's point of view the wars with the Sioux, Comanche, and other peoples were much like conflict between nations, albeit mismatched.The portrait of Custer the man is differently angled, too. As a soldier he was mostly a pain in the ass to those he led, those he served with, and those who commanded him. He was self-indulgent, not serious about duty in the Army, and convinced the rules didn't apply to him. Brash and reckless, as we know. He believed in the old values present in America at the time, even as he was sworn to work against certain of those values. So he was a racist at heart though an officer in an army fighting--in part, to be sure--to overturn slavery. As a soldier campaigning against Indians, he admired their life of freedom on the land and thought they should be allowed to retain it.Rather than define Custer's life by his death, Stiles points to 3 trials as important benchmarks in his life, indicators of character. Hence the title. Custer was court-martialed twice. In 1861, on the cusp of graduation from West Point, as his fellow cadets were streaming south to take up military assignments, north or south, in the armies assembling to fight the war over secession, Custer was detained and court-martialed for a failure to enforce discipline while on duty. In 1867 he was court-martialed for abandoning his unit to visit his wife. The 3d trial was the 1879 court of inquiry investigating charges that Major Marcus Reno of the 7th Cavalry was responsible for the disaster at the Little Bighorn. Stiles tells the Last Stand story through testimony presented at Reno's court of inquiry. Because little was known in 1879 about what really happened, the book's narrative of Custer's last couple of hours is largely blank. But that's one of Stiles's main points, that the real story of Custer the man isn't in his death but in what had gone before. I thought it fitting that such fine, panoramic history should taper off into enigma. The ending rhymes with the enigma that was the man....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 29, 2016",May 2016,"Apr 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24738291-custer-s-trials

The extremes of weather and the extremes of human corruption and malevolence combine to create a danger so severe that some feel they've been abandoned by a caring divinity. To compete with the pervading evil aboard the whaler Volunteer there are only a couple of good men. In the frozen wastes there are only innocent Esquimaux, and bears whose strongest credo is eating. There's a priest but even he knows ""God doesn't care whether we believe in Him or not.""This is a novel about a whaling voyage to the Arctic in the mid-19th century when the industry's in decline, whale oil giving way to kerosene and vegetable oils. The blurbs mention Moby-Dick, and an early scene where, in the streets of Hull, Patrick Sumner is warned about the captain of the Volunteer reinforces the likeness. There's another prophecy on p136 which reminds us of Ishmael's fateful voyage aboard the Pequod. But there's a blurb also invoking Blood Meridian. Violence is certainly a theme of McGuire's just as surely of McCarthy's. Creating waste in a frigid waste by slaughtering animals rather than Indians. The religious references remind us of McCarthy's novel and the extremes of Arctic desert are easy stand-ins for those of Blood Meridian's southwest. But The North Water can stand very well on its own. McGuire is good at describing the brutal landscape and weather. It's a good descriptive novel making plain the realities of 19th century whaling, unwashed men, and hard work in hard weather. It's good at making us see how the innocence of those who live in the gelid far north, animal and human, contrasts with the despoiling malignance of those who intrude in a region where God doesn't care.

Since I already had To the River in hand, I thought I'd see what she's about before committing to the newer one. Turns out she's about a lot.Laing writes about the River Ouse in Sussex in southern England. Her goal was to walk the river from its source to the Channel, her intention to show what ""that little patch of England looked like one midsummer week at the beginning of the twenty-first century."" The result of her weeklong ramble along the river is marvelous, a book much like the W. G. Sebald novel The Rings of Saturn.It's meditative, digressive, and concerns itself very much with history, memory, and nature. We all remember that it's the Ouse in which Virginia Woolf drowned herself. It flows through Rodmell where she lived and through which Laing walks, and so she reflects at length about Virginia and Leonard. There are also long a digression about Kenneth Grahame. I'd never known before that his The Wind and the Willows is set along the Ouse. She reflects on the classical idea of hell, the nature of pollen, the nature of memory, the discovery of dinosaurs (the first iguanodon fossil had been found there), and, to contrast real science with the bogus, the story of the Piltdown Man forgery, the fake skull fragments having been seeded in a gravel pit along the river's northern reaches. And there's much more as well as lyrical passages about the flora and fauna of the river she encounters walking its course.It's not surprising the river's ecology is also a concern. She notes some recent animal species migrated from other regions, and even from other parts of Europe. They're not always welcomed by the locals and therefore sometimes looked on with a jaundiced eye by her. She writes nostalgically about species which have been lost in the recent past. Physical changes to the river draw her attention, whether the natural change of flooding or the man-made changes of development.But she thinks that no changes have affected the rampant beauty of the river in its course and the landscape surrounding it. Her descriptions are rhapsodic, her love for this ""little patch of England"" evident in how the words make sparkling images on the page. Sparkle is a good word, I think--she writes so well that my impression of the book as a whole is a sparkling harmonizing of sun and sky and water reflecting each other. At the beginning she said she felt like Ishmael, needing to be near water. And so she set out to walk along the Ouse's water to the sea. And what she experiences during her journey, not only what the senses bring her but also the mental jogs the river and landscape evoke in her, is beautifully told. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"May 10, 2016","May 26, 2016","Apr 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13592875-to-the-river

That's the mantra of his book. The subject is geopolitics as influenced and determined by geography. It shapes how nations relate to each other and how they ultimately fail or succeed, how they're limited but also how they often spring free of the bounds geography has placed on them. Apparently Kaplan doesn't, like many geopolitical analysts, have his own overriding theory of how nations interact and compete, or doesn't, at least, theme his book on an original vision. Instead, he subscribes to the ideas of others and ultimately uses them to come to his own original conclusions. He supports the idea of Samuel Huntington's clash of civilizations and John Mearsheimer's idea that great powers naturally strive toward hegemony over its region, but his geographical focus most uses the principle of British geographer Halford Mackinder's Eurasian heartland, or world island. Mackinder considered the whole Eurasian landmass an island centered on Russia, the heartland. Around this is a vast rimland running from Morocco to Korea and Japan. The main geopolitical competition between nations has always been, and is now, control of the key pivots in this natural design, like Iran, the Balkans, the Anatolian land bridge at the Dardanelles, India, and China. The key to it all is the Indian Ocean. Whoever dominates the Indian Ocean dominates the world island and all the energies of the rimland. I realize I've described it badly. Kaplan, however, is convincing. The focus of his book is on some of the key actors in this geography, showing how the shape of the land and populations have determined their history and how they're using it today. So he writes about Russia's long struggle to obtain all-weather ports, hence the Afghanistan adventure and the need to maintain Syria as a client. He writes about the rise of China and what this means for East Asia. He describes the Chinese-Indian competition to control the Indian Ocean, the importance of Iran as the pivot of the whole mad teetertotter and its important relations with Turkey. The geographies of all these actors determines how they will most likely conduct themselves in the 21st century.The final section is about America. We have 3 problems, the American Kaplan writes. We will have to continue to deal with Middle Eastern instability, which will only get worse as social media and globalization turn the region into urban spaces linked by instant communication. Most analysts feel that at some point the U. S. will have to confront Chinese military expansion into the South China Sea and westward into the Eurasian heartland in order to maintain our presence in East Asia. Mexico. According to Kaplan, many geopolitical experts feel Mexico is on the brink of becoming a failed state. This slide into disrule can only impact the U. S. negatively. Consequently, some feel that the money plowed into 2 lengthy Middle Eastern wars would have been better spent in making Mexico more stable and economically powerful, to our benefit.What I've written only scratches the surface of the history, geography, and ideas presented by Kaplan in his study of how geography has and will influence the fate of the nations of the world island.

It's devoted to examining a wide range of contemporary issues from the context of philosophical argument as well as older, universal philosophical questions considered in the light of modern practice. Therefore, discussions in a discipline which is both changing and unchanged since the time of Socrates and on such topics as the morality of using drones alongside those pertaining to truth or knowledge mean the ideas deliberated here are both old and new.As the title indicates, editors Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley have assembled a selection of 133 of the Stone essays divided into 4 broad sections: Philosophy, Science, Religion and Morals, and Society. Within those divisions are subsections which focus on distinctive issues. Beginning with ""What Is a Philosopher?"" and ending with the 133d essay, ""Navigating Past Nihilism,"" 97 philosophers of our time write about modern ideas and affairs within a philosophical perspective, from the current meaning of freedom to racial democracy in America to the threat of global warming to the need for creating moral machines as we approach the onset of artificial intelligence to how much better literature makes us to the meaning of time.

The violet color evokes sadness and in the heavy atmosphere of The Waste The phrase is Eliot's, from The Waste Land, meaning the evening, end of day. The violet color evokes sadness and in the heavy atmosphere of The Waste Land suggests death. The 48-year old Roiphe has written a book about death and the relationships of 6 writers with it. It's also an impressive work of criticism. It stands to reason that her inquiry into these writers at the end of their lives would consider what their work revealed about their perceptions of death, particularly their own. The weakest of the studies, I thought, was that on John Updike. He was, she implies, surprised by its quick, unseen approach through lung cancer. It seemed important to him to continue working, so that he turned out one final slim volume of poetry written in part as he succumbed to the disease, but I thought the chapter on him misfocused and that it propitiously, perhaps, spent too much time discussing the sexual attitudes conveyed by his fiction and by the author's life. The best critical analysis was that of Dylan Thomas's poetry and her nimble demonstration of how he expressed a wish for death in his writings and rushed hastily toward it in the life he lived. There's also Susan Sontag's abject fear of death and fierce denial when it was near. Sigmund Freud calmly studied death's arrival. He denied himself pain killers until the very end so he could be conscious of the fascinating transformation. Maurice Sendak thought of death as an adventure and revered it.Roiphe's writing about these people offers no real surprises. She writes factually, presenting only what's known about their deaths and their thoughts on the end of life. It's in her ""Epilogue"" that she begins to write conclusions about what she's learned from her research. In this final section she talks to James Salter. At the time he was still alive and 89-years old. He told Roiphe he didn't think about his own death. He'd seen some death--flying planes in the military, the accidental death of a daughter. Talking to Salter allowed Roiphe to more clearly process what she'd learned about these writers dying. He allowed her to see that maybe we don't need to think about it. ""You take your knowledge and move on."" Talking to Salter she realized you work while dying, or you don't, you struggle against it or you give in, you maintain control of your emotions or not, you deny its coming or you accept, you pray or not, you continue reading or you sit and reflect on meaning, you kill the pain or you don't. You run from it or you run willingly toward it. ""In the end the deaths are the same."" In the end they're released. ""The struggle, once it's over, doesn't exist.""I enjoyed this little book very much. To be honest, it's a little uneven. We know a lot about Updike's philosophical views on the nature of existence and the end of it, for instance, from such novels as Roger's Version and from another book on death, the philosophical work Why Does the World Exist? in which he plays a key part as the only writer who's interviewed on the subject. Yet Roiphe chose to keep her writing focused on the bedroom Updike we know best. I thought her chapter on Sendak uninspired. I was bored, at any rate. But others soared: Sontag's story was harrowing, Dylan Thomas's brought me new perceptions of his work I'd not been aware of. I enjoyed most her telling of the afternoon she spent with James Salter and the deep insights he led her to. ""He writes more radiant sentences than any writer alive,"" she said of him. But he, too, who never thought about death, died, and before the book was published. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 09, 2016","Jul 21, 2016","Mar 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25733900-the-violet-hour

It's a comic novel with a kernel of serious assertions, perhaps philosophic observation, at its center. Hilarious situations and dialogue swirl around this center as huge storms encircle Jupiter. Bits of Paul Murray's weightier views appear to have been torn from the novel's heavy core and can be encountered careening amidst the zany circulation around it.Murray's a funny writer. He's created dialogue and circumstances and outlandish characters that'll make you smile and might make the bubble of a laugh rise in you. It's a novel of the recent financial crisis but located in Dublin where Claude Martingale is an analyst in the taxing work of making money for clients while rival banking institutions are ground out of existence beneath the groundswell of colossal failure. In the opening pages, at the outer rim of the swirling burlesque, we have Claude set up as mark by a would-be writer against the moral void of big financial institutions. This is like the big bang moment from which the novel expands in several directions and permutations of mark and void.Murray is a skillful writer. While he makes you smile or chuckle he also makes you think. He writes interesting ways of seeing the modern technical world. Murray sees that technology has made us all more individual. We've used it to paper over the emptiness created between us and to analyze the encyclopedic array of facts it brings us as we try to recover systems of thought that'll bring the constantly changing shards of our lives into a reality. This point of view surfaces from time to time later in the novel in various disguises. They're derivatives. Murray enlarges the idea through reality becoming story built from images which are derivatives of the self, our chosen method of defeating death and time.But this is just part of the dust spiraling around the dense center. In another sense the void is the center and the realities are the bits torn from it which Murray grabs to use as construction materials in his narrative. There's a painting called The Mark and the Void which is emblem for all this ""cascading darkness,"" just as there are empty characters, clocks striking thirteen, Cyrano de Bergerac, a hoot of a boy named Remington Steele, and flowing through the middle of the narrative and Dublin itself the River Liffey (life) which Claude sometimes mistakes for Lethe (death).I'd been impressed with the earlier Paul Murray novel Skippy Dies. About another type of institution, a boarding school for boys, it also weaves together hilarity with serious ideas. So I looked forward to The Mark and the Void and was rewarded. Now I look forward to what he does next....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 18, 2017","Feb 07, 2017","Feb 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20804235-the-mark-and-the-void

I've read only a handful of the novels and some of the philosophy. These letters inspire me to become more involved with her novels which, we're told, are powered by her philosophic ideas.I didn't get a sense of her deep intellectual currents from the letters. Almost all of them are personal rather than concerned with her writing or teaching. Because she cared deeply for those she corresponded with, they're more affectionate and newsy than informative about her professional life. Strongly influenced by Simone Weil and Plato, for instance, she thought Good a real moral force in the world and the moral life a realistic goal. Her fiction, novels often about good and evil, carry the same ideas as her philosophic thought.These appraisals of her beliefs and character, however, are hidden deep in the letters. For the most part they offer little insight into her fiction or philosophy.

It's outline because a comprehensive history of the 1st 900 or so years of the Roman world would need to be much bigger and necessitate more detail. But even outline can be valuable, and S. P. Q. R. is.Beard is interesting in her discussions of the difficulties of making sense of what we know about the Romans, of deciding what's fact and what's exaggeration, legend, or simple distortion of history over time and many chroniclers. Robert Moor reminds us that knowledge changes shape as it changes hands. Beard makes plain that we're right to be skeptical of many of the stories that have come down to us of the rulers, both of the republic and the 1st 2 centuries of empire. One of the strengths of the centuries she writes about, one of the key elements of Rome's success, was political stability, possible only if the qualities and characteristics of the rulers themselves governed more or less sensibly. But stability was built into the political system, too, another key ingredient of success, and important because we're told the qualities and characteristics of those who ruled had little effect on the actual narrative of Roman history and its developments, or on the common inhabitants. But Beard reminds us again that what we know of individuals is distorted by the vast amount of time between them and us.For me the best parts of the book were the final chapters in which Beard discusses some aspects of everyday life, how the empire affected its citizens, and how it related to the larger world it governed.The years covered in the book precede the wide influence of Christianity. Only a few pages are devoted to its early rise and competition with the Roman pantheon of deities and Roman social fabric. Beard doesn't discuss at all known effects of Rome on Christianity, but I received impressions from her book that some elements of Roman theology were adopted by the Christian faith to become part of its orthodoxy, which is to say the Romans believed it first. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 29, 2016","Oct 04, 2016","Jan 26, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25013067-spqr

Interesting in that it's the 1st comprehensive narrative of the war--or at least the 1st I know of. Interesting in that I knew almost none of what Razoux writes. Even when the war was going on it was only at the periphery of my awareness because it wasn't widely covered by western media. So even if it'd been in the front of my mind I wouldn't have known much--information wasn't available. Interesting because it was modern industrial warfare between 2 belligerents with large modern militaries. It's a war deserving of study for that alone, for seeing how war's state of the art has progressed because all the arms of Iraq and Iran were involved. Armor, artillery, navies, and air forces were extensively used during the 8 years of the war, singly and in various combinations. The war even saw periods in which enemy cities were bombed and when chemical weapons were used on the battlefield. It was a savage affair. Finally, the book cleared up some murky events of America's Middle Eastern policies from the '80s I'd puzzled over. I remember the huge U. S. Navy presence in the Gulf during those years, engaged as they were in escorting and protecting oil tanker traffic. Razoux describes a fairly active, intense naval war between our Navy and the much smaller, lighter Iranian vessels. I don't even remember that even being hinted at the time.The book is also a fascinating look at the 2 opposing countries at war, especially how they evolved after the hostilities and affect the Middle East we see today. Two wars with America removed Saddam Hussein as leader of Iraq, of course. What's left has been radically altered and enfeebled. But Razoux's portrait of Iran is the most fascinating because they're essentially the same country today, run by the same types of Islam-driven leaders and mindset. And now that Iraq has been weakened, the regional balance of power has swung in their favor. The same leadership has been energized with new opportunities.Most interestingly, Razoux, near the end of his history, is understanding about Iran's drive toward nuclear weaponry. He says that if atomic weapons had been developed during World War I, all the little countries of Europe--presumably smaller actors like Belgium and Poland and Serbia--in the same position of marginalized power vis a vis the great powers as Iran is today, would've also tried to proliferate their own atomic weapons.

We're familiar with Columbus's discovery of the islands in Todorov's subject is the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and Mexico in the 16th century. We're familiar with Columbus's discovery of the islands in the Caribbean and their Indians. And how Cortez conquered the Aztecs with a relatively small band of men is an even more familiar story. We've read accounts of priests Christianizing the Indians and how the population was enslaved and decimated by disease. We understand the conquest in terms of the leading edge of 16th century technology coming into abrupt contact with a society not possessing a written language.Todorov tells us the narrative is one of how information is processed. History understood through semiotics. He sees the indigenous peoples as unable to improvise in the face of Spanish force and manipulation. Their world operated through ritual and symbol, the interpretations obtained in the past applied to the present. Spanish improvisation overwhelmed ritual. The better, more pragmatic understanding of available information led to the subjugation of a unique civilization. Though his history ends about 1600 or so, that central tenet of European-Amerindian contact, the establishment of one rule of law over the other, the submission of one culture to another as one system of information proved more useful than the other, remained the pattern for the next 350 years. Todorov does simplify it somewhat in his ""Epilogue"" by reducing the evolution of symbology to the possession of writing, which favors improvisation.He addresses other aspects of the Spanish impact in the New World as well. The great death from European diseases--it's estimated that as many as 90% of the Indian population died during the century, an unintended circumstance coupled with the general brutality of the occupation to create a genocide--is covered at some length, as is that population's enslavement. But he spends more time on the Christianization of the Indians, and it leads to a conclusion I found surprising. Many in the Spanish clergy didn't think Indian society necessarily inferior to that of the Spanish. In fact, Todorov tries to show how many of the stereotypes emphasizing the otherness of Indian society were exaggerated by conquistadores. The brutality of the conquest suggested there was little difference between them, and Todorov writes the conquest became that of a sacrifice society by a massacre society. The 2 cultures in Mexico formed what he called a massacrifice society.The style is academic and thickly-worded, made even more difficult by the frequent lengthy quotes of contemporary Spanish sources. But it's an interesting read. It's a subject which has always fascinated me, and this is a different, compelling way to look at a familiar history. I came to it aware of its controversies, maybe attracted by them. I'm glad I did. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 11, 2016","Mar 31, 2016","Dec 21, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/74737.The_Conquest_of_America

The qualifier seems necessary because there were limitations placed on the biographer Jonathan Bate. The first to be given access to the huge archive of Hughes's unpublished writings, permission was later revoked by the widow, Carol Hughes, ostensibly because he was uncovering too much of the libertine and not enough of the literary. Hughes famously--or infamously--was a womanizer and had many affairs, some with writers whose names are well-known and some whose names can only be hinted at. Bate provides enough detail to satisfy the voyeur in us while at the same time, being an intelligent critic, gives us a full and fascinating portrait of the poet and his work.Hughes, as we all know, was the husband of the suicidal poet Sylvia Plath. Their marriage was one of the most interesting unions and collaborations in literary history. Hughes's love for her and his loss of her were the defining events of his life. Bate isn't able to add much to a story already so well known. It's all covered by him rather quickly considering the importance of those years to Hughes and their impact on the poetry to follow. Still, there's much story left, many sides to Ted Hughes--outdoorsman, eco-warrior, Poet Laureate, Shakespearian scholar, expert on myth and the shamanistic--and the biography makes a full man of him.If this isn't the biography Bate wanted to write, it's still an excellent one.

I wasn't familiar with Christopher Coker and assumed a study of fiction about war through its characters must be the work of a literary critic. Neither of my initial ideas were right. The book is a study of the nature of war through its effect on men represented in the fiction we read. Christopher Coker himself is described in another book as a ""philosopher of war."" He calls himself a social scientist and his goal to help understand the existential reality of war as it's re-imagined in fiction.Coker's study looks at characters in war through 5 archetypes: warriors, heroes, villains, survivors, and victims. He writes in detail about 25 works of fiction representing these character types. The fiction he writes about spans all of military history, from Troy to World War II, and characters as diverse as Achilles, Falstaff, and Blood Meridian's Judge Holden, works ranging from The Iliad to Slaughterhouse-Five. But his subject is war as an elemental trait in politics among nations. He uses such subjects as Achilles and Dr Strangelove to illustrate all this and the effects on men. I know that Coker believes war to be an innate part of being human, coded in our evolutionary past. ""Humanity and war are joined at the hip and it is most unlikely as a species we are done with war yet,"" he writes.But in the end Coker does give us insightful glosses of the works and characters he chooses as archetypes. I haven't read all the fiction he glosses. However, I recognize he writes knowledgeably enough about those I'm familiar with that I respect what he says about the works as fiction. The farther I read in the book the more I thought him accomplished as a reader of character and the books they inhabit.The book closes strongly. In his summing-up he acknowledges that though his book studies men at war the voices particularly missed are those of women. He writes that women are the chief victims of war, wives and mothers left behind to become collateral damage through the loss of their men. It's no surprise that women have often been seen in literature as checks on their men at war.A negative property of the book is that it's marred by many typos and misspellings.

I've known Pattiann Rogers for many years through her poetry, and my fondness for that led me to these essays.As in her poetry, the aim of her essays is to demonstrate the universal in the particular. Star dust in the oak leaf has been a theme of many before her. Thomas Wolfe and T. S. Eliot come to mind. I can remember their work expressing the same unity of all existence, but it's my opinion she writes the theme with equal insight and majesty. Her prose makes clear what her poetry veils with metaphor and the figurative. Writing about the family or the death of a small lizard, it's always in relation to the greater universe.As you might expect, she's equally comfortable writing about the wren as the Andromeda galaxy. In the unity of life on earth and its relation to the physical cosmos as we know it, in all existence in relation to itself in combination and function, she sees divinity. She wants to believe in God but not the omnipotent being and creator. Creation, she says, is an ongoing process and one in which humans play a crucial role. In one of these essays she spends considerable time discussing how human perceptions and acknowledgement give meaning to everything and how important this is because we may be the only cognitive intelligence in the universe. How she joins the spiritual with the physical world of science is dignified, unapologetic, and permissible. She recognizes the divine, sees a holiness that only comes into existence as a poem witnesses it. At one point she commented that her poems are prayers. In a sense poetry can be seen as religious experience.The book concludes with 3 interviews in which she expands on all this and talks about her need to join poetry with science, specifically to show that poetry can be seen in science which, after all, reveals the development of life and man. I was impressed with the deep wisdom held within these essays....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 31, 2015","Jan 08, 2016","Nov 10, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13235817-the-grand-array

Some of the pairings are common sense, some seem more peculiar. The pairings are supposed to represent affinities I'm not sure he always successfully demonstrates. Successful or not in matching didn't matter so much to me because he writes so wonderfully here--he's always been in love with these people--and glosses the work so magnificently that one is able to look at each of them independently. I wasn't surprised to see Ralph Waldo Emerson considered alongside Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman with Herman Melville. I raised my eyebrows at Nathaniel Hawthorne's combination with Henry James. That relationship is the most jarring, but I don't know James that well and may not understand Bloom's thinking.The analyses aren't in depth. The works of these writers are too enormous and powerful, limiting Bloom to rather brief treatments, in some cases only a few examples from a lifetime of work. Only 3 Faulkner novels are discussed, for instance, and 3 poems by Robert Frost. By comparison, most of Hart Crane's work--admittedly he died young and left relatively little--is glossed. But Crane is also a Bloom favorite. I don't recall that he's written at length about him elsewhere.Bloom has a word for these larger-than-life heroes of our literature. He says they've been oracles, they're the ones considered capable of inhabiting the eminent space of American oracle and singing in the Orphic voice....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 10, 2016","Feb 18, 2016","Nov 04, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22570795-the-daemon-knows

Vollmann's primary literary project is a series of novels he calls Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes. His great subject is William T. Vollmann's primary literary project is a series of novels he calls Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes. His great subject is the contact of European culture with that of native Americans, and the overwhelming of Indian societies by those of Europeans and their imperialism. In earlier novels he'd written about the Viking settlements in Iceland the easternmost maritime islands of North America (The Ice-Shirt), the Franklin Expedition and its search for the Northwest Passage (The Rifles), French Canada (Fathers and Crows), and Jamestown (Argall). Those who've followed this series of novels understood he had to address the subjugation of the Plains Indian tribes. This 5th novel, or Dream, tells that side of the history through the Nez Perce War of 1877 in which that tribe refused to settle in its assigned reservation and fought a running campaign with the Army through Idaho, Yellowstone, and Montana as it tried to escape into Canada. The Dying Grass is an impressive novel in its size, its ambition, its research, and its breadth of history. It's told in an innovative style, following the 2 strands of Army and Indian narrative. The Army's side of the story is told through a large cast of characters using almost exclusively dialogue and interior monologue. Imagine War and Peace with the French point of view told entirely through dialogue and you get an idea of what this is like. The Nez Perce narrative is told through the traditional omniscient narrator who presents the Indian perspective in their voice and sensibilities. This doubled-stranded telling, which never gets far from history, allows Vollmann to present the major issues of white settlement of the frontier in conflict with Native American traditional ownership of the land. The points of view are much as we've come to understand them. In general, white settlers and the Army are portrayed as racist, lustful, greedy, and ruthless in their dealings with Indians. The Nez Perce, on the other hand, are seen as peaceful and innocent pastorialists who cherish the land. Though they are also impetuously violent. Both sides understand they can't peacefully exist side by side.One of the great strengths of Vollmann's novel is historical authenticity. In addition to the convincing societal traits mentioned above, the portrait of the U. S. Army in the field is captured in every detail, even as it's spun out in cialogue. I thought it realistic that these soldieers gave frequent thought to the Civil War. That earlier war was only 12 years in their past and, for most, especially the officers, it was the defining event of their lives, the time of their most intense military learning, and therefore never far from their minds. The simpler Nez Perce are primarily motivated by their loving relationship with the land.The Dying Grass is a huge novel. This 5th Dream is 1158 pages, and that's followed by 125 pages of appendices. Reading it is kind of a project. But worth it. Though long, it's an easy read. Vollmann has structured the text on each page, mixed as it is between dialogue, interior monologue, and leaps of attention among a crowd of characters experiencing the same things, so that it indicates which is which by varying depths of indentations. The pages look a little like poetry rather than dense prose, and this allows the pages to flow easily. Though imposing, it's accessible and never intimidates.Where will Vollmann go next? Wikipedia's article on the Landscapes suggest he may write about the 20th century Navaho, King Philip's War in colonial Rhode Island, or Captain Cook's voyage of discovery to Hawaii. There were 14 years between Argall and The Dying Grass, so the wait may be a long one. I'm already looking forward to it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 25, 2015","Mar 14, 2016","Aug 05, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23399010-the-dying-grass

It's a novel made up of the conversations of Vincent, Marsha, and Emily that run the course of a summer spent in East Hampton. Stephen Koch, in his ""Introduction,"" described this as a kind of reality novel. As he tells it, Rosenkrantz began it by taping the conversations of friends during a summer at the beach. Then she created her novel by reducing the talk of 25 people and 1500 pages of transcript into 215 pages and 28 conversations between 3 of them--not characters, we're told, but real people. It's very much a novel of the 1960s in that what the trio of friends talk about at the beach or over dinner or in the car are the hot topics of the day: the sexual revolution, the gay-straight dynamic (gay Vincent's 2 closest friends are Marsha and Emily), drugs, rock & roll, the New York scene of Andy Warhol and Susan Sontag, literary culture, food, and psychoanalysis. It's almost a little encyclopedia of its time and yet because Vietnam isn't a topic in these conversations you feel a little as if there's a hole. But though the war was so much of a part of our 60s consciousness, for these 3 in the summer of 1965 it hasn't yet become such a passionate issue. Passion is reserved for sex. All of them are intent on talking out their past relationships and what they hope for in the near future. It's a funny book, too. It's kind of like watching a sitcom because the banter is so teasing while it stings with the deep understanding of friendship. Vincent is funny all the time. Marsha and Emily are funniest at the beach watching the men. Besides being fun to read Talk is also always interesting.

But I did read it, and I did like it. A lot. I'd started Naked Earth once before, probably a couple of years ago. But I'd lost interest right away when I read in the ""Introduction"" by Perry Link that the novel had been one of Chang's novels commissioned with a grant from the United States Information Service and intended to describe the mercilessly oppressive face of Mao's China. Link goes on to write that Chang is too good a writer to let her fiction be ""distorted"" for political reasons. However firmly I agree with that now, at the time I plunged into the first chapters of the novel to be greeted with a portrait of, as I expected, mechanical obedience, rote thinking, and dogmatic manipulation during the land reform movement in China's rural areas, I'd decided I didn't want to read what I thought was a polemic. I set the novel aside. Earlier this year I'd read one of Chang's later novels, the autobiographical Little Reunions. It presented different challenges, a narrative shifting back and forth across decades and one populated by a cast of over a hundred characters, many known by more than one name or title. I never really engaged with Little Reunions--held at arm's length by its tangle of characters--and I didn't want to read Naked Earth.But you understand how it is. We're obligated to the books we own. They want to be read. They expect to be read and wait shelved or piled on table or floor for their time to come. They want to be used, they wait for the opportunity to tell us what they know. So I came back to Naked Earth. I'd finished a novel--I forget which--and casting around for what to read next I was confronted for the umpteenth time with Naked Earth and felt that tug of guilt again. And dating as it did from sometime in 2015, it was the oldest unread book I had. So I began it again but skipped Perry Link's ""Introduction."" I dove right into the first chapter.I liked the novel and admire it. It's a novel of revolutionary China in the years 1949 to 1953, during the period of the communist consolidation of power. I did struggle a bit in the opening chapters dealing with rural land reform and such anticipated ideas as self-criticisms, cadres, and struggle sessions, but, their work completed in the tiny village, Chang quickly shifts her characters to propaganda work on newspapers in Peking and Shanghai. The same personal dangers always threaten wherever they are. They're subjected to constant scrutiny and evaluation, and they attend many meetings aimed at strengthening political devotion and correcting any deviations of behavior. Chang carefully writes each character tiptoeing through mine fields of how to act and mind what you say, all part of playing ""chess moves aimed at minimizing punishment."" It's a harsh, rigid life. But what I like best about the novel is that it's not political. Chang wrote a novel which puts a human face on people caught in the inhumanity of Chinese revolutionary political struggles. To me it's much more a novel of personal interactions within a sterile system. Maybe what the USIS wanted was a polemic. That what they got is more like a tragic romance or a romantic tragedy caused by conditions of state may say all it needs to about political perceptions. What I got was a novel set alight by love.

Carefully looking at a variety of books on the subject, I chose Tom Wells's The War Within. Wanting something more scholarly than not, I think I chose well. Wells was active in the opposition to the war, and the insider perspective led him to begin the book as his PhD dissertation at Berkeley. The scholarship is evident. He provides a comprehensive commentary on the subject, describing the events, personalities, and policies of all the parties involved during those turbulent years.To me it's a mistake to try to report in depth from both sides of history. The good history--meaning objective interpretation--gets lost in the argument, particularly given that the historian admits sentiment for one side over the other. The debate among the various groups in the opposition to the war--with all their confusing acronyms--is described quite well. However, it's not surprising that the policies initiating our taking over the war from the South Vietnamese, the bombing campaigns, and the negotiating process orchestrated by the Johnson and Nixon administrations is mostly recounted without regard for why such policies were undertaken. It becomes a polemic, whether or not Wells intended it to be so, a narration of military and diplomatic stratagems formulated to prosecute the war in Vietnam alternating with the reactions of public opinion and the political dissent. One wonders at the lack of objectivism in what asks to be considered a serious work yet refers to administration officials as murderers. Believing myself to be objective reader, I was disappointed in a historical tract which failed to discern the smugness and naivete of principle thrown against the bulwark of realpolitik, or one which seemed to approve of the demoralization of the national army in the field and the sabotage of its weapons. I suppose that while I applaud the comprehensiveness with which Wells tells the story I really object that the story has to be such an ugly one....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2015","May 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1001666.The_War_Within

Possessing a gift for poetry and language, he wrote without the need to subsidize his writing through teaching or editing or any other kind of employment. Yet he spent almost every day of his adult life in disciplined, hard work at his desk writing mostly poetry but also a couple of novels, a memoir, and a handful of plays. Langdon Hammer's is a critical biography which discusses the work in detail. He tells us that much of it was autobiographical. Merrill was a formal poet, always working in some traditional structure and rhyme. His long daily hours at his desk paid off. He was recognized during his life as a poet of brilliance and elegance. He published 15 individual volumes of poetry but is probably best known for The Changing Light at Sandover, the trilogy based on sessions he and David Jackson spent at a Ouija board.David Jackson was his lover for 40 years or more. Merrill was gay, an orientation understood by him from an early age. Hammer writes comprehensively of Merrill's gay life beginning in the years when homosexuality was misunderstood, stigmatized, and even illegal through the years of gradual acceptance and the AIDS epidemic. In fact, Merrill died of the disease. Hammer's narrative of the life fully incorporates what it meant to be a gay man during his lifetime, 1926-1995. The fact of his homosexual lifestyle and its importance in how he lived his life and how it affected his work is a major focus in the biography. Another is his huge network of friends which included Alice B. Toklas, W. H. Auden, Truman Capote, Elizabeth Bishop, and Larry Rivers. Merrill's friendship with each of them and others give Hammer the opportunity to write engagingly about almost everyone who knew Merrill and the nature of the friendship.Life and art. A life in art.

I was right. In fact, many of the attitudes we've developed about the war provide commentary and add flesh to the novel.The bare bones of plot center around a Vietnamese Captain who flees during the last days of the republic in the south. He's aide to a General and accompanies him into exile in America. But he's the sympathizer of the title, a communist agent who reports on the activities of the General who, it's feared, will generate revolutionary action in the newly-reunited Vietnam. One of the impressive things about the novel is that Nguyen, who was born in Vietnam, writes in a robust western style with full-throated allusion to western sensibilities yet with a keen enough eye to see American culture through the eyes of someone outside looking in, as the Captain is forced to do. This is a prose style with hooks and barbs that allow you to see old truths in new ways. The novel is fun and intelligent in its observations of American culture by a man just arrived. It has a lot to say about movies through several chapters in which the Captain is employed to assist in the making of a film bearing resemblance to Apocalypse Now. And Nguyen uses the film vehicle to segue into reflections on the American way of war. The novel's rich in these areas while also revealing a grim if caricatured picture of Vietnamese lives displaced to America by the lost war, the pervasive sense of guilt brought on by it and by loyalties divided by duty and love of country.The movie itself is used to explore the whole relationship between Vietnam and America during the war. And it's here that Nguyen's use of names--or lack of them--becomes the most parodic because in addition to the General and his wife Madame of the Captain's immediate family-in-exile, the movie set also introduces the Auteur, the Thespian, and the Idol. Some of the novel's characters carry adjectival designations: the grizzled Captain, the affectless Lieutenant. Our protagonist is surrounded by types.As you might expect, the word sympathy carries a lot of weight in the novel. The Captain is our obvious sympathizer as spy. Nguyen extends the political meaning by finally reminding us that revolutions begin in sympathy for those oppressed. But in the end the definition as compassion also takes on importance when reeducation leads to redemption, yet another way Nguyen jolts Vietnamese perceptiveness with the hot charge of western ideas. And the ending for me brought to mind another novel of redemption and another war, Catch-22.I thoroughly enjoyed The Sympathizer and admire it. The one quibble might be that the reeducation of our narrator, when his unreliability is made most plain, went on a little too long for this reader, though it didn't become as torturous as events in the novel....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 24, 2015","Apr 10, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23168277-the-sympathizer

We forget--or I forgot--that a long time ago Peter Ackroyd published one and later Lyndall Gordon produced a 2-volume life. Do you remember"" Of course you do and now you're realizing it seems a lifetime ago. There's a reason. Eliot didn't want a biography written, unrealistic as that wish seems today. His wife Valerie, keeper of the flame after his death in 1965, acceded to that wish by withholding access to materials and limiting what Ackroyd and Gordon could quote. Still, their biographies were exciting because they were all we had. Obviously there was persistent interest in Eliot, though. For the most part the resulting works, like the play and movie Tom and Viv which depicted him as a misogynist or other works which dealt with his anti-Semitism or claimed him to be a closeted homosexual, disappointed Valerie Eliot and hardened her resolve to stand in the way of serious biographical studies. Now Valerie is gone. Robert Crawford, who knew her and had impressed her with his academic work on the poet has used the relaxed restraints on research and access to the material to write the first biography since Gordon's.Young Eliot is right. The story of Eliot in London is a familiar one. But whereas most biographies race quickly over the formative years, Crawford spends three chapters and 78 pages in detailing Eliot's boyhood in St Louis and Gloucester, Massachusetts because he's able to demonstrate how influences of those years were later used in his greatest poetry. Another five chapters and abut 120 pages are needed to get him through Harvard, after which he studies at Oxford, meets Vivien, his first wife, and the rest is famous literary history. All of this material, though, is new because it's not before been covered in such detail. While I was aware, for instance, that he'd studied philosophy at Harvard, I hadn't known before of his deep background in anthropology and how it would affect The Waste Land, the Sweeney poems, and his criticism. Equally important parts of Eliot's story, and heavy influences on what he wrote, were the one who got away, Emily Hale, and the one who wanted him and married him, Vivien Haigh-Wood. One of the surprises for me was that Crawford mutes the difficulties of the marriage. While he allows they were awkward together the way he writes of the marriage makes Tom much more supportive and accommodating than perhaps we'd believed before. Of course, this first volume ends at the end of 1922, and Tom and Viv have some trying years ahead of them. There's the poetry, too. No biography of Eliot could not discuss and analyze ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" and The Waste Land. Crawford writes in depth about where they came from within the poet and why, as well as lengthy discussions of the Sweeney sequence, ""Gerontion"", and other early works.This is grand biography. Crawford plans a second volume to be called Eliot after The Waste Land. I'm sure that when it's published Crawford's will be the Eliot biography for our time....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"May 15, 2015","Apr 08, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22561308-young-eliot

The answer is probably both.I've always liked the definition of grand strategy, that level of planning and maneuver above that of the military, as the means used to win the peace. Brands defines it ""as the intellectual architecture that gives form and structure to foreign policy."" He presents the grand strategies of Truman, Nixon/Kissinger, Reagan, and George W. Bush to show its proper and improper applications. Truman and Reagan, in Brands's analysis, were successful. Truman formulated a means of confronting the west's ideological opposite and competitor for power, the Soviet Union, through containment, a policy which endured for 40 years. Reagan's policies, developed partly through good instincts, are credited with ending the Cold War in the west's favor. The prime occupation of Nixon and Kissinger was how to get America out of Vietnam. Of the 4, Brands sees only George W. Bush's policies in the Middle East as failed grand strategy.Brands doesn't judge the policies he analyzes. He presents them and their results in the light of contemporary perspectives rather than historical evaluation. He remains above emotions which might be generated by some of the events he writes about, discussing them solely in terms of their appropriateness and effectiveness at the time. In this way such controversial subjects as the bombing of Cambodia or the defense of Korea can be examined as load-bearing components of the ""architecture"" of foreign policy, not as part of the public debate.The only policies studied which get poor marks is Bush's grand strategy in the Middle East. Here Brands's even-handed treatment of his subject allows him to deliver a savage critique on the arrogant, incompetent management of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which undid the balance of power in the region thereby validating the rise of Iran and which embroiled us in the region at a time we should have been preparing for the Chinese drive for primacy in East Asia. Of the 4 legacies left to us by these grand strategies, only that of George W. Bush can be viewed as harmful to the interests of America, and those interests are the focus of grand strategy itself...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 24, 2016","May 09, 2016","Mar 10, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23737112-what-good-is-grand-strategy

I noted the praise of recent readers and so looked forward to it and began it with anticipation. I was a little disappointed.It may be that in order for a quiet, unassuming novel like this to successfully engage a reader the protagonist has to be interesting. I never found the character William Stoner interesting. He's a good man and meant to be seen that way. He's a dedicated teacher. He's a devoted father. He endures with equanimity and grace a long marriage to a difficult wife and a career marred by a hostile relationship with a colleague. The author John Williams has given him an admirable life written well. What Williams doesn't give Stoner in the novel is affirmation, some kind of event or deed or knowledge--an epiphany would do--that gives his life meaning. He teaches, endures, does his duty, and fades away alone and in darkness, if not exactly with a whimper, without a bang, too.Unfortunately, as skilled and dutiful a teacher, as devoted a husband and father, Stoner isn't given enough descriptive words other than ""numb,"" ""absence,"" and ""indifference"" to allow him substance and force. These words fill the book in regard to Stoner, and it's those words we remember. In the novel's 2d paragraph is the sentence, ""Stoner's colleagues, who held him in no particular esteem when he was alive, speak of him rarely now; to the older ones, his name is a reminder of the end that awaits us all,...."" That's the character and lackluster effect Williams meant to establish. The trouble is the effect on colleagues can be the same for readers.To be fair, I read Stoner simultaneously with 2 other novels which are particularly powerful and philosophical. I'm nearing the end of a reread of Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. The other was Curzio Malaparte's The Skin, the highly symbolic Italian novel of World War II which I wrote about here yesterday, the most impressive novel I've read in months. I had no way of knowing, of course, but Stoner's low wattage shines dimly in the presence of such novels. To read Stoner without such brawny competition would probably allow it to be a completely different read....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2015","Mar 06, 2015",,,view (with text),/book/show/1566608.Stoner

Atticus Lish in Preparation for the Next Life not so whimsically widens hell to include the entire city, especially Queens. In fact, the characters come from other regions of hell to this level of gore and pain where we find them. Not only does Lish create the atmosphere in scenes like the butchers of Queens and Chinatown destroying slabs of meat with saws and cleavers, for instance, or by writing about displayed photos of women beaten or savaged by disease, but the novel rides on an undercurrent of vulnerability, madness, violent behavior, and self-destructive impulses. Those who live there who aren't mad are spiritually empty.It's the story of 3 characters. Zou Lei is a Uighur from the western reaches of China who entered the U. S. illegally and was swept up and jailed in the southwest. Inexplicably released, she makes her way to New York where she struggles to earn a living and stay out of the way of authority. She befriends Skinner, a PTSD-haunted soldier who served 3 tours of duty in Iraq. Now he's left the Army, or perhaps was discharged on disability because he's psychologically damaged by his combat experiences. Jimmy Turner is the 3d character. He's a recently-released con who has known nothing but petty crime and is now angrily watching his life tilting askew because he can't find a job. These 3 gears, the working parts of Lish's novel, meet to gnash and grind against each other in this dream-like surreal America where Northern Road, Queens runs directly into the Silk Road.There is a 4th character, a Berretta. We remember what Chekhov said about a pistol appearing early in a story.If I've made it sound grim, it's because it is. The city they move in is waste. It's smoky and dangerous. The dead hang around the corners or are eating at the food court in the mall. Anger and fear are only 2 of the elements of the modern American periodic table combined here to make this menacing, violent place. Yet the heart of Preparation for the Next Life is a love story. It's Skinner and Zou Lei who struggle toward the flickering emotions that count for love here. They need each other, and they work to save each other. Zou Lei is the novel's softest character. It's she who props up Skinner when his mind flies apart under the stress of memory. Skinner can give Zou Lei love and the security of legal status in the U. S. Together they are like Eurydice and Orpheus, struggling toward the surface and the light. One of the most impressive sections of the novel is Chapter 53 describing a long nighttime walk from the Bronx to Queens, a walk through underworld New York toward morning. It reminded me of Yossarian's wanderings through Rome in Catch-22.This is a compelling novel of those who inhabit America's margins. I think the characterizations an achievement. Lish keeps them gloriously and richly distinctive through voice and trait so that they stand clearly themselves even while sharing the same psychological space. It's tragedy, though, and you know it. There can only be tragedy in the broken, littered, and depressed streets of Lish's New York. But perhaps only a writer of Lish's power could paint tragedy with such abundant and colorful affirmation....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2015","Jan 28, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21535396-preparation-for-the-next-life

I admire the work of Fitzgerald, but to be honest I read this biography as much for who wrote as for the subject. I think Lee's a terrific biographer. She doesn't disappoint here.Fitzgerald was a writer who led a conservative, traditional life as wife, mother, and teacher for most of here life. Even after she began to write late in life--her first work was published at sixty--she preferred to give the impression of one who was colorless and not particularly learned. Lee shows us the real Fitzgerald, one different from the persona she advanced. Fitzgerald herself began writing as a biographer--of her family, of the artist Edward Burne-Jones, and the poet Charlotte Mew. Her early novels, like The Bookshop and the Booker Prize-winning Offshore, were autobiographical. Late in her career and late in life she turned her fiction to historical subjects. The strength of the life Lee's written rests on the extensive attention she gives to each of Fitzgerald's books. Some of the glosses are a chapter in length, all are complete with analysis and summary, motivation and meaning. The discussion of the writing is as fine as the comprehensive detail given to the facts and events of the life itself. As I knew she would, Lee does justice to a wonderful novelist, an important British novelist who wrote for the world. She didn't become well-known until she was elderly, but Lee's study reveals her as important her whole life....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Mar 05, 2015","Jan 14, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17612573-penelope-fitzgerald

Adam Nicolson's knowledge of Homer's great works and his understanding of the Homeric world seem truly deep. Along with the important literary analysis The Mighty Dead is dense with historial fact and perspecctive concerning Bronze Age conflict, the tribal nature of Greek socity compared to the more civilized Trojans, Greek origins, and the importance of Troy to the ancient world. Nicolson has some interesting ideas: he convincingly equates the warrior attitudes of Greeks on the beach at Troy with the gang ethos present in modern East St. Louis, and he writes a section late in the book explaining how the Biblical Philistines were the same kinds of Mycanean warriors who besieged Troy. The book bubbles from front cover to back with such energetic insight ranging from who Homer really was to why we stilll refer to him for news of the past and why he so accurately reflects the nature of modern man.As equally delightful as Nicolson's knowledge of Homer and the world of the Greeks is how well the book is written. Nicolson is a wonderfully descriptive writer. One personal reflection of how he himself once had a knife held to his throat illuminates the fighting on the beach at Troy. Another--and these are just 2 examples--is a description of a stormy sea, something he as sailor knows as well as the Greeks did. His elegant image of the way a gull can raise one wing to expose his chest to the wind as a way of lifting himself higher took my breath away. The book is full of such moments. You don't necessarily have to read Nicolson to read and apporeciate Homer. Homer can stand on his own 2 feet. But you'll want to read Nicolson for the depth of background he can give you about Homer's famous poems.

Cummings we're aware that Susan Cheever knew him through her father, John. The opening is fascinating as she tells of the night in 1958 she met him following a poetry reading. She sat in the back seat and studied him while her father drove Cummings from the reading in Westchester, at Susan's school, to his home in Patchin Place in Greenwich Village. Her portrait is of a puckish and likable man. It's unfortunate that what looks at first to be an intimate book on Cummings, a memoir of their connection, quickly turns into conventional biography. Friendship seems to be acquaintance. And perhaps it's because she's unable to draw on a close and personal association with him that the book settles into a study as thin and frail as Cummings himself.I'm generous with stars these days. Still, this book doesn't deliver. I don't think Cheever tells us anything about Cummings we didn't already know. Or any perspective on his character and work that we haven't come across before. She more than once emphasizes his childlike, playful nature and sees it reflected in the poetry and his own lowercase persona which bucked against authority, any authority. Yet she also claims Cummings as one of the century's high modernists, even as she admits his reputation is waning under repeated charges by academics and poets that his work shouldn't be taken too seriously. Somehow it means a lot to me that in discussing language and style in a poet most widely known for that rather than content she never uses the word lyrical.Some aspects of the life and work aren't developed. At one point she writes a sentence hinting he was bisexual. She goes no farther with the thought than that sentence. She spends time describing the correspondence of Cummings and Ezra Pound, but the content of the correspondence she chooses to discuss has to do with their disagreement about the true nature of blue jays. Cummings is here, the poet I love is here.

It's probably the most comprehensive discussion of the craft and the relation to the poet's life the individual poems display. Braiding the subject and the work in a literary biography necessarily explains where the work comes from. Booth does it well. As biography it adds little to our knowledge of the events of his life because much has been written. But Booth, who was a colleague of Larkin's at Hull University, magnifies our understanding of the man and writings largely through the focus of love, the third thread of his title. It's hard to resist reading about a poet with a muse. Larkin had three in concert. His relationships with Monica Jones, which spanned decades, Maeve Brennan, a fellow library worker, and Betty Mackereth, his secretary, Booth convincingly maintains, is one of the most important ways of defining Larkin and his work. Few of us are incurious and willing enough to look away from the juicy details of love life, anyway. So important was love to Larkin that he began the last affair--Betty Mackereth--with the hope that it would help jumpstart his flagging creativity.I've read, too, that it was Booth's intention to dispel some of the bad air that arose with the 1993 publication of Larkin's letters assembled by Anthony Thwaite. The correspondence revealed a man who seemed not only a racist and misogynist but a cantankerous complainer and waspish critic of other poets, as well as a collector and lover of pornography. The letters portrayed a man quite different from that his growing audience had come to admire. Booth's Larkin is kinder, gentler. The disreputable characteristics aren't ignored, but their sharp edges have been blunted.All that's beside the point, in my view. It doesn't deflate the work any more than does Eliot's anti-Semitism, Neruda's Communism, or Pound's collaboration with fascism. Booth's story is the poetry. His critical appraisal of the poems makes this an invaluable book for those who admire Larkin's oeuvre....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 24, 2015","Nov 25, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20613548-philip-larkin

It follows The SportsLet Me Be Frank With You is a book of linked stories that, combined, form Ford's fourth book about the character Frank Bascombe. It follows The Sportswriter, Independence Day, and The Lay of the Land. And it follows his most recent novel, Canada, which I thought not one of Ford's best. The material, the handling of themes, and the muscular verbal style in this latest Bascombe book pleased me because I saw it as a return of the Ford I admire.When Canada was published I heard Ford read and be interviewed at a venue near my home. From the audience I asked him if he was planning another Frank Bascombe novel. The aging Ford's comment was that he hated to start things he couldn't finish. I took that as a no and recognized he might be thinking about his mortality. The publication of a new book about Frank surprised me but its theme of aging and the approaching end of life didn't. Frank Bascombe is now 68-years old. These stories are filled with his meditations on old age and his encounters with the old and dying. I don't remember a character we'd consider young. At one point Frank reflects on life as a roller coaster and thinks about the ""final, thrilling dips"" of the ride. This line of thought is supported by the book's cover photograph of the Jersey Shore's popular roller coaster surrounded by water. Near t he end Frank thinks, ""The famous roller coaster up to its knees in ocean,"" a reminder of the creep of old age up the silly inclines of life. I don't remember such a metaphorical Ford, and the passage pleased me.The floodwater was from Sandy, the hurricane which battered the New Jersey coast during the last week of October, 2012, weeks before the Christmas Frank has such mixed feelings about. His own home in Haddam--now made by Ford into one of those iconic towns in American fiction--was away from the ocean and the most severe effects of the storm. But he observes the physical ruin of neighborhoods and the devastated lives of residents, some of them friends, with genuine compassion. Ford is, I think, encouraging readers to rhyme the physical damage of Haddam with the physical decline accompanying old age.As always in these books about Frank Bascombe, Ford is writing a portrait of America. So here we get Frank's perspective on Christmas in America, television, nursing homes, fast food, and his experienced take on marriage. Race relations is a major theme. ""Everything Could Be Worse"", the 2d story, centers around a conversation between Bascombe and a black lady who comes to his door wanting a nostalgic look around the house she used to live in. Over coffee in the kitchen their talk reveals some secrets but also self-consciously skates around the crack-in-the-ice fact of racial differences hanging over the table between them. During Bascombe's wanderings through Haddam and these stories we come to realize how much thought he gives to race in America. Near the end of the book Ford, a native of Mississippi, has Frank reflect, ""White southerners all think we 'know' Negroes better than we do or could. They may think they know us, too--with better reason."" That's Frank's Default Self poking through a mostly crusty exterior. Running through the second half of the book, it's the idea that we have essential selves we can't do anything about. We watch Frank's Default Self blow both kind and irritable throughout the book as he deals with the Default Selves of others. But I think it's his attitudes toward race that bring out his essential nature. I think it's significant that the last person he speaks to is a black man. And it's the Frank Bascombe Ford leaves us with.Will there be another Frank Bascombe book? We have been through 4 major holidays with Frank and his family: Easter, the 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and now Christmas. I suppose Ford could write an even older Bascombe at the end of the year and the end of his life. I take him at his word that he'll not start on work he's not sure he'll finish. We can only hope he'll surprise us again....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 13, 2015","Nov 13, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22663248-let-me-be-frank-with-you

Meant for the general reader rather than the academic, it should be enormously useful to any reader of the poem, especially those entering it for the first time.Shaw analyzes the Commedia through the use of seven themes: friendship, power, life, love, time, numbers, and words. The discussion moves from how Dante came to begin it to the historical reality of its final existence and everything in between, including the importance of the Trinity, explorations of love, and how the poem's cosmic scope can be squeezed into the conscience of a man. That design means her gloss isn't a canto by canto summary, and it allows her plenty of leeway to discuss the other important material associated with the poem. Biographical details of Dante and others are included along with descriptions of Florence and the Italy they lived in. Shaw spends time explaining the theology of the times and the tumultuous politics of the mid to late 13th century, both Papal, which influenced all of Europe, and the regional politics Dante had to skate through. She maps the ""geography of the afterlife,"" as well as the all-important structure of the poem itself. I especially liked her writing at length on the influences such ancients as Aristotle and Ovid had on Dante and those Dante had on such moderns as T. S. Eliot and Seamus Heaney.I'd think Reading Dante a useful book for anyone interested in Dante and his work. If you've read his Commedia before, Shaw's study can only add to your appreciation.

Not always accurate, either--he describes William Boyd's An Ice-Cream War as taking place in North Africa. And I think that in an 1100-page work, where there's one error there are probably more.

I had to get used to the way the prose runs because rather than purring like a Cadillac it kind of clunks like an old farm tractor, an engine that misses and misfires, though it does slowly move along, planting the seeds of information and analysis. Maybe the reason the engine of this biography doesn't run more smoothly is because it's clogged with venom and spite. It's a near-assassination. It's a negative slant. Kinzer seems to want to paint a negative portrait of the Dulles brothers, John Foster and Allen. The former was Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of State, the latter the first civilian director of the CIA during the early years of its operation. I've read other biographies like this. Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang, which I ed here on Goodreads in 2009, and the Albert Grossman biography of Elvis disappointed in the same way. Biography approaching its subject in such a negative way and telling the life from all the bad angles makes for unbalanced biography. Unfair, too, because it can't be the complete story of these men who lived long, productive lives in service to American society and government. But it must be the story Kinzer wants to tell. He writes more on expose and polemic than biography.The book is structured around 6 international leaders of the period Kinzer says the Dulleses called monsters: Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh of Iran, President Jacobo Arbenz of Guatemala, Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba of the Congo, Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam, President Sukarno of Indonesia, and Fidel Castro of Cuba. The governments of the first 3 were overthrown by U. S. intervention and influence, primarily through actions initiated by John Foster and Allen Dulles, at State and the CIA. In my opinion, to explain the intricate, global-encompassing foreign policy of the U. S. in the 1950s as the intervention in 6 countries is to rob your work of the high octane fuel needed to write successful biography. I don't doubt that the Dulles brothers in power during those years had a hand in subverting governments. But by trying to make me believe they did no good, either, or didn't act in the best interests of America is to subvert my sense of history and my values of good biography.To be fair, the book becomes less strident following the death of John Foster in 1959, leaving Allen alone in government. Though the reader knows the seriously-flawed Bay of Pigs, a CIA operation. is still to come. But Kinzer's summation claims the brothers misread Soviet intentions, motives, and attitudes, and that misunderstanding led them and America into a more threatening stance which created friction between the ideologies. He writes, ""John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles guided their country through the world during an era of extremes. The passage of time, and the end of the Cold War, make it difficult to grasp the depth of fear that gripped many Americans during the 1950s. Foster and Allen were chief promoters of that fear. They did as much as anyone to shape America's confrontation with the Soviet Union. Their actions helped set off some of the world's most profound long-term crises."" To me, to blame the Dulles brothers for the confrontational stance and fear generated by the ideological competition is to forget that Churchill advocated a preventive war against the Soviet Union at the end of World War II, that George F. Kennan's influential views of Soviet intentions and motives encouraged the policy of containment adhered to during all those years, and that Harry Truman's actions in Berlin and Korea began the pattern of confrontation before the Dulleses came to power. Sometimes I thought Kinzer wrong. To claim that singer and actor Pat Boone's announcement that he wouldn't kiss his leading ladies was an example of the religious climate of 1950s America is to misjudge the times. (Even at 15 I knew he was making a mistake by not kissing Ann-Margret.) To compare the interventions of the Dulles brothers to Shane ridding the valley of bad guys, or Eisenhower to a sheriff in a lawless town, is to misjudge men.But to be fair again, by Kinzer's summation the engine was running more smoothly, the rattling rhetoric not so noisy. The stars are generous. The skies are clearing here, and I can see them again. Just as I could always see there was some truth in Kinzer's telling. It's just that he didn't tell it all....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Nov 30, 2014","Oct 20, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19286626-the-brothers

Steady, elegiac, melancholy drumbeats that work a progression, leaving home and coming back. It's like running the bases.I've read all of Robinson's novels this year. The first 3 were rereads to refresh myself and to provide a continuity leading into Lila. That novel is both the earliest in time of the Gilead trilogy and yet may be seen emotionally as its affirmation. Considering all 4 novels, Housekeeping is about leaving home for a transient life; Lila is about returning, about coming home. And it's about being saved. Lila is saved from her vagrant life and saved through baptism by the Reverend John Ames. She both returns home and is given a home. Robinson has always concerned herself with what the word means. In Lila she expresses it in the Calvinism of Ames and his great friend Robert Boughton as well as Ames's love.Like all of Robinson's novels Lila is a quiet one. There's little action and yet a lot happens, at least to Lila and John Ames. Her life before wandering into Gilead is told in flashback and is marked by a gritty reality and subtle danger. Life around the gentle shepherd Ames is almost pastoral. And yet the Eden that's Gilead has a door and Lila knows she'll always have a taste for the transient life. We know, though, that in the novels Gilead and Home, set several years after Lila, she's still there and content in raising her child. That child is part of her salvation. Just as she was raised in an itinerant life by a woman named Doll, saved she thinks, she's offering a salvation of her own to her young son. There's much to like here. I like the concept of leaving and returning, the frame of Ruthie in Housekeeping seduced into a vagrancy returned home in Lila by the loving Ames. I like the glorious prose. I like the robust philosophy deftly snatched from the conversations of the gentle Lila and Ames, turned this way and that, investigated. I've stated in a comment about Home that I like the characters. They're much like small town people I've known in my own life. Robinson writes in a way that reveals their sensibilities and allows the reader to recognize their fine qualities. We can see that Robinson has brought Lila to a home that's a paradise of sorts....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 31, 2015","Oct 14, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22663115-lila

Wounded in the throat in Barcelona, he was already struggling with the tuberculosis which would kill him in 1950. His first wife died in 1944 leaving him to care for their infant son alone. Four years later he himself was hospitalized. He spent most of his last 2 years in hospital. These letters deal with how Orwell coped with these misfortunes. Bravely, I think, and also hopefully right up to the end. The personal letters describe matter-of-factly and uncomplainingly the difficulties of health and raising a toddler in ration-plagued postwar Britain. He made the best of it. If he never wrote figuratively or poetically, he never wrote angrily or dejectedly, either.What Orwell didn't struggle with was his writing. He wrote quickly and with ease when he was healthy enough to work, and he was lucky in being able to place whatever rolled from his typewriter. Publishers waited eagerly for his novels, but finding someone to print essays and s was easy, too. His book deals were good to him; book clubs provided huge print runs and large sales. Partly because of all this his letters reveal little friction with publishers and editors. With peers, either, though there are few letters to fellow writers.

The thing about a f2f group discussion is the need to say something interesting. At least as Crain explains it and as he admits he felt, there's no avoiding an element of competition as group members speak to insight and deft analysis, each striving to dig into the pure vein of the work discussed. One not only wants to wear the showy codpiece but to demonstrate the literary balls to put in it. In Crain's group discussion of Dubliners he felt he didn't have the opportunity to fully express himself. Worse, he allowed his ideas to be too easily dismissed. Angry and unhappy, he decided to write a book about Dubliners in which he'd say everything and anything he wanted. The result is this beautiful study, and in it he's shown he has what it takes to fill the codpiece.I reread Dubliners as I read Crain's book, my copy ragged now and brimming with bold red underlinings and marginalia indicating meaning I'd picked from other sources. I was a little disappointed that Crain doesn't cover the same territory. His focus is on character analysis and motive, and on language, how Joyce tuned this sentence or that word to serve his story. What he has to say about this, Joyce's technical skill as a writer, is interesting and convincing. And amazing at times. I would have never thought to count the l's in the first paragraph of ""The Dead"" to demonstrate the heavy alliteration. Crain says there are 39 of them. Other than language he writes about the psychology of the characters and how Joyce used words to create it and fit it into plot. So instead of offering us the meaning of the snow in ""The Dead"", Crain analyzes the Passion of Michael Furey versus the Good Sense of Gabriel Conroy. In ""Grace"", where I'd been encouraged to see a miniature Divine Comedy, Crain focuses on Joyce's use of the numbers four and five in sentence structure which aligns with the peculiar quincunx formation the men assume in chapel. I don't criticize. Crain's gloss is impressive, I think, as well as accurate. But Joyce also wrote with sharp points poking in every direction. He who expected academics to pore over his work didn't intend for meaning to be disregarded. Crain does understand the paralysis of Joyce's characters in these famous stories. He writes about it in each chapter, just as he writes about his own at the critical discussion of ""The Dead"" in the San Francisco f2f group. He's made up for it, though, by writing an intelligent, perceptive book which one guesses includes everything he wanted to say there....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 16, 2015","Oct 01, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18733370-reading-dubliners

Meg Wolitzer's first novel, SleepwalkiI'm reminded of a couple of novelists long-established before the publication of A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. Meg Wolitzer's first novel, Sleepwalking, revolved around a trio of girls on the Swarthmore campus who were obsessed with Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, poets who destroyed themselves. One of Joyce Carol Oates's earlier novels was You Must Remember This. It shares a major theme with McBride's novel, sexual abuse within the family.Despite the thematic similarities, there are differences. Wolitzer's character Clare Danziger and Oates's Enid Stevick complete their journeys as knowledgeable, rational, and beautifully complete young women. McBride's protagonist, never named, is, as the title suggests, half-formed. The most striking difference is the language. The reader quickly becomes aware that in her novel about a half-formed girl McBride has written half-formed sentences. The hype surrounding the novel refers to Samuel Beckett, with good reason. The prose is choppy in the same way, though McBride's writing has a few unusual and original characteristics. Sometimes in the midst of this choppy sea of sentence fragments, stops and starts, McBride has even formed sentences from word parts. Dis. Gusting. Pet. Ition. Sometimes she'll wombine cords, like that. In a time of stresS near the end, she's caPitalized ranDOm leTteRs, like this. In fact, this is language under stress, language bent, stretched, and twisted to the breaking point.I don't mean to make it seem difficult. It's not. It's more unusual than difficult, and is fairly easy to read. Some sections, I'm remembering now, are even musical. Other parts push the narrative forward with irresistible, headlong power. The story itself is a conventional one of a young girl's passage through school, through sexual awakening, to become a woman. It's Irish, so not surprisingly Catholicism is a theme, as is the dense weave of family. Some elements may be autobiographical. Another thing the news about the novel tells us is that McBride also had a brother who suffered a brain tumor. The experience must have been searing. She holds us close to the flame with her.McBride has a bright future. Wolitzer began in darkness but has sprung, fully-formed, into success as a writer of lighter themes. The legendary Joyce Carol Oates has thrived on her novels exploring the dark underside of families. McBride will have her time. Her prose pops and flashes like fireworks, and out of such beginnings a writer able to demonstrate such savage, Paleolithic style will be capable of writing the gleaming ziggurats and gardens of lasting literary merit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2014","Sep 29, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22457037-a-girl-is-a-half-formed-thing

Leviathan is a Russian movie incorporating the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes and the Book of Job to tell a story of a family living on the shore of the Barents Sea destroyed by the pervasiveness of corruption and a ruinous lifestyle which, we are encouraged to understand, are inherent in modern Russian society.Anthony Marra's novel A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is enshrouded in the same atmosphere. Some novels, as you read, make you feel a sense of darkness, as if it takes place at night. And in the coldest hours of night, too, because after all this is Russia in the iron grip of winter. But Marra's Russia is Chechnya, and his story tells of a few days in the time after the two wars in which the Russian Federation cruelly overpowered the Chechen separatist movement. We follow the slim staff of a dilapidated hospital as they try to survive while knee-deep in the chaos governed by the Feds, who can be seen as the persecuting demons in this hellish environment. So this is a novel dark in tone about a society beaten down by war and oppression. It takes place in the murky depths where the leviathan of state exerts pressures great enough to crush the human soul. Still, there's light. The novel is lighted by luminous characters who swim in the depths of this narrative with hope their only solace. It may be cold and dark at these depths, but there's still life here, the constellations of vital phenomena of Marra's title.Perhaps the best descriptive word is powerful. Reading the events occurring in the 5 days of the novel's primary action, you'll be immersed in the atmosphere I spoke of as it's constructed from the same dark detail and emotion its entire length of almost 400 pages. It's as if you lose all sense of time. It's a little like waking up, after having finished the novel, to find yourself in a different place and time, not having been aware of the passage. It's that absorbing. The ride is bumpy. The anvil of history is hard and those pounded on it are shaped and misshapen until all that's left is the luminosity of their hope. The blows upon the anvil are softened by Marra's humor, for this is a funny novel. The bumpy ride is smoothed by the fluidity of his prose, for it is also lyrical. Making such powerful fiction must be harder than we suppose, those of us who dig for nuggets like this in the vast rubble field of contemporary fiction. Some novelists struggle to find such light in communities smoking with despair and hopelessness. I admire Marra's ability to write truth with such expressive passion it creates a reality. On this site dedicated to good reading, I suggest Marra's novel is exactly that, a good read. I recommend it. I think you'll like it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Oct 31, 2014","Sep 02, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14287832-a-constellation-of-vital-phenomena

She also translates favorite works into Arabic and stores them in boxes in the maid's bathroom of the old apartment. But she feels unnecessary because she doesn't fit in the world. Estranged from her family, divorced, friendless, quite alone, from her kitchen balcony she's party to all the life in the building and the street below she doesn't belong to, including the coffee klatch of three women upstairs.Asliya's situation is partly by design. She's deeply reclusive and is content--indeed, prefers--to relate to the world through literature. Early on she tells us, ""I long ago abandoned myself to a blind lust for the written word. Literature is my sandbox. In it I play, build my forts and castles, spend glorious time. It is the world outside that box that gives me trouble. I have adapted tamely, though not conventionally, to this visible world so I can retreat without much inconvenience into my inner world of books. Transmuting this sandy metaphor, if literature is my sandbox, then the real world is my hourglass--an hourglass that drains grain by grain. Literature gives me life, and life kills me."" As you might imagine, her first person rumination on life is filled with many references to the literary works she loves. J. M. Coetzee and Fernando Pessoa are just a couple of her particular favorites. Her love of literature makes this novel an avid reader's delight, a novel with rich literary veins to be mined.This is also a Beckettian work, I think. Asliya's story is a sad one evoking Beckett's characters in cosmic isolation. She, like a Beckett character, is weak, frustrated, and helpless while being at the same time defiant and part architect of her condition. At one point Alemeddine has her say, ""I like men and women who don't fit well in the dominant culture, or, as Alvaro de Campos calls them, strangers in this place as in every other, accidental in life as in the soul. I like outsiders, phantoms wandering the cobwebbed halls of the doomed castle where life must be lived.""Though defiant architect, she's resilient, too. In the course of the novel she undergoes a family crisis and a crisis with her vast collection of translations. How she is forged in the crises amounts to affirmation and returns her to living life rather than just witnessing it. To be honest, I thought the ending a little too contrived and pat, but it doesn't mar the novel. It's the result you and Asliya want. Laurens Van der Post once wrote, ""Life is its own journey, presupposes its own change and movement, and one tries to arrest them at one's eternal peril.""

WoundeBela Zombory-Moldovan was a Hungarian artist called to service as a junior officer in the Austro-Hungarian army at the outbreak of World War I. Wounded in the first offensive against the Russians, he spent the rest of the war in a noncombatant role. The Burning of the World is a memoir which relates Zombory-Moldovan's experiences during the first days of fighting and his recovery from his wounds at home in Budapest. It's an appropriate subject in this the centennial of the war's beginning.After the war Zombory-Moldovan returned to his life as an artist. Following World War II, after Hungary became part of the Soviet bloc, he ran afoul of the Communist authorities and was forced from his official post as head of the Budapest School of Applied Arts. It's thought that the writing of this memoir followed this dismissal, when he was unable to work officially and was left to his own painting and private work. It's also thought the memoir was intended as merely the beginning of a much larger work. Following his death in 1967 the memoir was found in his papers. It was translated into English by his grandson Peter, who also gave it the title taken from the text. This New York Review of Books edition is the first publication of the work.Only the first half of the book, the account of Zombory-Moldovan's experiences at the front and his return to Budapest, is truly engaging. While he was able to convey the effects of the war's beginnings on the country, the first weeks of military service, the move to contact with the Russians, and the initial actions, the prose is a little flat. He does tell a harrowing story of how he returned wounded to Budapest, largely on his own. But the recovery period, the remainder of the book, is difficult to relate to because it's obscure, and the prose in general lacks energy. The narrative relates interaction with a swirl of family members and artist colleagues without any real explanation of who they are. The biggest problem may be that Zombory-Moldovan wasn't a writer, and he was unable to give family and friends any depth and unable to give his account enough texture to make it compelling for the reader. It reads as if the reader is expected to know who these people were, making an imaginative description unnecessary. It reads as if it was a record intended for family. Unpolished as it is, it reads like the papers one finds stuck away in the personal effects of a deceased family member. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 04, 2014","Aug 13, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20342656-the-burning-of-the-world

I recently read a critical appraisal of Walt Whitman which called him a distinctly American saint. Today I can't remember where it was I read that, and I'm disappointed with myself that I didn't make a note of such a remarkable perception. Poet William Heyen wrote a book called Eight Poems for Saint Walt. One can understand how Whitman, the poet of the open road, the larger-than-life man who boldly strode along the shoreline at home with both the sea and the cosmos, and the sympathetic nurse who cared for the war's wounded, could be considered a saint. The other figure is Robert E. Lee, who in the recent biography of him, Clouds of Glory: The Life and Legend of Robert E. Lee, Michael Korda writes possessed a combination of personal qualities including skill at high military command, physical and moral courage, courtesy, dignity, and lack of self-interest which make him a secular military saint.Korda's biography carries that tone. It's part of what makes it so interesting, the portrait of Lee as a kind of martyr hero. It's a book about a legend as much as a man. The story is familiar. I have other biographies of Lee, some of which Korda frequently quotes, and so know well the narratives of such high holy events of the Confederacy as the Seven Days and Chancellorsville, Gettysburg and Appomattox. Korda sheds little new light on them, but his focus on Lee's considerations and his conduct during those events is fascinating, no matter how familiar we may be. While his biography can't offer new military analysis it is a rich, beautiful portrait of Lee the man. It's the complete man he draws for us, too. This is not only the savvy, daring tactician maneuvering against the array of Union talent assigned to defeat his army, it's also the dutiful, loving husband scouring Richmond music shops trying to find his wife the sheet music for ""Dixie."" Devotion is a key word in this biography. It helps prop up the idea of saint, and it accurately describes the feeling Lee had for his cause, which was more about Virginia and his army than it was the Confederacy. Those who knew him and fought for him returned the devotion. It's not a stretch to say Lee was worshipped.But Korda's biography isn't a complete valentine. While there may be little left to say about the course of Lee's military operations, Korda does provide fresh insight--fresh to me--as to why certain developments came about. Korda criticizes Lee for failing to command sternly enough and to demand his primary commanders act with promptness. His orders were often vague and offered too much leeway. But he expected those commanders to know what to do and also what he wanted, and he was too courteous, a quality of his patrician upbringing, to prod or urgently pester. He also was over-confident about what the men of the Army of Northern Virginia could do, even in the face of severe logistical shortages and overwhelming Union strength. He thought his men unbeatable. The inadequate staff work and lack of logistical resources were problems he never solved. All these factors played a part in the 3 days of Gettysburg and at other times during the war, too, though with less catastrophic results.Korda himself isn't perfect. The book is a bit repetitious in places. And I thought it a mistake to claim similarities in Southern slavery and Russia's system of serfdom. But these are small matters in a biography which gives us such a masterful portrait of Lee and makes such a convincing claim for his sainthood....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2014","Aug 08, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18263071-clouds-of-glory

They are objects and signs, some lifted up from lesser things, some lowered from a more exalted meaning, that ""somehow are redeemed."" ""Things set up, lifted up, or in whatever manner made over to the gods."" He explains the poem is composed of fragments which he associates with the Mass. He writes there's no plan but that each fragment carries an association with one or more other fragments. This sounds as if there's no narrative, but that's not true. Generally the poem begins in prehistory, advances to the mid-20th century and then returns to the time of the Crucifixion. Jones says that its shape is only that it returns to its beginning.This is a difficult poem. Like The Waste Land, which is also difficult but rendered coherent with multiple readings, it is fragmentary. It's made up of snatches of Latin, obscure geographical and mythic references which are Welsh and medieval and Middle Eastern and a whole lot more, and it's seeded liberally with technical jargon relating to such things as sailing vessels and geologic formations. Difficult. It's a goulash of history and myth which, to me, seems to unite in a sea voyage from the past and the Eastern Mediterranean toward London and the present. Then the narrative sails back to Jerusalem and ends in the Crucifixion. But it's a mingling of history and all myth so that a mast is always a Cross, the crew of a ship is all mankind, the ship always an altar. All history is not only connected but co-existing--there's a moment near the poem's end where Roman history also seems to suggest the runup to WWII. Helen of Troy is the Virgin Mary who is Guinevere of Arthurian legend. The Grail Quest ends at the Last Supper. Difficult. I admit to only a very general and partial understanding of the poem. But I can easily relate to Jones's overarching theme that all myths have a correspondence with all others and unite in serving the same purpose. It's more straightforward than you'd think to get from Helen of the Iliad to Rhiannon of the Welsh Mabinogi which plays a part in the poem.I've had this on my shelf for a long time, intimidated by it.

The opening chapters, hQuiet Dell begins with the story of a Chicago family lured to its destruction by a monstrous killer who preys on lonely women. The opening chapters, however, which deal with the hapless Eichers, are merely emotional foundation because the narrative quickly switches gears to follow the obsessive pursuit of the news story by Emily Thornhill, a Chicago reporter, who watches the killer brought to justice. I thought Quiet Dell an unusual novel. Unusual in that rather than telling the story with modernism's mythic components, for instance, or a style we might call postmodern, Jayne Anne Phillips has written a novel in the rhythms and sensibilities of the 1930s and with dialogue that sounds as if it was written for that era's silver screen. There are even setpiece episodes that seemed written for and lifted from the screen, like Christmas at the Eichers or the ragamuffin boy Emily rescues from the streets of Clarksburg, West Virginia, feeds, and puts to bed, Jackie Coogan-style, with the novel's devoted mascot, Duty the dog. It's melodramatic. It's romantic, and it ends in the easy, happy satisfactions of bad times turned into good.I'm a longtime fan of Phillips. I was willing to put down roots in the style she chose for her story though I felt out of place in it. Only a couple of things bothered me enough to mention here. First, the novel's set, like the real events it's based on, during the Great Depression. Yet Phillips didn't write the impact of those hard times into the consciousness of her characters. I only remember a passing reference to someone not trusting his bank. The other thing was a spiritual element. Phillips frequently includes a visionary or delphic character in her novels, one who has special insight. Quiet Dell has a murdered girl who watches over the novel's events from the afterlife.I never got into the rhythms and adopted attitudes of Quiet Dell. I couldn't not hear dialogue as stilted in the way of old movies. I wasn't able to let character mannerisms and sentiments appropriate to the period become second nature. I do recognize it's a novel about people 85 years ago. In some instances that distance could have been developed as a historical novel. Phillips didn't, but it's a novel that could easily carry a subtitle: A Novel of the 1930s....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Apr 21, 2015","Aug 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18775414-quiet-dell

That was the case, however, and Kevin Birmingham's book on how Ulysses overcame that to be declared legally fit to publish is terribly interesting, a terribly fascinating story well told.The Most Dangerous Book is an elegant combination of criticism, history, and biography relating how Ulysses came to be written and published and how it finally was judged respectable. I've read the novel several times, have read several critical works on Joyce and his novel, have read the biographies and Joyce's letters, and yet Birmingham not only wrote the familiar story in a way that still engaged me but informed me of many facts and ways of thinking about the subject I wasn't aware of. How many fans of Joyce don't know the story of how Sylvia Beach published the novel for him through her Paris bookstore, Shakespeare and Company? Birmingham's account of the Joyce-Beach friendship still adds a lot I didn't know. How many admiring readers of Ulysses don't know that Joyce's wife Nora and her easy sensuality was the largest inspiration for Molly Bloom? Birmingham's portrait of their relationship provides new insight into their characters and relationship.As you might expect, the climax of the novel's troubled publication history was the famous 1933 obscenity trial presided over by Judge John M. Woolsey. Birmingham writes that serious readers who came into contact with Ulysses in the decade prior to the trial recognized its literary value. So it was no surprise that Woolsey, who loved literature, made a point of reading the entire novel, and that perspective allowed him to see that the objectionable material, when considered in light of the characters and the novel's rich thematic material, wasn't inserted with pornographic intent or meant as an aphrodisiac. What I'd never realized was the story didn't end there; Birmingham also tells the full account of the appeal to the U. S. Court of Appeals, which upheld Woolsey's decision.I'd had this book for over a year, had received it as a gift. But I'd been a little slow to come to it because I thought the subject matter wouldn't add to my understanding of the novel and author. I was wrong.

It's a love story which also evokes the romance of field anthropology in its heyday when ethnographers were broadcasting themselves like seeds across the globe to study the culture and social mores of primitive societies. In 1933 New Guinea, as Lily King writes in her ""Acknowledgements"", Margaret Mead and her husband Reo Fortune met another anthropologist named Gregory Bateson. While immersed in their field studies a love triangle developed. The factual events surrounding the trio inspired King's novel. The idea of euphoria itself is explained by the Mead character, Nell Stone, as that moment when you finally feel you understand the culture you're embedded in. But it also refers to the realization and glad acceptance of one's being in love. Both happen in the novel deep in the New Guinea Sepik River region. I found this to be a fascinating novel because I studied a lot of anthropology in the days when Margaret Mead was required reading. At that time she was still one of the field's luminaries. King's portrayal of her as an ambitious social scientist living among primitive and dangerous New Guineans, learning the languages, helping the women, playing with the children, makes for a captivating read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2015","Jun 09, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21416301-euphoria

Not as frequently mentioned is David Jones, who many consider the best of the poets to come out of the war and whose verse-novel In Parenthesis most think is the finest work written about the war.Thomas Dilforth's superlative biography, David Jones in the Great War, covers the period of Jones's wartime service and how it influenced his post-war life and art. He served in the army longer than any other writer who experienced time in the trenches, and his service included the horrendous battles of the Somme and Passchendaele. Jones differed from the others we most commonly associate with the war's poetry because he spent his entire service as a private in infantry units whereas the others were for the most part junior officers. In telling the story of Jones's time in the army, Dilforth describes in great detail what day-to-day life was like in those units stationed in the trenches and how the mundane as well as the chaos of battle were used by Jones as sources for his visual art and his poetry. Probably for me,and certainly the primary aim of the biography,is that it explains how Jones's experiences were transformed into one of the century's great modernist works, In Parenthesis..In his ""Introduction"" Dilforth discusses how calling his biography David Jones and the Great War would have required a book much larger in scope than David Jones in the Great War. By focusing on Jones rather than having to explain the great events he was part of, Dilforth is more able to show how the art came to be expressed as it was. It's a rich story and the confidence with which the biographer handles his material amplifies the value of his telling.

Farrell is the author of the three masterful novels we call the Empire Trilogy: Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur, and The Singapore Grip. We find that by reading the letters and diaries of writers we admire can lead us to insight about the sources of their work. That impulse was unsatisfied in my reading of In His Own Words, the letters and diaries of Farrell. He wrote a wide variety of people. However, the letters concern business with publishers and agents. Or they are letters to lovers, who were numerous, but Farrell wasn't given to writing affectionately or poetically to them. Or the letters are notes to friends. Disappointingly, the collection shed no light on the thought processes behind his work, the ideas which were the engines running his writing. There is no debate with correspondents, no discourse or argument running through the letters. Instead there is personal news: the current progress of what he was working on, where he'll spend holidays, complaints about the lack of money. And yet anyone who has read The Singapore Grip knows that an intellectual current coursed through his thinking. Here, though, the letters to acquaintances reveal a degree of naivete. The air of pointless youthful enthusiasm never quite left him. He had literary friends. He was close enough to Margaret Drabble to be invited to dinner parties at her home. Yet the only correspondence to her in the book are thank you notes for the evenings. He knew Garcia Marquez, Saul Bellow, and Richard Hughes, but we have only notes to Hughes thanking him for a weekend's hospitality. He was friends with Jean Rhys, Sonia Orwell, and John Banville but seems not to have corresponded with them, a practice which might have leavened the collection with some bookish, literary dialogue to spice up these rather ordinary letters....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 06, 2014","May 20, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8861659-j-g-farrell-in-his-own-words

Because we've read many of the world's acclaimed works and having, through long years of reading, hammered a receptacle of appreciation together on the anvils of many great books and intoxicating glory days of reads and rereads, we (or I at least) often have trouble finding fiction that satisfies. And if a novel takes my breath away while also satisfying, that's frosting on the cake. I was excited when I learned of Zia Haider Rahman's In the Light of What We Know. Feeling I was on the threshold of a memorable experience, I wasted no time in reading it. Having finished, I'm still excited by it. Perhaps it's not in the same lofty stratosphere as Gravity's Rainbow or The Recognitions or Ulysses, but it's the most intelligent novel seriously and artfully addressing some of the issues and ideas of our time that I've come across in a while. It totally satisfies, and it frosted my cake.In the Light of What We Know is many things. It's primarily a philosophical novel of ideas which becomes a love story and in its final chapters develops a spy twist. It's no accident that Graham Greene's The Quiet American is mentioned more than once in the novel, though the halitosis (the thought is more Greene's and Rahman's than mine) is breathed on Afghanistan these days, rather than Vietnam. It's also about being an alien, the difference between information and knowledge, mathematics and how it relates to the world and finally how it validates its reality, and it's about writing. Politics and community are also addressed. Rahman is Bangladeshi in origin and Muslim, and his lessons on South Asian and Middle Eastern politics is fascinating.It's Proustian. A novel can be made lovely by its digressions, by stories within stories and by reflection within an overarching idea. It's digression that makes In the Light of What We Know so lovely. Much of it is conversation between 2 South Asian men, and the loops and spins of their talk carry them to the far corners of their lives, and ours. It's that use of the tributaries and oxbows of narrative that make great writing, allowing not only demonstrations of style but reflection on the primary themes which shoot like arrows through the novel. Proust could do it well. Rahman can, too. In the spaces of the narrative filled by digression is his finest writing.

A er of this recent New York Review edition and translation commented that we've read similar treatises before. And perhaps we have, but it still seems fresh. Part of it is certainly because it's so well written, and part of it may be that there aren't that many novels of the war from the French perspective available in English. My own judgment is that it is among the finest of the novels to come out of the war.As the title indicates, the novel is about the fear of men in combat. It's about men who almost expect to die and who accept the fact of it and the horrible deaths of those around them. It's about overcoming that fear, too, as the protagonist Jean Dartemont does. His own willingness to bravely face death are triumphant moments in the novel. So it's about fatalism, too. as are all very good war novels. There is no ""Vive la France"" or thoughts of the greater good in a political context. The tone is without patriotism. These are soldiers whose thoughts are on their own survival, not France's. Dartemont says near the middle of his career as a soldier at the front, ""I can assure you that none of the men I saw fall around me died thinking of his country, with 'the satisfaction of having done his duty.' I don't believe that many people went off to fight in this war with the idea of sacrifice in their heads, as real patriots should have done."" This is gritty and realistic and brims with truth. Though thirty years ahead of Joseph Heller's great creation John Yossarian, Chevallier's Jean Dartemont is cut from the same cloth.

I read this first biography eager to learn more about where the fiction I admire came from. I wI've been a fan of John Updike's work for a long time. I read this first biography eager to learn more about where the fiction I admire came from. I was a little surprised to learn that it came from his own life. For the most part he recast his own personal experiences into his writings. From the early short stories to the first novel, Of the Farm, to the magnificence of The Centaur to Marry Me and even to the racy, notorious Couples, Updike was telling his own story. The famous characterizations of Henry Bech, Richard Maples, Peter Caldwell, and Piet Hanema were all portraits of the author himself while other characters in the novels were based on his family and friends more or less, particularly his wife Mary. Equally surprising to me was learning that Rabbit Angstrom of the well-regarded tetralogy bears little resemblance to Updike.The way Updike recycled his own life and the lives of family and others around him determined the shape of Adam Begley's biography. Writing a critical biography was almost necessitated by that important trait of the fiction. I was pleased that the fiction received such detailed analysis. I also felt it appropriate that a man who put so much of himself into his stories and novels should have a biographer who relates his subject through that fiction. Almost every event of Updike's life has some fictional parallel. Whether a boy contemplating pigeons in a barn, the death of his mother, or adultery in Ipswich, Massachusetts, events of his life are inserted and interpreted in the work. Begley tells the biography in that way. For that reason it's all slightly non-linear, but it is fascinatingly full of descriptions and facts of how Updike lived, worked, and thought, including material sensational and tabloid-like as well as artistic and philosophical. It's almost seamless. In essence, the life is explored as how it relates to the writings. The happy result is that both life and the life's work receive comprehensive analysis. The happy result is thoroughly satisfying as a biography that's slightly eccentric but which is well organized and well written and runs like a well-oiled machine.Adam Begley was an insider. He's the son of the novelist Louis Begley (Wartime Lies; About Schmidt). We're told the Begleys also lived in Ipswich, which became the bedroom community of Tarbox in the novel Couples, and that they were friends of the Updikes. The biographer gives the impression he has a deep understanding of Updike and even knows more than he can tell. But the only door to the man and writer he uses is the work. His knowledge of both is convincing, satisfying.As neighbor, son of an Updike family friend, Begley knows all the players of the legendary Ipswich years. One charge against him is that he shows favoritism toward the 1st wife, Mary, friend of the Begleys, while painting an awkward portrait of Martha, the 2d wife. She's depicted as being a controlling influence on Updike, a gatekeeper who protected him from distractions which might affect the work and who also limited access, even from the children of his 1st family. Reviewers are aware of more than I can be, but it seems to me Martha's protective reactions are more normal than not, understandable given Updike's fame and the public demands on his time. As Begley himself explains, Mary began her life with him before he'd had even his first success, and she lived with him as he evolved. It makes a difference that when he married Martha he was already fully-formed as a prolific, prize-winning man of letters. Why is the question of Mary's and Martha's treatment so important? I suppose getting it wrong can be seen as a flaw of perception that might prompt arguments about other perceptions in the biography. Each reader has to come to his own satisfaction.As for myself, I was riveted by this biography. I learned quite a bit about where the individual works came from and why they took the shape they have. I learned a lot about an author who's always interested me. The detail of the subject's life and thought provided goes very deep. From the philosophical underpinnings of a novel like Roger's Version to relating the family crisis caused by a cuckolded husband confronting John and Mary, it's all here. But this is just the first of the Updike icebergs to float by. There will be other biographies. In addition, Begley tells us Updike was a busy letter writer and that he corresponded with many close friends in the literary world, Joyce Carol Oates and Ian McEwan among them. We can look forward to what's still to come. In the meantime we have Adam Begley's fine biography. I imagine Updike would've liked it....more",Notes are private!,1,5,1,not set,Jul 2014,"Apr 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18089918-updike

It concerns itself with a doomsday cult centered around the lone survivor of a coal mine accident in the American midwest. The inspiration was a 1961 mine disaster in Carbondale, Illinois. After successes with his early novels, Coover turned to the metafictions and experimental novels for which he's most widely known. The Brunist Day of Wrath is a sequel to the first novel. It takes place five years after the apocalyptic events attending the Brunist rise as a cult, and it chronicles an apocalypse of its own. The novel marks a return to Coover's original style of satirical naturalism. He still has the knack.One of Coover's major themes in his long career has been religion and its relationship with myth. The novel is about fundamentalism, evangelism, and Pentecostal millenarianism. His satirical voice is critical of such movements. The character Sally Elliott, as atheist, is the voice of reason and understanding and might represent Coover himself since the novel's long afterword is the account of how she wrote the nonfiction novel describing the cult's return to the place of its origins and the second vigil for the end of the world.At 1005 pages, this is a huge novel. It's populated by a huge, cacophonous crowd of characters, too. In the ""Epilogue,"" when Sally Elliott's writing her novel, Coover himself writes, ""Putting characters in was not what was hard, she realized. It was keeping them out."" Such a din of voices is a Coover signature. They and their homespun language make for a raucous populism. They even sing songs, their lyrics spatter the novel. A character list would have been helpful. A shorter novel might have made sense, but his story filled every one of its 1000 pages without my being aware of padding. Trimming might have been most useful in the 45-page ""Epilogue"" detailing how Sally Elliott wrote her novel. But I thought this, rather than being excessive, was Coover nodding toward the construction of The Brunist Day of Wrath and therefore nodding toward his own affinity for metafiction. Whether or not it's too long, I finally thought it quite an achievement. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,Nov 2014,"Mar 25, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17465579-the-brunist-day-of-wrath

I expected satisfaction on both counts and got it first because Kennan is well-known as one of the more influential voices for the policy of containment which drove our actions in regard to the Soviet Union and secondly because Gaddis has written one of the handful of outstanding biographies I've read in recent years.In describing Kennan's life and work as diplomat and historian, Gaddis necessarily has to discuss in detail the foreign policy issues and developments as the intense east-west competition after WWII locked down into the bone-chilling Cold War. Kennan, a Russian and Soviet expert and diplomat who'd served in Moscow more than once, sat at the heart of the confrontation. And so he famously was able to offer his government an analysis of Soviet intent and capability underlain by his deep understanding of Russian character and the basic motivations of its leadership, which led, at his urging, to the U. S. policy of containment of Russia rather than direct confrontation. His prescience and vision of a Soviet Union unable to keep up with the social and economic advances of the west's free societies became reality 40 years later. The middle section of the biography is thick with discussion of these issues and with how Kennan was a primary actor in forging a grand strategy where none had existed before, one which became the narrative controlling the international tensions of those years.Understandably, the geopolitical story is the central focus in telling Kennan's life. But Gaddis doesn't neglect the rest of his story: husband, father, historian, and public intellectual. One thing that makes this admirable biography is that Gaddis avoids the sensational. Many biographies bring focus on the personal failings of their subjects. Kennan had his, too. Gaddis doesn't put the spotlight on them, merely mentioning them to hurry past to sink his analysis in the meaty public affairs importance of the man he's chosen to write about. There is enough of the good Kennan to fill 698 pages, and the story of the influential diplomat-historian who wrote America's Cold War strategy is fascinating by itself....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 19, 2014","Mar 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13542550-george-f-kennan

Lu Anne's story mostly agrees with Kerouac's. Her telling differs only in small details from the events of the novel. What's most valuable is her insights into the events and into Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac. She was, of course, one of the travelers on the early cross-country sprees as well as being Neal's wife and, for a couple of weeks, Jack's lover.Nicosia writes that the friendship of Neal and Jack is the ""sperm and the egg"" at the beginning of the Beat Generation. At first I discounted it but then began to see Beats as a public perception, not as a way Kerouac and his friends thought of themselves, so perhaps the idea fits. What is overblown is Nicosia's claims for Lu Anne. While she arguably may be the glue holding Neal and Jack together, Lu Anne can also be seen as wanton and dissolute and willing to be led into petty crime by Neal. And this is in sharp contrast to Nicosia's picture of her as breaking new ground for women and their roles in society. As Neal's companion and kind of muse to On the Road she was a valuable observer, but to consider her a proto-feminist and revolutionary is to seriously overstate the case.The closing 2 sections are recollections by Al Hinkle, lifelong friend to all of them and fellow traveler on that famous road, and Anne Marie Santos, Lu Anne's daughter. It's in these sections that we're made aware of what a tender love story it was. Lu Anne made it clear she always loved Neal. And he told her, his 16-year old bride, that she was his one and only wife. They always had feelings for each other, and Hinkle tells us they continued to have a sexual relationship during their subsequent marriages, right up to a few months before Neal's death in 1968.Well, it's all clumsily written. Sometimes I thought Nicosia's transcription of Lu Anne's oral history, which he claims is true to her speech patterns, the best prose in the book. Nevertheless, it's all terribly interesting. I think this is probably essential reading for all fans of the On the Road legend.

These are the years in which Durrell wrote The Alexandria Quartet and 3 volumes of The Avignon Quintet, and he constantly kept Miller apprised of his progress and his thinking as he worked. Miller finished the Tropic novels and The Rosy Crucifixion. One of the more charming traits of the letters is the abundant affection they show for each other while at the same time being good and honest critics of what the other is writing. Durrell is the more elegant correspondent, though he often lets his boyish enthusiasm show, and this is in contrast to Miller's more workmanlike style. Always Miller seems bemused by his success. Durrell was grateful, of course, but he was also confident of his art and was more intent on producing a lasting body of work....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 16, 2014","Jan 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1619574.The_Durrell_Miller_Letters

Two things stand out for me in her translation. First, the explanatory notes following each canto are exceptionally helpful and comprehensive. Second, while any translation of Dante's work has to adhere to the spirit of the age in which he wrote it and to the sensibilities the characters carry, Bang has not been afraid to seed her translation with references which butt against the present. So we come across a moment in Canto IV in which Virgil says ""Let us go then, you and I"", and we understand she's connecting Inferno and T. S. Eliot for us in the same ways Eliot himself threw references in his work back to Dante. There are allusions to heavy metal music, the poet John Berryman, ""South Park"", and much more in our world which, Bang points out, may reflect Dante's. I personally laughed with delight when, in Canto VIII, she compared the Eagles' ""Hotel California"" to Dante's city of Dis. The strength of her explanatory notes as well as her many cultural links of the present to Dante's universe make this an accessible translation, especially for those interested in one less academic than others you might find on the shelf. And it's a delight to read, too. For those reasons it may be the translation for our time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Oct 14, 2014","Dec 16, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13166697-inferno

Perhaps she spends too much time on Moore's childhood. At least for me the biography stuttered until Moore entered Bryn Mawr and began to write seriously. After that it's a biography which is sleek and satisfyingly filled with what seems the right amount of detail and convincing understanding. Of course, Moore led a simpler life than most literary women. She never experienced the messy complications of love. She didn't have a drinking problem. She didn't take drugs. As a writer she was never involved in a literary controversy of any consequence beyond something as slight as the arrangement of poems or rejections. She was never crazy. She wasn't politically active. She just wrote what was always considered great poetry. Even considering that during her lifetime she was recognized as one of the great modernist poets of the 20th century, and is still regarded as such today, it's a testament to Leavell's skills in organizing and writing her biographical material that she could fashion such an engaging life story out of the conventionally normal Marianne Moore.During the span of her writing life and her stints at editing journals, notably The Dial, Moore knew everyone who wrote. The stories of her interactions with the influential writers of her lifetime, from Pound to Plath, make for fascinating reading. This is fine critical biography as well. Her major poems are discussed in depth as Leavell gives us, if not first insight, fresh insight about where they came from and how they came to be.Moore was 5'3"" tall, Leavell writes, weighed less than a hundred pounds, talked in a low mumble and praised others while disparaging herself. Yet her poetic gift and reputation hung about her as charismatically as her signature black cape, so that everyone was afraid of her. This is such a superb biography that such unintended intimidation and power is transformed into a lovely, loving life. Leavell has made Moore a woman I wish I'd known. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jan 15, 2014","Dec 09, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/17910294-holding-on-upside-down

There are differences, of course: Marlantes writes about the Marines, Boccia about the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Matterhorn takes place just south of Vietnam's DMZ, The Crouching Beast farther south in the A Shau Valley. Perhaps the most notable difference is that the Marlantes account of combat in Vietnam is fiction with all its freedoms of expression and imaginations whereas Frank Boccia's memoir is limited to the truth and to his own experience. Still, it's memoir as intensely riveting in its truth as any combat fiction you're likely to come across. Frank Boccia arrived in country and reported to his unit as a young, inexperienced lieutenant. In some respects it follows the familiar arc of refining skills while moving inexorably toward harrowing experiences in his future. The book covers 7 months of his Vietnam tour. I puzzled over, while reading, the lack of reflection. Boccia is intelligent and attentive, writes sensitively about the men under him. He writes descriptively about what it was like to campaign in those valleys and along the ridges above them. You learn what it was like to drop by helicopter into a landing zone or what it was like to have to endure one of Vietnam's violent thunderstorms while on patrol. This is writing good enough to put you right there with him. However, he doesn't record wondering about the North Vietnamese. He's a young man new at the war, but he doesn't mention wondering about what contact with them will be like. And he doesn't wonder about his place in the unit's mission, especially what Frank Boccia will be like under fire when they finally contact the North Vietnamese. He displays the confidence of a young Army officer but doesn't give the reader any sense of the anxieties which he must have felt about the dangers to come and how he'd perform under the stress of combat and its responsibilities. Again, a reader of this and the highly autobiographical Matterhorn can't help but compare young Boccia to the rich interiors of Lt. Melas that Marlantes gives us.The 2d half of Boccia's memoir is taken up with a baptismal action at Hill 1485 and his part in the much larger sweep by 3d Brigade into the A Shau Valley and the controversial assaults to take what came to be known as Hamburger Hill. You won't learn much about the actual course of the 11-day battle. Boccia's telling of it is limited to Bravo Company's part, though it's searing and fascinating reading. From start to finish this is a compelling read, but especially on Hamburger Hill.If one can find a damaging criticism of the book, it's that it needs maps. They would have added a graphic illumination and clarity to the narrative. This is most true in the long account of the assaults on Hamburger Hill. It's difficult to picture the swirling movements of Boccia's elements in that chaotic terrain without some visual aid.But though the book lacks maps, it's full of courage and the ""nobility of spirit"" Boccia said he wanted to convey to readers. It's a gritty description of what Vietnam was like for a young Airborne officer.

The year 1914 was the end of a remarkably long period of time without a European war. The end of the Napoleonic wars in 181This is excellent history. The year 1914 was the end of a remarkably long period of time without a European war. The end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 was followed by a century in which the only European wars were relatively small ones, like the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and conflicts along the peripheries, in colonies. The War That Ended Peace is a portrait of European society, governments, and thinking in the couple of decades before World War I and focusing on the direct causes. It's a subject as lumbering as the armies which began to march that year, and it's a complicated story, but MacMillan has written a history that's wonderfully readable and engaging. It's a familiar story--it's just that MacMillan has written it so well and so comprehensively that it seems fresh, like new knowledge or perspective.The long-term causes we've always been aware of are covered: the competition for colonies, particularly in Africa, and the arms race in dreadnoughts and artillery. Given the systems of treaties which had been put into place, given the 3 Balkan crises since 1908, there was a great deal of tension on the continent. MacMillan stresses that one of the most important factors to consider when wondering how Europe slipped into war was that given the intense competition for continental dominance and for hegemony in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire, that sick man of Europe, declined was the general thinking by everyone, every leader and government, that war was inevitable. In fact, some thought the sooner the better; Germany was afraid of a Russia rebuilding after its defeat in the Russo-Japanese War 9 years earlier and preferred a 1914 war rather than a later one. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated by Serbian rebels--brokered by the Serbian government, I learned here for the first time--it created a crisis in which some of the participants and key decision-makers were seized by the fatalism prevalent among Europe's leaders. Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia which they knew would be unacceptable, declared war when it was rejected, and the treaty systems and mobilization took over. Diplomacy was at an end. The move toward war had reached an irresistible momentum.Reading MacMillan's history we're always aware of some similarities between the 1914 era and our own. The author spices her narrative with many analogies which clarify the pre-WWI world because we understand our own. It's a big, messy story, but she makes it clear. She's able to simplify it to some extent because she says in the end it was a simple story. The war was brought about by failures of leadership across Europe, by a lack of imagination in their not being able to see how destructive the war would be, and by not having the courage to stand up to those who said Europe was out of options and the only course left was war....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 19, 2014","Nov 12, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17345257-the-war-that-ended-peace

In fact, though his history is primarily a military one, it's comprehensive enough to include the impact of the war's outbreak on all the belligerent societies. Equally important to him is how those societies adjusted. What was the public mood? Expectations? How did people learn to live with the new reality of war?But it is a military history. Hastings covers all the important aspects of the opening campaigns, Eastern and Western Fronts. The narrative of the German attack through Belgium and France which culminated in the Battle of the Marne is told mostly from the perspective of the British units involved. Surprisingly, I thought, Hastings is sharply critical of British Expeditionary Force leadership during these opening campaigns. He's generally approving of French leadership and unit performance, but his narrative of the war's beginning focuses on the British for the most part, told from all the many angles: military, political, social, and personal.He completes his picture on Christmas Day, 1914. His analysis of the situation at that time is fascinating. And because he knows where the story went from there, as we do, too, he spends time explaining how the situation at the end of the year allowed the future events to come about. He uses the word catastrophe only once, but that's his judgment of what happened to Europe in 1914. Who was to blame? He concludes the war was caused primarily by Germany. Though it didn't seek to bring on the war, it failed to use its influence in restraining Austria-Hungary from going to war with Serbia, thus allowing that first dangerous domino to trigger all the military alliances which were in place among Europe's powers, leading Russia then France to mobilize and finally bringing Britain in when it invaded Belgium. Hastings writes that Germany allowed Europe to slide into a general war because it thought it could win. Perhaps as history the book doesn't give us much new information or break new ground, but it paints a very clear picture of the complicated maneuvering, diplomatic and military, during those 5 months. It's a picture well done and valuable for that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2014","Nov 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17412744-catastrophe-1914

For all those years the poet Wendell Berry has been in the habit of taking solitary Sunday walks around his farm and holdings in Kentucky. And in the habit of writing poems about what he saw and experienced on those walks. The result is an impressively extensive body of work called Sabbath Poems. They're published in their entirety as This Day: Sabbath Poems Collected and New 1979-2013.These are all relatively short poems. They're meditative and Thoreau-like. They're pastoral, nature-conscious, and, as you might expect, observant of every personality of the seasons, aware of every type of wingbeat and footpad of life there. These poems are always sensitive to the passage of time, and they're modest and grateful for the world. In recent years the poems have become more spiritual. Thinking about Berry's awareness of and ability to articulate the wholeness of existence, it's no wonder he's been compared to the great Roman poet Horace.This is a remarkable sequence of poems. This is the kind of volume you want to keep nearby so as to be able to open it frequently and be brought back into contact with Berry's easy comfort in the world.

In the middle is the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. For that reason it's been called Pynchon's 9/11 novel. And perhaps for that reason it sings of New York City and celebrates its atmospheres and spirit in much the same way as the Bruce Springsteen album The Rising.I think the novel classic Pynchon. For me it's a happy return of the Pynchon I admire after what I considered the off-kilter Inherent Vice. On p327 is a sentence that outlines his fiction: ""Out in the vast undefined anarchism of cyberspace, among the billions of self-resonant fantasies, dark possibilities are beginning to emerge."" As in the best Pynchon, at the heart of the novel is a looming force whose mystery and meaning has to be penetrated and understood, in this case a thicket of malevolence and crime in cyberspace. The heroine gingerly stepping into this dangerous labyrinth of Deep Web and financial fraud is Maxine Tarnow. A free-lance investigator, her furtive probes bring her into contact with, as those familiar with Pynchon would expect, a rich assortment of colorfully-named characters, including CIA operatives, FBI agents, Russian mobsters, drug runners, and geeks. Several Pynchon keynotes are present. One constant theme is technology, and it's present here as the hidden niches of the internet and the bleeding edge of what's to come as well as the meaning they're all trying to discover. The familiar trope of characters disappearing into the grid of annihilation also occurs here, though the grid may be seen as the city itself. And on every page the dialogue zings like a bee. Much of it is throwaway, flip, and irreverent, full of puns and fun. Yet it's razor-sharp commentary on the times we live in. I think that not only Pynchon fans but anyone interested in a lively, intelligent read would enjoy Bleeding Edge....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 26, 2015","Sep 18, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17208457-bleeding-edge

It's spare at 161 pages, and it's double-edged in that it's filled with 81 photos complementing the text. It's a brilliant elegiac combination. O'Grady's fictional voice beautifully describes the protagonist's experiences growing up in rural Ireland and his life working as a laborer in England. That voice is melancholic in reflecting on exile, solitude, and the loss of a world without ever writing about them as such. The book is appropriately prefaced by John Berger, whose work, especially his novels about French peasantry, this novel resembles. Berger writes: ""The silence of the unsaid is always working surreptitiously with another silence, which is that of the unsayable,"" which captures the leanness of O'Grady's prose but even more so Steven Pyke's stark, melancholic black and white images of the land and people which form the other side of O'Grady's text. This is a profound, moving novel. It's a somber work full of depths and yet the reader is likely to be amazed by how nimbly O'Grady can capture a moment, such as these sentences about a wedding feast: ""We pass the dancers, flashes of white and red from their clothes, breezes blowing, John Conneely charges through a gap with his wife, his bad knees springing him forward.""

Bees do have roles in the poems here: sometimes they dart through a poem like a thought and sometimes, as in poems specifically about bees, they have a heavy, lumbering presence. However, most of the poems are not about bees, unless they also have a hand in love and death, Duffy's 2 great subjects. Homage is paid to people lost to the poet, her swollen heart turned over to the reader. In fact, my favorite of the collection is called ""The Dead."" The love poems also expose her. As always, they voice the hook in one's perception of the world, though she is careful to write, ""nothing and no one is wrong.""I consider myself fortunate to have come across Carol Ann Duffy a number of years ago and tagged her as someone I want to read. I've learned that to read her poetry is to consistently find intelligence woven with humor, powerful purpose given to us as art. It's no different with this volume. Duffy instructs us, she confesses, and she reminds us the meadow may have some corners untouched by the sun. Then she'll lighten the load by sending in her muse, the bee. She'll get our attention with a line as sharp as a bell--""Out of the silence, I fancied I heard the bronze buzz of a bee...."" And so that we remember the grace still abundant in the world she'll delight us with her own bee hymn:Been deep, my poet bees,in the parts of flowers,in daffodil, thistle, rose, eventhe golden lotus; so glidegilded, glad, golden, thus--wise--and know of us:how your scent pervadesmy shadowed, busy heart, and honey is art....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2014","Aug 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16365934-the-bees

People who exhibit the personality traits of extroversion, those who are more gregarious, more active in group dynamics, and more comfortable as the center of events are seen as those most successful at life. The person who practices activity over thought, isn't afraid of taking risks, and displays confidence in the ways they conduct themselves are generally more admired than their introverted counterparts who're often thought to be limited in terms of interaction and therefore less likely to be successful. Quiet people are sometimes thought of as disappointments. Extroversion is the ideal we're expected to achieve.Cain's study refutes the notion that introverts are limited or that the way they conduct themselves in society and business--private, shy, contemplative, even--doesn't have personal value or benefit society. She reminds us that some of history's leading personalities--political, military, and business--have been introverts. How our ideas about extroversion and introversion have led us to behave is that people pretend to be extroverted. It's a big subject. She writes chapters dealing with such topics as handling introverted children, how extrovert-introvert thought processes are different, the influence of temperament, and new business models that emphasize working alone. She writes about how solitude breeds more innovation. She emphasizes the importance of finding the work you love and best fits your personality. She spends considerable space discussing the notion of high emotional sensitivity in people and how it's related to introversion. In the end she stresses that while love is essential, gregariousness isn't.Most people would come, I think, to this book already thinking of themselves as introverted and, the general perception being that certain social skills, even intelligence, are lacking, looking for explanations and ways to deal with it. I know that I was looking for ways of seeing myself. Cain has some answers. I did find myself in her book but also finished it believing introversion is far from undesirable.

Admittedly our taking the Philippines from Spain and then suppressing the resulting insurgency was an act of empire building, and this is treated correctly by Hunt and Levine. But in considering the wars to follow, in my opinion they become wrongfooted. They seem to forget that the U. S. at the beginning of the 1940s was Europe-focused and didn't want to go to war with Japan at all. They seem to forget that rather than trying to hammer out empire in Korea after the war we'd removed our occupying forces from the country before the Communist invasion of the south. They fail to see the mid-century U. S. policy advocating the containment of Communism as motivating our military responses in Korea and Vietnam. They write a sensationalist history too often filled with the negative details which support their view of America's drive for empire. Aside from an insightful analysis of why our failure in Vietnam was inevitable, an analysis that impressed this old revisionist, much of their work is too polemical and self-serving to their central idea.

Here are essays on Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Marianne Moore, Emily Dickinson, Percy Bysshe Shelley and others that purr, growl, sing, rant and, finally, clarify how these poets have touched her. Her aim is to describe Wordsworth's great subject, the ""growth of a poet's mind.""The form is the essay. McLane herself is a poet, though, and the shape of the prose on the page is like that of poetry, as is the lyricism of her words and images. The poet central to her work is H. D. (Hilda Doolittle). She is the poet with whom McLane feels the most common links, attitudes, biographical similarities. It's in her loving discussion of H. D. that she writes thoughtfully about what poetry really is as art, a form of thought. But these are all her poets for a reason. From the polemic against provincialism she sees in William Carlos Williams, to the wildness at the heart of Emily Dickinson, to the expression of her feminism and sexual openness she finds in Shelley, these poets have spoken for and to her and have become hers.You've never seen anything like this before. Critical exposition, memoir, confession, love letter--take your pick. My Poets is all these and more. Not only is it engagingly insightful into the poets she writes about, it's breathtakingly lyrical in its own right and fun to read. It's probably correct to say it's valuable, too.

They carry the atmosphere of a studied Kerouac essay exactly detailing the texture of loneliness in the heart of a city. The stark sterility of the famous Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks comes to mind, too. Sterility figures heavily in the quality of the light. As you might expect of poems about night, they describe how these public places, abandoned until morning, are lighted. For that reason I think it can be said these poems are also about that light as much as what it reveals. It's a challenging venture, but Shapiro manages the difficulty in ways that are satisfyingly artful while also providing insight into the how light reveals and inhabits those places--gym, post office, museum--when we're not around, as if safeguarding them at the same time it possesses them.The last section is a series of formal, identical 21-line poems in tercets. About the common things of our everyday--bathtub, coffee cup, faucet--they remind me a little of Pablo Neruda's Odes.

On its cover, in fact, the book is labeled literary studies. The bibliographical references and index list on the copyright page include criticism and interpretation of Miller, politics and literature, censorship, and history. What I found the book to be primarily was a capsule biography of Miller, and it's fascinating for that, as well as satisfying. Rather than a study of Tropic of Cancer, Turner's work concerns itself with how Miller came to write it, and in doing so he had to relate how all of the 43 years of his life prior to the novel's publication influenced it.The most important fact about the early Miller was he was a failure. He'd failed at everything he'd ever tried to do. But he considered the most important failure to be his inability to write novels worthy of publication. He'd written several but he was told they were bad and he himself recognized them as second-rate. He was writing formally, conventionally. Finally, in Paris, out of the despair of poverty and that sense of failure at everything he'd tried to do and write, he decided to abandon all his previous styles and to write as he spoke and about what was on his mind. The result was Tropic of Cancer.In breaking new fictional ground, he became what Turner chooses to call him, a renegade. Miller referred to himself as a ""gangster author,"" much like the famous apaches of Parisian lore, the pimps, pickpockets and street fighters with whom he sometimes identified. Turner paints him in the tradition of frontiersman, those who were also renegades and braved new ventures in order to spread society and culture, in Miller's case literary experience. And like frontiersmen, Miller saw himself as a folkloric character and was, constantly talking, as busy at creating his own myth as ""crank, huckster, outlaw and utopian dreamer"" as any of them. In discovering that his gift was the ability to span the gulf between the spontaneity of talk and the meditative act of writing, the message was carried in what he wrote. So Turner's story is how the legendary Henry Miller remade himself through a new style incorporating his natural knack as monologist and by using the great, equally legendary loves of his life, June Miller and Anais Nin, as muses and came to write Tropic of Cancer. As Turner explains it, he learned to live in the muck of reality and learned not only to love it but to articulate it in his own savagely erotic way. In doing so, Henry Miller finally became free. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 15, 2013","Jun 07, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16073342-renegade

DaWhen Britons talk of World War I they use words like mud, horror, slaughter, futility, unjustified, command incompetence, and redemptive sacrifice. Dan Todman's The Great War: Myth and Memory is an analysis of changes in how the war has been remembered over the last 100 years and how the myth of those ideas has become the dominant way of thinking about the war. Because it wasn't always that way. As Todman explains, in the early 1920s for someone to suggest higher command was at fault or the war effort had been futile would have provoked a sharp disagreement. Today those who argue otherwise are considered ill-informed.Todman surprised me by insisting one reason for the shift was the poetry of Wilfred Owen. Arguably he was the most influential of the war poets. Unpublished in his own lifetime (he was killed in the closing days of the war), his friend Siegfried Sassoon published the poems in the 20s and 30s. At the same time the poetry was promoted by the poet Edmund Blunden, and he again published them several more times after 1960. Owen's mystical poems of doomed youth, fatalism, waste, and futility captured the public's imagination. And its popularity meant that the poems and their received meaning would be taught in schools and quoted frequently in the television documentaries marking the 50-year anniversary, freighting them with even more influence. That picture the poetry and the documentaries formed became dominant.The fact the World War II, by comparison, seemed to be a much easier war contributed to the power of the perceived myths of World War I. Particularly meaningful was the fact that combat losses in WWII were half those of WWI, emphasizing the slaughter and what many explained as incompetent leadership in the period of 1914-1918.After 1945 movies and novels continued to more frequently reflect the growing influence of the public perception so that novels critical of the war became highly successful during the 80s and 90s. Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy and Sebastian Faulks's Birdsong are only 2 of the examples Todman highlights.Perhaps the single most important counter to the burgeoning strength of the myth was that by the 1970s WWI veterans began to pass away in huge numbers. Many of them, if not most, had not experienced the war in such negative terms. But they were no longer present to tell a different side of the story.Todman tells us that there are essentially 2 histories of the Great War: a public history composed of popular beliefs emphasizing slaughter, incompetence, and horror, and a political history viewing the war in light of Britain's geopolitical position in which her entry and persistence to the end of the war can be justified as necessary to at least prevent German dominance of the continent, keep free the avenues of British trade with her continental partners, and prevent Germany from establishing a naval presence on the Belgian coast to threaten British control of the Channel. How these perceptions of the history came to be pushed aside as the most important issues of British participation in the war is the thrust of Todman's study....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 08, 2013","Jun 04, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2125150.The_Great_War

It's a classical philosophical question. As Jim Holt tells it, Martin Amis once remarked in an interview tWhy is there something rather than nothing? It's a classical philosophical question. As Jim Holt tells it, Martin Amis once remarked in an interview that we're about 5 Einsteins away from answering the question of why things exist and how the universe popped into being. Taking the thought to heart, he gave himself the task of talking to a succession of experts--particle physicists, theologians, philosophers, cosmologists, mystics, and a great writer, heavy thinkers all--who he hoped would prove to be one or two or three of those Einsteins shining a light down the path toward the answer.But before beginning he felt he had to come to an understanding of the concept of nothingness, which he concluded has been proven to be impossible because in order to experience nothingness there's still the consciousness explaining it. Too, such a nothingness would still be contained in something, which leads to the spiraling argument that nothing is an ontological option and that the universe is an impossibility if there's no one to observe it.Holt's investigation takes the form of a story, told engagingly and in ways accessible to everyone. Those he talked to are academics and scholars who have an answer or part of one:1. Adolf Grunbaum, a philosopher of science whose approach is to take existence for granted because it doesn't need an explanation.2. Richard Swinburne, who says the most reliable scientific explanation is always the simplest one, and in the case of creation and existence the God explanation is the simplest.3. David Deutsch first theorized the multiverse. He thinks there is no bottom line principle which explains everything.4. The philosopher Robert Nozick thinks existence is so rich it contains, in its absurdity, both something and nothing.5. Alex Valenkin, who has suggested that a quantum vacuum existed before and made possible the Big Bang.6. Steven Weinberg thinks that only by determining why things are the way they are will we shed light on why there is anything at all.7. The prominent Platonist Roger Penrose thinks that pure mathematics proves a world other than our own exists. In fact, he says there are 3 worlds or realities: the physical world of classical physics, the Platonic (other) world, and the world of human consciousness, in our brains.8. John Leslie posits a cosmos consisting of an infinite number of infinite minds, making our universe the contemplative product of one of those minds. He says the universe exists because it ought to exist, because Plato's vision of the Good created the need for it.9. Donald Parfit thinks that one of the multiverses is one in which nothing does exist.10. The novel Roger's Version was written by John Updike. In it he addresses the issue of God by having a character browbeaten into seeing that the universe came from nothing at all and that, further, the Barthian idea of God is so alien to reality that He could not have created it. God possibly may be found to exist through ontological necessity or math, but it would be a different God from that of the Old Testament or Billy Graham.Does Holt come to a conclusion? I think he does, if I understand him well enough. Part of Holt's method is to keep breaking physical reality down into its basic components and examining their relation to each other. Eventually he comes to the self and the idea that what we mean by existence is that thinking and feeling human beings think and feel themselves to exist. It's been said before, that humans create reality. Holt explains that at some moment in the history of the universe some atoms happen to come together in a certain way to create the self, each of us. The I springs into reality by recognizing itself and I creates reality by recognizing the physical world. All knowledge becomes self-knowledge and therefore creates the world. Holt recites Wittgenstein: ""The world is my word"" and ""I am my world."" To not exist, that is to die or to have never been born, is to deny the existence of the world. It either ceases to exist or it never came to be.Did I fully understand all of this? No, but I was never lost, either. Holt makes it more accessible that I'd hoped. I began the book anxious that I might be beyond my experience and that only by risking mental hyper-extension and brain hernias would I begin to grasp it. The subject is a difficult one. It's arcane and hard to wrap your mind around. Holt writes clearly, though, and in a manner which presents the concepts and widely-flung ideas and how he came to them as stories or parts of stories so that it's all rather engaging. If I didn't grasp every nuance of it, the read would have been much worse had the prose been a thick paste of scientific and philosophical terminology. Holt eases the journey, too, by being funny. The book also accomplished something important other than its obvious instructive values: it did what all good books should do, it made me want to read it again. It deserves another read, not because it's so difficult that it needs more clarification, but simply for the breadth of its understanding and for its elegance of expression....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 26, 2013","May 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8854815-why-does-the-world-exist

Streams of refugees arrived there clamoring for exit visas and transit visas and berths on the few ships leaving for the western hemisphere and safety. This novel follows 3 such refugees as they try to escape the war.This is described as an existential novel. The narrative's thick layers of ennui and spiritual disorientation make this plain. We're to see the refugees as the dead waiting to be ferried across the River Styx. The Eliot line ""I did not know that death had undone so many"" is never far from the mind as you read. And an image that won't go away is from our current broadcast news, the scenes of desperate refugees fleeing the Middle East and streaming across Europe.

Seghers cares for her characters and makes you care for them, too, and that makes a light to cut through the existential overcast.

It begins on a Navy ship approaching Okinawa in 1945 and ends about 40 years later. The novel covers his life as an editor for a New York publisher, his marriage, and the women he loves. But more, it's a novel which details the people in Bowman's life. Its dustcover is a photograph of a man swimming, and swimming delivers primal truth in the novel. I began to think of Bowman as a man swimming through life, encountering these people who help to stitch together the fabric of his experience. There aren't that many in comparison to some novels. I wrote down fifty-six. But Salter is skilled enough as a writer to make them essential to his story, to Bowman's story. And he can write gracefully enough that the stories of these characters aren't an intrusion, even if, as it happens, some entire chapters are devoted to this character or that and in which Bowman doesn't make an appearance.The novel is made up of setpieces of informed conversation, locales, and acute descriptions of the qualities which set them apart from other experience, the ring of silverware or the taste of a wine, the look of a Paris street or of a woman in bed. The joy of a Salter novel is the luscious prose. The simple declarative sentences, dispassionate and worldly, have such presence and poise, such clean vision that you begin to think all that is is what should be. Their accumulation becomes an elegance. Yet you know that within the images carried by these fundamental sentences is elaborate reality. It's not deep. Bowman doesn't swim in deep water until the final epiphanic moment, which occurs during a swim.

It waThe North Vietnamese Tet Offensive at the Lunar New Year in 1968, in January and February of that year, marks a convenient benchmark in the war. It was roughly about the midpoint of our active involvement in the Vietnam War. And for many it seems a seismic event after which American military fortunes and public attitudes took a negative turn. But the latter is only one of the misperceptions James Robbins writes about in This Time We Win.The sensational title is unfortunate. Robbins explains he uses it because he's frequently urged to set the war's record straight. The book he's written attempts to do that. It centers around the Communist Tet Offensive of early 1968 but his concerns are encompassing enough to cover the entire war and, indeed, to touch bases in Korea, Iraq, and Afghanistan. It's not a narrative history of the battle but an analysis which mostly addresses and tries to correct misperceptions. Perhaps the most glaring of those is that the U. S. and South Vietnamese allies were defeated. In fact, the opposite was the case. The NVA/NLF goal was to strike at many targets country-wide expecting the populace to rise up and overthrow the South Vietnamese government. As we know, an uprising was never even a realistic possibility. In the end the enemy was rather handily beaten back, and the NLF itself was destroyed as a field force and were never effective in large units again. He explains that the allies weren't surprised by the Tet attacks, as was widely reported. They'd known the enemy was going to attack during Tet and had even repositioned some units and made other preparations to meet the threat. Interestingly, Robbins writes that the plan of a popular uprising to overthrow the government and to force the U. S. out of the country was so outlandish and unrealistic that the Allies didn't quite believe it represented a true operational plan, and therein lies the surprise of the offensive. He addresses the widely-held belief that the Tet Offensive turned the American public against the war, brought about by the carnage and ferocity so visible on television, by negative press coverage which emphasized our having been taken by surprise and our desperate situation. Robbins shows through a detailed analysis of the polls that public opinion had shifted sharply against the war a year prior to Tet, in early 1967. In fact, as often happens during wartime, the fact of a resurgent and more dangerous enemy during Tet didn't discourage at all but made the public more belligerent and supportive of the war. In Robbins' analysis of the polls, public disapproval of the war came about as a result of dissatisfaction with the way Lyndon Johnson was conducting the war. They would have preferred a more aggressive and decisive administration.Robbins is the first historian I've read who lays defeat in Vietnam on the president. Having blunted the offensive, having sharply defeated the enemy, indeed, destroyed him, despite the military's urgings to strike back boldly while the North was on their heels, to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail and then push with major combat units into North Vietnam, Johnson elected to stay on the strategic defensive, urging and hoping for negotiations. He surrendered by bowing to the rising tide of negative public opinion and announcing he would not be a candidate for re-election.That asymmetry of national goals is one of the key elements of the war. Hanoi fought to win, fought for regime change and defeat of the South while we fought for a stalemate. From Korea we took the lesson that successfully defending the status quo is victory. Johnson believed it. In the end we couldn't win. We sent no signals to Hanoi that we were going to defeat them, that they would suffer terribly as a society and a political entity if they persisted in their aggression in the South. We didn't threaten to destroy North Vietnam or occupy portions of it. We did not do those things we needed to do in order to win.Following the news reports during those years you would think the U. S. was being defeated in the field. Robbins spends considerable time writing about the negative reporting engaged in by the press corps during the war, especially after Tet. His analysis of why and how the press got on a different page than the military and the administration makes for some of the most interesting reading in the book. It's well-argued and convincing.In addressing Tet, the wider war, and the lessons learned, Robbins makes his claim that the old arguments about the war are too simplistic. This is perhaps the book which best gets to the heart of the entire American involvement in the war, even though its core is about a battle in 1968 lasting a couple of months. I think this history is wise in its assessments. I think it tells truths about Tet, about our country, about our leadership of the war, and about the nature of war itself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 22, 2013","Apr 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8145438-this-time-we-win

History is perspective, and the processes of historical perspective are always shifting, a boiling stew of opinion, trends, methods, and conclusions. Histories of the Vietnam War are no different. Andrew Wiest, in his ""Introduction"" to Triumph Revisited: Historians Battle for the Vietnam War, compares the historiography of Vietnam to that of World War I. The dreadful sacrifice of that earlier war was traumatic, particularly in the view of British historians whose accounts we're more familiar with, and it was seen as having accomplished little. Disillusionment had a grip on the public in the 2 decades after the war. That orthodox historiography of mismanaged armies, wholesale slaughter, and despair became chiseled in the mind of the public. Wiest writes the same situation developed after the end of the Vietnam War. An orthodox historiography developed which had been influenced to a great extent by the news media and by the antiwar movement. By the time America's presence in Vietnam came to an end the public perspective and subsequent histories of the war was that it was a foolish venture, an unwinnable and wasteful war, and a failure of foreign policy. Both wars, however, have turning points in their respective historiographies. For the Great War it was the publication of the 1963 biography of the B. E. F. commander Douglas Haig: The Educated Soldier, which created an intense academic debate about the true interpretations of the Great War and which in turn began reversing accepted ideas about many of the war's sacred cows. The 2006 history Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War 1954-1965 by Mark Moyar serves the same purpose for America's road to war in Vietnam.Moyar's book re-energized the orthodox-revisionist debate about the war by claiming the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 was America's single worst mistake in the war, ending a competent government--and one which was winning--to be replaced by instability from which South Vietnam never recovered. Moyar writes the war was indeed winnable but was not, finally, successful because the Johnson administration failed to heed his military leadership who advocated taking the war to the enemy by physically interdicting the Ho Chi Minh Trail, by occupying southeastern Laos, and by invading and occupying parts of North Vietnam. In choosing to follow a strategy devised by civilian agencies of the government to gradually increase pressure on the North until they sought peace, remain on the strategic defensive, and in general, not threaten the North with defeat or even serious destruction, the U. S. mismanaged and lengthened a war they should have won.Triumph Forsaken seems to have been a watershed event which serves, as did the Haig biography for the First World War, as the point when history begins to shift from the orthodox view to that of what's now called revisionist. Triumph Revisited is made up of 15 essays--called ""s""--by a selection of leading Vietnam scholars about the various claims of Moyar's history. Most of these essays favor the orthodox view, I think, though the majority is a small one. It's divided into 3 sections: the war in the Asian perspective, Triumph Forsaken as history, and orthodoxy versus revisionism, and at the end of each section Moyar has written lengthy responses to the comments of the essayists. My impression is that Moyar's responses are the least interesting. I'd already read Triumph Forsaken and am familiar with his analysis. Here he merely writes rebuttals of counter-findings by colleague historians or else agreements with those who find his analysis of the history correct. The individual essays, whether orthodox or revisionist in outlook, were much more informative and therefore interesting. I especially liked the essay of David L. Anderson, persuasive in its examination of the true import of the famous domino theory. And Edward Miller writes a most interesting overall exploration of the orthodoxy-revisionist debate.But ultimately the book is like being at a cocktail party at the end of a hard workday listening to 2 people, fueled by too much wine, argue their deeply-held beliefs about the war. At the end of the long evening neither has given ground because such convictions--as in all political, and even religious, debate are iron-clad. Vietnam remains, for now, a war of mixed and emotional perceptions....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 14, 2013","Apr 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6757394-triumph-revisited

That axe has compelled him to tell truths and analyze America's strategy in Asia and the Middle East as he sees it. The analysis is grim. By the time I'd finished his ""Introduction"" and ""Prologue"" I was already discouraged and reluctant to learn the bad news I knew was contained in the book's body. Early on it reads like a valentine to Hilary Clinton and the late Richard Holbrooke and a harsh critique of Barack Obama and his national security team which is opting out of heavy involvement in the Middle East in favor of a ""pivot"" to the east to counter the rising strategic challenge of China. When criticisms are this rabid they become polemic, and polemics are always suspect because an oppositional agenda underlies them.Nation by nation Nasr analyzes the current strategic picture in the Middle East, with emphasis on those drawing most of the U. S.'s attention, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan. The war winding down in Afghanistan might be replaced by conflict America sees as necessary to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear-armed. Our deteriorating relationship with Pakistan will drive them into the welcoming arms of China which needs an Indian Ocean port on Pakistan's coast to support its energy interests in the Persian Gulf. Turkey's difficult position sitting astride the juncture of Europe and the Middle East is delicate as it tries to be influential in both.The final chapter is about China and is the heart of the book in that East Asian concerns are steering American foreign policy in the Middle East. North America will be independent of Middle Eastern energy in a decade or two. In addition, America's trade with East Asia is ten times that of trade with the Middle East. So our relations with the Persian Gulf region have become less important, and so Obama's pivot. But our decreased interest and influence will create a vacuum into which China will rush, and Nasr's concerned that China's mercantilist spirit in regard to oil, which he considers similar to that of Germany in the years leading to World War I, will create tensions resulting in conflict if she tries to control the flow of energy through the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. China's desire to control the latter is seen as perhaps the biggest problem. The United States and the West stand for free trade, for open economies and governments in a system developed in the early days of the Cold War as a countermeasure to Soviet pressures. China's position on a system she had no part in developing is unknown. The U. S. guarantees free access to trade routes, and confrontation looms in the South China Sea. In addition, Obama's strategy seems to be to ring China with points of containment. But in the past she's lashed out at those points which threatened her: Korea in 1950, India in 1962, the Soviet Union in Manchuria, 1969, and Vietnam in 1979. See? Grim. America wants to protect its Pacific hegemony. China wants to expand.This a recent publication. I've had it for only a short while and read it quickly in order to have its immediacy. It's two-sided.

I've learned that reading a Cunningham novel is to take a literary journey. I read By Nightfall with that understanding and those expectations.The Hours famously rewrites Mrs Dalloway in our time while bringing Virginia Woolf to life. Specimen Days, we were told, was laced with Walt Whitman quotes, but reading the novel one discovers that Cunningham has written in its three novellas a retelling of The Divine Comedy. So I began By Nightfall looking for, as I was told to expect, Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. It's there, the story of an art dealer and gallery owner of solid reputation and career destabilized by his sudden, unexplainable attraction to a beautiful young man. Peter Harris's life in art becomes the ideal terrain in which the familiar conflict between decay and art is played out, this time transferred to today's busy New York City gallery scene. Death in Venice is here. Peter is attracted to Ethan (Mizzy), his brother-in-law, and the attraction is strong enough to destroy the marriage and career he's spent his life in. The way Cunningham phrases it is that he's available to the forces of mortality. Literary allusion is here. Right out of the box Cunningham alerts the reader to James Joyce, Henry James, George Eliot, and Proust. Mann is mentioned directly because Mizzy is reading The Magic Mountain and carries a copy around with him. F. Scott Fitzgerald arrives later in the novel. But aside from these, there are so many fine touches in this novel. Cunningham skillfully layers Peter's complexity by giving us an early wading scene which involves his brother and foreshadows the wading scene we've been expecting, 80 pages later. He carefully interweaves the Mann elements of art, startling undertones of mortality, like that of the open maw of a shark which is both art and death, and even an evoking of Saint Sebastian which figured heavily in the Mann work.Just as you're becoming comfortable with Cunningham's Death in Venice, however, he shifts gears. He abandons Mann for James Joyce and puts his characters into ""The Dead,"" the concluding story of Dubliners. As the novel closes on a snowy evening in New York City, Peter Harris is surprised by the depth of his wife Rebecca's preoccupation with her brother and by the apparent shallowness of his marriage. As he watches the snow settle, his wife reveals ambiguities of his marriage he wasn't aware of, exposing for the first time his own hopelessness. He realizes Joyce's great themes of sexual confusion, death, paralysis, and futility. Peter has become Gabriel Conroy, Rebecca Gretta, and Mizzy Michael Furey. I thought it was brilliant. At that moment the novel soared and took me with it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2013","Apr 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8100015-by-nightfall

R. often wrote letters in the same obscure, circuitous, challenging prose style of his novels, especially so in his later years. They're marked by a curtness and by run-on sentences which side-step grammar and punctuation. With the exception of the loving letters to his daughter, Sarah, they're not at all conversational and to me displayed little warmth. This includes letters to those he considered friends or those in the publishing business to whom he needed to be polite. This doesn't mean he didn't intend warmth or politeness, only that the letters carry the same choppy style of the novels and read as if they're offhand. They begin slowly. For many pages the only correspondent of the young Gaddis was his mother as he traveled Central America, Spain, France, and North Africa. But those letters are filled with the eager thinking of an intelligent young man traveling for experience and using what he learned in the novel he was already writing, The Recognitions, one day to be considered among the most influential of the 20th century. However, other than some frustrations displayed in the few letters written to his wives and the obvious love shown in those to his daughter, and an ""Afterword"" by her, there's little here to give a sense of what the man was really like.Rightly, I think, Gaddis refused to offer explanation or meaning of his novels to critics or academics who requested it. He thought readers and writers interested in his work should interpret for themselves and that each interpretation would have some validity.

The novel is the story of Professor Joseph Skizzen, who teaches music at a small Ohio college. Because he has no teaching credentials, not even a degree, and because he emigrated to America without documentation of any kind and is necessarily forced to live a documentless life, it's important that he live that life without drawing attention to himself. He has arrived at middle age content and secure in his middling mediocrity. Another paradox is that Middle C is a language novel. William H. Gass has written a novel about mediocrity in language that springs with energy. Gass's prose is rich in metaphor, allusion, and puns. Each paragraph is loaded with idea. Each sentence takes the reader through meandering verbal currents or else rockets him down dense tricky cataracts of language. Either way will get you to a pool of wonder and appreciation, and to greater understanding of human truths filtered through the bland Joseph Skizzen and those around him. Though its subject is deliberate insignificance, paradoxically this novel is a blend of the diluted ambition of Joseph Skizzen with the nimble mind of William H. Gass....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 05, 2013","Mar 12, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15741474-middle-c

And it's a portrait of a woman, Kate Ennis, who's in love but on the run. The first two parts of the novel find her traveling to try and forget the relationship she's recently ended with a married lover of eight years. She's fled to Orcas Island in Puget Sound. Then she's in Ireland as guest at the castle of an acquaintance. And then she's back home as she works toward a decision. Pitch Dark reads like a meditation. It reads like the interior of Kate Ennis thinking about the complications of her life and relationship, complications piled on complications when she has an accident in Ireland and has to deal with the offhandedness of authority and the castle's servants. She's unsure of herself, she's lonely and stressed. She seems slightly paranoid, and she feels guilt.What's interesting about all this is that it's not told in a straightforward manner. There's narrative but it's revealed only a bit at a time and in a jumbled sequence. The novel's brief sections set off by line breaks are strokes or snapshots taken of a woman's flight from a relationship. They're like flashes of lightning at night slowly revealing a landscape as a storm passes over. At last we can see detail and make sense of it.Maybe it's at that time that we realize the writing is more interesting than Kate Ennis. Kate is a journalist, intelligent and insightful about her own past. Yet she lacks self-possession and the ability to approach her problems rationally. She can't be resolute about the present because she can't be sure she did the right thing in her love life. The trip through Ireland is a nightmare of indecision and letting herself be taken advantage of. Her story becomes painful. Adler has given us a challenging, well-written novel which, stretching the boundaries of narrative as it does, gives us an interesting way to look at a character. It's just that who we come to know at last might be someone who doesn't interest us very much....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"May 15, 2013","Mar 11, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13643033-pitch-dark

Then the confidence to leave conventional form for a different way to move them, Leah, Felix, and Natalie, through their stories.Those forms include the prose narrative with the dialogue in a smaller font, the dialogue not indented or set off in an otherwise conventional story about Felix, and the short, zippy chapters which propel Leah and Natalie along in quick step.

Smith failed at interesting me in the characters. I simply couldn't get involved in their lives. And I thought her development of place inadequate. As NW it's about a particular section of London. There are many references to specific locations. Her characters are always located on this street of in that park. Natalie changes clothes at Finchley Road. Felix notices a bus on Willesden Lane. Leah's on the train as it pulls into Kilburn Station. But the class, ethnic, and cultural flavors of NW, while hinted at by the characters themselves, aren't used to create the city character the novel needs. It's not fair to compare Smith, good as she is, to Joyce.

This record of his journey is a delightful celebration of the human spirit he found there. Above everything Grossman admired about Armenia was its people, the peasants of this mountain republic who've endured the stoney hardships of pulling a living from resistant earth. As he writes the events of his visit the primary focus is the people, whether fishing for trout in a cold mountain-locked lake, reading to curious children in a school, or, as in the last chapter, attending a wedding whose joy can't be diluted by the numbing poverty of the families. For Grossman these people stride proudly over the rocky paths and they shoulder back against mountains which tower over everything they do. One reason he likes them is they accept him. Even though he's obviously a Russian outsider he can so easily fit himself into their days. He enjoys them and they enjoy his curiosity and the mutual enjoyment allows vodka to flow on every page. He admires the land itself, dominated by Mt. Ararat, because of its fundamental link with the beginnings of all things and all history. Along the way Grossman, keen observer of human nature, is able to translate what he sees in the Armenian people into insight about peoples everywhere, giving him opportunity to write long digressions about habit, about how the human mind writes the world and our relation to it, about the joys of simple lives and how the inner beauty of people like these Armenians allows man to make everything valuable in life out of such stoney hardship. His penetrating understanding of the land and people combine with his elegant prose to unite the inchoate and the universal.

In this case music and landscapes, and she's offering us ways in which our countrysides and sweeps can be taken over by music. Even redeemed. The space in between is our true understanding, a moment of transcendence in which we're able to see them fuse into a whole. It's the end of our desire for either, the moment when sunlight becomes the music and, as she says, our relinquishing is the end of mourning.

Lie Down in Darkness, the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Confessions of Nat Turner, and Sophie's Choice have been widely read and admired for decades. This selection of letters, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's not the letters themselves--Styron was an engaging correspondent who wrote with intelligence and wit to those he cared for while not reluctant to verbally bloody other writers or critics who exasperated him. It's the lack of supporting information which I thought limited the edition. Though there is a five-page biographical ""Timeline,"" and footnotes, both are sketchy and don't provide what explanatory text could have. The facts of his biography during the course of these letters aren't noted except in the briefest of annotations. One has to intuit details of personality, politics, attitudes, and preferences from the letters. Personal narrative, too, such as family, homes, pets. He was a friend to such people as Philip Roth, James Jones, Willie Morris, and Peter Matthiessen, and the dialogue he had with them is fascinating. However, Styron didn't admire everyone, particularly if they were critical of his work. Styron himself might have appreciated more editorial explanation surrounding letters concerning or written to such people as Norman Mailer or Shelby Foote because his opinions were sometimes sharp and could register as ungenerous. I also thought the treatment of his two serious bouts with depression cursory. That story is well told in his brilliant account of his illness in Darkness Visible, though.

This is the rather restricted world of upscale Grand Riviere, MI during the Depression. The hard world outside is exactly that, however. Outside. The novel is this world viewed through the eyes of 7-year old Tommy MacAllister who always keeps in mind what he's been told is the good and best way of conducting oneself with friends and neighbors, and particularly with adults. It's adults Tommy observes most closely, and there the veneer becomes apparent as he realizes there are some things he doesn't understand but still knows enough to have misgivings about. Beneath the propriety of family and neighbors there's an undercurrent of mischief and misconduct he can register but not quite make sense of. Faintly reminding me of William Maxwell's fine Time Will Darken It, this is an intense and microscopic look at his parents, siblings, and those they socialize with. Nicely rendered, consistently innocent yet full of clues, it drags at times because the observations of Tommy are often too detailed without any forward movement in the novel other than his observations themselves. The long Thanksgiving Day dinner and Christmas day celebration are examples. The novel is best when Tommy sees adults being themselves. He suspects but doesn't fully understand.

Texas Stadium, where the Cowboys play, with its vast seating, its giant Jumbotron, concourses selling an array of products and a cornucopia of food and drink, all surrounding the pristine emerald playing field where America's game is played, represents America, and the 80,000 screaming fans all of us. Even more, Fountain may be suggesting a world divided, as the classical world, into gods and mortals. Think of those 80,000 mortals watched over by the high Olympian private boxes of the Cowboy and Texas elite. Bravo Squad, as they're called, are briefly exposed to this privileged domain. There they are celebrated as heroes--especially Billy, who's a Texan--until they realize the cold, true society of hypocritical gods makes no place for those who are, finally, not worthy enough. Even unsophisticated Billy, from the nearby small town of Stovall, recognizes the entire panoply of game and patriotic display, oracular Jumbotronic oversight and the musical splendor of a show featuring one of the high priestesses of pop, Beyonce, has the air of something religious, a ceremony to create an American reality larger than any truth ever experienced by these young men at recess from their war. Even young Billy feels ""the god in your head.""I liked those ideas Fountain put in my head, but I liked best the novel's language. Not just the dialogue, which lives, but the zinging descriptive prose. It reads like the neon fluidity of America itself as snappy phrase follows vibrant, perfect image tumbling after the hot sizzle of recognized truth about America and what it might all amount to. It's an energetic language fashioned just right for the indifferent willingness of young men amidst the popular frenzy of American sport made big business.So, Sergeant Dime proclaimed it a normal day in America. Dante had a more direct comment--""I had not thought death had undone so many,"" and Eliot used the same thought in describing the hordes crossing London Bridge. In the end, at the end of the game, at the end of their tour, the young soldiers of Bravo file out with the ""shambling"" multitudes of football fans leaving the America of Texas Stadium. Bravo is preparing to leave America itself to return to Iraq where death is only a possibility rather than a certainty....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2013","Jan 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15818032-billy-lynn-s-long-halftime-walk

The House of Ulysses is labeled a novel on the cover and title page of my edition. I'm not sure it is, though. There's little story except that of the Joyce novel itself. The only narrative movement is that which follows the course of the novel famously paralleling the Odyssey. There are characters: a professor named Ludwig Jones, a mysterious Macintosh man who seems to correspond to the mystery man of Dublin on that first Bloomsday, except this one carries a Macintosh computer, a mature reader, a young woman, an old critic, and a museum guide. We follow these characters as they walk through the Martello Tower, famous as the site of the opening chapter of Ulysses and now the site of Dublin's James Joyce Museum. As The House of Ulysses progresses, the characters stroll from point to point in the museum, each exhibit corresponding to a chapter of Ulysses. The novel is made up of a detailed summary of each chapter of the novel as the characters discuss it, followed by sections called ""Passageways"" which, as the word suggests, offer additional information indicating ways of understanding. Often the Rios chapter will be written in the same style as the Joyce chapter. Whatever it is, it's fun. And it's interesting from first page to last. The language is Joycean, as you might expect, full of double entendres, verbal mischief and magic, puns, and meaningful information about the intricacies of Joyce's work, including occasional mentions of Finnegans Wake and Dubliners. I don't know if readers not familiar with Ulysses would be engaged by the Rios novel. For those of us who are, some of the interpretative material and glosses will be old news, but much of it will be new.

From 16 October to 28 October 1962 the U. S. and the Soviet Union were nose to nose in a dangerous crisis broughtIt's a matter of record, of history. From 16 October to 28 October 1962 the U. S. and the Soviet Union were nose to nose in a dangerous crisis brought about when the U. S. discovered that the Soviets had installed in Cuba ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to strike American cities. The subsequent confrontation and diplomatic maneuvering which resolved the crisis without a nuclear exchange, an invasion of the island, or a general war was brought about by the Soviet insistence that the U. S. remove their own ballistic missiles from Turkey and agree not to invade Cuba in exchange for their removing the offensive weapons from the island.The White House meetings on the crisis were conducted by the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. Without the knowledge of the members, the meetings were taped. All previous histories and material dealing with the crisis had been prepared from transcripts rather than a careful audio appraisal of the tapes which were declassified only in the mid-1990s. Stern's book is an account of the course of the crisis as revealed through the content of the tapes and is presented as a very general narrative. As he demonstrates, the tapes debunk some misinformation and myths which have persisted through the years. In some ways the book takes particular aim at Robert Kennedy's book about the crisis, Thirteen Days, published posthumously in 1969. One of Stern's points is that ""History based on personal recollections rarely transcends the author's motives in writing it,"" and he calls RFK's book a self-serving distortion of the facts. Kennedy painted his position during the proceedings as that of a dove, but Stern writes the tapes reveal his arguments were for dealing firmly with the situation by the use of quick and comprehensive military means. The roles of others have been corrected as well. Thirteen Days portrays Secretary of State Dean Rusk to be a weak advisor; the tapes, which cannot slant their content, show Rusk to have been, instead, one of the president's more reasonable and consistently helpful members of the committee. The meetings of those 13 days are discussed from the perspectives and motives of the key players, from the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff who urged immediate military action to the president himself who saw almost from the first day that a trade, U. S. missiles for Soviet missiles, was the quickest, most reliable solution. All the voices are here: Vice President Johnson, Ambassador to the UN Adlai Stevenson, Mac Bundy, Paul Nitze, and others. One problem with the book is that as Stern focuses on the individual committee members to reveal their thinking and comments as the crisis progressed, main points become redundant, brought up in regard to Rusk, then with the Vice President, then Bundy, and so on. It's like stopping the tape to rewind and play again.There are some surprises in the book. I'd not known the fate of Berlin was such a concern during the crisis. American fears were that bombing or invading Cuba would result in a Soviet overrun of West Berlin, thus involving all of NATO. In fact, any military action at all against the U. S. would have brought all 40 of America's allies directly into the conflict. And I was surprised at the almost unanimous disagreement of ExComm members at the president's decision to make the trade, Cuban missiles for Turkish missiles. It's an interesting book, and it provides new perspectives as our picture of those 13 days become clearer....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2013","Jan 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13789914-the-cuban-missile-crisis-in-american-memory

Briefly we're told of his panic when she does. We're told of his fear of young hypnotist and subject being discovered by his mother and having to explain. What do you do when you're 13 and faced with a naked woman for the first time, completely under your control? Though this is the kind of story which necessarily needs a conclusion, we're not told how it turned out. It smacks of the apocryphal and, as the first instance of Cohen's being seen as standing at an angle to the universe, tends to set the tone for the rest of the biography which includes other mysteries. It's not exactly flattering, not an attractive angle, no matter how steadfastly Sylvie Simmons stands on his side.Often the impression Simmons gives us of Cohen is that much like a young boy, lost and without confidence, he arrives suitcase in hand, over-dressed, and in some new location willing to accept what new direction his life will take. I wonder if that impression can be a correct one, considering the enormous success he's enjoyed as poet, novelist, and as singer/songwriter. I'd begun the book warily, in the first place. So many show business biographies become corrupted by the author's need to record in detail every tour, every album and the personnel on it, every significant moment of the subject's life and where he was as well as who he was with. This biography doesn't escape that quagmire. Perhaps there wasn't much Simmons could've done about preventing this from turning into another of those music/performer biographies. About the time Cohen began to record and to tour as a singer, when he moved away from poetry and fiction, he became less interesting. Or, at least, Simmons was unable to write about Cohen in a way to rivet me to the page.I've always been interested in Cohen. I first knew of him as a poet but learned though his music that he wrote interestingly about his own experiences. I was always taken with the romance of his romance, presented through music I though was realistically adult. I wanted to read about all those intriguing muses of his songs--Marianne, Suzanne, Rebecca, Anjani--and all the artistic people he intersected with, influencing and influenced by--Jackson Browne, Janis Joplin of the legendary Chelsea Hotel fellatio, Judy Collins and the beginning of it all, Jimi Hendrix. They're all here. Still, the book paints a different picture of the Cohen one might have thought he is, especially for those who've seen one of the recent gentlemanly live performances. He can be seen as poet, novelist, and man of letters, but Simmons shows us the pop star. You can't have it both ways.Sometimes even the music is treated as casual. The idea of Cohen's albums is made to seem accidental, as if too often they were never intended or planned but came into being almost unbidden by musicians who got together to see what would happen.I discovered I wasn't interested in Cohen other than as a writer. When you combine Simmons's litany of tours and details about this Berlin performance and that appearance onstage with Judy Collins with the position of every album on the U. S. and UK pop charts and with the show-bizzy prose, you have a biography which might be less than you wanted. You have story and narrative rather than serious analysis of an interesting man. Another example: recently in real time and late in the biography Cohen spent 5 years in a Zen retreat in California with a lifelong friend and teacher, left there to study Hinduism in India while continuing to remain affiliated with his Zen studies and at the same time keeping up his observance of Jewish ritual. Yet, having finished the book I'm not sure what Cohen's religious views are or what his philosophical position might be. I still think Cohen an interesting man but I wonder how close Simmons got to him and how close, therefore, she can take the interested reader. It may be as simple as saying that Cohen the man and serious artist deserved a better biographer. Or maybe a better reader. But for now hers is his story and my experience is as I've described it....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 07, 2013","Jan 04, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12217971-i-m-your-man

That first beginning Perhaps the gift was the first impulse but it began a habit Richard Burton kept up with varying regularity the rest of his life. That first beginning in December 1939 was in a diary given to him. He recorded the family and school and church activities of his home in Port Talbot, Wales faithfully all the next year. That first diary reveals what you'd expect, a boyish enthusiasm about sports and the war. He ended it after a year and didn't record his days again until 1960. By that time he'd begun his acting career and was already quite successful. He was also married with two daughters.The main diary began in 1965 after ""the scandal"" of romance with Elizabeth Taylor while filming Cleopatra and the breakup of their respective marriages. It's pretty much a record of their relationship from that point on. His interests were literary. He read widely and often recorded what he read. I think the fact of the diary indicates an impulse to write himself, and he often expressed a desire to write, but he never did other than a few commissioned magazine articles.He wrote much less introspectively than I'd expected of one we're told read voraciously and sometimes deeply. Often it's a catalog of items which were a measure of their luxurious lifestyle. He and Elizabeth lived on a yacht and traveled the Mediterranean. As Burton recorded, they'd often go to their homes in Switzerland or Puerto Vallarta on the coast of Mexico. They were frequently the guests of people like the Rothschilds or Prince Rainier and Grace of Monaco. Their life was busy with the arrivals and departures of family and members of the high society they swam in, with the occasional bits of gossip Burton couldn't resist. His observations of people are usually interesting: the likes of Maria Callas, Lucille Ball, Rex Harrison, and others. Disappointingly he wrote less frequently about authors and what he thought of them. He did write more than once about Dylan Thomas, though, who he knew and admired. The writing of some others--Hemingway, for instance--he despised. Politics interested him, and always sports, all kinds of sports.While there is little profound reflection and little poetic writing, he did, as you might expect, have a lot to say about acting and making movies. His prose was a little stodgy perhaps and sprinkled with cute phrases he adopted--""as twere""--but he was a good actor and knew it. His own professional activity and that of Elizabeth's was almost an everyday subject. Reviews of this book emphasized Burton hated acting, but I didn't get that impression at all. He did baldly write that once, but he didn't complain. He did record the drudgery and the daily grind of filming in all kinds of weather. I do think he loved the money and the celebrity.And he loved his family. That characteristic of Burton stands out. He loved Elizabeth intensely, if not forever. He loved his children and constantly wrote about them, bragging on their accomplishments and beauty. Whatever he was in the public eye--actor, husband of Elizabeth Taylor and bestower on her of lavish gifts, celebrity--he was a loving gentle man concerned with family above all else.

Though she spent months away at a sanitarium near Paris, there are no letters here between the two of them. Only occasionally does Eliot unwind. These two years are the beginnings of the correspondence with Bonamy Dobree, the Leeds University professor and critic, which contain the ribald verse history of C.

The years of settlement were barbarous years in having to deal with the indigenous peoples they found there and felt the need to displace. They were also plagued with differences in their own transported societies, which was constantly shaken by political contentiousness and religious disputes, all of which caused upheavals threatening stability and a sense of secure future.

While his autobiographical writings don't offer much in the way of interpretive literary analysis, he does write close, penetrating portraits of almost everyone in the New York literary scene. No one escapes his critical eye, whether approving or unfavorable, not even himself. Some he admired as writers but disliked as individuals. Saul Bellow was an example. While he admired the mind and work of Hannah Arendt, he also liked her immensely as a person and was even sexually attracted to her, but held a strong enmity toward Arendt's best friend Mary McCarthy.As interesting are Kazin's social portraits. Unable to serve in the military during WWII, he finally made it to Europe in early 1945 as a reporter. His vividly descriptive picture of England and London during the war is one of the most interesting I've ever read. Coming as he did from the intense leftist stew of immigrant Brooklyn during the 20s and 30s, he was politically and liberally bent his whole life. That political orientation flavored his role in a cultural exchange visit he made to the Soviet Union and in the portrait of the people he met there. The student protests at home during the Vietnam era also inspired comments revealing an understanding of the immense social forces at work.While never a deeply religious man needing a close relationship to a supreme being, he nevertheless was always aware of his Jewish roots and was earnestly outspoken about the direction they gave his personal life. The book ends with his articulate debt to that heritage as he struggles with the anxieties brought on by the Jewish-Arab debate over Israel which threads through most of the book.This book's resolute, unblinking gaze at the man he saw himself to be combined with his legendary critical sense about American letters and ability to define its currents make this fascinating reading.

He writes with such elegance it's a pleasure to read an Updike sentence. Near the end of Self-Consciousness: Memoirs he describes watching Olympic ice-dancing on television and being struck by the poetry of the moves as the dancers glide and shift through their routines. The same could be said of Updike's writing, the fluid movement from thought to thought.Self-Consciousness is a memoir written in his mid-fifties, twenty years before his death. In 6 essays he describes the life he led, meandering here and there, flowing back and forth in time and focus. Like memory. He comes across as fairly honest, and he's not easy on himself, being frank about the ways he thinks he's failed as father and husband. The essays cover the town of Shillington, Pennsylvania as he remembers it when he was growing up there, his health issues, primarily asthma and psoriasis, his beginning to write and his struggles with stuttering, his unpopular support of the government during the Vietnam War and his inability to keep his stance from becoming public knowledge, an Updike family history, and an essay on how all his past selves contribute to his present self and, more, how his memories of those selves create a consciousness.To me it seems wise because Updike has the ability to so elegantly and with such clever insight relate what we all experience: sexuality, work, religion, family, our relation to the current events of our day. It's labeled memoir; it's also philosophy. Updike's memoir remembers his experiences as a postwar American who's had moderate (his thought) success at what he chose to do with his life. More than about John Updike, it's about the America he saw in his lifetime. In some of the generalities he makes about himself one can see generalities about America. The man who comes through in these pages is easy for me to like. Some of his attitudes and opinions mirror my own, including his controversial acceptance of our presence in Vietnam. His ability to go along with things and to acclimate himself to any environment in which he finds himself holds great appeal to me. In only one area did I not relate to Updike's expression of his conscious self. In the section entitled ""A Letter to My Grandsons,"" I thought it a little too detailed in Updike family history to be of interest to me, a Murphy.I thought it a clever structure, to focus on six biographical areas and use them to propel the narrative of one's life. Having been away from Updike for a while I'm always surprised at how impressive, how opulent his prose is. He wrote with great style yet it reads with an ease that encourages you to conclude it came to him easily. This is terrific, grand memoir which looks at a self in the context of the human. But it's only one story. He reminds us that billions of such self-consciousnesses make up history, each the center of the universe. You'll agree, though, that only someone like Updike could articulate with such refinement his place in the world....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jan 16, 2013","Nov 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13155803-self-consciousness

Joyce Johnson's book, The Voice Is All, is an examination by a writer and editIt's been a long time since I read biographical material about Kerouac. Joyce Johnson's book, The Voice Is All, is an examination by a writer and editor of how Kerouac developed the spontaneous prose style that brought him success as a novelist and poet as well as the spokesman--if reluctant--for what became known as the Beat Generation. I don't agree with those who say of this biography that it adds nothing to the Kerouac we already know. I think it does. I think Johnson writes with a deep understanding of her subject other biographies couldn't, particularly fresh insights to facets of his character and the conflicts within the man. She has, after all, the advantage of having been his lover rather than other biographers who try to explain Kerouac relative to the literary movement. Her book obviously makes extensive use of Kerouac's available papers. This is evident from the careful track of how he found his voice and became the writer we know.Johnson's study of Kerouac seems to have a few strengths which I think serve it well. I thought I detected attempts by her to write in the evocative language reflecting the different periods of his life. And her picture of Kerouac himself seems broader, more full than the man we encounter in other books about him. Also, her portrayal of those around him, those who mattered, are given more attention so that often the focus rightfully isn't on Kerouac but on those who influenced the directions he took. Every one of these legendary figures has a story which acts as a barb or fletch on the arrow of Jack Kerouac. Each was a factor, as Johnson relates, in his evolution as a writer. And all of it makes his story that much more interesting.The book follows him into the mid-1950s as he was polishing On the Road and finding his way toward the prose style that fuels what's arguably his best novel, Visions of Cody. I'd be happy to read it if Johnson chose to continue with Kerouac's life through the final dozen or so years left to him....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2012","Oct 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16109487-the-voice-is-all

He said it arose from a dream of his, and he simply wrote it down upon awaking. About feelings of loss, it describes a funeral, and the poem and its idea of funeral become central elements in Dublinesque, the novel by Spain's Enrique Vila-Matas.Samuel Riba, Villa-Matas' protagonist, is a retired publisher much concerned with the end of the Gutenberg age of print and its replacement by the burgeoning digital age. In a dream similar to Larkin's he's inspired to visit Dublin with friends to hold a funeral on Bloomsday for the Gutenberg age in Glasnevin Cemetery where Paddy Dignam was buried in Chapter 6 of Ulysses. When one thinks of Dublin in relation to literature one immediately thinks of Joyce. Riba's trip to Dublin is, naturally, a pilgrimage in homage to him, but others are strong presences here as well: Brendan Behan, Flann O'Brien, W. B. Yeats, and, of course, Samuel Beckett. In fact, Beckett is the most important because in Riba's impassioned visions as he travels around Dublin he keeps thinking he catches glimpses of someone who resembles him as he was, the young author of Murphy. And he finds a kind of transcendence at the edge of the stormy Irish Sea the same way Beckett did. Yet the Beckett figure won't stand still for him. It swirls away in fog in ways he understands as death so that what he and we experience is as much a funeral for the world as well as the Gutenberg age, a world in which Beckett, as God, goes away taking the sacred texts of Joyce with him.So it's a novel about defeat, in the end, though it's a majestic defeat. The demise of the printed word becomes the collapse of faith, the death of God, and the end of the world, even as Vila-Matas still finds room for optimism in the possible return of the author, ever becoming as elusive as Beckett, and all of it, the whole crumbling facade of print and literature slowly sliding down into the emptiness envisioned by Larkin.I believe Dublinesque to be the best novel I've read this year. At least it's the kind of read I search for. It's a deep pool of literary ingredients, many more that I've touched on here. The narrative supports such themes as instructions for readers, elegies for the declining influence of print, and vast choired hosannas sung in a litany of mentioned authors. Vila-Matas keeps stirring in metaphors and ideas until it becomes a thick brew. It's a dense, meditative, and triumphant mixture, and after the first refreshing taste the reader will be tempted to quaff it down quickly....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2012","Oct 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13031462-dublinesque

But Steven Pinker writes convincingly that the incidence of violence of all kinds has been in decline for centuries, and particularly during the 2d half of the 20th century. Generally, Pinker attributes this to the blooming of liberalism and modern emphasis on political correctness. Societies are more right-thinking and are everywhere undergoing what he calls a civilizing process, a revolution in humanitarianism and a belief in the rights of individuals and groups. After writing about the psychological motivations for violence, Pinker covers comprehensively a history of it with heavy focus on the causes of war, the strong forces within societies which foster violence, and the increase in those human virtues, like empathy and reason, which are sharply reducing it. So Pinker's exhaustive study of violence and its decline moves from psychology to history to sociology to philosophy.

Embers of War fits my ideas of America's involvement in VietReaders love to discover books which articulate what they've always known and understood. Embers of War fits my ideas of America's involvement in Vietnam. For that reason it's not surprising I'd like the book and consider it important in that it voices perspectives long needing to be made clear.Logevall's huge book is a comprehensive history of the French return to Indochina following the defeat of Japan in 1945, how it found there a burgeoning nationalism and a free Vietnam already proclaimed under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, how the French reinstated themselves, precipitating the revolutionary warfare with the Viet Minh which culminated in the decisive battle at Dien Bien Phu eight years later and the cessation of hostilities and division of the country at the 1954 Geneva Conference and how, from there the U. S. was handed, or snatched, the baton of responsibility for the security of South Vietnam. It's a big story. Logevall's organization of all this material and his careful narrative explaining all the complexities of Vietnamese nationalism and what's called the First Indochina War (1946-1954) is truly impressive.The bulk of his history is that war between the French and the Viet Minh. One of his most important considerations is explaining how Vietnamese nationalism led by Ho and the Viet Minh was complicated by its communist philosophy and how this association affected perception by western governments which found themselves locked in a competition with the Soviet bloc, a competition always threatening to destabilize into some kind of open conflict. More, how Ho's difficulties with the west were made even worse when Mao's communist armies defeated Chiang Kai-shek's republican armies in 1949 and when the Soviet Union and China recognized the Viet Minh as the legitimate government of Vietnam. Logevall spends a lot of time explaining Ho as shortsighted in not being able to see how the Vietnamese war and politics made up a part of the big picture of global political confrontation, and how his insularity precluded diplomatic moves which might have softened the west's view of the Viet Minh and their motives.One of the most important factors in this history, of course, was the Korean War, conducted primarily by America and finally resulting in a stalemate and armistice. The U. S. always, from the first moment, linked the two wars as part of the same east/west struggle. That linkage was emphasized by Eisenhower and was behind America's more active role in Southeast Asia following the end of the Korean War. The U. S. had held the line against communist aggression and charged France with doing the same in Indochina. But even massive material aid couldn't insure French success in the face of a stubborn enemy and growing domestic disenchantment with an 8-year war.As the book closes, how the U. S. became mired in Vietnamese politics leading to eventual military intervention, how the U. S. came in the end to make the same mistakes as the French, how the North Vietnamese decided again on a military solution to reunification, becomes the focus. Eisenhower's strong advocacy of blocking communism in the region, with military means if necessary, continued to dominate policy. Even recognizing the unpopularity of the Diem government in the south and the likelihood that that government would fail did not keep Ike's successors, Kennedy and Johnson, from pressing on with the same policies because America always seemed to plunge along the same path trusting the situation would improve. And always the need to be perceived, in the age of McCarthyism and shortly after, as standing up to communism was of political importance, as was the need to not ""lose Vietnam"" as Truman was said to have ""lost China."" All decisions regarding Vietnam were made in this heated political atmosphere in which America saw itself as the leader in the geopolitical contest with communism. Logevall carefully analyzes these points and many more as he arrives at the point of American military intervention.This is big, complex history. It takes many twists and involves many leaders of several nations, all of whom realize triumph and miscalculation. I think Logevall has done a masterful job in sorting it all out. For those with even the slightest interest in the Vietnam War, even for those who enjoy interesting history well told and well written, I think Embers of War is essential reading....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2013","Oct 17, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13155847-embers-of-war

The final poems are interesting in that they remind you Berryman was, after all, a gifted and complete poet.

A claim to rank and to worth thought not deserved or not yet earned. The concept as it concerned the Greeks went back at least as far as Achilles and Agamemnon in the opening lines of Iliad. By the time of the mid-400s BC its influence on rank had become the most important determinate of power among the Greek city-states. As J. E. Lendon informs us in Song of Wrath: The Peloponnesian War Begins, it was the primary cause of the war. The Peloponnesian War between Sparta and Athens and their allies lasted 27 years, 431-404 BC. Our primary source--though not the sole source--of the events of the causes and events of the war has always been The Peloponnesian War, the history by the great Athenian historian and general, Thucycides. From his history have evolved our notions of that conflict reflecting in many ways the conflicts of our time. Some of the political thinking of today and then can be mirrored. Though he limits himself to writing about the first ten years of the war, ended by the tentative but well-intentioned Peace of Nicias in 421 BC, Lendon's convincing analysis is that what was different between the modern age and the ancient, what's strange to us, and what caused the war and determined how it was fought wasn't a desire for conquest, political gain, and wealth, but instead perceptions of rank, pride, and honor, and questions of hegemony. For most of the century Sparta had been the predominant power of the Greek world. In 431 BC, probably as it had always been, divisions of power among the many city-states was well-established and universally recognized, though most likely not officially designated. It was an informal understanding. Challenges to the order were justification for armed conflict of some kind, the conduct of which wasn't the total war of our time in which we try to severely damage our enemies and limit their ability ro fight us. Greek warfare was largely demonstrations and raids, posturing and challenge. Defeat was often determined by one side or the other refusing to take the field. And wartime operations were carefully orchestrated to avoid escalation. Tit for tat. A Spartan invasion of the region around Athens to destroy crops was answered by Athenian raids along the Pelopennesian coast, but nothing more that would alter the strategic situation. So it was that in mid-century when Athens began to be a force in the region, primarily as a naval power, and acted belligerently in response to Spartan strongarm treatment of states near Athens, it was seen as a challenge to Sparta's hegemony and a bid for equal ranking--hybris--and an intolerable state of affairs for Sparta.Lendon writes that Thucydides understood his world and conflict in these terms. However, he didn't detail the impulses for war and peace in his great history. His audience, after all, was Greek, and they understood the importance of rank, pride, and hegemony without having it spelled out. The blurring has occurred in our own interpretation of Thucydides's history because we see war and diplomacy in terms of political gain, wealth, or conquest. So this is a fascinating work and one which forms a fresh perspective on one of the most important conflicts of the ancient world. Because it took place during Greek's Golden Age, it ripples culturally all these long years down to us.Other than the fascinating analysis and interpretation, which is what good history is, another attraction of Lendon's book is how well it's written. The language is almost Homeric, and it approaches the lyrical. I've seldom come across history written this well. If you enjoy reading good history written engagingly, and if you're interested in ancient Greece and the Peloponnesian War, this is a book for you....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2014","Oct 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13587170-song-of-wrath

The ""Afterword"" by the poet Eavan Boland tells us it's a catalog, comparing it to a cemetery for the Iliad's forgotten dead. These are the little-known warriors of the epic who receive only mention in Homer's poem. Oswald, in small verse biographies, brings them to the surface of the poem while letting Homer's heroes, the likes of Achilles and Agamemnon and Hector and Patroclus, sink out of sight. Each biography recording a man's death is followed by a short simile portraying some pastoral or domestic aspect of the man's life. Each simile is repeated in a process which Oswald explains is intended to present an elegy like that of a rhapsode which in Homer's Greece was followed by the chorus's repetition. The effect is stunning. I believe the similes the truest poetry of the book, even if Oswald tells us they're the closest to direct translation.

That's certainly the effect of Oswald's long poem. Memorial becomes a long elegiac contemplation of not only war but the tragic loss of men who disappear in the obscuring pervasiveness of battlefield death. She reminds us that men like Euchenor and Opites deserve to be brought from the depths of an Iliad veiled by the dust of desperate fighting and the agony of their own fear and pain to be remembered. She reminds us that they are 21st century men as well as 9th century warriors on the plains outside Troy.

But I think Strugnell is an alter ego for Cope herself, even while the verse reputed to be his is Larkin-like. In his voice Cope tries on different poetic forms, like the sonnet and the haiku, and I believe she also tries on Ted Hughes. This is a well-known volume of poetry. It made Cope's reputation as shining as it is today, and I'm glad I could finally come to it because it's not only impressive in terms of the craft she demonstrates, it's lots of fun, too....more",Notes are private!,-1,4,1,not set,"Nov 15, 2012","Oct 17, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13556245-making-cocoa-for-kingsley-amis

The point is made that as you climb events of the past take on a different shape and meaning, as seen from different points of your life. I see David Wagoner in this way, as a crusty and wise commentator who's already ascended, a hill rather than a pyramid, and who sits on top so that he's able to now see everything in its true perspective. And in poetry that seems wise he reports to us what he sees from his hilltop and how he remembers it as he ascended. His collection of poems is about memory, about how we perceive things now that we can't go back. We're past the point of no return. No writing fashioned in that way can not be about loss. He records that as well, but he celebrates nature more, with humor and compassion, a fly that's confused when a room is plunged into darkness, a pig standing with dignity in her mud. I imagine Wagoner high on his hilltop but he's not out of touch, not so high he can't hear the world's music roundabout, and he records it with lyricism that often takes a form I like, a stepped tercet that reads as if it's rolling its polished understanding downhill....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Dec 14, 2012","Oct 17, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13237052-after-the-point-of-no-return

Briefly, it's a book about the 1862 Civil War invasion of Maryland by Robert E Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and the Union response which led to the Battle of Antietam. It's a book about George B McClellan, the commander of that Union Army of the Potomac, and his strained relations with Abraham Lincoln and his administration. It's a full discussion of the motivations for the Emancipation Proclamation, issued after that battle, and its impact on the war and, in fact, all of American history following September 1862. To say it's an account of the Battle of Antietam doesn't do justice to Slotkin's achievement. The battle itself is discussed comprehensively, perhaps one of the best accounts I've read, especially in terms of decision-making by the high commands involved. But the Antietam Campaign itself takes up only about 40% of the book. Slotkin's grand history necessarily discusses the causes and progress of the war, the nature of chattel slavery in the South and its economic and political influence on the country, the friction between the command staff of the Army of the Potomac created by McClellan's ambition to wrest control of the war from Lincoln's administration and bring abut a compromise peace, and, finally, how Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation changed the war from one whose goals had been restoration of the Union through conciliation and an acceptance of slavery into one whose intent was to subjugate the South and destroy slavery as an institution. It's a big story. Slotkin tells it well. He writes with clarity about these complex issues. He writes in prose that flows as easily through the mind as spring-swollen streams moving heavily but irresistibly from point to sparkling point. The revolution Slotkin writes about is Lincoln's. In explaining the Emancipation Proclamation he changes perspectives. At least mine. I've been reading the Civil War since I was a pup but have never had things so clearly and convincingly explained as Slotkin does here. And I've never read analysis of George B McClellan so perceptive, have never read of how thick was the Army of the Potomac's mood for coup and the establishment of a military dictatorship, here so intelligibly demonstrated by Slotkin's use of the contemporary records.

It encompasses 50 years from the Italy where the blockbuster film Cleopatra is being filmed to a small Idaho town where a local theater group is staging an original, small play called Front Man. And through those years love is woven in the same way a shuttle carries thread through the warp of a loom. Walter's firm, controlling hand holds it together so it can be pulled together in the end to make a warmly engaging story. The author's writing is impressive in that he has to create sustained voices of several characters. Not only are their chapters in the different points of view, there are different pieces of writing within the novel, a movie pitch by a would-be screenwriter as well as the play in Idaho. Perhaps the best thing in the novel, though, may be ""The Smile of Heaven,"" the opening chapter of an unfinished novel by a character called Alvis Bender. It's a narrative made from several locations and times, cleverly stitched together.We want what we want, we love who we love is a mantra in the novel, an indication, perhaps, that we can't help ourselves but we win by surrendering to what we feel is right for us.And it's about the movies.

Then about the improvements, which happened later. Trying to imitate the highly acclaimed first 2 sentences of Richard Ford's novel which read, ""First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later."" For me this didn't work. The big reveal of those 2 sentences dammed up the narrative flow and slowed it to a trickle. A large pool of non-event was created in which nothing happened. The reader slowly approaches the dam of the robbery. We want to get over it and into fresher water. Because we always know what's coming--not just the robbery but later events, too--when we arrive it's with a lack of excitement or a sense of our already having experienced them. You want to cross over the event and get it behind because you've already lived with it too long. The first part of the novel is a 160-page bank robbery. It's always ""I'll get to that in a minute."" Momentum is denied. A short novel becomes one of moderate length. It's true that the prose is marvelous. Ford is especially good at painting character and they're sharply drawn. People like Charley Quarters, Arthur Remlinger, Neeva, the mother, and Berner, Dell's sister, vividly bristle with the attributes which make them compelling characters. The problem is Dell himself. He's a blank. He doesn't act on his own. He's merely recording and rewinding events without any particular insight. Fifteen-year-old boys aren't very interesting, even if their story's being told by the middle-aged men they become. A narrative lacks brio if it's merely relating what's seen, what's exterior rather than interior, and especially if we already know what's coming. It's true Dell has a psychological side but he tells the story instead of explaining it, and that's why knowing the facts too early hurts the novel. A narrative dammed by its opening lines backs into a pool of redundancy. The boy displays more energy later. However, the adult Dell of the coda hasn't changed much and is hardly better than the boy of Great Falls.In Canada, the novel becomes more interesting. A jigsaw puzzle of Niagara Falls plays a part in the novel. It's as if that spillway is leading us to different channels and brisker currents. Part Two begins with a fast drive down a straight highway with a vanishing point. The novel is made more mysterious, as if shrouded in dark and overhung as it is with the threat of approaching winter and by the events we've known about since the first page. At least the characters have enigma about them and give us flashes of color in the dark. The strange new life Dell chronicles is interesting as it builds a sense of tension, at least up to a point because Ford has told you what will happen. But he's also good here in providing atmosphere and menace. Dell, exposed to this new province of adulthood and its wonders, finally becomes a sympathetic character.I kept waiting for the payoff. It began in Chapter 38 in which Berner and Dell, cast adrift from their parents, cross a bridge over the river and move from one life into another. It's a border in a book of borders. It's a line in the novel as sharp as the line dividing the U. S. and Canada. The contrasts in the novel are always apparent: U. S./Canada, Bev Parsons/Arthur Remlinger, robbery/murder, paradise/hell, Part One/Part Two, Berner/Dell, innocence/guilt. There are even borders of learning. This is on p173: ""Their rules had governed our behavior and determined everything we did. Now they were gone, and so were their rules. It was a dizzying feeling. I felt I had a rough idea, then, about what the rest of my life would be."" Those thoughts by Dell, who finally began to understand. In the coda the older man he is looks keenly at the borders he sees everywhere. Berner has changed her name to the more benign Bev, like her father. Dell, tainted, driving north through Michigan, longs for the darker self he can be in Canada.I was surprised at my poor response to Canada. I'm a Richard Ford fan. I personally consider his Frank Bascombe trilogy a magnificent achievement and think those novels prove Ford a major novelist. I'm not exactly sure I can say what the problem is. I hesitate to say I was bored by the novel. It may be it's too personal to himself. If we think he wants to write about his own father, lost to him in 1960 when he was Dell's age, and to write about the boy he was, then it may be a labor of love meaning more to himself than to us. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 03, 2012","Jul 31, 2012","Jul 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13616591-canada

Unquestionably he's done that with a life so filled with detail that we know not only how he dressed but why he dressed that way, what his mannerisms were, what he ate, what his ailments were, and how he arranged his working day. Washington the man truly becomes real in these pages. Chernow's mastery of the material also includes a comprehensive understanding of the times and events in which Washington walked as well as those personalities who walked with him. You the reader get to know everyone.It's written in beautiful prose, too. It's the life of a complex man at the center of complex events yet Chernow writes so fluidly and clearly that such intricate issues as British taxation and the causes of the Revolution are easily grasped. And still, everything is adequately explained. Washington is one of the iconic figures of history. Everyone has some sense of his biography and historical importance. But on every page the reader will encounter some new fact, some new perspective or way of seeing, about Washington or the thick slurry of history around him. Such detail creates a new, rich portrait of the man. Even as we're given this new, all-inclusive portrait, it's never too much information. In fact, one of the greatnesses of the book is the happy balance maintained between the narrative flow and the wealth of information. Familiar with the facts of the Revolution, I know how well Chernow writes paraphrases of the military operations while filling them with thorough analysis. No doubt a history of this length could be written about Washington's presidency alone. But Chernow skillfully describes the two presidential terms and Washington's role in creating a republican form of government within the guidelines of a written Constitution, including restoring American credit, forming a diplomatic corps and a judicial system, and managing to maintain the peace, all while acting in accordance with his political philosophy of remaining a servant of the people. Chernow relates all this without bogging his biography down in the great swamp of exactness and fact.Along the way he's bold enough to oppose conventional historiography. For instance, he seems to disagree with others who write that the British can be faulted for underestimating the Americans and therefore not making a maximum military effort during the war. His claim is that the British tried to deliver overwhelming force but failed.Elegantly, beautifully done. As one who prides himself on always reading and always having been reading a biography, I think this one of the finest I've ever read....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jun 27, 2013","Jun 12, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10683230-washington

It's history, a history of the European dominance in world affairs and the reasons for it. It's geopolitics told through Ferguson's prism which receives the vast record of European history during the last several hundred years and projects it into a patten. The West has dominated, he explains, because they differed from the Rest, or excelled while the Rest didn't, in 6 key areas: the spirit of competition, the scientific revolution in the West, stronger social and political systems based on property ownership, the medical breakthroughs of the West, the demand and creation of cheaper goods, and greater capital accumulation through the work ethic.In 6 chapters devoted to these ideas, Ferguson explicates his thesis. I was a little surprised to find the Rest wasn't always the undeveloped nations of the world. Different examples of the Rest illustrate each of the 6 main points. Africa, for instance, is the Rest in comparison with the West's leadership in medical advances and disease control. South America is the Rest when he contrasts the differences in property ownership. In explaining the West's domnance in manufacturing and consumption the Rest becomes the communist political system. As I say, the story can be told in different ways. It has been before and will be again. Ferguson's book is a system of understanding the West's global dominance. But it's a system that works. Ferguson is a learned historian and writer able to fill a book like this with many aha moments and fresh ways of seeing. Religion is mentioned quite a lot. The Protestant ethic drove part of the West's success, he says, and now declining interest in religion is resulting in a less stringent work ethic. In another example, he writes that European geography with its many rivers and mountains dictated the formation of more numerous, smaller states necessitating the competition among them which was at the heart of European exploration and drive for empire. He compares this to China's large single-government rule and less complex geography.Is he right? I don't know. His ideas are one way to explain it. They're convincingly laid out and argued, and in ways providing an interesting, gripping read from beginning to end.. I suspect there's room for disagreement within the community of historians and geopolitical experts at his level, and I suspect there are detractors.He himself is an admirer of Samuel P Huntington. He mentions his thesis of ""clash of civilizations"" more than once. And agrees with Huntington that such things as the economic rise of China and the rise of Islam held up against the decline of Christianity are direct threats to the West. Like Huntington, too, and many others, he subscribes to the notion that civilizations rise and fall in cycles. Ferguson's conclusion deals with the West's downward trend in the cycle. All civilizations fall, he says, and their fall is always accompanied by and trumpeted by fiscal difficulties. Every time. Like we see on the news and read in the papers. Ferguson says the fall is swift, too--decades, a generation. Cycling upward? China, of course, though he admits there's room for them to stumble. But even with China dominating the globe economically and militarily, it's not the end of civilization.

It's a dystopian city on the west coast of Ireland in a time about 40 years in the future. Its citizens have gone to seed. There's little municipal control or services. Vice reigns as various tribes and chieftains compete for dominance.As fiction, it's a language novel. If the city isn't the central character the language is. The people of Bohane speak a kind of noir street talk made up of high slang and dialect which carries both the rhythms of Irish brogue and the Caribbean.The novel isn't so much the story of a person or group. There is a loose narrative. There's conflict, climax, denouement, and result. But the novel's more about the imagined town, Bohane, which is like a rich anarchic stew with characters as ingredients which swirl around and bubble up and down, coming into view as author and reader need them before sinking out of sight again into some thick neighborhood.

I was first attracted to it in 1980 by a  describing it as an Israeli Ulysses. ReadingThis is a favorite novel of mine, read several times now. I was first attracted to it in 1980 by a  describing it as an Israeli Ulysses. Reading it I was delighted to see it's so. Set in 1966 Tel Aviv, it involves the relationship of a couple who bear resemblances to Leopold and Molly Bloom. Aharon Megged has deliberately incorporated some pastiches of the more famous charactistics of Ulysses into his novel: there's a cathechism chapter with its heavily-worded questions, there's a scene on the beach in which Shuka is attracted to a young girl, there's a section of dense interior prose as a woman lying in bed wonders where her husband is, and everywhere, everywhere in every head and situation flows the stream of consciousness. It's a lovely novel in its own right and it's lovely as a tribute to one of the most influential novels ever written.There's a lot going on in the novel. Shuka, the husband and insurance salesman, is a fine template for Bloom. Elisheva, the wife, does the novel's heavy lifting because, beginning about p33, she's compared to Stephen Dedalus and carries him as well as Molly. Like Stephen, Elisheva is enormously intellectual. She teaches literature at the university and is busily engaged in writing a paper on Don Quixote. That's a key name indicating Megged has more than Ulysses on his mind. Elisheva's learning is at an elevated, idealistic level. She spends her days and nights musing and focused on literature and is so caught up in it that she has little time for the real world or the demands of family, much like the famous man of La Mancha. The lumbering, practical Shuka has his feet on the ground, just like Sancho Panza, and sees the world realistically. He looks after Elisheva and the practical sides of their life, too, as Bloom looked after Molly. The novel has many references to riding a horse, and to knights. Shuka drives a Fiat which he cares for lovingly and which is spoken of in terms you'd associate with a donkey. In fact, at one point his little Fiat runs away from him.As I say, Elisheva, professor and writer constantly reflecting on literature when alone or discussing it with colleagues, or with Amnon, a novelist and Megged's stand-in for Blazes Boylan, bears the intellectual weight of a novel which alludes to many writers other than Joyce and Cervantes. In the convesations of characters like these Megged has much to say about writing, artistic personality, and the relationship between reader and writer. Such names as Flaubert and Pinter flow through the blue Mediterranean air of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There's even a recurring story Elisheva imagines and keeps revising in her head which parodies the opening of Kafka's The Metamorphosis. And in the end Dante's terraced hell appears in the Negev.I hope I've made The Short Life sound like fun because it is.

Beginning at the end of his college courses in 1934, it traces the early years of his literary development as critic, er, and teacher. These are the apprentice years when he begins to write his first book, On Native Grounds, and makes the contacts which allow him to find steady work as a er. This is the dawn of the intellectual growth which will mark him as arguably the finest critical mind of the century following the death of Edmund Wilson. His increasing presence in the New York literary scene gave him admission to an impressive circle of important personalities. He knew Wilson himself but also creates portraits of such people as William Saroyan, James T. Farrell, and Clifford Odets.The 30s for Kazin meant more than literary consciousness, though. The great engines of the decade were the Depression and socialism. Everyone was touched by the former, and the latter had enormous influence on political thinking in America. Kazin spends considerable space here writing about socialism's impact; he himself believed in its ideals, mostly as the result of exposure to it while being raised as part of the hard times immigrant experience in one of the poorer sections of Brooklyn. Socialism was everywhere when he was a child and young man, like pollen in the air. Kazin recalls the fervor of the political activism as well as the tumble of disillusion as the realization of the Moscow purges became known, followed by the Soviet Union's nonaggression pact with Hitler. They, combined with the Spanish Civil War, created, for those on the political left, an atmosphere of disenchantment during the 2d half of the decade. For Kazin there's another revelation momentous enough to warrant a brief final chapter as epilogue. In the spring of 1945, in London, he watched newsreels from the newly-liberated Belsen concentration camp which demonstrated the crimes against the Jews. The thirties were both a time of awakening to literary learning as well as a time of movement away from the political left. He sheds the clothes of political influence and dresses himself in the habit of criticism and academia. In the beautifully written prose for which he's known, Kazin remembers those he knew and worked with during those years as well as some he treats unflatteringly, such as Mary McCarthy. He looks back, too, at Jewish life in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. It's a fascinating look at Kazin and New York.

I was attracted, I suppose, to his prose, to his thoughts on writing, and to the idea of true sentences put on the page. The book's seductive in that way, reading his rhythms, crystal clear sentences which roll into the mind with the same regularity and gentleness as waves meeting the shore. He's telling you about Paris in the 1920s. You may not learn anything about Paris during the period, or even about Hemingway, because it's all been said before and because much has been written about A Moveable Feast. You're familiar with the Paris he writes about, and the people he knew there, but you haven't read about them before in prose this unpolluted by blather or forced importance. Still, to be honest, I tried to dislike the book. If you own half a shelf of books on or by Gertrude Stein, it becomes unacceptable that a certain name not be spoken--Alice, Alice, Alice. Because Alice B Toklas is a household name--and I suspect that may have been true in the 50s, when this book was written--it makes A Moveable Feast seen dated, irrelevant, because Hemingway doesn't call her by name but instead refers to her as Stein's companion or ""the friend who lived with her."" And that he goes to elaborate lengths in a chapter dedicated solely to recounting the by now famous story of how he inadvertently overheard the couple arguing upstairs and heard Stein imploringly using her pet name for Alice--Pussy. Hemingway's telling this story without calling her in his book by the name we all know makes him seem catty and demeaning.The whole thing has an air of incompleteness about it. It seems directionless. Even considering additional sketches Hemingway had intended to leave out were tacked on to the original body, given some fragments he was working on were included at the end, the main part of the book feels unfinished, as if he'd simply put it aside and not returned to it. Those finished sketches seem only that, sketches, skeletons of impressions without the flesh and muscle of thought. In the section entitled ""Additional Paris Sketches"" there's a long one about boxing and an even longer one about he and his wife, Hadley, deciding how he should wear his hair. They're filled with good sentences but they're not very interesting, and their not having been woven into the rest of the book adds to the feeling of incompleteness.To its credit, the portraits of the people Hemingway knew in Paris are truly interesting. He writes of conversations with James Joyce and Ezra Pound. His portrait of F Scott Fitzgerald is fascinating, if a little mean and probably, in the end, unreliable. He wrote two send-ups of Ford Madox Ford which are hilarious. A sketch Hemingway wrote of his son--called Bumby--is loving and cute. The man could write prose to die for, as we've always known. It's just that he didn't always make what he wrote interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2012","May 11, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7171913-a-moveable-feast

As the title indicates, Sorley lays a large part of the blame for America's defeat in VietnaThis is another biography which assassinates its subject. As the title indicates, Sorley lays a large part of the blame for America's defeat in Vietnam on William Westmoreland, commander of U. S. forces there from 1964 to 1968.He'd had an exemplary military career. He was a West Point graduate, saw combat in World War II and Korea, rapidly rose through the ranks in distinctive commands, including that of Superintendent of West Point. But Sorley's description is of a man not considered one of the best and the brightest, a man extremely good at what he did yet rigid in thinking and limited in imagination, and therefore unsuited to army command, particularly in an asymmetrical war like Vietnam. Westmoreland is blamed for sticking to his strategy of attrition and thinking that the terrible losses the North Vietnamese experienced during the war would eventually force them to accept a divided Vietnam and negotiate a peace. It is true the strategy didn't work. The fighting was killing large numbers of the enemy, but they were willing to replace them. Westmoreland's doctrine of search and destroy moved the big battalions into the highlands and jungles away from the villages and population centers where the enemy continued to control the population. One of Sorley's main points is that tactical defeat for the NVA/NLF was inconsequential. He knew he could replace his losses and he knew American public opinion was strongly against the war. He didn't have to win battles in order to achieve his political/psychological goals, and so he was willing to continue fighting even when victory in the field was improbable. This realization was the assessment by Robert McNamara and other high-ranking officials that led them to decide our victory was unobtainable.In studies of Vietnam, perhaps America's most complex war and that most dependent on perceptions, it's thought that the U. S. and South Vietnamese allies made positive gains against the North after Westmoreland left the command and the war was given a different direction, even as historians agree that given the limitations of the U. S. government's waging of the war, in effect seeking a stalemate, a holding of the line rather than a defeat of the North while the North itself sought to win and overthrow the regime in South Vietnam, there was little Westmoreland or any other commander could do to achieve a victory Americans would recognize. But Sorley insists on blaming Westmoreland and does so by writing criticisms which appear mean-spirited in that they omit and distort facts and attitudes, making the censure of Westmoreland more important than accuracy of those facts. He goes beyond saying the search and destroy/attrition was flawed. An entire chapter is devoted to that alone, and he quotes many senior commanders who agree with his analysis. But he uses other arguments as well. He makes a case for the ineffectiveness of the ARVN being caused by our not supplying them with the M-16 assault rifle, and says that was Westmoreland's decision. He says the Americans were surprised by the 1968 Tet Offensive, when they weren't.It's true that Westmoreland wasn't the best man for the command of the war, even true that he was ill-suited for the post. But he deserves a better biography than this....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 25, 2013","Apr 25, 2013","May 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11294231-westmoreland

The two points are at the heart of Flanery's complex novel. It's a novel about modern South Africa set a dozen years ago when the Truth and Reonciliation Commission was working hard at damage control after the long, hard years of apartheid. But it's one in which racial injustices aren't the focus. The narrative follows, instead, the revelations and confession of wrongs within a family. Though the racial issue smoulders in the background, South Africa isn't seen through its prism but rather through the hellishness of its criminal activity, robberies, killings, home invasions, and the general danger of city streets. Every home has become a fortress of walls, double gates, and security devices, including panic buttons in every room. It's a bleak, frightening portrait of the country. The menace and impersonality of the state Flanery writes about recalls Kafka. Clare, one of the central characters, is writing a fictionalized memoir telling about her unforgivable betrayal of family members in the past. Sam, an academic, is writing a biography of Clare and remembering disturbing events loosely connected to hers. How Flanery brings these two strands together, two characters achieving absolution through confession and realizations of love while frenzied crime and fear swirl outside, threatening to spill over walls and in doors, is the novel's core.It's a well-written novel, tightly structured and controlled. One hiccup of objection: it's a novel of dialogue, discussion, confession and quiet disagreement behind and between walls, thick protective walls of stucco making compounds around houses, blank walls within the house, and sometimes the stark characters tend to lose their energy and to blend into the stark walls. But it's a tiny thing in a first novel otherwise nicely done. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 20, 2012","May 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13073575-absolution

It provided for a ceasefire in place and the withdrawal of all non-Vietnamese forces. And it expressed a desire that both Vietnams be united by peaceful means. Within 4 months of that signing, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to continue military operations aimed at the overthrow of the government of South Vietnam and a unification under the communist government of the North. Within those areas of the South the PAVN still occupied as permitted by the Accord, they built an enormous military presence backed by Chinese and Soviet aid. A limited offensive was conducted in 1974. In March of 1975 they began the general offensive designed to overthrow the South in a year.South Vietnam proved to be a house of cards.

Famous for what it stands for in the political history of Southeast Asia and also personally famous because it seems I'd always known of it but had never read it. I'm surprised at the towering cynicism. Part of the novel's legend lies in Greene's having supposedly foretold America's shipwreck on the rocks of the North Vietnamese unflinching willingness to pay any price to rid Indochina of western hegemony. But of course he coldn't see that. Published in 1955 the novel concerns the winding down of the French war and could not in any way have seen 15 or so years into the future. Perhaps if one gives Greene the benefit of the doubt and considers that he looked at the political situation there as one would project geopolitical interests into the future, and this at the request of British intelligence--another legend has it that he worked for them at times--one might say he could see the doom of American involvement. But he couldn't. He could see America propping up the French in the region. He could even invoke the domino theory as he does on p95, but if one understands its genesis then one knows Greene borrowed it and couldn't have projected it onto American geopolitical thinking prior to April 1954, a date which I think falls after Fowler speaks of it in the novel.If the reader knows a little history of the long conflict in Indochina and also knows a little about Greene the man, he'll be able to see how Greene waded in the bog of French imperial and moral bankruptcy while creating in the cynical Fowler a character who shares critical biographical details with the author. That Fowler's so much like Greene was part of the surprise. Before I began reading I was aware of negative American reaction at the time of publication to the depiction of brash naivete in Pyle, the young American idealist. So if you contrast that with Fowler's cynicism meant to be taken as worldly wisdom and an understanding of Asian character but perceived in terms of Greene's biography, then it's possible to see how Greene thought himself to be on the moral high ground but may have been merely displaying some of the same end-of-empire weariness as the French. This is in contrast to Pyle. Many of their arguments are from a chapter in Part 2 in which Fowler and Pyle are stranded on the road at night and take refuge in a guard tower. They disagree about the meaning of the war, but it's the French war. One wonders today if the novel created the antiwar sentiment or if opposition to the war made it possible to perceive that Greene saw it all coming. Which is stronger, the fiction or the history?My thinking is that Greene couldn't have foreseen all that. For one thing, the old, weary empire-burdened European misread American character. Alexis de Tocqueville said something like it was in the American character to know no boundaries. He expected us to expand, and we did, from the small provincial America to the Pacific, to Hawaii and on to the Philipines, to Japan and Korea until the surf of manifest destiny crashed ashore in Vietnam. (Remember you heard it here first.) The novel brings up the old revisionism to argue with conventional antiwar sentiments because the political disputations raised have overshadowed its literary merits.It is a good novel. It is a good story told well, even if The Quiet American has less imaginative writing than some of his other novels. In many places it's impressively written. I especially liked Greene's description of Mr Chou, how smoking opium defined him and how Greene, also known to have smoked, understood him. But it's heavy-handed, too. On the 1st page is foreboding--Phuong's name means Phoenix but we're told ""nothing nowadays is fabulous and nothing rises from its ashes."" Greene writes, ""his weariness with Saigon, with the heat, or with the whole human condition."" Fowler's--and Greene's--malaise permeates the novel, never goes away. Trying to assign literary traits to it, like the allegory of Phuong as Vietnam, Fowler as Europe and empire, and Pyle as American can do only returns us to the political because, as I say, that gloss of the novel can no longer, in the light of history, be avoided. In the end the largest issue becomes not the strength of Asian character or the value of The Quiet American as fiction but the senselessness of a spiritually sterile Europe continuing. In Greene's world decay contends with still expansive energy for the soul of Vietnam....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 30, 2012","May 10, 2012","Apr 30, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/828079.Quiet_American

Many men and women were killed in the period of the Sioux wars of the 1860s and 70s. In using the death of the iconic warrior chief as a kind of hub, Powers relates the history of those years made up of dispute and open warfare which ended in the death of the old, traditional hunting and raiding life of the Plains Sioux. It's a history written with the aid of the rich resources left by participants of both sides but most interestingly from the point of view of the Indians because it's a portrayal of primitives told with an anthropological precision giving us a detailed picture of every aspect of Indian life, not only warfare but also ceremonial practices, social structure, dress, food, ways of thinking about and dealing with death, and marriage customs. It's as clear a picture of what the Plains peoples were like as I remember reading. We understand the motives of the white men and the westward movement. Powers addresses that but to his credit spends even more time explaining the intellectual disciplines of the Indians and their understanding of the several powers in the nature around them, how they related to and used them. And also to his credit, as a history of the spiritual impulses of the tribes as well as the political, which was a thick stew of shifting fortunes and allegiances, it's told not in the stereotypical way of Indian oral histories but in the modern language in which this history has come down to us. This is probably the best book I've read at describing that seam where the Indians and white men met.The story itself is full of self-serving motive and misunderstanding. Powers demonstrates the friction caused by the contact of 2 culturally diverse and technologically imbalanced societies. His story is analysis which brilliantly isn't analysis but is comprehensive in its glaringly hostile attitudes these 2 cultures in collision had of each other. Without actually saying so, he shows why they couldn't co-exist. The prime mover of Powers's story may be Crazy Horse but this is a larger history of the displacement of a people which is human, tragic, and utterly fascinating, and which the author follows well into the twentieth century....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Aug 06, 2013","Apr 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10714289-the-killing-of-crazy-horse

Over thirty years ago Dyer first saw the film Stalker by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. Still fascinated by what he saw, he's written a book about the film which is a synopsis and interpretation of the narrative. But that's just the start point because it's more than just a movie to the author. There's layered meaning, if not in the story itself, in the rich cornucopia of allusion it pulled from Dyer the viewer. He uses its plot elements as referents to his own life and even illustrates how they can pertain to the lives of us all. Dyer gives himself up to whatever he's reminded of and reflects on it all in footnotes, some so long they become digressions. The longest of these runs for 7 pages. In this way the book becomes a meditation, on movies, particularly on Stalker and other films by Tarkovsky, and on how we reach the point at which we totally understand ourselves. He writes about how the older we get, for instance, the more we think about and yearn for the past. He makes a case for the close relationship between hope and belief. He questions whether or not the majority of us really want to understand the heart of what he calls our souls.Stalker is a film relatively few of us have seen. I felt my understanding of the book was limited because I haven't seen it. Though Dyer's commentary is detailed and interesting, I felt I couldn't begin to appreciate what he so clearly loves because, not having seen the film, I have no visual accompaniment to his text. I think we've all seen something similar to it. A trio of men enter a Chernobyl-like Zone which appears to be restricted by some toxic hazard as well as government control. At its heart is the Room, and when our characters reach it Dyer suggests it may be an area where our most ardent wishes may be realized. That promise may be the key to Dyer's passion about the film. As the 3 men return from the Zone and sit over a beer, tired and dirty from exertion and tension, they seem to realize what they sought hadn't been found. More, what they'd learned turned out to be empty. And perhaps that's Dyer's point as well, that in the end it doesn't amount to much. You enter the Zone in a mild funk, uncertain, and you leave the Zone still wearing the uncertainty just like your sweaty clothes and waterlogged boots. But in the end if man's purpose and the meaning he creates is an empty chasm, at least the steady eloquence of Dyer's prose is the reliable guide into the Zone and back again....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 08, 2013","Apr 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12575105-zona

At the heart of his story is American imperialism and racism. It seems to be his intention to illuminate American traits of the past we'd easily recognize as those of today. For the period around 1900 was the seedtime of American imperialism, manifest destiny spilled over the west coast into the Pacific. The sections of the novel dealing with the war concern primarily military and political events in the Philippines, which was a war quickly won but just as quickly mired in a transitional guerilla war today called the Philippine Insurrection. If the reader doesn't connect the events and situation with Iraq, Sayles helps by writing the Philippine chapters in a kind of journalistic style as familiar as the recent media coverage in the Middle East. San Epifano is seen in the same light as Fallujah.Racism is Sayles's other major theme. The narrative and its characters are rooted in Wilmington, North Carolina. Almost every character is connected there in some way, and about half of them are African-American. The events in Wilmington revolve around a Jim Crow vigilante movement which drives the black population out. However, racism extends everywhere in the novel. Bigotry sprinkles the far-flung localities: Filipinos are slurred by American soldiers fighting there, even by the black units, which are themselves considered second-class by the rest of the military. Ethnic groups such as Jews or the Irish in America are denigrated, discrimination is ubiquitous, epithets are freely used in the novel's dialogue and multifaceted points of view.Much of it is seen in terms of journalism and meant to reflect the vaulting energy of an America teetering on the platform of a new century, poised to spring into it to create or seize its destiny. Some sections are written in a journalistic idiom complete with headlines, a character called the Yellow Kid sells the sensational news of the bustling new America on the streets of New York City, editorial cartoonists sketch their ideas, Mark Twain comments to the press, even Damon Runyon, I think, has a voice here in a chapter representing the popular reportage on the war. In fact, sections written in this style, reflective of the news of the day, combined with cameo appearances of some notable historic personages plus the vast reach of the novel itself make it a kissin' cousin of the USA Trilogy of John Dos Passos.It must've been Sayles's idea that such big themes required a big novel. He provided it. And it's impressive. Sayles's capture of the language and atmosphere of these many, many characters and the wide broadcast of settings his plot scatters among these many pages is flawlessly controlled, be they Filipino insurrectionist or young boy hawking the evening edition on Broadway, black soldier in Manila or racist newspaper editor in Wilmington. They're meant to reflect the varied types of people in motion during this transformation from frontier perspective to international aspirations. Sayles doesn't miss the historical and societal shift from the agricultural/industrial to the social consciousness/political. This is a new America, the seed sprouting from the bud Sayles writes, on its way to full, expansive bloom. This is an America bursting its boundaries, in full flow into the world while at the same time shackling elements of its population with a familiar repression. The paradox of growth and racism and xenophobia. The creation of the age mirrors our own yet lets that age, 112 years ago, live on its own. Built into the narrative are some important events of the turn of the century allowing it to be singular in its own way. American politics is a constant slow simmer underneath the narrative, President McKinley is assassinated, mention is made of a new sandwich called a hamburger, New York's small industries thrive in sweatshops.It may not be brilliantly achieved. It may not be great fiction. On the other hand, perhaps it is. What I do think is true is that in a few spots it rather heavy-handedly splashes its message into the mind. The novel's first page, a ""Frontspiece,"" is apparently a description of an editorial cartoon in which Uncle Sam and Lady Liberty stand on the shore looking west across the ocean before them in expectation. In the final pages Sayles writes for us a scene in which the cholera-stricken Yellow Kid, being treated by the black Dr. Lunceford, points out with hand laid on hand that they're the same color. But Sayles stumbles in this way only a few times--remarkably--in such a long novel, though it tends to jar the reader convinced of the author's ability to write with realism and grace. Because Sayles can write beautifully descriptive prose while deftly controlling a narrative as big as America itself, brimming with a swarm of energetic characters in motion. Perhaps it does shine an uncomfortable light on a moment of Americentric prejudice which Sayles suggests still exists. Maybe the clouds are parted to reveal the beginnings of an American triumphalism just being recognized and endorsed by an industry and populace too energetic to be contained. The triumph in that sunshine is Sayles's....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Nov 2012,"Apr 11, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12044190-a-moment-in-the-sun

Besides knowing very little about the warReading this interesting history I discovered that some of my preconceived notions about the war were wrong. Besides knowing very little about the war itself, I realized what familiarity I have with it is through British perceptions. The histories most available to us are British histories, and so such innovative work such as that of Florence Nightingale is filtered through British sensibilities, and the attention given to something like Tennyson's ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" has made that action during the Battle of Balaklava as iconic as Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg. The fact is the British had only about half the force in the field as the French, and British lack of success, both on the battlefield and in caring for their army, meant they generally had to follow the French lead in the conduct of the campaign.That's only one of the new perceptions of the war Figes's big sweeping history gives us. It's comprehensive, and it covers not only the military operations during the conflict but the political and diplomatic activity in the couple of decades prior to the war and after. Figes explains clearly the Russian ambitions in the Balkans and the religious tensions between Ottoman Islam and Russian Orthodoxy which provided the backdrop to Russian territorial incursions igniting the war, ultimately involving Britain and France because they feared Russian expansion in the Black Sea and their potential occupation of the Bosporus and Dardanelles. He asks the reader in his ""Introduction"" to be patient because his detailed consideration of the historical contexts of the war means the descriptions of military operations don't begin for about 150 pages.Figes's work is important for opening up to us the Russian side of the war. In addition to the discussion of Russian military operations and political actions is another new perception, this covered in the war's meanings in myth and memory, of the significance the defense of the Crimea during the mid-1800s has always meant to Russian identity. He writes that the loss of the Crimea during the collapse of the Soviet Union was a severe blow to Russians, and adding this fact to Crimea's obvious strategic importance in the Black Sea the reader can also understand that Putin's recent restoration of the peninsula to Russian sovereignty served to restore reputation, too.It's history enlivened by some of its actors. Tolstoy's role as soldier in the Crimea is detailed. And so is the role of Nightingale and others in providing medical help for the wounded. Political and military leadership is analyzed thoroughly enough that their strengths and weaknesses give them the qualities of characters in a drama.One quibble is that Figes's claims for the technological innovations developed during the Crimean War or some of the harsher realities of the nature of the war ignore the American Civil War. His claim on p275 that not until World War I would armies again be subjected to the horrendous scale and nature of injuries caused by industrial war is an example of this overreach.But there's much more to admire in this history than there is to quibble about....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 02, 2016","Dec 02, 2016","Mar 13, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11979430-the-crimean-war

Many are to stage producers, such as Roger Blin in Paris, famous for his work in and on Godot, or to publishers, agents, or translators. Reading, you notice they become like friends. So the distinction blurs. Beckett was a warm, generous man. You learn little about how he worked. He didn't say. He also refused to discuss meaning. The works mean what they say, he explained. It becomes more and more apparent that melancholy was a normal state for him. He writes many times of being sad or ""not in the mood."" Often he demonstrates the same hopeless resignation as his legendary characters, particularly in letters to Pamela Mitchell, an American lover. ""In the place where I have always found myself, where I will always find myself, turning round and round, falling over, getting up again...."" he wrote. He wrote Mitchell, ""Yes, I'm gloomy, but I always am."" To Patrick Waldberg he said ""...not just the hope but the desire is dead...."" These letters are the words of Beckett himself. He was a private man, though, and the reader won't learn much about him from them. Instead, the editors have provided a comprehensive and scholarly approach to his correspondence which includes thorough introductions describing Beckett's activities during those years, plus yearly chronologies and detailed notes accompanying each letter. Together with the letters this volume forms an important portrait of one of the most important writers of our time....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 03, 2012","Mar 06, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11580294-the-letters-of-samuel-beckett

This volume covers the young and precocious Sontag froThis is the first of three planned volumes of Sontag's journals, edited by her son David Rieff. This volume covers the young and precocious Sontag from age 14 to 30. It's a period of learning for her though she already appears learned.The early entries are about 2 primary awakenings. First is a blossoming intellectual strength through studies at Berkeley, Oxford and the Sorbonne followed by a return to the U. S. and a professorship at Columbia. The early 60s also saw her writing her first novel, The Benefactor. In addition, these journal years are filled with her sexual awakening. At Berkeley, at 16, she recognized herself as a lesbian. Later, at Chicago, she married sociology professor Philip Rieff and bore their son, David. In Europe, without Philip, she returned to an affair with Harriet, her lover at Berkeley and later, in New York, was in a long relationship with Irene, never returning to her marriage.The entries are mostly notes, lists, and jogs to herself indicating directions she wanted to take. Few entries are developed into purposeful prose; it's sometimes difficult to determine what she was thinking, what her attitudes were, at least in depth. And it's difficult to follow details of her biographical narrative. What is clear is a strong sense of increasing self-awareness and expanding interests. If there's little about her writing, these notes carry hints at what she was reading and studying and how it all influenced her. Many of these entries are intensely personal. Confessional. Difficult to completely understand her, it's also hard to like her. She whines, complains, bemoans every bump in her rocky love life. Or she writes as though her love life is filled with trouble. She loved hard, agonizing over every experience. Writing her feelings down helped her cope with them, just as noting her scholarly advances allowed her to keep track of the path she climbed. It's equally hard to relate to her learning. Part of it is her enormous intelligence. At 16, at Berkeley, she was filling her journal with challenging entries demonstrating this. Continuing to do so because they were intended for her rather than a reading public, they're not particularly helpful in helping us understand Sontag. Tailored for her own use, she doesn't have to explain how she got to the peak; she's already there and writes in the knowledge she used every day. The troule is, at the top of peaks like Sontag's mind, sometimes a cold wind blows across such a landscape filled with rock and wind. Stark, direct sunlight is wasted. One comes to understand the journal reflects the kind of woman she probably was.So in this first volume of journals we're able to follow the two parallel courses--emotional and intellectual--of this clever California girl from New York to Europe and back, through lesbian affairs to marriage and motherhood to women lovers again, from young Berkeley undergrad to Columbia professor and novelist. It's quite a ride. By 1961, Sontag disliked herself.

His study traces the significant ways American myth has changed as popular responses to the frontier have changed. The earliest Puritan settlers saw the wilderness before them as a vision of hell populated by demonic Indians and transmitted their message by way of the sermon. As settlements moved west the constant contact with Indians and frequent confrontation were responsible for many settlers, especially women and children, being carried into captivity. The literature resulting from this was the popular captivity narratives and their emphasis on the return of those carried off and their hope of redemption. After the Revolution came deeper penetration into the wilderness and the advent of the hunter myth such as stories we associate with Daniel Boone and Cooper's Leatherstocking characters in which the attitudes of settlers favored being more like the Indian and adopting his belief that by using the fundamental resources of the wilderness--trees for building and animals for food--one is renewing the self. Slotkin completes this study, the 1st of 3 volumes, with analyses of how Thoreau's Walden and Melville's Moby-Dick are examples of the extension of the hunter mythology. Through it all the wilderness is seen as the symbol of the primal states of nature and of human consciousness. But always, Slotkin explains, our relationship with the Indians is the identifying characteristic of American history. Settler and Indian coexistence evolved from the Puritan fear of them as hellish demons to a wary alliance with them during the period of the captivity narratives to eventually arrive at the idealized heroes like Boone and Deerslayer who strive to reap the newly-realized rewards from the wilderness, those of self-renewal or self-creation through the violence of the hunt. So the mythology of the frontier moves from Puritan attempts to save the Indians to personal redemption to a regeneration of the wilderness by its destruction. He concludes this volume by showing how America has used these myths throughout its history and in the shaping of a national character, even to how it contributed to attitudes about the Vietnam War, just ended when this volume was published.

It's ahape is a big square demanding more room in your lap than most books. And for a volume of poems not selected or collected it's thick. The size is appropriate because Albert Goldbarth writes big. I like it when a er tells me each page of a book presents a world. I'm attracted to the idea of encyclopedic writing. Most novels so hyped disappoint. Goldbarth's poetry doesn't make the encyclopedic claim but that's what you get.The poems here are for the most part long ramblings. Or so they seem to be; there's more organization and purpose that at first meets the mind. His poems run from point to point, topic to topic like puzzles we used to draw to reveal a familiar object. So in reading you follow his points of seemingly disparate thought until you realize the picture he's revealed to you. Beginning with an image of a fox running across a snowy field, before you know it you're reading ideas about the insignificance of earth in the non-scheme of things before finally returning to how the fox relates to Odysseus shoving away from the shore. A Goldbarth poem gives you a lot to chew on.As you'd expect, these are poems about the variety of human personality. Everyday people given to us in big solid blocks of long lines and looping thought, a little like a journal entry. There's a middle section about Darwin and how his ideas are applied to current social norms. And there's a funny little (for Goldbarth) poem told from Ralph Waldo Emerson's point of view about how a visit from Thoreau fills the room with the gassy by-product of his bean crop grown at Walden Pond. He's best, though, writing about ordinary men and women and how they fit into the larger forces of nature and society or as units of national character. Or--and Goldbarth never gets far away from thinking cosmically--he describes us pinned by gravity on a spinning sphere moving at mind-boggling speed through a mind-boggling emptiness. Goldbarth thinks as deep as history. His poems read like gathered wisdom. I picture him standing in the night watching distant flashes of lightning.

His volume of poetry about his habitation of the place remembers the spirit of Thoreau's time spent at Walden Pond. In fact, many of these poems have a Thoreau quote as an epigraph. Kinsella begins there and never lets himself get too far away from the Walden experience. The poet even deliberately identifies with Thoreau by planting beans. All of Kinsella's poetry I've read has concerned itself with the nature of a place. Here he's a long way from Walden Pond. Kinsella's home is largely desert with plant life hardy enough to maintain itself there and animal life overseen by inquiring kangaroos.

Beginning it, I thought it pedantic, even preachy. As a novel about atrocity and racism, I thought the author's points too plainly and eagerly hammered home, without grace. What bothered me, too, was that Lamont Williams, a 21st century individual necessarily treading water in the sea of information we live in, could be so ignorant of the Holocaust. But I was unsuccessful. I soon began to like The Street Sweeper.Perlman has written an engaging, even gripping novel, and the faults I held up soon began to feel less heavy. His story is a big one and concerns, at least in part, a historian trying to find evidence that elements of a black U. S. Army unit were present at the liberation of a Nazi concentration camp near the Rhine River in 1945. In this way Perlman assigned himself the monumental task of writing a novel linking 2 of the most malevolent philosophies of the century, Jim Crow racism and the Holocaust. I believe he succeeds, and part of his success is achieved by using a literary dissonance I'd thought lacking in the opening chapters.There's a lot going on. There are at least 3 threads of the story: the story of Henryk Mandelbrot, Holocaust survivor, the story of Henry Borden, a psychologist who does primary research in interviewing survivors in 1946, and Adam Zignelik, a Columbia history professor looking for the African American link in liberating the doomed Jews. All these strands are brought together around Lamont Williams, a black ex-con and the street sweeper of the novel, who acts as a kind of redeemer.There are still a couple of small quibbles. First, the novel is a little too verbose and repetitive. Second, Perlman himself is an Aussie and embedded some unnecessary Australian elements in his story. One of the characters, the Columbia history professor, is Australian and tracks down and interviews one of the Holocaust survivors in Melbourne. In a novel very much about American blacks and European Jews, I thought the nods to Australia forced and awkward.If at times a searing read as the conditions at Auschwitz and the ways the systematic murder was carried out are detailed, The Street Sweeper is still an interesting novel of memory, racism, and history.

For that reason the biography of a writer necessitates an analysis of the work in order to fully understand it and the artist and their relation to each other. He thinks any biography other than a critical one wouldn't be complete. For that reason he writes extensively here abut Williams' work, especially the poetry, and about what it has to say about the man. This is critical biography so rigorous the study of the work almost obscures the life. The biographical details of Williams' life are almost in outline here. However, the analysis of the writing is thorough and interesting throughout. I personally appreciated the long chapter devoted to Williams' masterwork Paterson. He also has particularly insightful things to say about an earlier book, Spring and All, explaining the ways it was important in breaking with tradition and acting as a kind of springboard for the new American poetic form Williams was trying to forge. His anti-Eliot stance as well as his own relations and mutual influence with other poets such as Denise Levertov and Louis Zukofsky are explained well. But it's Leibowitz's examination of poetic form and meaning that are at the heart of the book and, as he convinces us, the man the poet was. Always he sees Williams in terms of America, just as Williams wanted to write exclusively about America and her people. Deep in his poetry he saw flaws in Ameerica, and he didn't shrink in pointing them out. But obvious in the poetry is the humanity he saw in the people as a practicing doctor and poet. One tiny surprise. I was going to read the book regardless--it's William Carlos Williams, after all. He was a womanizer.

How to lure the craft and tease it out like the killdeer does.What's also wonderful about Hall's poetry is that you can never use it up. You'll never get to the bottom of it. Come back to it, find something you didn't see before. There's a certain dissonance to the poetry here. If you look behind the words and dashes, there's a larger world.

They may be more important theIt could be argued that Alfred Kazin's Journals may be the most impressive journal in terms of thought since Emerson's. They may be more important the Woolf's. They're comprehensive, meditative, and wise. He was probably the most important critic of our time, certainly and at least since the death of Edmund Wilson in 1972. On every page is some wisdom about our age or about literature. On every page is some whizz-bang lightning of insight. He began keeping a notebook when he was a child. The first entry of what we now know as the Journals was made on 14 May 1933 when he was 18. Always a heavy reader, even at that age he wrote discerningly about literature. And as his training prepared him as an academic, as his teaching and writing experience continued to inform his life and thinking, his Jounal became the treasure chest where he recorded the inner man and thinker apart from his published autobiographical works. He wrote in his Journal every day. The practice became the high point of his day. He called it talking to himself and recognized its theraputic value as well as the best way of recording and keeping track of lines of thought. The whole man Alfred Kazin was is here, not just literature and philosophical musings. The stormy relationships with wives is here, the love for his children. Most of the greatest literary names of the century are mentioned here because Kazin knew them, rivals like Lionel Trilling, friends like Saul Bellow. Kazin had affairs with many women. He records some of that here, sometimes in tones erotically nostalgic. In later years his entries became a little more dramatic and self-conscious as his health deteriorated. But it doesn't detract at all from the power of his intellectual talking and writing to himself every day for 60+ years. This is a fascinating record of a man's lifetime journey and an insightful overview of the literature of the age....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 10, 2012","Nov 24, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9939154-alfred-kazin-s-journals

They're lovely.The section called ""Heroines"" is an uncompromising look at life on the street, a life in drugs, and a life of love you can't depend on as easily as you do the turn of the seasons. Heroin and heroine are best combined in the poem ""Her-Row-In,"" one which carries very well the voices of these women. These are poems galvanized more through emotion than image. Her women only want to survive. One haunting poem concerns the notion that not only do these women have a dirty habit but they themselves are a dirty habit men can't kick. Users and used. This is gritty, unforgettable poetry. It gets in your teeth and you can feel it grinding there just as it grinds the mind. These are the voices of women strung out, hung out by their addiction to drugs and to life. Musgrave writes the language of the street and the language of the lake.

I had to fish for it. I had to cast out in more than one direction to finally reel in the mysterious term for two linked novels. Compass RoseDuology. I had to fish for it. I had to cast out in more than one direction to finally reel in the mysterious term for two linked novels. Compass Rose links with John Casey's earlier novel Spartina, concerning itself with the same characters and a few additions, mainly Rose, the graceful center of the novel. Casey's great strength, as with Spartina and equally evident here, is elegant descriptive prose and strong characterizations. Spartina was Dick Pierce's story, how he built his own fishing boat, how he had an affair with Elsie Butterick and how she became pregnant and out of love for him decides to have the child on her own. In Compass Rose Casey continues the story from the moment of the child's birth. In the narrative Rose grows from infancy to a young woman finishing high school. But it's not her story. As novel Compass Rose belongs to May, Dick's wife, Elsie, and to Mary Scanlon, her best friend, and others. The narrative is told from the points of view of those women, though never from that of Rose or from any man. Rose acts as the glue holding these characters together. She sits at the center like a compass and points in every direction of the novel.To be honest, there isn't much plot development. It's about Rose's growing up and her relationship to the women and to Dick. There is an offstage incident at sea seen from the angle of women whose men make their hard livings on boats exposed to nature and the merciless ocean. The novel's build to denouement involves a land grab. It's a little heavy-handed. One key moment is when Elsie, a game warden and one at home in the woods, watches a snake invade a bluebird nest and swallow the babies. By this time you've begun to care for the characters so much you don't mind that it's a little too pointed. And about this time in the novel, too, the reader realizes he's reading something more than a straightline narrative. It rings as sharply as a loud, clear note from a bell struck deep in Elsie's sylvan groves and booms out over Dick's inlets and ponds of spartina on the coast to awaken the reader's mind to possibility. Casey has written a classical theme. He has imagined Rhode Island as Olympus and environs, populated by gods and spirits in common guise. It's easy to see Elsie as Dione, a wood nymph. In fact, she has a relationship to bark in the novel and at one time Casey writes her so angry she feels herself hardening over like bark, just as the mythical Dione once turned herself into a tree. As nymph and game warden she's so close to nature she's a kind of caretaker and is indistinguishable from it. Nature itself is one of Casey's themes. A character asks, ""Do we stand outside of nature, or do we stand inside it? Is nature everything but us? Or is it simply everything?"" And Dick? Dick is Zeus as May becomes Hera. The handsome god Apollo, a ""fine figger of a man,"" as Elsie reflects, rides a motorcyele in the novel and in one of the more delightful lines Elsie remembers he ""had pulled orgasms out of her like fish on a trotline."" Rose? As the daughter of Zeus and Dione, Rose becomes Aphrodite. In mythology Aphrodite has enormous presence. She's love itself. And I suspect her story will require its own novel, making a trilogy....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 23, 2012","Nov 02, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10663086-compass-rose

I thought Philbrick might provide me with new interpretive keys to inform my reread. I don't think he did. He downplays interpretation, in fact, encouraging the reader to consider it in naturalistic terms. He plainly states that the white whale isn't a symbol. It's what it seems to be: an aggressive sperm whale who happens to be an albino. Any meaning assigned to him beyond that, any blame attached for ""human complaint""--Philbrick's phrase--is in the mind of Ahab. The symbols are the captain's.Nathanael Hawthorne's influence on the novel was new insight for me. Before beginning Moby-Dick Melville had written some bestsellers based on his adventures in the Pacific. Moby-Dick was written in a similar realistic vein, and Melville had almost completed the first draft when he met Hawthorne in the summer of 1850. Becoming familiar with the shy, inscrutable Hawthorne and the dark elements in his short stories made him rethink the character of Ahab and take the novel in the direction of the rage and fear he associated with human experience.Philbrick explains that Moby-Dick contains the emblems for everything America had been and was at the time of its writing. All of American history and culture is in the novel as well as all the essentials of Western literature. Just as important, perhaps, Melville wrote the book in such a way that a novel about the sea would become what Philbrick calls a ""metaphysical blueprint"" for America in 1850 and would especially reflect the divisiveness caused by the moral confrontation over slavery which was about to consume the country.Philbrick writes about these things in an engaging way. However, his study is quite brief and his not elaborating on ideas such as these dilutes their power to convince. I'll be looking for these elements when I reread....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Dec 2011,"Nov 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11175728-why-read-moby-dick

Bartlett Giamatti writes poetically, philosophically, and eloquently about games and leisure and about their meaning to Americans. He's not a sports writer. He's a classicist. So he sees leisure linked to Aristotle as well as to the sacred as in holiday or holy day. All sport becomes ceremony. Since sport is conducted in stadiums, because the intense emotion is about winning or losing through ceremony and ritual, the joy of the gods is brought back when people gather. In every sport, ritual is enacted. In that same way, sport perpetuates community by bringing together groups of people so that elements of our necessary rituals, including winning and losing, can be performed.The 3d essay, ""Baseball as Narrative,"" is so beautiful it'll break your heart if you love baseball. He sees baseball in Homeric terms, each game a tale of quest and homecoming, each game played on a geometric grid of circles, squares, and rectangles, and each game involving specific tasks and challenges centered around the idea of leaving and coming home. It's a story of how we find our origins. Confined within boundaries and patterns which constrain the rhythms of play and passion, the game allows us the joy of accomplishment and helps us realize freedom in the fulfillment of a complex order. Baseball is a retelling of the same story and is a refinement of the fable we live over and over. Just as each game is made up of a ritualistic repetition of pitches and outs ordered by a numbering system centered on 3 and 4, each game in itself is a repetition of the story we never tire of reliving.It's a paean to baseball.

Golding himself regretted the fact, feeling his later work far surpassed it in quality, even though from his beginnings with the inspirations in which boys he taught and understood so well and used as models for a descent into savagery to his ending novels, the Sea Trilogy, his major theme of evil loose in the world never wavered much. His novels were informed by his interest in ideas rather than people, in seeing mankind against a cosmic background rather than a social one.William Golding is one of those novelists whose books have been long familiar to us because their fame rests on their assertions about the human condition. They've been widely read for that reason, and for their stylizations. Carey's biography is a successful one in that it presents an interesting portrait of the writer in the midst of his motives and influences as well as cogent analysis of the individual novels. And it's successful because it makes one, even if a fan acquainted with the work, want to go back and read it again. But the book does disappoint in a couple of ways. A naval officer during World War II, Golding served in the Atlantic and as the commander of a LCT used to launch rockets against shorelines to be assaulted. Given that records may be hard to obtain today and that these years may have been pre-diary, I thought Golding's wartime service too sketchily dealt with. Also, it suffers, like many biographies, from an abundance of information in the later years. Carey falls into the trap; when his subject became so public that too much is known of him not to mention, he tries to catalog it all so that his narrative of the life is turned into a survey, a torrent of facts and events rather than meaningful analysis of the man and writer he'd become.But if Carey fails to make Golding as unique as perhaps he was in life, he explains the novels in such a comprehensive manner that reading the biography becomes worthwhile and engaging....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 02, 2012","Jul 13, 2012","Sep 21, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8839216-william-golding

Her book is ultimately about love, I think, concerned as it is with her father who famously worked as an engineer on the Hubble Telescope project.

In that way Smith can be thought of as life on earth yearning for what she can't reach, her departed father, or Nature beyond our solar system.

The bunt is designed to move the runner along the bases. The grounder hit to the right side advances the runner from second to third. The fly ball hit deep enough to allow him to score from third is considered a sacrifice. Sacrifice is an elemental part of life, too. There are sacrifices parents make for children, for instance, and there are the everyday decisions we make that amount to the act of giving up something we value for the sake of something we think of as more worthy. Sacrifice figures prominently in Chad Harbach's The Art of Fielding, making it both a novel of baseball and life.It's only one of a number of themes in an intricate novel full of references to Melville, whaling, and literary asides and quotes as wide ranging as Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Owen Wister. An English class sits listening to a recording of Eliot reading The Waste Land. A ballplayer sits in the dugout reading Fear and Trembling. Plato wanders through the pages along with Henry James. And, not surprisingly, Whitman strides manfully here, as well, because the cult of male friendship is a theme as is homosexuality and the sense of ballplayers as a brotherhood. I wondered if I was also reading something with a classical significance. At the heart of a novel filled with Melville and whaling and water sits Pella. Her name means stone in Greek, and her character ripples out to touch every corner of the novel. And she gives as generously as Pandora.Zen is a theme. Baseball itself is treated as a mystery. The intricacies and rewards of the game are seen as inscrutable as faith. At one point the ability to throw a ball is explained as an alchemical thing only superheroes possess. Henry Skrimshander, a central character, is a shortstop with the ability to throw with such accuracy that he doesn't know how he does it. It's as elusive as a Zen koan. In fact, a character says about playing baseball, ""Sometimes harder is easier."" The ball itself is wonderfully described as 2 identical pieces of cover fit together like the classic yin-yang symbol and stitched up with red thread. The novel's characters do whatever it is they do--whether it's playing baseball or cooking or administering a college--in disregard of personal gain but simply for the satisfaction of doing those things well.The Art of Fielding has been called Franzen-like. I can recognize that in the same detached way the characters are studied, not presented full on but at a slant. Yet, like Franzen, somehow each character is central. Henry Skrimshander, the talented shortstop, stands at the center of the infield. Pella, the stone cast into the pool of characters, stands in the center of her ripples. Mike Schwartz, the catcher, squats at the vertex of the diamond's angle. They and every other character is in some kind of molecular motion that keeps them prominent.This novel gets one of my highest compliments--it's elegant. It's as graceful as a shortstop's single-motion scoop of a grounder in the hole and throw to first. It's elegant enough to be a literary novel about baseball. It's elegant enough to be a baseball novel about the moral complexities we all face. It's logical and romantic at the same time. Harbach has knocked the cover off the ball....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Oct 14, 2011","Sep 09, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10996342-the-art-of-fielding

Not long ago I read a critical essay singing the values of more declarative sentences and less ornate description to create a simpler, more beautiful prose. McCarthy, though he writes declarative sentences, was one of those singled out as an example of someone who writes poorly. His fictional style, it was said, is too muscular and therefore so extravagantly expressed that it distracts from the story and characters. The piece is lost to me now; having read it, not knowing I'd want to refer to it regarding The Orchard Keeper, I tossed it. But I knew as I read it that the claim isn't true of McCarthy at all. His prose makes you look at things in a way you've never looked before, makes you see a different truth in it, and that's one of the aims of good fiction. The Orchard Keeper is beautifully written in just this way. It's his first novel but he was already writing with the full-tilt dynamism for which he's known. He wasn't yet writing the poetry of The Road, but his style had wings enough to soar.To me one of the strongest elements of the novel is the physical description of people and place. Reading it, you know it perfectly describes things you've experienced yourself. This is rural East Tennessee, but McCarthy has it so pitch-perfect it could be any rural area in the South of the time. Because I'm familiar with country roads such as he writes about, or country stores, or screen doors that flap, and many other touches he includes, it's kinda nostalgic. Because I've been where he writes about I know he writes it well. People, too. I don't think I ever knew a moonshiner, and certainly not anyone who fired a gun at the law, but I have known many people who spoke exactly in the way his characters do, known people who hunted for food or rocked back on two legs of a straight chair or threw a biscuit in the yard for a hound. About two-rhirds of the way into the novel is a scene in which Marion Sylder visits a local store. Reading this, I knew McCarthy captured it superbly, from the storekeeper to the old gas pumps with the glass bowl on top to the flypaper and ticking clock to the cool box for drinks. Perfect. McCarthy not only writes with power but with authenticity, too....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 25, 2011","Sep 12, 2011","Aug 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/463382.The_Orchard_Keeper

Such poems as those about the beheading of captives, extraordinary rendition, and Abu Ghraib are antiwar poems, cries against the extremities of our current wars. But such poems are a far cry from the pastoral life in New Hampshire she writes about. Those are her poems I most admire. She's at her most lustrous writing about her farm. Her strength is writing about horses, nature, and the quiet New England life, weaving those themes with memory and biography. Someone said Robert Frost's New England is underlain with violence, but Kumin's is truly bucolic. She leaves her gentle landscape occasionally to dart into academia and letters. A close friend of Anne Sexton, she has something to say about suicide, for instance. She attempts the classical by imagining herself as Leda. Or she's humorous in imagining Emily Dickinson as a modern woman mastering Microsoft. But she's most at home with poems about mucking out the stables or about how beans are like a young boy. Or, my favorite, contrasting her dog's frolic in the pond with the human burden of our pasts and our need to divine our futures in the ooze of the bottom. Maxine Kumin is the only poet I know who writes so naturally about her natural space and her place in it.

The Bridge, his long poem published in 1930, has always been a favorite of mine. Of this Complete Poems I read only it and his first volume of poetry, White Buildings.Crane is a difficult poet. That said, his poetry is still wonderful to read, first because it's fun, but also because you feel as though you're reading a significantly major work, as you are with The Bridge. Because it's a demanding work and because it's one most of us will never fully assimilate, you as reader become part of the poem's quest for the transcendence suggested in the final section, ""Atlantis."" At the very least the reader will marvel at the beauty of Crane's poetry. And will probably come to feel there's truth in it as well.As the Brooklyn Bridge becomes all the symbols Crane assigned it--a ship, a woman, a huge harp vaulting the continent--you're taken through history from the moment of discovery by Columbus to the present. But what I most like about it--and other works like this--is that the questions raised by such rhapsodic work as this, as we're told Crane apparently knew, are more important than the answers. In that way The Bridge urges the reader as quester on and on, always seeking more boundaries and challenges. By reading we become aware that even though there's a hellish subway tunnel, the world also contains, arcing over that tunnel beneath the East River, the promised affirmation of Brooklyn Bridge.Tinged as he sometimes was by T. S. Eliot, Crane was nevertheless an American original with a unique voice and way of seeing the truth in America, and he should be read more often than he is....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 16, 2011","Jul 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10372256-complete-poems-and-selected-letters-and-prose

M. Forster, advised her, ""Unless you start with When researching her biography, Wendy Moffat tells us, Christopher Isherwood, a lifelong friend of E. M. Forster, advised her, ""Unless you start with the fact that he was homosexual, nothing's any good at all."" Moffat took that to heart. In doing so she gives us a different biography from what we might have expected. Forster was the novelist who wrote such critically-acclaimed and influential novels as Howard's End and A Passage to India. He was a don of Cambridge, lecturer, friend of Leonard and Virginia Woolf as well as many other intellectuals of the Bloomsbury group of artists and writers. He was also a homosexual who lived most of his life trying to live so that the fact wouldn't be revealed, though he relished the lifestyle and lived what he considered a fulfilling and satisfying life while defining himself as a homosexual, as did those who knew him.That's the biography Moffat gives us. Not the biography of the novelist Forster and man of letters but the life of Forster the homosexual. The great unrecorded history, a phrase of his own, is the story of his sexual orientation and relationships. It's the story of how he lived as a homosexual in a society which, for his lifetime at least, prosecuted such behavior. It's an interesting story--Forster came to terms with his orientation quite early and never agonized over the fact of it. Moffat is even-handed with her material. There are no salacious details or juicy reveals we didn't know. And she writes well enough she can engagingly relate the stories of his relationships and those he loved as well as the many homosexual acquaintances he had. Moffat describes some of these friendships, those which influenced Forster directly or those which were with those prominent in society and the arts, in detail.One small quibble: Moffat too frequently uses the word gay. To me the sexual and social lifestyle Forster lived was more correctly homosexual than the gay lifestyle we know today.I enjoyed the book. Still, it wasn't the biography of Forster the writer I wanted. His novels are here, but not in any great detail, and without analysis or suggestions as to how their various elements and themes might relate to their author. Forster the writer was necessarily active in a rich company of authors and artists with whom he interacted. He socialized with the Woolfs and others of the Bloomsbury circle, for instance. He knew T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But we're not told of his relations with them. The novel most often referred to is Maurice, the novel of homosexuality whose publication he wouldn't allow during his lifetime. The most detailed description of Forster at work is his writing the libretto for Billy Budd in collaboration with Benjamin Britten. As for Forster in life, what's important in Moffat's biography is his homosexuality. I think she probably records much of what has gone unrecorded until now. She has made it possible--necessary, even--to return to Forster's great novels as the focus of his life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Feb 10, 2013","Jun 13, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9729340-a-great-unrecorded-history

So this selection of poems from his 5 most recent books is one I acquired eagerly and hurried to begin reading. I've commented before that I like the meditative qualities of Wright's poetry. The long lines create long thoughts and large stanzic blocks in which he considers what he observes in the world. Much of what he writes about is the emotion created by what he experiences and takes in as sensation. Memory is one of his great themes. Memory inspires some of the most beautiful images and the most emotional tenor found here. Meditation and memory go hand in hand. They become catalytic agents which spark each other into making nimbly reflective poetry.For me Wright's poetry possesses an Oriental sensibility and grace. Though Appalachia is his home and overriding subject his recording of nature rings as sharply for the reader as a garden bell. To read what he has to say about the seasons is to sense how he stands to let them wheel around him, noting textures of air, arousals of April streaming into the decline of December. He touches large themes: love, time, memory, death. All of his volume called Littlefoot, which concerns mortality, is here. In fact, practically the whole of the human experience with those themes is kernelized in Bye-and-Bye. He writes in one poem, ""Emptiness happens."" But it doesn't happen here.

They were correspondents and lovers until his death in 1985. Her personification quickly became that of a rabbit, an endearment he continued their entire relationship. Sometimes he referred to himself as a seal. He always called her ""bun"" and often adorned the letters with little drawings of a rabbit involved in rabbit activities such as cooking or watching television. In reality she was an English professor at University College, Leicester for most of their relationship. Larkin was Assistant Librarian there, later took a position in Belfast, and finally became the Librarian at the University of Hull.I think my enthusiasm for Letters to Monica, apart from my keen interest in Larkin and his poetry, is because this is a warm love story. Larkin has a bit of a reputation as a curmudgeon. For the most part these letters don't show it. It was only about 1955, after he'd taken the head librarianship at Hull, that he began to grumble in letters to her. Never at her or to her, but he began to complain about some of those he worked with, some writers who were his peers and contacts, and sometimes about activities necessary to administering the library of a major university. But his words for her were always charitable, loving. His genuine affection for her was apparent. The Larkin we see was a much more tender man than I'd thought. Monica often received nothing more than unimportant chatter, an indication to me that the simple postal contact with her was more important than the passing of any meaningful information or ways of thinking. It was important to him to reach out to her. Larkin was at least twice unfaithful to their romance, most notably with an assistant at Hull named Maeve Brennan, while she's reported to have been true to him through all those years, though, described by peers as attractive and sexy, she had many opportunities. But Larkin loved her deeply. He always turned to her for the steadfast support he needed. He always held her close. In the end they lived together, both feebled by illness, for the last 4 years of his life. I was touched by their love, somehow encouraged by his feeling for her. It was a delight to return to these letters day after day to discover what he was going to say to her.It's too bad more of her letters to Larkin haven't survived. Only too infrequently are portions of what she wrote him presented here as footnotes to explain the content of his reply. I got the impression she might have been sometimes a little depressed. In one quote from September of 1962, for instance, she displayed an overall sadness about life and what she expressed as a sense of futility.Larkin was a poet, of course, and Monica may have been his best reader. He frequently wrote her about the progress of what he was working on and about the activities involved in getting published and giving readings. It's in discussing the responsibilities of those activities and those he came in contact with while living the life of an active poet and er that some of his famous irritability becomes evident. The technical elements of his writing are left out but the reader can surmise from the context of many letters some idea of meaning. It's in that way that we learn ""Broadcast"" is about Maeve Brennan.Though deeply hurt by his brief affairs with other women, Monica remained devoted to him. She loved him back as genuinely as he loved her. And in the end she performed the final task he asked of her, that she destroy his diaries. But luckily for us she didn't destroy the letters he wrote her....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2011","Jun 07, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9625753-philip-larkin

Ilustrado the novel is about one such individual, the writer Crispin Salvador, whose story is told in a long ribbon of poems, memoirs, interviews, and fragments of novels and essays. This treasure is collected and presented for us by the writer Miguel Syjuco who returns to the Philippines following Salvador's untimely death in order to uncover truths about the man who'd been both mentor and friend. As narrative it becomes a novel of an odyssey home and the rediscovery of heritage for the young Miguel while at the same time the interwoven fragments of Salvador's writings form a family saga reaching back to the mid-19th century.To describe it this way makes it sound interesting, but it's not. I couldn't develop a stake in this novel. I found it terribly tedious. Miguel's story, especially, seemed artificial to me and Syjuco didn't make me think I should pay attention, look for import.

It's an ambitious novel, I think. And it's impressive in that Syjuco had to create the author voice of Crispin Salvador and sustain it throughout the book as well as that of the narrator Miguel.It's still early in the year but Ilustrado may prove to be 2013's big disappointment.

Eliot, and because I knew her study of Emily Dickinson would be informative I began Lives Like Loaded Guns with an avid, keen eye. Gordon doesn't disappoint, but it's not exactly biography. Though the seminal biographical events of Dickinson's life are touched on, the book is first a deep character analysis of her, and second the detailed story of the dispute within the immediate family and close friends over the rights to the poet after her death, who would get to publish her work and get to say who she was.This is a fascinating book. I've read several biographies of Dickinson and those around her but still was spellbound by Gordon's telling. In the first place, it's so detailed. I was given new fact on top of something new to think about on top of interesting idea, almost on every page. Gordon has dug deep into that Massachusetts earth. When you do that you can't help turning over fresh dirt. At the heart of the story are 2 women: Emily Dickinson and Mabel Loomis Todd. Emily was the reclusive poet of Amherst who left a treasure of almost 2000 poems and letters when she died, a body of work now considered among the finest poetry in the language. Mabel Todd came to Amherst late in Dickinson's life and was close to the family members but never met the poet herself. Her importance is that she almost immediately began an intense affair with Dickinson's brother, Austin, causing a rift in the tightly-knit family, and in the fact that she took an interest in the poetry and after Emily's death used her relationship with the brother and Vinnie, the sister, to usurp a great number of the poems and letters, to begin transcribing them, and to take it upon herself to edit the first published volumes. The row over wills and copyrights that resulted went on for a hundred years, carried on by the daughters of Susan Dickinson and Mabel Todd.That's the arc of the book. However, Gordon has a few new facets of the gem to polish. It's her theory that Dickinson suffered from epilepsy and that the fact of it explains her reculsiveness rather than a disappointment in love or any other reason. She thinks her condition is reflected in the poetry and offers analysis to support her idea. Her treatment is convincing and fascinating, the depth of her research impressive. Dickinson, she writes, understood all this clearly. She used the analogy of the loaded gun to describe the effect of the onset of epileptic attacks. ""My Life has stood--a Loaded Gun--"" is also used to describe the similarities of character shared with her grandmother, Lucretia Gunn. And Gordon herself uses the phrase in many ways throughout the book.The affair between Austin Dickinson and Mabel Todd is well known. But Gordon's reasearch digs deeper than any I'm familiar with. She provides dates, locations and rather interesting details of this affair, even the fact that Mabel's husband apparently often participated in some way. Gordon writes the words ""group sex"" and ""voyeur.""In the end she concludes that Emily and Mabel were similar in personality. Both lived lives like loaded guns, she says. Emily the poet ahead of he time, Mabel the opportunist who at the same time possessed the editorial skills to successfully launch her into the world. We can never really know these 2 women or their family members. I believe, though, that Gordon has brought us closer than anyone else. In my opinion this is one of the best and most important books on Dickinson and her family....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 14, 2012","Jun 04, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/8387904-lives-like-loaded-guns

We're eager to know more about the cultural milestones of our times and why they continue to influence and intrigue us. The 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's is such an event steeped in legend. Its beginnings as a Truman Capote novel are legendary itself because Capote worked hard at creating just the right amount of mysterious aura with which to cloak himself and his work. He thought his little novel about a Manhattan cafe society girl struck the perfect moral tone for the times and the film. Realistically, though, the Hollywood at the turn of the 1960s had to step carefully to avoid being too sexually suggestive. The movie and how it came to be made has become the legend surrounding the Holly Golightly story. The cultural impact can be felt today in feminine freedom and dress as well as every version of ""Moon River"" you've every heard on the radio, in an elevator, or sung absent-mindedly by someone you know. That's the subject of Wasson's book.I was intrigued by the subtitle ""...and the Dawn of the Modern Woman."" I thought it, like many subtitles, a bold claim. Wasson wastes no time in explaining how Audrey Hepburn's gamine-like charm coupled with a romantic comedy screenplay toying with a new broadmindedness toward sexual freedom suggested a bad girl could also be a winner and an openly sexual life an acceptable goal. Hepburn gave the movie-going public a way women could live for and by their own code of interests. At the time there were two poles of womens' behavior: the virginal, easily-shocked Doris Day and the sexy, childlike Marilyn Monroe. Hepburn offered a little bit of both and made it possible for women to emulate her and fit themselves in that middle road. For the first time, women were shown that if they were imperfect they wouldn't be punished for it. Holly Golightly became the role model many women felt they needed. Hepburn's influence was also felt in fashion. She favored the clothes of Hubert de Givenchy, the Paris designer. She'd worn his designs in an earlier film, Sabrina, for which she'd selected a rather plain black cocktail dress suiting her build and de-emphasizing what she felt were imperfections. For Breakfast at Tiffany's he outfitted her in the same look, nowhere better displayed than the iconic image of Holly enjoying her danish and coffee in front of Tiffany's window. Quickly becoming known as the little black dress, it inspired the fashion of the 60s and continues to do so today.As always, a story such as this is informed by the many personalities making it up. The most grounded may have been Henry Mancini. At a time when movie music was being transformed from the lush and orchestral, Mancini clearly saw the tack he needed to take and sailed in that direction. The score he created with such confidence has become a classic. But, though the book never approaches anything like a tabloid tell-all, everyone else in Wasson's account is seen through some sort of pecularity, even Hepburn herself, who was vulnerable and conflicted in the role of Holly, good/bad girl. Some others--Capote, Edith Head, the costume designer--come off less well. But no one's assassinated. It's not that kind of book. Wasson's aim is to detail how this wonderful film came to us and how it's changed our lives. It's warmly told because he shares our affection for it. Reading his book will make you want to see Breakfast at Tiffany's again....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 02, 2011","Jun 10, 2011","Jun 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7057039-fifth-avenue-5-a-m

The Pilgrims weren't fundamentalistNick Bunker tells a history of the Mayflower Pilgrims and the settlement of Massachusetts we didn't get in school. The Pilgrims weren't fundamentalists. The author makes clear there were no fundamentalists in a Europe in which religion had such a large presence. Deeply inspired by Calvinism, the British Puritans were those who felt the British Crown hadn't gone far enough in separating itself from Catholicism. The Pilgrims were marginalized and frowned-upon within English society, but the sailing to Massachusetts aboard the Mayflower was much more a commercial venture than it was a flight from persecution. It was even sanctioned by a British government that had begun to realize the economic potential of North America and the need to compete with other European powers for dominance there. The Calvinist separatists, wanting to leave the country, were convenient seeds to plant in the fertile New World. The greater portion of Making Haste from Babylon is the history of the Puritan society prior to the Mayflower and how it developed within the larger English society of the late 1500s and early 1600s. The story is complex and is told with the broad brush needed to cover the whole picture of English religion and commerce of the time. Bunker's telling is filled with many richly-drawn characters from both the Pilgrims and the less severe, more conventionally religious population. He necessarily spends time discussing the lives of the Pilgrims themselves in England and in Holland, where many of them migrated to avoid harassment by an Anglican-dominated Britain. The Massachusetts part of the story, the initial interactions with the Indian peoples there, the early struggles with farming, takes on the flavor of an adventure. Even as commercial venture with the Crown's blessing, life in the colony remained treacherous until the arrival of domesticated animals in the early 1630s. This made possible farming which provided surpluses. That plus the beaver fur trade, which had been slow to develop, insured the colony would be able to sustain itself....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 20, 2012","Jun 01, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7055027-making-haste-from-babylon

And he shows how each of these examples are related. With each succeeding chapter and progression through history Parsons demonstrates how each of these example empires mirror each other by using the same techniques. All empires are about the exploitation of the land they take over and administer. All empires feature a tribute paid in some manner by the subject peoples and an extraction of whatevr wealth the region holds. In addition, the subject labor is used for the greater good of the empire, even as slaves. The rule of empires is often harsh. Parsons writes, ""There is no such thing as a liberal empire.""Though one of my complaints is that the book isn't well-written, Parsons does keep an objective and level tone throughout, at least to the mid-20th century. While insisting that the Nazi occupation of France demonstrates all the features of traditional empires, he also blames the Franch people for being too passive. In fact, he claims during the war they acted exactly as Asian and African subject peoples in the previous century and that it made the German administration and exploitation of France that much easier.All the time I was reading I kept in the back of my mind how imperial behavior relates to America. Parsons confirms my opinion that America has never sought empire, except during the brief period of the Spanish-American War when they took the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico from Spain. However, his final chapter, ""Conclusions,"" is about America's conduct of the Iraq War. And he convincingly explains how that adventure in nation-building and its attempt to extract Iraqi oil and change the balance of Middle Eastern power was clearly an example of empire. An example ending in failure, chiefly because the U. S. failed to achieve the cooperation of tghe Iraqi people. The cooperation of the subject peoples, almost always secured through harsh methods, is one of the most important features of empire. In our current transnational world, though, Parsons writes, nations acting unilaterally to use whatever harsh means necessary to subdue a subject population for exploitation won't be tolerated, and so the age of empires is finally over. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2011","Apr 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7968540-the-rule-of-empires

I'm not sure its shoulders are big enough to say every chapter displays a different style, at least not in the astonishing way of, say, Joyce's Ulysses. While reading I wasn't sure most of the chapter syles were different enough to advertise. It is written in the different voices of its many characters and from their differing points of view. The chapters slide about in time, too, from the early 1970s to a decade in the future. But it wasn't until I came to Chapter 9, that written as a magazine article with footnotes, that I had a sense of a different style. The final chapter is beefy with text messages serving as part of the dialogue. The most striking style is Chapter 12's PowerPoint format. While I didn't care for Chapter 9's clumsiness or Chapter 13's breezy texting, I liked the PowerPoint. I thought it fluid and easy to maneuver, and lots of fun. I liked the rest of the novel, too. It's a novel that snaps its gum appealingly and smiles an invitation to come closer, which you do because you learned early on there's an abundance to enjoy. ""Come on, I'll show you a good time."" It delivers. It becomes a page-turner bubbling with brio and snappy dialogue as infectious as detective fiction. And it occasionally broadcasts flashes of an exciting complexity. One of my favorite chapters is that in Naples which toys with the Orpheus-Eurydice myth. It's a novel about aging rockers, and time is a theme--Egan slides the times of these chapters back and forth like a bluesman's fingers on a guitar neck. Two characters use the phrase ""time's a goon,"" and we're made to notice the exhaustion it brings to bodies and spirits.

It's a rich combination of poetry and prose that makes heavy use of allusion to the Old Testament, Arthurian legend, Welsh folklore, Coleridge, Chaucer, and Norse myth and relate them all to the war. Jones believed that to try to describe the war as a conventional historical event wouldn't begin to present an adequate picture of what it was like. Whether or not Jones, who served at the front, came to see the frontline environment and action there as enchanted, the folk and literary references he uses tend to create that atmosphere. As a narrative it follows the formula of many war novels: leaving home, shipment to the theater of war and to the front, first experiences and acclimatization, times of rest in the rear, and a climactic battle, in this case the first day of the Somme Offensive. The book does a good job of depicting the life at the front with all its details of equipment, jargon, and daily life. However, it's Jones's rich attempt to use traditional elements of religion and literature to see the soldiers as representative of all the soldiers of history and to picture the war in a heroic, folk tradition sense that gives the book its weight. Sometimes it's a thorny bramble of motifs and references but Jones's extensive notes guide the way through minefields laid with Celtic cycles and the Song of Roland. That the narrative can be seen as an authentic tale of soldiers at war at the same time as a movement to apotheosis is a testament to the elegance and intelligence with which he arranged all this detail. It's been charged that his use of such things as Arthurian and medieval romance results in a work diluting the horror because it ultimately makes the war romantic. I think I can see that. In his desire to find a new vision for the war he experienced and believed couldn't be understood in conventional ways, Jones described the torn up area between the lines in terms of wood nymphs, knights, church ritual, sacred and popular song, mythic figures from the Welsh landscape, and much more. It may be the battlefield is so crowded with allusion one can't see the combat as the insanity it is.

The subtitle of my edition is A Personal History of the Cold War. I'm not sure why the history is a personal one. Maybe it's personal for his account of 1968's Prague Spring, which he tells through his own experiences as a ""spear carrier."" Perhaps it's personal because the tone isn't academic or even all that formal. It's prose leaning toward the casual. It reads as if Stone is telling a story, which he certainly is. He tells it with credibility and insight. but he sometimes lets himself become prey to a style or stance trying to avoid sounding pontifical, and that in turn leads him to conclusions which often have the whiff of personal opinion. Worse, he can let tact slip, as when Jimmy Carter's ""scrawny wife"" is mentioned, or when he writes about a Congressman's affair with a ""whore."" To me it's not so much a history of the Cold War as it is a history of the West and the NATO Alliance, the Atlantic of the title. While most of the key events of the Cold War are mentioned, they aren't related as if they form part of a confrontation. The successes and failures of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and the whole cast of involved players between 1945 and 1990 are detailed, but those successes and failures aren't given weight relative to the broad ideological and (almost) military friction underlying all of geopolitics during those years. Instead it reads like a historical narrative of the West, casually told, as I say, in which the critical themes we associate with the East-West political confrontation called the Cold War--the long disagreement over Berlin, the nuclear arms race--receive their due attention in the story but aren't analyzed as part of a conflict. Even given that the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Korean War were more direct and dangerous clashes, Stone still focuses his analysis on the economic and political events of the individual player nations without placing them exactly in an adversarial context vis a vis those traditionally considered their enemies. Much of the story is economic. Stone seems to be a strong swimmer in the arcane currents of economic and monetary policy. It's easy for a reader without that kind of compass to get lost.While not exactly what I thought it was going to be, it's still an interesting history full of engaging insight. Stone is aware, for instance, of the importance America's huge and advanced war machine is to her business and economic health. Interestingly, he says that Vietnam became the symbol of the failure of Johnson's Great Society and, more, that if Vietnam hadn't existed it would have had to have been created. Equally interesting, he ends the book, in a chapter called ""Ending History,"" not with the fall of the Soviet Union but with the fall of the Thatcher government in Britain....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2013","Mar 15, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7514274-the-atlantic-and-its-enemies

He can be deeply philosophical, as in the long sequence ""Nine Deaths,"" and I lean into the philosophical to hear and learn.

First of all, to me the prose reads like that of Kazuo Ishiguro. Its rhythms and textures are similar and just as beautiful. Second, one of the major themes, that of a man restlessly walking the streets of New York City, brings to mind Alfred Kazin's memoir of coming of age in the '30s, A Walker in the City. Teju Cole's peripatetic protagonist, Julius, is a resident in psychiatry who wanders the city's streets in search of release from the tensions of work, in search, like the young Kazin, of life and the world. As you might expect, the novel's deeply meditative. Julius reflects on many things as he wanders the neighborhoods or rides the subway, learning from what he sees: immigration, the various definitions of sanity, death and burial, slavery, and the influences of music. Indeed, the overall tone of the novel might be described as dirge-like, a lamentation. That's not to say the book doesn't have bright moments. Some of the imagery is astonishing, like that of the flow of generations through the eye of a needle seen as subway. Cole might be hanging onto the staid coattails of T. S. Eliot a bit, but I give him that because he can write like silver. Still, the beauty is that dark, stark kind Emily Dickinson could write, finding music in crepuscular tones. The music begins in the first chapter when Julius hears a recording of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erbe in a store. It continues through the last chapter which finds him at a performance of Mahler's final symphony, the Ninth, composed when he realized he was near death, and as a result is very somber and shadowed. In this sad air, following the funereal steps of a reflective man walking the streets, the novel resonates with the melancholy of Mahler and the end of life, end of novel. At the close Julius is still wandering without resolution though still learning. His searching and the novel are open-ended because it's an open city. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Apr 10, 2011","Mar 07, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8526694-open-city

Originating as a project of the CenteThis is a book about memory, about the power of photography, and about what it was like to grow up in the South. Originating as a project of the Center for Documentary Photography at Duke University exploring ways to combine visual and verbal memoir, the editor Alex Harris has assembled the essays of 11 Southern writers along with family photographs to capture the experience of Southern childhood. If you were raised in the South the book may break your heart, not only because these portraits of Southern childhood reflect a lost world and are therefore necessarily nostalgic, but also because a couple of them have sadness at their center, such as Josephine Humphreys writing about her grandmother in Charleston or Sheila Bosworth's memory of an uncle's fatal illness. The timing of the project (the book was published in 1987) and the ages of the authors who agreed to provide material for it dictate that the years most evoked are the '50s and '60s they grew up in but also means they all share some of that era's elements of hot summers playing barefoot, the charms of high school punctuated by football, booster clubs, and dating as remembered by Robb Forman Dew, those stately columned homes in the old centers of small towns, and the regional myth of the automobile so richly evoked by Dave Smith. The inclusion of family photographs supporting each narrative adds a lot to the book. We all have collections of these old black and white photos of our earlier selves in places perhaps only dimly remembered, often with people we don't think enough about these days. The best of these photos are of these 11 authors as children, often peering into the camera, as William Manchester once wrote, as if peering into the future. Appropriately, 3 black authors are included. While their lives may have been conditioned a little differently, they still remember just as fondly and the experiences are much the same. I particularly like James Alan McPherson's reminiscences of growing up in Savannah and Atlanta. My favorite in the book is T. R. Pearson's remembering family vacations at Cape Hatteras. His quirky characterizations and send-ups of family members are hilariously told with unabashed love. But that's the essence of the book. Just as family is the heart of childhood, it's here the heart of each of these affectionate essays. Perhaps what might be wrong with the essay I liked the least, Bobbie Ann Mason's story of her high school years in Kentucky, is that family isn't as central to her memory as a doo-wop group called The Hilltoppers. A World Unsuspected certainly stirred my memories and took me back to fond days of hard summertime play in denim overalls, walking hot dirt roads barefooted, farmers' breakfasts, and the importance of stealthy stalking with a BB gun.

The simplicity of the poems is part of their beauty, each one evoking a moment of time, an image, and mood that rings in existence with the sharpness of a bell. Seemingly slight, the individual poems are luminous. They are haiku thought without the strict form. Beso, Italian for kiss, lives in a small pasture bound by fence, sky, and grass and looked on by sun and moon. At the same time he's the Acropolis, the Sphinx, his ears track hawks while galaxies wheel in his eyes and stars nest on his back. Beso's awareness is cosmic yet his attention is also on the wind, the occasional apple, the companionship of bee and poet. Beso can't help being a force of nature. He animates it, making the subject of the poems the nature of all being. In the last third of the book the poet takes on more of a role. In seeing Beso more through the poet's eyes we realize the poems track donkey progress toward what we must assume is something like nirvana. Weariness becomes a word. Beso's tail hangs down.

My introduction to Rosenblatt and his book came through an interview of him on the PBS News Hour. Inspired by what he said in the interview I approached the book eagerly but was a little surprised at how basic it is: what a story is, how to begin, write about what you know. So it's useful in turning your head so you're focused on what you need to see and remember as good practices rather than teaching techniques to make your writing better. I thought the most useful chapter that on poetry and the simple idea that poetry emphasizes the contradictions we notice about ourselves. Rosenblatt considers poets religious in their devotion to writing and their observations of the world. In the end I did find inspiration in the book. He emphasizes over and over again the importance of choosing the right word. He quotes Mark Twain: ""The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning."" I think I've always known that without being able to say it so wonderfully. It's why I'm slowly reducing my thesaurus to tatters.

Though he saw the glory in the squalor, his interpretations of what he observed and appreciated work as description rather than thought. The poems failed to succeed with me as they had in earlier readings. Glory and lowliness, cleanliness and squalor, good versus evil, the eterual struggle of opposites is the primary tenor of the poems. The physical descriptions are straightforward. They fit imagination like a sock. I was unreceptive to Baudelaire's view of evil, though. These days the poems fail to shock. Following 20th century literature's cornucopia of death, drink, and illicit love these Baudelaireian visions aren't dreadfully repellent. I personally can't judge Howard's translation. It has an elegance, but he can't get too far away from Baudelaire's idiom, which seems to me now a trifle overheated. And, of course, he can't avoid the formal structure of the poems. Baudelaire lures me from time to time into those alleys sloppy with mud, busy with marginal lives. No doubt this book will call me again, ""Psst! Eh, monsieur, what would you like?

I've been aware for some time of her books on FDR, the Kennedy family, and Lyndon Johnson. Team of Rivals, the only biographical and political material by her I've read, is more than just another book about Abraham Lincoln and his presidency; it's a study of Lincoln's cabinet and his relation to the men who served in it. I think it's probably essential reading for those interested in how the Civil War was prosecuted by the Uniion. In concerning itself with the relationship of Lincoln to his cabinet and how they served the government and the presidency, it also necessarily enlarges to become a political biography of each. Lincoln's presidential history is well known but the service of the others much less so, and Goodwin's focus on each individually helps to make them as three-dimensional as the president. Figures like William Seward and Gideon Welles and Edwin Stanton are familiar Civil War personalities. But lesser-known cabinet members such as Salmon Chase, Edward Bates and Montgomery Blair become just as fully vested in Goodwin's history. Her ability to bring these men and the women around them to life, her perceptive understanding of the men--military and civilian, heroes and failures alike--who served in key posts during the national crisis, and her skill in capturing the feel of the era they lived in all combine to make this an absorbing read. It's comprehensive and, I think, while written by someone whose caring for those people and their shared service to the nation can't be as intense as that for her father and probably doesn't equal their mutual interest in the Dodgers, is nevertheless the same sort of caring.

""Tennessee Lonesome End"" by Peter Schrag made me hungry for Southeastern Conference football, eager for the hot, humid wind of today to be forgotten amid the color and spirit of gridiron noise in crisper air. Baseball never fails to please, and the stories here are a delight, especially ""A Mickey Mantle Koan"" by David James Duncan, which was originally sent to me by the writer Teresa Tumminello Brader and was the seedling inspiring my read of the Harper's collection.The nostalgia bestowed by football and Duncan's tribute to his brother and Mickey Mantle are the high bar here.

This finaThis is the 3d volume in the masterful trilogy covering the rise of Nazism in Germany following World War I and the 12 years of their power. This final volume is concerned with the war years 1939-1945. Though obviously the major military events and currents are touched on, this isn't a military history. Rather, it's a social history of Germany at war as a nation, a society, and an ideology. I feel that taken all together these 3 volumes are the definitive chronicle of the Third Reich for our time.The history Evans writes, The Third Reich at War, is World War II with all the romance wrung out of it. We of those nations opposed to Germany are most acquainted with histories which picture the war as a grim crusade which had to be undertaken with hard work, resolve, and sacrifice. Our histories of the war teach us that victory created our right perception and justification. Evans's history sees it that way as well, but he's also intent on showing us the excesses of the Nazi regime as we've come to realize it, that their conduct of the war was one of genocidal inhumanity which included not only the destruction of the European Jews but the brutal mass killings of the Slavic peoples, the enslavement of Soviet POWs and other subject populations, medical experimentations, and the general disregard for life which stood in the way of establishing the greater German Reich. Evans catalogs everything negative about how the Germans prosecuted the war. Frightful detail on frightful detail are repeatedly dumped into the narrative until the mixture, seasoned with anecdote and statistics, becomes toxic. The examples and numbers associated with Nazi conduct quickly pile up into a weary glut. The vision is truly hellish, and the reader may occasionally wish the author had found some brighter elements to mix in with this litany of viciousness. However, history is what it is, and Evans's telling is all part of the book's comprehensiveness. Included are discussions of how the war affected such things as education, religious observation, sexual practices, and food production. Evans is thorough.I'm reasonably familiar with the war but was surprised by a couple of ideas Evans spends time on. First is his writing that strategic bombing by the Allies was effective in reducing industrial production and civilian morale. Second has to do with his analysis of the 1943 Battle of Kursk. The largest tank battle in history, Hitler's intentions were to inflict a decisive defeat on the Soviets, a defeat so severe that it would prompt them to negotiate a cessation to the war in the east. Evans goes against the historical grain and accepted conclusions that the German formations shattered themselves against the Soviet defenses. He claims the battle was very nearly a German victory.Right or wrong as Evans may be about relatively minor points such as these, the breadth of his history is convincingly complete and carries the weight of authority and sound research as all history must. It's my opinion that it probably replaces William L. Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, published 55 years ago, as the record for our time and for years to come....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Apr 12, 2015","Dec 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7179635-the-third-reich-at-war

It's about idolatry, with the actress emblematic of Garbo seen as goddess, those who attend and handle her as acolytes. And in this way it's more about the perception of those who create and nurse those beautiful and lofty enough to be supported in that olympian fashion. There are scenes in which the goddess is prepared and cared for, scenes in which some who attend her are assigned a specific duty in enhancing her image, both on screen and off. The trouble is that it's a hollow devotion. It's such a cold and self-absorbed attention to the goddess that it becomes steeped in death rather than celebration. There's a powerful section of the novel in which the director, Stiller, looks after Garbo following a day of filming on the streets of Constantinople. While he does her hair, they gaze, rapt but emotionless, at their reflections in the mirror. Twins or doppelgangers or mirror images crowd the novel. It's only through them that these characters can find the life they seek. Meaning they find it in themselves, essentially. Philip Nilson is writing a screenplay about Garbo, but he's reminded of his obsession for a young woman long gone from his life. His relation to the lost love mirrors the director's consuming passion for Garbo and for everything supporting her image on the screen. As much as I liked the structuring and central conceit of the novel, the breathless, overcharged language blighted it. I suppose it's meant to suggest Nilson's comfort with a continental milieu, and, in fact, at times it reads as Nabokovian. But the novel lacks the rich characterizations, moral depth, and tangled games of a Nabokov novel so that what we're left with is a very direct narrative told in studied and stilted prose which most often shows Sobin's clumsy two step rather than Nabokov's elegant waltz....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 06, 2010","Dec 12, 2010","Dec 06, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/925912.In_Pursuit_of_a_Vanishing_Star

In these Journals he doesn't record only daily events. He reflects and in those reflections he wrote down as part of daily routine is the philosophy he lived by and which he thought we all should live by. There are events of course. He'd record the visit of someone like Margaret Fuller, or relate an anecdote abut Bronson Alcott or Thoreau. And he loved to write about the cute things his son Waldo would say and do. But he was most interested in recording what he thought. So here, embedded in daily journal entries are ideas on such topics as natural history or the importance of solitude or the value of reading. And much more. To be sure there are landmarks in the Emerson personal narrative: he begins to doubt his faith and leaves the ministry, his beloved Ellen dies and he later exhumes her, he remarries, has his delightful son Waldo, he enjoys friendship and interesting dialogue with Thoreau and Alcott, or he meets Thomas Carlyle, takes a hike with Nathaniel Hawthorne. But the beating heart of the Journals is what he observed and recorded about human nature and the insights into every fact of the world around him and how we can best live in it.

There arDower has written a book comparing the causes and endgames of the war we waged against Japan in the Pacific with the more recent war in Iraq. There are many similarities. The intelligence failure resulting in 9/11 brought an immediate investigation which compared it to the intelligence lapse at Pearl Harbor 60 years earlier. In pursuing its war on terror, America's deciding on a preemptive war in Iraq mirrors the same tactical triumph resulting in strategic stupidity Japan displayed in attacking the western powers in 1941. His history ends with a comparison of the occupation of Japan with that in Iraq. His perspective is that in Japan our steady, clearheaded policy of economic reconstruction (plus, it seems, the impetus the Korean War gave to their economy) and gradual de-emphasis of the cult of emperor worship was largely responsible for winning the peace. In Iraq, he writes, there was no peace following the war because our lack of planning, the purge of the Baath Party, and the disastrous dissolution of all Iraqi military formations left no authority to assist America's inadequate military and provisional governments. Further, in Japan a democracy was in place on which to base a reconstruction. In Iraq the Bush administration tried to forge a democracy out of managerial and organizational shortcomings, with disastrous results.My response to the book was one of contrasts, too. The early reading is something of a polemic. I don't really doubt the truth of Dower's ideas. It's that I take issue with his flattening out of facts and dodging considered analysis in order to make a point. Statements of half-truth history such as claiming the burst of America's imperialism in the period between 1895 and 1905 gave us a gulag in Guantanamo make me raise my eyebrows. The longer one reads in the book, however, the better Dower's history becomes. As his discussion works its way through wars of choice, Hiroshima and the bombing of noncombatants, and the similarities between the faith-based secular thinking of Japan, the Bush presidency and Bin Laden's jihad to come at last to the contrast of the successful occupation of Japan with the failed occupation of Iraq, his analysis has become measured, sound, and convincing.

I'm sure there's no insight to the novel or feelings about how it touches me that hasn't been expressed before in dozens of ways. Earlier in the year I came across something by Peter Gay in a book called Modernism: The Lure of Heresy: From Baudelaire to Beckett and Beyond that I thought insightful:""There is a short, memorable passage titled ""The Intermittences of the Heart"" in A la recherche that occurs in Sodome et Gomorrhe, the volume published just before Proust's death. It was a phrase that he had sometimes thought to use as the general title for his masterpiece. He well might, because the expression tersely epitomizes one of Proust's most disheartening, and most irresistible, conclusions about the vicissitudes of existence: the human heart fails when its endurance and judgment are most needed. Life is many things, to be sure, but most conspicuously it adds up to a vast array of mistakes, of mismatches, of sentiments out of phase with realities; everyone gets experience wrong. Proust at the opening of ""Intermittences"" (a little tediosly) introduces a talkative foreign-born hotel manager who maltreats the French language in every sentence. He is a typical small example of larger human failings. But Proust wastes little time on such trifles. Rather, he gives illustrations of what he insists is only too common: we love too early and too late, and too often the wrong persons; what we learn about those we come to know intimately almost never matches our first, or even our second, impressions. Love turns into hate or into indifference or reverses its course, but not for logical reasons: the heart, as I have said, fails. It has, in short, its intermittences. Life, therefore, is a perpetual act of revising, of correcting, what we think we know; it is a school for disenchantment.""I didn't care that much for Gay's book on modernism, but I think this is a breathtakingly important thing to say about the novel. But anyway, this kind of knowledge is in Marcel's future. In these first 2 volumes the young and impressionable Marcel has dipped a madeleine in his tea setting off waves of memory, especially about the Swanns, he's spent a season at Balbec, and he's fallen in love with Albertine. There's much to come. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 23, 2011","Nov 12, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/190576.Remembrance_of_Things_Past

They end in peace. It's not clear from Rose's title or from anything I read about this book beforehand, but this is a history of AmericaHow wars end. They end in peace. It's not clear from Rose's title or from anything I read about this book beforehand, but this is a history of American grand strategy in the 20th century. Grand strategy is the direction steered in to enable you to win the stable peace you desire when the fighting ends. So this is a history of how America has achieved its brand of peace during the last century. It tells how political and military leaders have handled the endgame of war in making force serve politics as each war ended. Generally our leaders at each war's end have learned the most from the previous wars and base their reactions on it, and that's why Rose says we always fight the last battle.The author's perspective on some of these issues is fresh to me. So I read with interest his explanation of how Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points were designed to prevent a harsh punishment of Germany and Austria to forestall the bitterness that could lead to another war. But his naivete and good-heartedness ran against the grain of British and French desire for retribution. We know what happened. I read how the decision to use the A-bombs on Japan was more of a decision dictated by the fact that we'd developed the weapon and not to use it would've been political suicide because every American death after its availability would have been blamed on the decision. The peace talks to end the Korean War were stalled until Eisenhower, the new president, threatened to expand the war with atomic weapons. Nixon, his vice-president, learned how toughness could produce results and tried the same tactics in Vietnam, without results. What Rose writes about Vietnam fits my own understanding. For this reason I thought his analysis of how Nixon and Kissinger got us out of the war the most comprehensive and clearly explained I've ever read. Rose explains how we screwed up the endgame in both wars in Iraq. Both in the Gulf War and in 2003 we failed by not having a clear policy and organization to meet the political realities once the military was finished. Both times we created a mess, adversely affecting American prestige and long-term strategic interests.The conclusions Rose comes to about the endgames of these wars and the results achieved amounts to a kind of wisdom. Obviously he comes to his conclusions through hindsight. It's true what they say about hindsight, that it's 20/20. But hindsight is also true.Rose tells a history based on pragmatism, a realpolitik though it's seasoned liberally with morality. In a section headed ""The Strong Do What They Can"" he explains that only the strongest nations can be geopolitically proactive, a conviction first expressed by the Greek historian Thucydides in the 4th century BC and still believed to be applicable today. Weak nations can only react to immediate developments. Those nations who're global leaders can project policy aimed at the future and potential problems. This is how he sees Iraq at the time of 9/11. Following the attack on New York and Washington, the U. S. had several options on how to use its power, wealth, and influence, including developing alternatives to fossil fuels which would free the west from dependence on the Middle East, or work toward the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Regime change in Iraq to produce a more stabilized Middle East was seen as one of the options and was the one chosen. It's emphasized that a team other than Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld would have chosen differently. Or the same team, given different circumstances, could have chosen differently. The strong do what they can, Rose insists. They're able to project, and Iraq was going to have to be dealt with sooner or later. Rose sees 9/11 as having the same importance and influence as the 1950 Communist invasion of South Korea, that is as a catalyst bringing about a new phase of international politics, this one characterized by American unilateral activity.Many people would object to Rose's conclusions. He's forgiving of American policies. He sees all of America's actions in the light of grand strategy--how do you win the peace and ensure the greatest economic and military security for the nation? One way is to use conflict to create and maintain stability. For this reason Rose doesn't look at the horrors of the nightly news. He looks at American foreign policy as that which projects American security. It's hard to find fault with the rationale for that security. Without being cynical, without seeing instances of flagrant imperialism, he sees America using its great strength to secure peace for Americans and to ensure stability in those areas of strategic importance. He describes American grand strategy as trying to pacify the world piece by piece. Few people, especially our leaders, articulate it in such grandiose fashion precisely because it sounds grandiose. If you look away from the hypnotic pull of television news and newspapers with their gloomy sense of western decline and economic doom, Rose sees promise.

I like it very much, partly because I found it terribly interesting and partly because I think itThis is an ambitious and fascinating work of poetry. I like it very much, partly because I found it terribly interesting and partly because I think it succeeds in its ambition. The 45 poems here form a narrative of a 1946 incident at Los Alamos in which a physicist working on a core of nuclear material was accidentally exposed, later to die of that radiation poisoning. But it's much more than that. The poems cover the length of one day whose events are seen in parallel with Joyce's Ulysses and therefore also with The Odyssey. The protagonist, the physicist Louis Slotin, corresponds to Leopold Bloom, and the people in his life represent other characters in the Ulysses pantheon. Many well-known elements of the novel are alluded to, and the narrative flow of the poems closely follows that of Ulysses. Slotin's wife, for instance, represents Molly. She's having an affair with one of Slotin's colleagues, a Blazes Boylan figure. Los Alamos itself is a stand-in for Dublin, complete with a map such as that we've become used to in critical analyses of the Joyce novel. ""Metempsychosis"" is the title of 2 of these poems. ""Wandering Rocks"" another, and ""Louis Slotin and Nausicaa."" Against these suggestions of Ulysses are many ideas reflective of nuclear physics, fission, splitting atoms, and the general research business of Los Alamos. The bloom of the title refers to the moment nuclear material goes critical. The word itself appears in almost every poem. And, of course, it evokes Leopold Bloom. But more, each of the poems is written in the style of a particular poet, named at the end of each. Some of the poets I'm not familiar with, but others include Anne Sexton, John Crowe Ransom, and W. H. Auden. Four of the poems carry the voice of Ted Hughes. Only after finishing, when I went back to copy a favorite from the book, ""A Pink Wool Knitted Dress"" in Hughes's style, did I have an aha moment and laughingly remember that Hughes himself wrote a famous poem with the same title about the day he and Sylvia Plath married, included in his volume Birthday Letters. Lista's ability to get under the skin of such poets as Hughes and Rilke and Robert Lowell and echo their voice and style is impressive. His reimagination of Ulysses is intellectually stimulating and satisfying as well as being breathtaking fun, a ride in which we let him take us to the various stations of Joyce's novel. The book stands on its own, too, as engaging poetry and as an account of 21 May 1946 when the bloom which killed Slotin flared into a lab in Los Alamos. The final poem's title, ""Where I Was a Flower of the Mountain,"" conjures up Molly Bloom again. It ends as the novel ends, with the multiple use of her (and Joyce's) favorite word, ""yes."" It bears the same transcendence and affirmation as Joyce's work. After such a gratifying reading experience I felt the bloom of all that magnificence as well.Rereading in 2020.

A Gluck poem draThough I look forward to and eagerly buy each new volume of Gluck's poetry, I have a little trouble expressing why I like it so much. A Gluck poem draws your attention instantly because it confidently strides from its beginning to its clear and convincing resolution. A Gluck poem has a certain formal respectability you come to expect. While she doesn't bend the verbal rules or hammer new forms that glow with creation, neither would she, I don't think, write about a red dress in a honkytonk. Not that her poems don't radiate heat at times. It's simply more controlled, and it may be that cool control I admire the most about her. She can enter a theme of her choice and show you truths that hadn't been apparent before, in my mind, one of the primary exercises of the poet. She produces volumes with themes: 1996's Meadowlands looked at a New Jersey family as emblem for Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus at Ithaca, 2006's Averno dealt with classical views of hell. Impressively, Gluck has the skill to tailor her voice to her subject--a Homeresque description of New Jersey, the more classical, Dantean, and infernal style of Averno. A Village Life is a volume about those who live in a small, mostly self-contained community in what I take to be Mediterranean Europe. The style is plainer, more subdued, what you'd expect from people who understand their daily rounds and the importance of getting on with them. It reminds me a bit of John Berger. If Berger wrote verse this might be what it'd be like. Gluck here is concerned with what matter to her villagers: the seasons, the weather, animals, the satisfactions of work, the harvest, the landscape. Gluck captures it well. I think of her as a stately poet but also as a worldly one, someone who can stand in a room or in a landscape and understand what she sees. And can tell us about it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2011","Oct 21, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8014413-a-village-life

I had a hard time with The Ada Poems. When I finished and closed the book I did so with the feeling that I wasn't a match for the poems here, that I'd been overwhelmed, my hair mussed and my shirt torn. Apparently these are poems, most of them, spoken by the gentle girl of Nabokov's novel of the same name. Many are love poems. Memory is a major theme, too, as is time. The verbal voice evokes Nabokov, or at least the voice of Ada, and cold, snow-blown Russian nights. Quotes from the novel precede most of the poems as epigraphs. But I didn't always see what the individual quotes highlighted and pointed to in the poems. We associate butterflies with Nabokov, and they're here, as is a misshapen reality. Two poems, particularly, conjured up the novelist for me: ""Poem for a Printing Press"" and ""From The Book of Knowledge."" They're the most playful in the volume and seem to share his prankster spirit. And they offer changes of pace from the solid formality and difficulties of the other poems. I don't want my struggles to diminish the loveliness of the verse and some of the images one can find in them. What could be more charming than the young Ada comparing time with her lover to a cat repeatedly dipping its paw into a jar of milk. Or more moving than understanding the slipperiness of her feelings away from that lover. But I found them intricate, convoluted in the same ways Nabokov himself is intricate, most certainly because the poems are meant to reflect him as much as Ada. Because I found it such an arduous read I'm sure I need to spend more time with this book and mix it up with the slippery young Ada again. I'll train for it, early morning jogs, shadow boxing. And jump rope--that should tease her out so that I can see her better.Rereading this a year later I was able to get into the poems a bit more perhaps, but overall they remain a wall I'm not able to see over.

One has to admire Helen Vendler's scholarship in discussing what is probably the essential poems of Dickinson's oeuvre. In selecting 150 of them and discussing them in depth, she's provided a work that accumulatively has lots to say about what she wrote, how she wrote it, and the currents of her thought. Each poem is printed in what has come to be the accepted form as Dickinson probably intended it. Following each poem is Vendler's intelligent analysis. Knowing Diokinson's work thoroughly and seeming to understand her is Vendler's strength. She apparently had access to the drafts of the poems and so can sort of read her mind as she developed each of them, guessing her intent as she chose and changed words and phrases here and there. This familiarity with each poem and how Dickinson composed informs Vendler's perceptive glosses. The detail is impressive. Multiple connotations of words and phrases as Dickinson understood them and used them receive extensive investigation. Meaning, metaphor, social and religious and philosophic contexts are made clear. Each brief analysis is a microscope peering into the intricate world of each poem, pointing out life and form. No stone, as far as I can tell, is left unturned. Vendler's voluminous knowledge of modern poetry also means she can tell us how Dickinson influenced later poets, as her loss of religious belief impacted Wallace Stevens's, for instance, or how the meter of a particular line was adopted by Hart Crane. By the time the reader finishes the book, he'll know a little bit about how Dickinson thought and wrote these poems, too. In recent years I'd been reading Diokinson using the Reading Edition of her poems compiled by Ralph W Franklin in 1999. I suspect in the future I'll consider the poem selection and glosses provided by Vendler to be inclusive enough to satisfy my occasional craving to touch base with her. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2011","Oct 07, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8075404-dickinson

Are we terrorists?""One of the many questions and conclusions in Richard Rhodes's The Twilight of the Bombs. Rhodes is acclaimed for his histories of the nuclear age: The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Dark Sun, and Arsenals of Folly. This 2010 study completes his history of the nuclear age with an account of events which have occurred since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The fact that part of the old Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal might be inherited by 3 newly-independent states was an alarming one. How the nuclear arms in Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan were dispositioned is the early thrust of his narrative. He also covers in detail the Iraqi program in the early '90s, which was very real. How that program was inspected by the UN-sponsored IAEA and subsequently ended, as well as the inspections in the runup to the 2003 U. S. invasion, is engaging reading. Rhodes describes the South African development of the weapon and their later decision to destroy their stockpile and all documentation relating to it. He relates as much as I suspect is publicly known about the successful North Korean and stalled Iranian programs.For this reader the most unsettling perspective is that of what's called nuclear terrorism. Though comprehensive discussions and steps to keep secure all the world's fissile material are constantly ongoing and ed, the possibility of an independent political group acquiring a nuclear device has become a fresh nightmare. Experiments have shown that a small terrorist group--numbering even a handful--with the scientific knowledge and a moderate machine shop capability can design and build a device if they can somehow obtain a few pounds of highly enriched uranium. It's fascinating reading, and some of it's grim. But for me the closer the book got to the present and to Rhodes's conclusions, the more encouraged I became. The nuclear powers are slowly coming to believe that possession of such terrible power is in the end a fiscal drain as well as an ineffective bargaining tool. The problem of nuclear weapons, it's said, is nuclear weapons. The fact that hey have never been used by a nuclear power against an enemy speaks for their uselessness. Nuclear powers elect to accept defeat--witness the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and America in Vietnam--rather than use them. It seems to be universally understood by the community of nations that they simply can't be used. Since the end of the Cold War there has been a vigorous and largely successful campaign to not only reduce the stockpiles of nuclear weapons but to begin, realistically, seeking the elimination of them altogether. Serious talks have taken place with that in mind, though without definitive agreement. Despite the holdouts--India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea--elimination for the first time seems possible because nations have realized that in this age of precision weaponry, when conventional strikes can be delivered into a 3-foot circle over 5000 miles, nukes aren't needed. Equally encouraging, though he doesn't state it directly, such precision makes the huge conventional formations of tanks and infantry units even more obsolete. Organized conflict will be relegated to smaller battalions. It's truly the twilight of the bombs. Rhodes's conclusions are stirring and full of hope....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Sep 2013,"Sep 21, 2010",,Roughcut,view (with text),/book/show/8087231-the-twilight-of-the-bombs

Kagan differs from others that I've read. He believes the drift of nations is generally toward liberalism. But in the post-Cold War world the powerful nations are more able to express their individual cultural traditions, religions, and nationalism. Because these nations no longer stand in the hulking shadow of Soviet-American conflict, this has allowed a new era of great power competition to emerge which resembles the rivalries prior to the world wars. The return to history Kagan refers to is this return to great power competition. Presumably the end of dreams is the failure of great power cooperation for peace and security. Maybe the most important word in the book is autocracy. It's those nations who have deep centralization of governmental power (near dictatorships) while practicing capitalism and economic health who've replaced the Cold War communists as the primary rivals of the liberal democracies. It's along the borders of those countries that the fault lines of potential conflict lie. Russia and China are the most important, of course, but the world is full of autocratic nations with whom the liberal governments deal with varying degrees of success or frustration, like Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Eventually, he thinks, this divide between autocracy and democracy will erupt in armed conflict. Kagan, like every other geopolitical pundit, also addresses the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. But he sees it as the last holdout against a tide of modernity and liberalism which will inevitably overwhelm an Islamic world already generally receptive to western ideas and culture. Fundamentalism will fall by the wayside in the rush toward modernism. Another--to me surprising--idea Kagan puts forth is that the general distrust of the American global hegemon was caused not by conservatives who tend to be more isolationist-minded but by liberals who were more aggressive about projecting the liberal democratic agenda worldwide.

At that time in his life, as an Army officer, he began to see that the conventional wisdom about America's military projection might not be entirely true. Apparently this revelation came about by being exposed to the reality of Soviet military preparedness. By seeing how weak they were relative to the U. S. and NATO, he began to think our strength and expenditures toward military development as unnecessary. His argument is that the feverish competition and arms race engendered by the Cold War and fueled by the philosophies of the early CIA and the Joint Chiefs' insistence on massive military response has persisted to this day, long after the era of Warsaw Pact threat and Soviet expansionism. Today, he says, our military and foreign polcy are energized by the ""sacred trinity"" of the conviction that in order to maintain international peace and stability we have to maintain a global military presence, that we have to project our power globally, and that we need a policy of global interventionism to counter existing or anticipated threats. It's a state of permanent war. He's writing about current international affairs and our posture in them. But in relating how we got here he has to cover a lot of history, and he skids on that slippery slope because his voice and argument is so strident and shrill that he loses the objectivity and rational approach of the historian. He becomes the doomsayer in homespun robe pacing back and forth with his placard. He doesn't discuss the reasons those who maintained the state of permanent crisis during the last 60 years thought it was necessary. He doesn't discuss Soviet attitudes or our perceptions of global power that helped shape our foreign policy. What can be objective about a history in which a section is entitled ""Dumb and Dumber?"" He's disingenuous. Some of his arguments are supported by what are mostly convenient truths. The early part of the book is marred in this way. To give him his due, his understanding of the current realities in the Middle East seems cogent and complete. But moving from his shrill polemics to reasoned analysis is too difficult after the reader has recognized his arguments as polemic; it's hard to give his later views credence. And in the end he overstates his case. His concerns are legitimate. But by the time he gets around to his conclusions and to proposing his own new trinity calling for the military to be used solely in defense of the U. S., the abandonment of our overseas bases, and a repudiation of the Bush Doctrine of preventive war, you've already realized his methods of discourse are too insistent and unreasoned to be considered seriously.

In this way the author pays tribute to the men and organizations he served with. He also remembers what was probably the most formative experience of his life. Marlantes does all of these things well. He's written a novel that has the grit of authenticity, both in the feel of small unit operations near the DMZ and in the true, honest portrayal of the men conducting those operations. Minute descriptions of equipment, doctrinal practices, and the attitudes of the men serving all make Matterhorn very real. In some ways the novel serves as a microcosm for the war by alluding to many of the divisive issues we associate with Vietnam. Some characters recognize the larger political realities overshadowing the action on the ground. A couple of the officer characters realize the NVA has all the time in the world, that they will fight only if it's to their advantage, and that frustration with the war will turn the American public against our effort in Vietnam. One character muses the NVA has forever, the Americans have only till the next election. This kind of understanding along with the fear and stress of combat, the high casualties incurred during these operations all wear on the charactrers.

He ends the novel strongly by seriously and maturely plumbing the meanings of death and military service. ""The jungle and death were the only clean things in the war,"" he writes.

Stoker's account succeeds in filtering out most of those details about the long litany of battles and the cast of characters and the social upheaval brought about by it all. What he's distilled from the mountains of material available is a rather compact 418-page study of the strategies the two sides devised to try to win the war, how these strategies evolved in response to unfolding circumstances and how they failed or succeeded. It's an interesting book. I was a little while warming to it, not seeing at first he's provided a fresh and useful addition to the histories. What I slowly realized is that by concentrating his study on the war's strategy alone he's given us something so totally comprehensive and efficient that we're able to see some of the old history in new and convincing ways. Some of his analysis is surprising. We're not used to being told--especially in the South--that the Gettysburg campaign was a tactical and strategic failure. Nor are we used to thinking Vicksburg was a less important military objective than Chattanooga. Traditional Civil War histories add a little romance and drama--Grant cutting away from his supply base to approach and besiege Vicksburg, Lee leading his ragtag veterans into Pennsylvania to manhandle the Union armies once again, this time on their own soil. Stoker avoids all that and focuses on the hard realities of the strategic picture. Lee overreached and failed at Gettysburg and nearly lost his army. Grant conducted a nimble campaign against Vicksburg but the more important prize was Chattanooga. While other historians might consider the use of black soldiers as a slave rebellion, Stoker simply states the Union's enlistment of those 200,000 blacks was certainly one of the determining factors in their final defeat of the Confederacy, especially since the South, though chronically short of manpower, decided against their use in the ranks. Surprisingly, Stoker is mildly critical of the generalship of Robert E Lee. He agrees that Lee was by far the outstanding leader in the Confederate armies, but he's less lavish with his praise of the operational accomplishments of Lee against consistently larger and better-equipped Union armies. And Stoker savages Jefferson Davis's overall mismanagement of the Southern armies and strategy. His heroes are--rightly so--Grant and Sherman. And Lincoln, whose political skill and management of difficult personalities held it all together. I have come to think Stoker's ability to refine all this information has left us with a resonant and rich overview of those strategic ideas and resources--overpowering on the Union side, meager and desperate for the Confederacy--and a new insight into the war. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 26, 2011","Aug 12, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8114492-the-grand-design

The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet isn't Cloud Atlas. And might not be Black Swan Green, either. But its narrative energy will take your breath away. One of the strengths of Cloud Atlas was the different styles so flawlessly controlled by Mitchell. Thousand Autumns demonstrates the same practice of different voices moving the story along. There's less majesty in the telling, but it's still well done. What's impressive here is the prose structure on the page. The primary narrative flow for many of the pages is made up of one-sentence paragraphs. Sometimes they're simply descriptive, sometimes these descriptive passages are interspersed with dialogue. A sentence a character speaks may be broken up by several of these illustrative sentences so that they carry the action down the page. They serve to place the action in its particular spot in the larger world. While characters intrigue--paralleled in more than one scene with a nearby game of go in which markers are strategically moved with each verbal riposte--and while emotions soar, the everyday goes on, gardeners rake white stones into peaceful patterns, carpenters mend a roof, and a cockroach waves its antennae in the shadow of an inkpot. It's much like a stream running steeply downslope, and it's impressive how well Mitchell uses this to make his people so dynamic in their actions and motives. Also, because it's all in the 1st person, the energy bubbles. As minimalist as it may sound, it's not--it's as rich as chocolate. But I believe Mitchell can probably write in any style. The novel's conventional paragraphs carry the narrative so beautifully many of them can stand as prose poems--p451 is an example. Other pages carry paragraphs as still and deep as a pond you'd expect to find in this Japanese landscape. The man can write. When I'd fret over the light seasoning of metaphor and philosophical heft Mitchell would appease me with thoughts of death moving through pines or the human mind rolling up like a scroll. Thousand Autumns is a historical novel. Not my favorite dish.

I have whole books of thse reliable poems, all with their lengthened lines requiring stretched breathing and mental attention. They are poems filling the page, huge collected and selected volumes, and volumes of singing, vigilant lines. One is a big volume of love poems made of those long lines so that you wonder how much more praise can be heaped on a woman, what other promises of constancy and devotion. Williams's poems form big blocks on the page, as regular as marching squadrons. As steady and unyielding. Each poem is a world. Those poems were the shape of a ship's sails, and as stark and strong. They were filled, shaped with knowing and for years propelled my learning. But this volume, Wait, is different. He's changed tack to a short line and, often, couplets. Somebody wrote that shorter lines and more spacing make the reader hesitate in order to reflect. The small stanza slows the reader down. That must be what he's trying to do here. But in contrast to the long line allowing him to more easily articulate, these newer poems--by far the majority in Wait--seem minimalist grunts. Rather than jubilees of expressive language capturing emotion and beauty, many of these poems seem shards of thought scattered along the thin shingle of a theme. Empty sails.

Most of his examination and praise is well-established. Still, Williams offers a couple of fresh perspectives. He says the first edition of Leaves of Grass, that of 1855, was Whitman's best poetry. He continued to add to the book and to tinker with the original edition for the rest of his life, but all his work after the first blaze of inspiration for the most part didn't live up to the power of those original poems and his revisions diluted them. He speaks of a poet's music as the beginnings of all poetry, before language, even. I found this a little hard to follow. Williams, an important poet in his own right, seemed to be speaking of a percipience or gift only another writer could grasp. But I finally decided him to mean inspiration or will or some intuitive gift. A clear-seeing into the way to speak the truths one is energized to write about. Whitman's music came to him about 1854, and from it came Leaves of Grass. Whitman burned his gift quickly, like a child's sparkler glows brightly before sputtering out. Little of the poetry Whitman wrote following the first edition glowed with the same intensity. Williams' comparing Baudelaire and Whitman was also interesting. He sees them both as offering new perceptions in new forms to see and rejuvenate their worlds. He writes of them as revolutionaries and as the 2 most alike in the vision they brought to clarify not only the age they lived in but ours, too. Their influence can still be felt today.

It's an American story. Stephen B. Ambrose once wrote a dual biography of Custer and Crazy Horse, who, he said, were born the same year and were destined to meet at the Little Bighorn. Philbrick combines Custer's story with that of Sitting Bull, the spiritual and political leader of the loose confederation of Indian groups clustered and traveling together through that Great Plains summer, trying to avoid the Army. There's a wealth of detail here about the lives of Indians and about the Army in the field, how the opponents were armed, care of horses, how cavalry mounts were fed and how much, and many other items of minutiae. Philbrick's is the latest telling of the Last Stand legend and I assume the most informed. It's a fascinating read. It's a book difficult to put down.We've known the story our whole lives, how the United States sought to corral the remainder of the Plains people on reservations, how several bands united around Sitting Bull while many others left the reservations to join him, how 3 columns of the Army searched for him on the Dakotan and Wyoming Plains, and how Custer found the great encampment on the Little Bighorn River. But, reading Philbrick, you get the idea that the failures weren't all Custer's. Even given the immensity of the land and the difficulties of communication between the separated columns, there was available intelligence that they were facing a formidable, dangerous assembly of Indians. Only 8 days earlier the same group of Indians had attacked General George Crook's 1200-man column on the Rosebud River and compelled him to withdraw and regroup. General Terry's column, of which Custer's 7th Cavalry was part, never know of this encounter. It's true, I suppose, they should have known better. Custer and the others were men experienced in dealing with Indians in peace and war. They recognized it was an unusually large migratory trail they were following. When the village was found Custer hurriedly put together a plan of attack before he thoroughly reconnoitered the situation. Famously he split his command in the face of an enormous force of enemy warriors, estimated to number more than 2000. The feeble attack of Reno's 130-man battalion was easily stopped by the Indians and routed. Custer, on the other side of the river, was just as easily overrun and killed to a man. As we know.Philbrick offers new perspectives. Neither of those actions were close things. Reno escaped to a hill with the remnants of his command and was able to withstand another day of siege. He was lucky; had the combined Indian bands rushed him as they did Custer he would have been overrun, too. Philbrick writes some things I never knew before. The 7th Cavalry was outgunned. They used single-shot breech-loading rifles subject to jamming. The Indians had at least 300 repeating rifles which were capable of rapid fire. On the east bank of the Little Bighorn Custer had divided his force yet again so that the actual Last Stand was in 2 groups, 2 distinct fights. Both were easily overrun. Philbrick makes it plain that Custer's superiors expected him to aggressively take on the Indians if he found them. Perhaps because his fiery, brash reputation led them to expect nothing less, Custer was told to attack if he found them. Philbrick doesn't give us conclusions, and he doesn't analyze. He simply tells the story as it's come down to us. But the blunders are plain. A minimal understanding of military confrontations of this type will suggest to the reader, even those not familiar with terms such as failure of intelligence or masked fire, that the 7th Cavalry rode into a situation which they could not control. Though Custer could be rash he was nevertheless militarily sound, and had he become aware of the enormous force facing him and had he kept his regiment intact he'd have still been defeated in a desperate fight but would've most likely survived with his command intact. Philbrick doesn't judge, so it's up to the reader to decide whether, given his experience, Custer should've known better. Philbrick's narrative of events is clear, and it's fascinating reading. Most of it is told through the perspective of the Army with some side glimpses of what's known about Sitting Bull's actions and motives. Reno's puny attack and defense of the fortified hill the next day is told through the point of view of Army participants. Because no one lived to tell the tale, Custer's desperate actions are told solely through the testimony of Indian eyewitnesses. And rather well, too. Philbrick himself organizes it all well.

I think them love poems, though without the usual valentine sort of declarations. ""Love Poem for Wednesday"" may be the loveliest poem here and a good illustration of that exuberance straining to elude the poet's grasp.

Recently I'd read his Five Days in London, May 1940. That was fresh material for me. It impressed me by convincingly explaining how close Germany came to winning the war at that time. This new study, The Legacy of the Second World War, is concerned with 6 issues: whether or not the war was inevitable, how Europe came to be divided after the war, why there would have been no war had Hitler not come to power, the development of atomic weapons, why the Allied strategy focused on Germany first, and the origins of the Cold War. Although this is a short book, he writes thoroughly as well as learnedly about these subjects. I'm familiar with the events and personalities of the war and the ripples they created, but Lukacs surprised me several times with new perspectives. One complaint might be that he seems compelled to flesh out his important points in order to give insight to the darts of his thinking. In so doing he often repeats himself, so that in 2 separate chapters he states that the Kursk Offensive in Russia and the Ardennes Offensive in Belgium a year and a half later were attempts to cause rifts between the Allies. What's invaluable for me, repetition or not, is that while I understand the importance of trying to separate members of a coalition, I'd never before understood it was an element of German wartime strategy. Some of his treatment doesn't offer anything new. He centers the attention of the atomic weapons chapter on the famous 1941 meeting of Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. I think he covers again what we understand the purpose of the meeting to be and what was said. But at the end of the chapter he interprets the reasons for the meeting as bound up in the sense the German government and indirectly the German people had that they were fighting 2 wars, a regrettable one against the western democracies with whom they might deal and a war for national survival against Soviet communism. The book is full of lightning bolts of insight such as this standing out in the clouds of general knowledge. This book and the earlier Five Days in London, May 1940 are influential books for me.

He's an Hanson's concern in these essays is the changing face of war in a geopolitical landscape increasingly defined by the haves and the have-nots. He's an expert in the classical era of war. He wrote a definitive study explaining how such ancient Greek notions as politically pragmatic strategy and citizen military service have become the ways of the west. Here his reflections on the changing nature of war--which is basically a focus on changes wrought by the asymmetrical types of wars in which poorer states confront the dominance of the west--reference his knowledge on the ancient past in every essay to show us how knowledge of history can always instruct us.His primary message is that the information explosion created by digital technology and the internet creates a proliferation of western weapons which tends to allow our less technologically innovative competitors to compete with us on the battlefield. The most obvious ways are through the effects on public opinion and by creation of situations in which wars waged in these ways--Iraq and Afghanistan, for instance--become so expensive it puts a strain on economies of the west. Damage inflicted on a western target is always more severe than damage inflicted on an enemy because the former is more cheaply obtained. It's possible for a relatively cheap shoulder-fired antiaircraft rocket to being down a multi-million dollar bomber. A more horrific example is a suicide bomber in a western parliamentary chamber being able to inflict more damage than a flight of heavy bombers over a known terrorist target in the Middle East. The damage to public opinion alone, in this age of instant global news coverage, can be decisive.Hanson is conservative. He ends with the argument put forth by others that the international political situation is one of a clash of civilizations, east with the west. The power of western culture is irresistible and tends to break down parochial societies. The threat is, more than their becoming like us, that the west becomes more tolerant of attitudes from the east which run against the grain of the foundation blocks of western societies. Hanson isn't the first to suggest this, and he won't be the last. But he adds that it's becoming increasingly more dangerous, partly because of changing attitudes in a west sensitive to public opinion, that those societies philosophically at odds with ours are able to more easily confront us militarily because in this information-rich age they can easily acquire methods and weapons to use against us and our expensive ways of war. Because a leveling of societies is desirable, the military problem has to be solved, at least for the present, with the same old emphasis on hearts and minds....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 12, 2012","Apr 28, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7812254-the-father-of-us-all

I remember how excited I was when Letters was published in '79, I was a longtime Barth admirer and looked forward to it. However, I couldn't even understand the s. Puzzled by what critics had to say about Letters, I was intimidated and didn't attempt it for several years. As it turned out, I had no trouble with it; I liked it immensely and was very much impressed by what Barth had done. After all these years I'm still impressed and think it one of the great novels of our time because it's such an energetic and all-encompassing spectacle of fiction. To say it's encyclopedic or a symphony is only to approach describng what it is. It's so huge and complex it can hardly be held in the mind. It's writing as big as its settings of Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes and everything in between. What's it about? Letters is an epistolary novel made up of letters written by the Author and 6 of the characters from his first 6 works of fiction braided together in a plot running from spring to summer of 1969 but including as well many events of the American Revolution and the War of 1812. As all of Barth's novels, the focus is on story and stories within stories, and there are many here involving not only the historical settings but the maneuverings of present-day campus politics and the filming of one of Barth's novels. So these characters from Barth's previous fictions make another appearance, but the main characters of the novel are language, the alphabet, and numbers. As you might expect, Letters is about those 26 individuals we use to form language. And more, it's about the nature of history itself, revolution, the patterns of lives, mid-life crisis, recyclings of all sorts, what makes up images, the nature of literature, and myth. It's about everything. And because it is, we--or I, at least--can never grasp the whole of it and know I'll never be finished with it. Because like Finnegans Wake or Against the Day it's a Mariana Trench of a novel, I'll always be able to dive deep into it and feel the currents of language and be amazed at the wonders found there, but I won't be able to find the bottom.

While those relations aren't always smooth, Wawro's history does demonstrate that largely our goals and actions have reflected the pressures of the times. Following World War II, 2 common threads knitted their way through the fabric of the region: the need to forge alliances to counter Soviet ambitions toward warm water ports and the persistent coercion of Israeli security concerns. And oil. I'd heard before, and Wawro confirms, that 3/4s of the known U.S. reserves in the ground were used to power the Allied militaries during the war. So securing the Saudi oil fields for strategic interests was vital to our Cold War policy. That obviously continues today. One of the interesting things the author does is compare the events of the present to the past to show how little things have changed. To me the book was shaped like a cornucopia, Wawro's narration narrow at the beginning of the 20th century but widening out as it nears the present until it spills a rich harvest of fact, analysis, and detail about the last 2 decades of turmoil during 2 Iraq wars, 9/11, and the war in Afghanistan. The lessons are as current and immediate as your daily paper. But Wawro is more historian than reporter and is able to follow the story down the long decades to relate it with insight and to explain with honesty how weaknesses of leadership or overreach or strength displayed by the many personalities involved--Arab, American, and European--have lent weight to the picture of influences and conflict we see in the Middle East today.

The book contains 10 essays by several of the most eminent historians of the classical Mediterranean. Their individual studies deal with such topics as Rome's strategic defense of the Germanic frontier, the importance of walls and fortifications in ancient Greece, slave wars in the region, particularly the famous Spartacus war, the difficulties of maintaining empires, and the role of personality in statecraft. I thought the collection for the most part intelligent and learned. I thought the linkage to the contemporary world gave these essays added potency. By pointing out the analogy of the Theban preemptive attack on Sparta in 396BC to the Iraq War or the defensive walls of Athens to the modern barriers between Israel and the West Bank or to that along the U. S.-Mexican border, we can see how today's news registers the past. Despite the impact and improvements of technology, we're told, the strategic calculus of nations and the motivations for warfare remain much the same. A couple of the parallels provided bingo moments for me. The Athenian notion of democracy was seen as the cuckoo in the nest and the terror of its day that other states in the region allied against. Even earlier than that, in the 5th century BC, the Athenian empire is shown to reflect the position of the U. S. at the end of the Cold War when only one state stood at the head of the west and therefore bore the dissatisfactions of governments who resented leadership in a time without a serious military threat. These are matters of perception, of course, but as one of these essayists reminds us, the one predominant truth linking the past to the present and making it possible to learn from the ancient classical societies and their military incentives is that human nature stays the same. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 04, 2010","Mar 26, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7722182-makers-of-ancient-strategy

Swans gliding across still waters, laurel hedges from which butterflies tumble, birdsong hidden in dappled sunlight? That's the atmosphere of Arden, the home of the Godley family in The Infinities, also the home of the gods. Infinities here are described as time subject to slippages so that ""all possibilities are fulfilled."" Banville plays with the notion that the gods are still with us.The Godley family is in crisis. Old Adam, their head, has suffered a stroke and is in a coma. While the rest of the family gathers to deal with his illness and its potentialities, the gods have gathered to meddle and take advantage. They overlook everything happening at Arden. Yet, while the point of view is usually that of Hermes, flitting quickly about to spy on everyone, Adam also comments on the busy activity in the house, even from the depths of his coma, suggesting we're meant to make parallels. There is the constant feeling that Adam sees everything and influences all action. It's all godly. Every description is in tones just a little beyond reality, as you'd expect in places inhabited by those more than human. Banville's prose is pitch perfect throughout. It's marvelously written, richly phrased and metaphored. The ""oily sway of wine,"" he writes, and ""the low-slung sky,"" the ""unmanageable, greasy weight of grief"" a character ""carries under his arm""--all from the same paragraph. It's all this delicious, the way Banville writes.This is a slick, sophisticated way to tell the story of a family emergency and the strain put on all the ties within it. I was reminded of John Updike's The Centaur, my favorite of his novels, in which every character has a counterpart from classical mythology. But Updike's novel is distinctly American. Darker, too, and tragic. Banville's atmosphere is more enchanting. It brims with Shakespeare's humor and A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Infinities is a midsummer pastoral romp.

Hoagland's so adept at making us face the facts before us that many of these poems seem to leave the ground. They take off from a lauching thought or phrase about a person or event to become a verbal ascent to vision. Whether about race or sexuality or the mundane fact of a vine climbing a wall, it's almost as if they begin in free association to become the controlled arrow of purpose and design, aimed at the target of discovery.

But I think if I didn't have experience with DeLillo's early novels I wouldn't have. I saw links to his first 2 novels, Americana and End Zone. Walls are very important in DeLillo's fiction. It may be that his characters use them as a way of measuring themselves. I remember a major engine driving the narrative of Americana was a man filling the blank walls of a house with writing. And walls figure in Point Omega, too, as figures are noticed standing in front of them or terrain features are described as walls. The wall is safety and meaning, two qualities DeLillo's characters desperately search for. So we read about a character standing against a museum wall watching a drastically slowed-down print of Hitchcock's Psycho that takes 24 hours to complete. He needs the film in order to escape from the clamor and chaos of the modern everyday around him in the city. The opposite of the city is the desert. There the novel's 3 characters seek refuge from the city's tumult but find they're too isolated from meaning and too close to the end of personality, so isolated in fact that they're in danger of washing into their surroundings and disappearing. One of them does inexplicably disappear. This is the omega point of the novel, though not exactly that of Teilhard de Chardin. DeLillo uses it as a kind of absolute loss of energy and the opposite of the complexity of our lives and as a kind of death. Teilhard gets a mention in the novel, but DeLillo writes of the idea as a dispersal of personality or life force stretched to the point where it ceases to hold together. The only escape is back into complexity, the city with its torrents of traffic, dominating decibels, and congested commotion. And in the bustling, throbbing hive the city is a man can find a still point where he can stand against a wall and watch a film so slowed that he can immerse himself in it enough to find meaning. Point Omega is spare. This is what you're left with when you pare all the extraneous material from a novel, as if removing everything from a map except those contours and landmarks you need highlighted to show you direction. What's left is a kind of poetry. What's left is a ball of aphorisms wound round and round to build up the ball of idea, in this case perceptions and justifications for war in the Middle East . What's impressive is that some of these thoughts about war were first presented in the brilliant 1972 novel End Zone, the novel in which war becomes kin to football. Here, 40 years later, many of the same thoughts are reduced to mysterious verbal formulas and to the dumbspeak of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, but he's writing about the same systems and forces of control that make war ritual, sacrament. Everything's the same. War remains what it is except the technology's more advanced.

I often luxuriate in rereading one of her novels or even one of the biographies. I have occasion to peek into the diaries or letters again. Reading about those important to her gives satisfaction, too, so that I've read biographies of Leonard Woolf, Vanessa Bell, and Vita Sackville-West to learn how they influenced Virginia. Sometimes I think I might resemble a sad teabag saturated with Woolf and Bloomsbury and unceremoniously plomped into a delicate Victorian saucer. So I'm not sure how Portrait of a Marriage, Nigel Nicholson's loving memoir of his parents, Harold Nicholson and Vita Sackville-West, went unread by me for so long. One forms impressions of books as well-known as this before they're read. I must've thought Nicholson's book attempted to explain and make excuses for Harold's and Vita's unconventional behavior and marriage. But now I know it's a loving portrait and homage to a union of substance and to parents totally devoted to each other and their children. Rather than explanation, it's a song of acceptance and love. Because his parents' commitment to each other and their lives together was complete, Nicholson doesn't feel he has to justify their bisexuality and their loves outside the long marriage. After Vita's affair with Violet Trefusis, none of their many affairs threatened to break the family. What Nicholson explains is how deeply Harold and Vita respected and cared for each other and the shared life they created at Long Barn and Sissinghurst, their country homes. The most serious threat, of course, was Violet. Sharing Nicholson's memoir of the marriage is Vita's account of her love affair with Trefusis recorded in her diary. Confession, maybe. Exorcism might be accurate, too. I was much less engaged with Vita's diary entries, written when she was 28, following the break-up with Trefusis, than I was with Nicholson's tender and understanding remembrance of her. Vita regrets. She and Violet had intended leaving their marriages for each other, and they would have if it hadn't been for the dogged determination of the 2 husbands refusing to allow such a mistake. Vita wrote in her diary, ""One should not to allow oneself the luxury of losing one's head."" Nicholson keeps his balance. He has the faith and grace to not judge, unless it's the seemingly catty remark about Trefusis, ""I met her only twice, and by then she had become a galleon, no longer the pinnace of her youth, and I did not recognize in her sails the high wind which had swept my mother away, because I did not know that she had been swept away."" I think that one of the strengths of the portrait he writes is his refusal to bow to the judgemental and his steadfast belief that his parents' love for each other wasn't only good enough but was extraordinary. That's his story. Virginia Woolf fits into the book only briefly. Her affair with Vita was several years after Violet. Virginia's inability to successfully respond to sex contributed to the brevity of the physical expression of it, but her love for Vita was intense for the rest of her life. In fact, the years they were closest were the years Woolf produced her 3 most magnificent novels. Vita was muse, too. Woolf's Orlando, a 4th novel from the Vita years, was another by-product of their affair. Inspired by Vita and a direct portrait of her, it's called by Nicholson ""the longest and most charming love-letter in literature..."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2011","Feb 08, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4332542-portrait-of-a-marriage

Even though the reader can tell he's in the hands of a gifted novelist, especially if he has previous Jayne Anne Phillips experience, he might ask this question before allowimg himself to sink into her narrative, confident she'll get him to the end safely and satisfactorily. And she does.Lark and Termite is a novel told in 2 narrative threads. There's a thread beginning July 26, 1950 in which a U. S. Army soldier fighting in Korea, his unit retreating before the overwhelming North Korean attack, encounters a group of refugees and tries to protect them. The 2d thread occurs over the same few July days nine years later. It relates the lives of the siblings Lark and Termite and several adults in Winfield, West Virginia. Once the reader becomes aware of the 2 distinct threads and the themes they share, he knows the author will bring everything together into a point to stab and stir the mind. I could not have predicted the third thread with which she neatly wraps her package. The additional elements put one more puff of wonder into a novel already ballooning with wonder. Phillips, in her earlier novels, writes of strong sister/brother bonds. Here's another. Termite, though disabled, damaged, and deficient, shares traits of other brothers Phillips has written in that he seems to be a kind of nature boy possessing primal intelligence or awareness. The sections told from his point of view show him to be a kind of wormhole allowing the different parts of the novel to flow into each other. Lark, his caring 17-year-old sister, is mostly woman, maybe goddess herself or maybe just votary, but easy to feel affection for. They're wonderfully realized characters.In the Korean thread I detected a clumsiness in Phillips. She seems less comfortable with Robert Leavitt at the opening of the Korean War. It may be an unfamiliarity with place and writing about military action. To me she seems a little out of step. I did wonder if her wrongfootedness isn't so much failures of research or confidence as it is convenient arrangement to allow the fit of parallels and metaphor. I usually scorch with scorn the supernatural in fiction. I'm not much interested in magic realism anymore. When I drive through West Virginia I don't see evidence of it, at least not on the route I take. But Phillips has found it there and shown it to us in ways to make the heart swell with wonder and gratitude. I call it magic realism to give the author the benefit of the labeling doubt. Realizing there was an air of mystery about the events that the characters didn't quite understand but accepted, I didn't mind it. And I didn't quite understand all of it, either, especially the angelic purpose of one character who comes bringing gifts and storms.I've been away from Phillips for a number of years. Primarily because she hasn't published, I think. But I'm reminded what powerful fiction she can write. The novel was deservedly shortlisted for the National Book Award. While it didn't win, I think the story of Lark and Termite is written with the grace and authority most novelists can't bring to their fiction.

That's fact. Colum McCann has constructed a wonderful fiction around it which encompasses the lives of some of those who saw or became aware of Petit's feat. They include an Irish priest doing work in the Bronx, a loose group of grieving mothers of Vietnam KIAs who meet that morning within sight of the towers, the judge who handles Petit's court case later in the day, an artist, and more, all connected to each other in some way by the incredible balancing act 110 stories above New York City. These are ordinary people hammered by life. Corrigan the Irish priest struggles to do what he can for Bronx prostitutes and for the patients at an old-age home while at the same time being torn between his vows and his love for a young nurse. The Vietnam survivor mothers are steeped in grief for their sons. The artist and her husband have crashed at the bottom of a drug-induced skid. McCann explains what Petit is to these and other characters in a sentence near the end of the novel: ""....the man alone against scale, still capable of myth in the face of all other evidence."" That moment when Petit walked and danced on that narrow cable strung between the 2 towers becomes the redemptive moment linking these characters to each other and to that irresistible inspiration above them. Aware of the incredible tightrope walk, the characters are unaware that in little ways they emulate him. A walk one character takes through the dangerous streets of the Bronx is compared to Petit's walk. A kid walking the beams of a bridge to spray paint graffiti parallels Petit high above. Jaslyn spreads her arms wide to maintain her balance on a curb. Corrigan the priest thinks of himself as an acrobat walking the thin line between his vows and his love for a woman.Philippe Petit has shown the way. Near the middle of the novel he imagines his caper as a kind of spark bringing life to the sterility of the silent air between the towers. It's anti-death. And on the last page a young woman driven to deliberations of the past by the grave illness of a nurturing woman who helped raise her realizes it's what we do, we stumble on to bring noise into the silence.McCann has confidently danced across a tightrope himself, keeping his cross section of New Yorkers delicately balanced within the structure of this beautiful and powerful novel.

Looking through the lens of the servant class and service Alison Light makes life in the This is a fascinating glimpse of a facet of British society. Looking through the lens of the servant class and service Alison Light makes life in the Bloomsbury group and Virginia and Leonard Woolf her subject. In telling all this, she has to pretty much explain British prewar society and give us a history of British domestic service. She tells it well, I think. The book is a chronology of Woolf's life and an account of her uncomfortable relationship with those who worked for her. More, the book also presents a biography--or the story--however sketchy, of each servant who worked for her. And in those stories and in the chapters dedicated to explanations of the service is a history of British domestic help. Light has written an important addition to Virginia Woolf studies. Because her book, in describing Woolf's relation to domestic help, thoroughly details the social system that produced the servant class, the need for them, the importance of individuals having service to go into, the evolution of dependence on them, and the relation of all these facts to each other, it also covers much of modern British social history. Virginia Woolf is a Bloomsbury star, of course, and her clumsiness and unease with domestics well known, but other Bloomsbury domestic styles and arrangements are also described by Light. The household of Roger Fry has its own chapter. Vanessa Bell, Virginia's sister, was apparently more traditionally-minded about servants. And Light also tells the interesting saga of Nellie Boxall, fired by Virginia, who later worked for years for Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. An absorbing read. One worry, a minor one. I like to read similar books simultaneously, thinking I can get more focus on a subject that way. I read this at the same time I read Glendinning's biography of Leonard Woolf and was surprised at how closely some of her impressions and ways of telling of a particular event matched up with the earlier work.

Mostly he's remembering a childhood growing up in settings such as these. The poems here are evocative, nostalgic, and sometimes sad.

He describes visiting the library as if entering a house of worship and recalls librarians who cast a suspicious eye on a kid who'd read so voraciously. Even this poem is about work.

The first and more formal is taken from a series of lectures. The second is what the publisher calls a conversation on several aspects of Forster's life and work. As the word suggests, its tone is more casual, though just as sincere and learned. Kermode leaves no doubt that he considers A Passage to India to be Forster's most enduring work. His interpretation, perhaps not new but new to me, is a combination of the secular and divine, a vision of the universe embodied in the land of India itself, and the reluctant--as I take it--appearance of Krishna after having been invoked in the famous scene at the Marabar Caves. But the novel also spoke to the acceptance of death as being necessary to the idea of the greatness which comes over Mrs Moore in the novel. Though Mrs Moore becomes, in the end, divine, that death is without spiritual current. Kermode, who recently died, brought his 50 years as a critic to bear on someone he considered to be one of the better craftsmen in British letters. He knew him a little, apparently, and used that acquaintance to bring to light such topics as Forster's dislike of some contemporaries like Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and Ford Madox Ford. Kafka, too, it seems, since Kermode notes twice that Forster never mentioned him. And if he wasn't comfortable with the experimental, including James Joyce and Wyndham Lewis, he admired Virginia Woolf and came to recognize her gifts as a novelist eventually exceeded his. His telling of the strained and shy relationship with A. E. Housman is fun to read. One of the most interesting things about Kermode's book is that it considers Forster from the angle of class literary preferences and attitudes. Early in the century, he explains, the working class was more literate than they've been given credit for. Forster more than most chose to reflect this perspective of the working class, one of his better known creations being Leonard Bast in Howard's End who lends an air of cultural gentility rather than unexposed indifference to the novel. Forster will always be an interesting subject. Kermode's portrait swings with the genuine admiration he felt for Forster's work, and that adds to the appeal of the book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2010","Feb 02, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6888160-concerning-e-m-forster

In my opinion the value of the collection is the man himself revealed by these letters which go to the end of 1925. Very few of them mention his own work. Most of the correspondence deals with his editorship of the quarterly, Criterion. I had an impression of Eliot as a cold, intellectually focused man. The personal letters included, however, show he felt a great deal of warmth for those he genuinely cared for, especially Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Mary Hutchinson, and Wyndham Lewis. What he wrote to them, and to others, says a lot about the person he really was. He could also be very funny when he wanted to be. The letters to Pound are a hoot.Eliot often mentions his own health and that of his wife, Vivien. The portrait one forms of Vivien from her correspondence and what Eliot himself wrote is different from that I'd had when I began the book. My impression of her was as a sort of cipher overshadowed and swamped by his enormous learning and talent. But I've learned that she was quite perceptive and was a talented writer in her own right. At the same time she does seem to have been emotionally fragile and may have been a hypochondriac. By the end of 1925 what she was mailing to acquaintances began to show some of the erratic behavior Eliot had to deal with. Her illnesses became increasingly burdensome to him at a time when he was working at a bank during the day, editing Criterion in the evenings, and trying to find time for his own writing. He became intolerant of her poor health and its demands on him. It might be that the health issues of his own chronicled here resulted from the pressure cooker of stress he couldn't seem to escape.This is an enormous book. However, Eliot's fluid language makes for easy reading. And the comprehensive notes and the glossary of names provide the details explaining the obscurities in the letters.

The Trotta family members, whose story this is, serve the Emperor Francis Joseph in civil and military capacities. Their story is his and the empire's story, his degeneration is their degeneration. Several traits give this novel its strength and endurance over time. One is the authenticity of character and Roth's ability to make the reader believe the Trottas and the people around them are real. These characters are so perfectly visible it's as if they've been chiseled from the page itself. Another is the brilliant and meticulous detail, such as descriptions of a singing canary and comparing a chattering telegraph key to a sewing machine and the feel of air and moisture as a summer storm approaches. More soundness is demonstrated in the unwavering resigned tone of the novel, maintained from beginning to end, relentlessly marching toward the demise of things as these characters know it. Roth grimly pours on the somber atmosphere until the Trotta family is defeated by events, by the meaninglessness and uselessness of the life they cherish and serve.

Knowing he'd spent some time in the U. S. after leaving the U. K., I'd looked forward to the next installment. Summertime is both that and yet not that. It's another of his novels in which he himself is a character. And it concerns itself with continuing the story of Coetzee's life. The premise is that after Coetzee's death a biographer is interviewing people who'd been associated with him in the period when he again lived and taught in South Africa after leaving America under some sort of cloud, not specified. It sustains the autobiographical interest because you feel like many elements of the truth are here. You feel as if the real J. M. Coetzee is being so unabashedly laid bare. There's little narrative flow here, but the character study and perspectives on Coetzee the man by these 5 interviewees is fascinating. One problem for me was what I considered a weak ending. The novel's framed by writings we're told are from Coetzee's notebooks and the biographer's annotations to them. Following the captivating material in the interviews themselves, the final section of notebook entries seemed, to me, not connected to the novel. I couldn't see the unity. But it's fine otherwise. I enjoyed it. Coetzee writes well about himself, or about himself as a character in his novels. While enjoying Elizabeth Costello and Slow Man--and maybe even Disgrace--with that self-as-protagonist perspective, I'd been seriously disappointed by Diary of a Bad Year.

It's a pleasure to read criticism as delicate as this and as magical as a hummingbird's flight. Benfey describes an age of American art and letters and society and history focusing on the lives and work of Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Martin Johnson Heade, and Emily Dickinson as well as various lives around them. He finds what they all have in common and shows how those enthusiasms link them and help create the art we associate with the period following the Civil War. Benfey uses the theme of hummingbirds, appropriate to all his subjects, to flit from person to person connecting them in the darting thrust of his text and ideas. But not only hummingbirds stitch them together--they share other confluences of circumstance, such as Brazil, transits of Venus, northeastern Florida, and flowers like the trailing arbutus. The picture Benfey is able to give us of the period and his subjects by using all these associations is colorful and elaborate. If the book has a main focus it's Dickinson. She's the flower here and the others along with their family and acquaintances are the hummingbirds who hover and feed on or near her presence in our literary history.

That it bears the Forster stamp and reputation no doubt has encouraged its celebrity and status as perhaps the best known of those works, even as we understand that when it was finally published in 1971 the subject matter was no longer controversial. It's unmistakably Forster fiction, well-written and confidently progressing through the familiar stations of class, unconventional behavior and a defiant adherence to it, love, and increasing worldliness. It has about it a breathlessness that seems overcooked, making it romantic in the way we associate romance with Forster, a kind of slow awakening to glory. For that reason I expect it's very different from modern novels about homosexuality, from The Swimming-Pool Library, for instance. I like Maurice without thinking it extraordinary. I wasn't made uncomfortable by the subject matter. In fact, reading Forster again I felt comfortable and welcomed, as if in a familiar place. It's deft handling of character and themes as what I expected from Forster. I'd put off reading David Leavitt's Introduction to this Penguin Classics edition until I finished the novel. So when Leavitt stated that Maurice is a novel similar to Howard's End, that it's very much of the same England and English as Howard's End or any other Forster novel, it made me understand my comfort in reading the book.

Ballard's story is familiar to us all, how as a boy in Shanghai before and during the war he was interned with his parents and other British and European nationals. I've always admired imagination in writing. What Ballard did with those experiences and how he represented it in Empire of the Sun, to my mind, demonstrated a high level of imagination. It, and the later novel The Kindness of Women, in which he brilliantly covers the same material in the opening 3 chapters, draw heavily on those experiences. One could say the most important writing Ballard produced were inspired by his first 15 years and his internment during the war, just as the years in Shanghai and Lunghua camp were the most important and formative of his life. He devotes 118 pages in Miracles of Life--42%--to them and frequently refers to them in the rest of the book. He could never leave Shanghai and, indeed, Miracles of Life is another retelling of those years. He admitted he found ways to keep his memories alive. If he were still alive and writing he might still be telling the story I began the book knowing the most fascinating pages would be those about Shanghai and the war. However, his perspectives on England, the effects of the war on the land and culture and on English character were just as absorbing. They were fresh views for me. Perhaps this freshness was the reason I thought his impressions of British attitude and pluck and sense of entitlement in the Orient as well as their blindered unawareness of the end of empire so brutally honest. He writes about his family in the same unsparing honesty. He alludes twice to feelings of neglect by and a distance more than physical from his parents as he grew up. He famously wrote them out of Empire of the Sun, portraying Jim, his alter ego, as being on his own in Lunghua camp. Reading this autobiography makes me think he felt they weren't there for him during the crucial milestone events of his childhood and early manhood. He relates how an interviewer once asked him directly why he left them out. He didn't answer the journalist and is slippery with the reader, too. Ballard was always an engaging writer, and there is good reading in Miracles of Life beyond Shanghai. He has interesting things to say about writing as a craft. Interestingly, he says that science fiction, in which Ballard scored his first publishing successes, was an advance on modernism. And he writes eloquently about the joys of raising his children, how happy he was at single-handed parenting after the early death of his wife. He generously gives his children credit for raising themeslves as well as him. And dedicates the book to them. He writes graciously, too, about the women in his life, those he emphasises were kind. But reading all these sunny paeans to family and friends I still sensed a shadow over Ballard the man, still felt the boy Jim was scarred by wartime Lunghua in ways he didn't write about.

It's printed on heavy stock paper, each page perforated so that the reproduced card can be punched out if the reader desires and kept stacked and boxed just as VN himself probably kept them. Underneath each card duplicating the author's handwriting, corrections, and original composition is the printed text of the card's contents, though it's seldom needed because he wrote legibly. The problem is the substance. What we have is unmistakably Nabokov, the urbane and silky style, the clever wordplay--""Games of blindman's buff would be played in the buff,"" he wrote--and even the familiar theme of pedophilia with a character named Hubert J. Hubert who I thought slimier and more disturbing than Humbert. It's not the dexterous Nabokov we know; he didn't have time to do much with it. The Original of Laura amounts to a collection of notes or several series of cards dealing with a potential thread or theme. But none of it's developed, and there's not enough to any of these threads to make a sustained narrative.

The story of his own life as Carol Sklenicka tells itRaymond Carver said his stories and poems were always about the ""he-she of human relationships."" The story of his own life as Carol Sklenicka tells it in this rich biography largely fits into that mold. All his romantic relationships were a little volatile at least, especially with the wife he married young, Maryann. Relations with his children were stormy as well. Not until he began living and working with the poet Tess Gallagher, who he married near the end of his life, did he find any true emotional stability. Sklenicka spends a lot of energy describing the fact of his life more well-known, his descent into alcoholism. Coupling this with his constant penury, his story becomes the arrival at and the slow crawl along the bottom, the personal desperation this caused, and its effect on his writing. His recovery from alcoholism, along with publishing success and the relationship with Gallagher, saved him. His rise is as interesting as his dissolution. Late in life he delighted in telling everyone how lucky he was.One joy of the book is Sklenicka's ability to tell a story well. Every Carver encounter with another writer contemporary to him gives birth to a story she's able to spin in some wonderful way. And Carver, it seems, knew everybody so that virtually a Who's Who of contemporary letters strides through the book's pages. Like the actor Kevin Bacon claims to have worked with everyone in Hollywood, Carver may have been acquainted with every writer in his time. In 1977 he met the man who'd become his closest friend, Richard Ford. Another writer, Gordon Lish, was important as a friend and as an editor of Carver stories. While at Esquire and Knopf he was instrumental in getting him published, and his aggressive editing was responsible for the shape of the early stories. As Sklenicka makes clear, however, Carver the teacher and writer was more influential than influenced. Today there isn't a post-Carver poet or writer who hasn't been touched by him.There's much to like here, like a Raymond Carver story. Sklenicka tells it all well.

And she makes our following the madcap movements of this wonderful fool and schlemiel through London and Paris a lot of fun as he learns to find his direction in life. About halfway through it becomes a caper novel. And becomes funnier. Jake stands outside the gates of a motion picture studio wondering how to get in: ""If you have ever tried to get into a film studio you will know that the chances of your turning out to be an Unauthorized Person are very high indeed. I am myself a sort of professional Unauthorized Person; I am sure I have been turned out of more places than any other member of the English intelligentsia."" But Murdoch was philosopher before she was novelist and near the end provides a serious side to Jake in that he sees that each separate moment of his life has gone into creating the reality of himself standing still, finally, on a London street that is really a crossroads. He recognizes that each moment can be pointed out just as each frame of a film is accented individually at speed to make time--and his life--flow. Iris Murdoch has spun some fine moments of character and comedy and narrative situations into a pretty good novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 16, 2010","Nov 11, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11324.Under_the_Net

His poetry seems gleaned from the French surrealists through Frank O'Hara and many have surrealistic ingredients at their center. To me what's so impressive is that he could make it such delightful reading, watching incongruous, ill-matched materials shift and shimmer within a poem and refer to each other until something powerful results. In this way his improvisations light fires in our imaginations and bring a measure of understanding to the world. But still, I don't always get it. I didn't follow, for instance, how the New York City Racquet Club can be linked to the Sarajevo assassination of Franz Ferdinand. At other times they're very intoxicating, as in ""Lorraine Motel, Memphis,"" which mixes sexuality with a transcendant vision of Martin Luther King. Having read assassination in the last 2 sentences you might get the impression his vision is violent. Not overtly. It's Seidel's mischievous heart. About him there's often a trace of evil, campy evil. Sometimes he plays rough and the dark edge of his poems threatens to tip things into a loss of control and chaos. In that way many of these poems reside in a dream, and their reading refuses to be hurried. They require time for examination. These are the poems of 50 years, unusually arranged from newest to oldest, 2009 to 1959, but I didn't feel their artistry diminished or that they became less accomplished as I progressed....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 16, 2010","Nov 11, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6100306-poems-1959-2009

The splendid golden fall depicted in Maureen Howard's The Rags of Time is gone, replaced by raw weather and a lowered, starless sky. This, autumn, is the fourth volume of Howard's tetralogy about the four seasons. I can't imagine anyone making sense of it if they haven't read the three previous volumes. I know she's a challenging novelist, and I'd reread the previous 3 novels this year, but I still found it very difficult. All the characters who'd appeared before return in one form or another. Louise and Artie from A Lover's Almanac play a principal role. One addition seems to be an aging writer--perhaps closely modeled on Howard herself--engaged in her own history, immersed in memory. History is Howard's focus. She dedicates one long section to Frederick Law Olmsted, the creator of Central Park which sits in the middle of both the city and the novel. To each character it's an Eden of sorts. I think discovery is a theme as well. The novel begins on Columbus Day. References to him and to Genoa continue to the end of the novel. The elderly writer lives in a building along the edge of the park called El Dorado. Associations are made with this and with Sir Walter Raleigh's search for the fabled city in South America. But I'm not sure the modern characters discover anything. I was never even sure from whose point of view a particular narrative section was spun out.Expecting redemption, I noticed only a winding down. Increasing cold. A chill wind ruffling the waters of The Lake behind the Bethesda Fountain. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 05, 2011","Nov 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6897512-the-rags-of-time

Breathless moments of intense feeling, passion, and tLove stories, novels about love, love poetry are easy to like because we can all relate to them. Breathless moments of intense feeling, passion, and the longing to be with someone are things we've all experienced. The loves of fictional characters reflect our own. We enjoy accounts of such intense emotion because they meant so much to us and because we recall them as happy. The Museum of Innocence has that going for it. And it has Pamuk's comfortable prose style going for it. There are two things wrong with the novel: Kemal and Fusun, the lovers. He never made them realistically vibrant for me. This is one of those novels in which the protagonist, Kemal, talks ceaselessly about his condition, in this case his obsession with Fusun. His voice is an apologetic drone about love lost, then found but unrequited and longed for. Even when Kemal has Fusun's love he's awash in a sea of mooning and reminiscence, agonizing about mistakes he's made. The details of his unhappiness are bound in the novel's conceit of a museum memorializing Fusun and his love for her. This premise leads to unfortunate chapters which challenge patience, like the one in which he describes collecting 4213 cigarette butts she smoked in the years he visited her family's apartment. If Kemal isn't infectious, neither is Fusun. As wonderful a writer as Pamuk is, in this love story he failed to convince me Fusun was worth Kemal's obsession. Fusun is 2-dimensional, and as a love interest this should not be so. Her dream is to become a star in Turkish art films. To the reader she seems as distant as if she were already an image thrown on the screen. Kemal speaks poetically about Fusun's thighs and breasts or the way she tosses her head or smiles in company, but as vigorous as my imagination can be I couldn't hold her reality as a young woman in love and loved. The society Kemal mixes with is upscale Istanbul, coolly sophisticated, confident. These, Kemal's and Fusun's young friends, are as sketchily portrayed as they are. The people who come most alive in the novel are those distanced from that group by age or attitude, like Fusun's mother, Nesibe, or Kemal's chauffeur, Cetin.All this isn't necessarily bad. Elements like the 2-dimensionality and Kemal's moony condition can work, especially in the hands of a novelist as adroit as Pamuk, but in a novel half the length of this 532-page doorstop. So this reader, at least, wearied of this interminable love story in which often the most interesting thing going on is the storks migrating back and forth over Istanbul....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Mar 2012,"Nov 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6282753-the-museum-of-innocence

It's pretty interesting, too, because I'm familiar with the area covered during the Niagara Campaign of that spring. In attempting to gain control of Lake Ontario, an American force invaded Ontario across the Niagara River and pushed the British forces up the Niagara Peninsula toward the western end of the lake. The British stood on Burlington Heights, now part of Hamilton, later launching a night attack on the American forces camped on Stoney Creek, a few miles to the east. The outcome was in doubt. The Americans withdrew, however, in some disarray, ending the invasion. Elliott's book is strong on visual support for his text: good maps, many photographs of the battlefield at various times, from the mid-19th century to the present, interesting biographical accounts of the participants, and several appendices covering such topics as the weapons of the armies, the historic preservation of the battlefield, and the modern archeological examination of it. It's interesting. It's comprehensive and provides a detailed study of an action which is rather obscure. My problems with the book lie in my own personal dislike of history told in the words of those who were there. Certainly they have first-hand experience. Maybe they even have a valuable perspective on the events, a deep understanding, notwithstanding the old saw about the fog of war.... Elliott, however, includes far too much for my taste. In some sections almost every paragraph includes a contemporary comment on what happened so that Elliott's first sentence is the paragraph opening followed by an eyewitness account.

It traces the details of their careers and the forces that shaped the way they conducted themselves at the level of high command. Once the thrust of the book moved away from the biographies of these men, it became the story of how the U. S. conducted itself in postwar Iraq in solving the problems there, in helping to create a stable government, and in combating the snowballing insurgency. The book became an account of how the military let the country slide into civil war before they were able to successfully put the puzzle pieces together and turn the situation around. These generals are George Casey, John Abizaid, Peter Chiarelli, and David Petraeus. I got a more positive impression of military competence from this book than I get from periodicals and the evening news. Though the book may be a bit partisan, it does present an image of a military recognizing what needed to be done before their civilian bosses and beginning to move in that direction. The title and PR on the book hinted at a mild expose, at a failure by 2 of these generals and a deliverance by the other two. I found this not exactly true. They were all working effectively toward the same vision and end result. Washington policy deeply affected the day-to-day efforts of these officers and those serving with them. General Abizaid directed operations for the Mideast region. Casey and his executive, Chiarelli, were responsible for Iraq. They were blamed when the sectarian violence threatened to spiral beyond the points where the Army and the 2 governments could contain it. Petraeus, perhaps rightly so, gets the credit for driving the counterinsurgency doctrine that returned the country to the most stable condition we've seen since 2003. What happens in the book, the ""future"" of the Army, is a shift from conventional warfare to counterinsurgency tactics, a shift now also underway in Afghanistan as well. The debate about counterinsurgency has been going on for years in the wake of Vietnam. Because our larger enemy in that war was the North Vietmanese Army and because they conducted conventional tactical operations the U. S. military fought a conventiional war as well, though the perception of history is often different. And after the war the Army, eager to forget Vietnam, refocused on what they considered their primary mission, responding to major land conflicts in Europe and elsewhere. Cloud and Jaffe don't approach the issue in that way and for that reason lessen the impact of counterinsurgency doctrine and strategy in Iraq after Petraeus had taken command following Casey's elevation to Army Chief. I personally think the change of gears in Iraq to that of counterinsurgency is quite distinct from previous approaches, and decidedly effective. The Fourth Star, despite its claim to describe the events affecting the future of the Army, seems to avoid giving credit to that policy....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 15, 2010","Oct 30, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6943893-the-fourth-star

I was intrigued by cover blurbs comparing it to Tristram Shandy, Moby-Dick and Gravity's Rainbow. Heavy company, those titles. What I thought it most resembled was a brilliant novel by Joseph Heller called Something Happened, and the more recent David Markson novel, Wittgenstein's Mistress. Or maybe a work by Samuel Beckett but with much less despair. It's what I call an interior novel, a mostly inner monologue by someone who's experiencing an isolation of some kind, either voluntary or preferential, or an institutionalization. Late in the novel we learn Helen's name, but I remained unsure about the type of community she's in. It's not a prison or asylum because she has quite a bit of freedom to come and go. We don't learn very much about Helen, either, in this plotless novel, though some things are slowly revealed. She was once a history professor, for instance. But she talks more about the known facts of history than about the ideas. Leslie Van Houten, the Charles Manson acolyte, is a theme that Helen thinks of as history. Napoleon is frequently mentioned, too, and Kafka. A lot can be brought up in 292 pages of meditative prose. Indeed, encyclopedic is one of the tags assigned to the novel. Maybe. Many things are mentioned but none are developed as essential struts holding up the edifice of the fiction. Such obsessions as Kafka, skin and its diseases, Van Houten, cats and dogs, chairs and fabric, her mother, the Polish lady who gives her facials at a spa keep recurring so that the repetitions seem to be a symptom of hysteria. More hysteria than thematic development. Yet we gradually have to decide she's not insane. Unsettled, I guess, is a more generous description. I say this while at the same time remembering the 2 epigraphs preceding the novel, one by John F Kennedy about the unfairness of life for people who are sick, and one by William James about the nature of reality. Near the end the characters around Helen begin to take on shape and personality, as if emerging from her mental fog into recognition. There's even a little dialogue and some narrative movement. For me, by allowing her to become more involved with others around her and come out into the open, to venture outside her brooding preoccupations, took some punch away from the novel and made it less interesting. Comedy? Well, I didn't laugh.

Some of his positions are correct in themselves, others are extreme. It's how he verbalizes his arguments that make this such a rant. His concern is that we're giving up language and the intellectual tools to cope with the complexities of modern life and are increasingly letting image and spectacle take the place of the printed word and meaningful content. He uses the tragic mini-dramas of professional wrestling and the tinsel of Las Vegas to illustrate this to great effect. And he's right. He's right to voice disquiet about the waning of intellectual interest. But when he claims that this leads to a hyper-masculinity that in turn breeds the imperialistic impulse of Iraq and Afghanistan he becomes a little shrill. And that's the tone of his book: he has valid concerns but how he argues his points diminishes them. Think of the robed man with the inflammatory placard. Sometimes his statements swing from the vine of his own personal opinion and agenda. The specific failings of individuals, like his mentioning the insider trading of Martha Stewart, read as if they're items of personal disapproval, a flaw, I think, in a work expecting to be taken seriously.My impression is that his anger diffuses his ideas to the point he either gets off topic or tries to include too much. His opening chapters have considerable impact in describing how the script of professional wrestling stands for the perceived script of America in decline and in describing how pornography is shifting our perceptions of love and intimacy. But his rhetoric accelerates into haphazard presentation. And some facts are presented without documented support. He claims, for instance, that some administrations have padded workforce statistics with the numbers of those serving in the military or that statistical loopholes allow the government to report unemployment figures half the size of those who're in reality out of work. ""Financial collapses lead to political extremism,"" he warns and writes of a U. S. War College study predicting widespread civil violence if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. Martial law is the result, he says. It's a tirade. He accuses journalists, especially those covering the Iraq War, of being courtiers. His careful explanations as to how literacy and love are in decline degenerate into rants about the government, about an economy held hostage by debt and propped up by the defense industry. He bemoans our democratic institutions undermined by a corporate elite. In fact, he writes of the rise of corporate states so powerful they're replacing political states as if the idea is a new one. His discussion of the suspension of habeas corpus reads like it'd never been done before the Bush administration. The charge of refusing to ensure verifiable ballot-counting and the practice of warrantless wiretapping are complaints made in transparent exaggeration.My own sense is that he's discussing ideas which have been around a long time. I wondered if these aren't old concerns now being newly-highlighted and magnified by newer information-age tools and kept current by the news media. Is this, I asked myself, just the latest articulation of what's always been true to some degree or another? I see the same body he sees and see the aging process and the bacteria and the blemishes. I don't see the viral infections he says are going to kill it.In the end he can only point his finger at what he thinks is wrong. He has no thoughts on how to fix it, or as was so recently and nimbly described, how we can fly the airplane while we repair it. Hedges sees decline and doom. He closes with a comparison of the Greek states Sparta and Athens. He reminds us the former celebrated militarism, power, and discipline. Athenian art and philosophy, in contrast, gave us hope. Unfortunately, he sees America as a Sparta, which he considers a culture of death and expects will leave nothing of value behind. Perhaps he doesn't see clearly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Apr 2013,"Sep 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6577631-empire-of-illusion

And we identify with the verbal energy poets use to write about the eager exhilaration we've all experienced. We never tire of love poetry because we never tire of love or of having that headlong plunge of emotion described for us. Love poems return us to times when light was attracted to us and was reflected brighter. Dempster's poems didn't do that for me. I thought his language thick and not personal enough to close the distance between poem and reader. I felt held at arm's length. I felt the emotion and moment he writes about was hardly shared. I didn't see his subjects in the new ways we see things as we look through love. Reading here I wondered where the lightning was. Where was the abandon, the desire? Where was the light?

I gave it more stars and wish there were more I could add because I think Gass is a brilliant writer. The Tunnel is almost what I call a language book kinda like Beckett or Joyce. He writes that well. It's an extended, encyclopedic meditation, a novel of 651 pages with no plot. It's a tunnel through the mind of William Kohler, a university professor who's written a huge history entitled Guilt and Innocence in Hitler's Germany. He sits in his basement trying to write the introduction to his book. Instead he writes The Tunnel while at the same time beginning a literal tunnel through the floor of the basement offering escape from a life and world he finds oppressive. He writes about himself and about his place in a history crowded with genocide, tribalism and bigotry, and tyranny both political and familial. In digging through his own life's narrative he hopes to break through the bedrock of what he sees as the fascism around him to find again his own virtue and pure purpose.Though it sounds as dank and dark as Kohler's basement, though it offers no dialogue to lighten up the dense paragraphs of packed memory and reflection, it's a lively read. Gass is a writer who uses language dancing like a sparkling fuse from impression to metaphor to notion, dream, idea, breathless wordplay, and able to vault from matters of intellectual gravity to fun in a single bound. Few today can write with his energy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 25, 2016","Jun 16, 2016","Sep 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/163477.The_Tunnel

This vReading only the 1st volume at this time.I read only this 1st volume of Burlingame's huge biography of Lincoln, saving the 2d for a later time. This volume takes him up to the eve of his 1st inauguration. The biography is big in scope and meticulous in detail. The only biography of Lincoln I can remember reading, this was promoted as offering new insight into a childhood in which the relationship with his father was strained, even abusive, and is therefore useful in explaining the formation of the young man. I appreciated how Burlingame could make lincoln come alive as he progressed through the years as shopkeeper, lawyer, and successful politician. On Burlingame's pages he's three dimensional. In covering his political career and views Burlingame has to necessarily explain the issues the midwest and nation dealt with at the time, the most important of which was slavery. As Lincoln's story moves to the national stage the big biography also becomes big history. Burlingame writes in considerable depth about the issues driving the various regions and acting to pull them apart. The long account of the Lincoln-Douglas debates is fascinating and is maybe the highlight of this volume. I never understood until now that the heart of the debates in the late 1850s was the institution of slavery itself. Darn good reading, but as biography it's almost too detailed, almost more than I want to know.Currently reading the 2d volume.A year ago to the day I finished the 1st volume of this biography. I enjoyed this 2d volume, covering the Lincoln wartime administration, more, maybe because the material is more familiar and easier for me to relate to. I found it engaging from start to finish. This is not only good biography but equally good history of the issues and pressures of the war years. There's a lot here I wasn't aware of, not only small details but larger issues such as the 1865 Hampton Roads peace negotiations with Confederate representatives which suggested an agreement for a peaceful end to the war might be hammered out before the Southern armies were defeated in the field. Nor was I aware of Mary Lincoln's questionable financial dealings with White House funds and her erratic emotional state. Burlingame explains all this and much more thoroughly and clearly, showing Lincoln's strengths and firm direction of a nation in crisis. Burlingame's account seems straightforward and honest, told without any perceptible slant regarding those influencing the course of the war or the government. He gives credit where due while being sharply critical of those who show weakness or fail in some way, for instance Mary Lincoln and George McClellan. For this reason I believe his portrait of Lincoln the man and wartime leader shows a person of extraordinary strength and wisdom and compassion. My admiration for him swells. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2011","Sep 04, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3514309-abraham-lincoln

Gold states it baldly: movies are immortality. He makes us see the 3 main Hollywood characters--Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks--in that devotional light. A main theme is the nature of divinity and celebrity. The reader comes to see it in terms of light, both the flickering, ghostly light of film and the bright sunshine of California. It's only deep into the novel that this theme is developed. Chaplin describes himself early on as a pooka, the imp of Irish myth. But Pickford explains they're more than that. She's come to realize that their celebrity is a commodity and that the transformative power of film gives them a kind of unlimited influence on public imagination. It's all pretty subtle, but after an opening describing mass sightings of Chaplin and the attendant hysteria the novel settles into a long middle game in which the idea gradually builds potency to arrive at a powerful apotheosis of Pickford shown as a luminous vision against a bedsheet in a Russian church. Pickford and Chaplin and others become the divinities of their day. They arise, brought by the light of the sun and the light of film to an apogee created by the public's need so that they are equally and simultaneously venerated in every locality where movies can be shown. Despite Gold's skillful emphasis of the flaws and vulnerabilities of these people, they are sturdy characterizations and this is absorbing fiction. Gold is careful to show them as gods in the Greek sense. They're commanding and magnetic personalities yet they have the false fronts of the movie sets they work on and the fragile, shimmering reality of their medium. I've concentrated here on the aspect of the narrative that most interested me, but this is a sprawl of a novel and there are 2 other fully realized stories making up the triangle, that of Leland Duncan who adopts dogs in France and that of Hugo Black who finds magic in Russia. I suspect my admiration for this novel goes beyond its real critical coin. But I like it a lot. It's more serious than it seems at first because it's funny and, like Chaplin's Tramp character, diverts attention from the sober sides of its themes. The humor is generated through warm characterizations and descriptions of actions presented as we'd expect them filmed--a cop pushes his cap up with the tip of his nightstick, he grabs a culprit and walks him away holding his collar, a soldier picks his way step by step down some stairs holding his weapon. I was taken by surprise. Gold lulled me into accepting the work as a rather simple triangle of narratives when all along he was preparing to show me how the gods came to realize their influence and how they became bathed in whole shoals of sunshine. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 07, 2010","Sep 04, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4745776-sunnyside

The attack was mismanaged and failed. One of the most interesting elements of the battle as well as the hinge on which much of Slotkin's history swings is that one of the Federal divisions used in the attack was composed of African American soldiers recruited from former slave areas of Maryland and from freed blacks living in the midwest. This was the first instance of African American soldiers used against the Army of Northern Virginia. The slave culture of the South and the strong feelings of scorn heaped on the Negro of the mid-19th century helped cause some of the most desperate fighting of the war and put into play many situations in which no quarter was given by either side. In histories such as this, those which cover a particular event, a narrative is already in place for the historian to use. Slotkin is one of our leading Civil War historians. Not only is his analysis of why the details developed as they did comprehensive and convincing, but he's able to tell the story of the battle and the people involved in such an engaging way that the reader will not want to put the book down. He's able to make the time and place come alive.Somewhere in Slotkin's impressive oeuvre is the comment that the most important factor in American history is the country's race relations, meaning both Indian and African American. His famous 3-volume history of the American frontier tells of our relation to the Indian. His Civil War histories necessarily include analysis of our deep connection to African Americans.No Quarter is also a fine companion to Slotkin's 1980 novel The Crater, one of the finest novels about the Civil War I know....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 11, 2014","Sep 04, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6435497-no-quarter

Difficult as obscure, as cuddling up to the surreal. And it's with that tone that the poems raise up spectres of old modernists. Many of them are about death, death on a grand scale. One of my favorites, ""Old Possum,"" alludes to an image of Eliot's of those undone by death. But today they're not crossing London Bridge en masse but are listed in Google and insurance databases. And there are poems about Nixon, too, the Dick of the title. Many of these poems become, then, political poetry. Not of political protest. Because Nixon's dark, insecure spirit is shown hanging over our age and influencing our own boogeymen--Loden points out Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Dubya--the protest in these poems is muffled by dread, disquiet, fear. She does give us a glimmer of brightness, though. The final poem, ""My Secret Flag,"" describes stitching hope like making a huge quilt. I like this book. It's difficult but I like its challenge. These are poems not so dependent on the meaning of their specific parts as on the tenor they sink into your consciousness.

You can tell she's reading near the end of the novel, probably the Molly Bloom soliloquy. Of course! But I'm passionate about James Joyce and his novel Ulysses, too. The subtitle can be misleading--The Art of Everyday Living. My first thought was that it's one of those books of popular psychology or light philosophy using literature as a loose base. However, the agency of the subtitle is through Joyce's book rather than Kiberd's. Ulysses and Us is one of the better works of Ulysses scholarship I've read. According to the author, Joyce wanted to create a reading experience so unique that new types of readers would be formed. He spends a considerable amount of time discussing his idea that Joyce saw banality in literature because the modern novel was focused on the bohemian. Therefore he set out to produce a work in which the bourgeois is welded to and overcomes the bohemian. Ulysses in this sense is a self-help manual in which an older man teaches a younger one how to live and be whole. Because Joyce saw that the middle class had no real public culture which promotes its importance and triumph, meaning everything is reduced to mass entertainment, he wanted to write a novel showing the bourgeois and everyman as heroic, in this way teaching us a new, better way of living. Following chapters outlining those general ideas, Kiberd gives the reader an impressive and fairly comprehensive critical analysis of each chapter in Ulysses. And he ends with several fascinating chapters which explain Ulysses's relation to The Odyssey, The Divine Comedy, The Bible, and Hamlet. It's near the end that Kiberd makes one of his most intriguing points, that in being deliberately obscure about his novel's meaning Joyce inadvertently encouraged the creation of a small industry dedicated to interpreting the novel and that this may have lessened the importance of reading it. I like to think Marilyn wasn't discouraged. I remember reading somewhere that she enjoyed a literary novel, so maybe she did read Ulysses.

About 620,000 men died during the Civil War from combatThis seems to me to be such a necessary history that I wonder why it wasn't written until now. About 620,000 men died during the Civil War from combat and disease. An equivalent proportion to our present population would be about 6 million. How does a society cope with such enormous loss? Faust's fascinating book of military and social history attempts to tell how. Simply put, it's a book about death, what it meant in mid-19th century America, and how those huge numbers of military deaths affected perceptions. Her chapters bear, as you might expect, titles explaining aspects of Civil War death: ""Dying,"" ""Killing,"" ""Burying,"" ""Numbering."" I think the most interesting chapter is ""Believing and Doubting,"" concerning the role of 19th century religion in helping to come to terms with the carnage and to justify it. My reading has given me the impression that in that religious age death didn't distance the fallen soldier from the living as much as today. In the 1860s death wasn't annihilation. Faust confirms this thought and explains that only the confidence in immortality provided by religious beliefs made the large Civil War death tolls acceptable. She adds that the Union was guided by Lincoln who emphasized the battle deaths, as at Gettysburg, were a necessary sacrifice in order for a terrestrial, political redemption to become possible. For the Confederacy, in defeat, their losses seemed meaningless and unredeemed, and out of that helplessness, she says, came the idea of the Lost Cause as a celebration of Confederate memory providing some means whereby the terrible loss of life could somehow be affirmed and the deaths not have been in vain. That same chapter is also valuable for its critical look at how such influential writers as Dickinson, Melville, and Ambrose Bierce helped outline the borders between religious belief and unbelief that resulted from the war and prepared western societies for the disillusion attending the losses of WWI. An important chapter in an important book. Much of the book was as I expected--I just needed it to be articulated. But I'd never given thought to death in relation to race. Here she surprised me with her description of the savagery of the combat between Confederates and the black Union units opposing them. Blacks apparently served partly under motivations of vengeance. Southerners often viewed the presence of large units of blacks under arms as a slave rebellion, as, indeed, it's been called in other histories. This is excellent history touching a face of the Civil War not seen before to my knowledge.

He thinks he's seen it, he wants to write it and tell it, and I think he has in his book reporting the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, The Forever War. Everyone who looks at an object or event sees it in a slightly different way so it's difficult to know exactly how the truth fits it. When reporting the events it's only those who write with beautiful authority, who can describe so convincingly that you feel you're reading the truth. Dexter Filkins can do that. Whether reporting on Marines in Fallujah or young Iraqi boys who spot for the insurgency, whether writing about American administrators or the menacing, mysterious cleric Muatada al-Sadr, you feel like he's telling it as you need to see it. Filkins has clear vision and he writes with energy and the fast pace of those events to allow you to see what he saw. Perhaps the strongest trait of the book is Filkins' affection for those he writes about. It doesn't matter if they're Afghanis, Iraqis, or Americans, he weighs them equally and showers them with the same sympathy. Perhaps it's this above anything else that keeps his reporting from becoming condemnatory. Everyone's caught up in the destruction of Iraq, none of the people Filkins writes about can escape the situation, and he seems to present everyone from this angle.I think this is accomplished reporting. I'd bought the book 3 years ago but had delayed reading it so long--through surge and end of mission and much else--that I wondered if it would still be timely. It is. It's still immediate, still carries the punch of news as it surveys the swirl of events yet never gets away from the people who're entangled in them. Because Filkins never loses sight of the individual Iraqis and Americans and their toll, this book may never become dated. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 12, 2012","Aug 17, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6021222-the-forever-war

Woodsburner is about that fire and about how it affects the lives of the novel's wonderful ensemble of characters. Because each of those characters is identified with a fire other than the Concord fire, one could almost say it's a novel about fire. Each character has a fire in their life and it means different things to each of them. Because I thought the novel trolled deeper waters than fire being several ideas of hell, I tried to look beyond that. Still, I think it's part of Pipkin's scheme. Toward the end of the novel is a description of the men as shadows desperately fighting the leading edge of the fire with hoe and shovel amid the terrible smoke and heat. That seemed pointed to me. But fire here is many things. To one it may signify guilt while to another it may be as simple as the taste of fire on his tongue when he takes a sip of whiskey. Thoreau, who startd the fire and soon became amazed at the size and uncontainable nature of it, thought of it as existence itself, before which he was helpless. What I believe is one of Pipkin's conclusions is that fire is redemptive. Concord was, as we know, one of the centers of transcendentalist thought in the 19th century, thought which is in some ways similar to Buddhism. So I wonder if we're not supposed to think of fire in the purifying terms of Buddhism. Thinking in that way, fire redeems. Each fire becomes a way these characters cleanse themselves. The novel's final section is set in time after the Concord fire. The characters have progressed in their personal narratives yet fire is still a part of each life. Those who have reached a state of grace are those who learn to control the fire in their life, whether building a roaring campfire or roasting coffee beans over an open flame. For a reader like me, fascinated with Alcott and Thoreau and Emerson and the little Concord world they inhabited, it's all wonderfully imagined and reconstructed in Woodsburner, right down to the language of the period. Surprisingly, I thought Thoreau the least interesting of the characters. Perhaps we know so much about him that Pipkin's imagination in making a young Thoreau was smothered before it could ignite him into energetic flame. Beginning the novel I'd thought Thoreau was to be the main character. Instead, I now believe it to be a man named Oddmund Hus, himself the most natural character in the novel and able to teach Thoreau a thing or two. It's just one of the interesting twists making this a wonderful novel, fully realized and hard to put down. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 28, 2010","Aug 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5292478-woodsburner

But because it's Pynchon it's a given it's well-written and fun and worth the read. An example of L. A. private detective noir, it pretty well captures the genre and adds to it with Pynchon's flare for off-beat characters and zany situations described in energetic prose. And I feel like it probably accurately depicts the atmosphere of some aspects of the Southern California beach, dope, and counter culture scene in the late 60s. Fun and fairly easy to read, as some have rightly claimed it's the most accessible Pynchon. I remember recently calling it Pynchon 101.

It might be more corect to say the life related was so big that it enormously affected history. I personally had a double-edged reaction to it, liking it but not liking it.Samuel Champlain was the French soldier, mariner, and explorer who was along for some of the earliest voyages of discovery to what is now Canada's Maritime coast and the St. Lawrence Valley. He helped found Quebec and other settlements along the river. He traveled extensively throughout the region establishing diplomatic and trade relations with the various American Indian groups. He was constantly busy making maps of wherever he traveled, often the first European there. An important man in France, too, he had connections at court as well as business roles in several corporations funding the settlement of what was called New France. Eventually he was named as the head of the colony, the representative of Crown and Cardinal Richelieu.My problems with the book are that it doesn't seem to realistically portray the historical events. Though the events seem to be factually accurate, I define the problem as a lack of cynicism on the part of the author, David Hackett Fischer. Because everything is depicted in a rosy light the book reads as if it was more suitable for younger readers. The book is so enthusiastically positive in relating Champlain's deeds and responses to what he saw that I began to wonder if history could be so ideal. Sometimes I thought the book gushed. And I began to think it was giving a false impression and that there was no true description of the lives lived. The Canadian light is always bright. Indians sing to everyone's delight and pleasure. Relations are all extravagant generosity and splendid displays. I began to see maybe the fault wasn't that Fischer didn't see the less than rosy side of Champlain. He may have been exactly what Fischer says he was. It may be that he didn't see the less than rosy side of the world around Champlain.This enormous moment in history must have been as shocking to Europeans as it was to the Native Americans. The wonder of such a huge land so full of promise and bounty compared to the smaller, cramped Europe, often war-torn, its society always circumscribed by centuries of established economies and class, must have produced true wonder, maybe even a sense of disbelief. Both Indians and Europeans must have functioned in states of amazement. As full as Fischer's story is, it's still too sketchy to adequately convey this.I also thought that Champlain is taken out of the broad history of North American exploration and Old World expansion. He gives us a Champlain too different from John Smith or Cortez or Sir Walter Raleigh. He shines too brightly and stands apart from them when in fact he was one of them. He may have been better at it and his intentions may have included the very best for the Native Americans. Nevertheless he was part of the movement in which the leading edge of the globe's most advanced economy and technology overwhelms the primitive. Fischer's failure to recogize Champlain in that way makes his book about a paragon rather than a man.The final chapters do provide better history. Fischer tells the story of the most important voyageurs who traveled the Great Lakes and intricate inland waterways exploring, mapping, and trading. And he describes the settlement of the Maritime coast and what came to be known as Acadia. Their history is so finely told that I was reminded of what an interesting writer of history Fischer can be. His book might have been better as a history of the broad nationalistic sweep of France into the political vacuum that was the New World rather than the lifetime dream of one man....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2011","Aug 09, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4531763-champlain-s-dream

When I learned Berlin Alexanderplatz is a technical first cousin to Joyce's UlyssesUntil a few months ago I'd never heard of this novel or of Doblin. When I learned Berlin Alexanderplatz is a technical first cousin to Joyce's Ulysses I became very interested. In presenting a picture of Weimar-era Berlin through the character of one man, Franz Biberkopf, using elements of stream of consciousness, mythology and Biblical and metaphysical references, he wrote a very impressive novel. He uses Berlin's geography in much the same way Joyce does that of Dublin; I'm sure Doblin's locations of streets, businesses and buildings are as accurate--and as lovingly pictured--as Joyce's Dublin. Berlin Alexanderplatz, too, just as easily focuses on snapshots of the ordinary denizens of this 1920s underworld and, like Joyce, allow us to glimpse them in a cosmic context. But not only echoes of Ulysses rebound in these pages: Berlin shown in the light of world news events recalls Dos Passos, and the presence of vast weather systems over Europe to influence events and the actions of characters just barely predates Robert Musil. This is the marriage of the real, natural Berlin of 1928-29 with the imagined, fictional, mythical. Learning that the translation was by Eugene Jolas surprised me. I know of him as a publisher and member of the Joyce Parisian circle of the 20s and 30s. But as little as I know about translation, this seems an excellent one. To me he's hammered out a vigorous, free-flowing English that captures what I think would be the slangy venacular of this underclass of characters trapped and crushed in their Weimar lives in Berlin, living in the seams between petty crime and convention. As I say, until a few months ago I'd never heard of this novel. I'd begun by watching the 13-episode German film Rainer Werner Fassbinder made of the novel, then, fascinated, moved into a simultaneous reading of the novel. I've still not finished the film. I find, though, that they compliment each other. Reading the novel has enhanced my understanding of the film, as incomplete as my appreciation may be. As readers steeped in 20th century modernism, we find the novel much less opaque. Still, as in reading Eliot or Joyce we never quite get to the bottom of it. Happily, I think, because then it's a novel that'll always have something to offer. I expect it can, as the best novels do, reading after reading, afford you a fresh reality....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Oct 07, 2009","Jul 27, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/243380.Berlin_Alexanderplatz

They seem to be about growing up and learning life lessons, education and finding direction, and young adulthood leading to early marriage, children, and divorce. But like her novels, everything is seen through the lens of her family, where she came from. In the last pages her parents are seen from the same perspective as Howard views herself, as a young married parent. The same pea grown in a different yet similar pod. It's brilliant, or almost so. Looking from outside herself, she examines herself as a character. In the end she's resigned to a kind of fate, to the ultimate things she always knew were in her path. As episodic history, neatly warehoused and shelved in packages to be lifted down and explored, rummaged through. None of the packages are transcendent, she says, except the moment the young woman walks up Madison Avenue in heels and a straw hat, the steps resonating clearly in the realization of her true nature. But if there's no transcendence, at least each package lifted down for inspection carries her DNA. All the individual packages make a whole. Each is an incremental step joining every other to become the steady beat of heels on Madison Avenue as that single frame of time illuminates her. Can it really be that meaningful, you ask? Yes, it can. It's a beautifully faceted gem of a book with a sharp, blinding glint....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 16, 2012","Aug 28, 2012","Jul 22, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1895341.Facts_of_Life

Big as Life: Three Tales for Spring, The Silver Screen, and The Rags of Time, the latter published last year, complete the series. By rereading the first 3 volumes before tackling The Rags of Time, I hope to remind myself of the themes Howard concentrates on as well as some characters who reappear. A Lover's Almanac takes place during the winter, though the actual dates of the novel begin on January 1st and end on March 31st, a slight doctoring of time in favor of convenience and symmetry. It's a love story in which 2 characters rummage through their personal histories and memories attempting to charge their present with meaning and order. By discovering the truths of their pasts they can understand who they are. The aim of many novels, sure, but Howard nails big ideas into the beams and joists of the familiar dates and predictions of The Old Farmer's Almanac holding this fiction together. That little book of folksy wisdom and promise helps inform the life and love of these characters. In the end all the standard features of the almanac have fused with weather and the night sky and predictive signs and mathematics to become lives and loves. As I said, Howard writes difficult fiction. But it's rewarding. One character says the problem is as beautiful as the solution. A novel of ideas, I suppose, though not at all a cold novel of intellectual sterility. Rather, a novel of winter in New York City in which the ""cold rain"" and ""falling weather"" of the almanac's predictions figure while it remains a warm novel of love and connections to the past, and of people who find themselves at the center of time and everything the almanac prepares us for. What's rendered in these winter months of 2000 is birth, death, and everything in between. I think it's accomplished fiction that soars, its arc as elegant as the sweep of the zodiac....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 18, 2011","Jul 22, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2424016.A_Lover_s_Almanac

It's a volume of short stories rather than a novel. The first 2 sections, April nd May, have a feel of the Gothic--the old, deteriorating house, the girl from Ireland hired into the employ of a dysfunctional family. More, they're capsuled family sagas. The 3d section, June, is made up of 3 shorter stories whose link is John James Audubon, birds, and flowers. And, of course, the entire collection is linked by spring, birth, growth, the sense of renewal. The 2d story in the June section continues the story of Louise Moffat and Artie Freeman begun in the novel of winter, A Lover's Almanac. Most impressive about the book and about Howard is how well she can write. It's not just the beauty and music of her sentences but the ability to weave the weft of allusion, theme and idea into the warp of those sentences.

But I'd alI'd read The Iliad before in the Robert Fagles translation and one by Stanley Lombardo, a classics professor from the University of Kansas. But I'd always heard about the earlier Richmond Lattimore translation. It seems that whenever you read a critical work on Homer the Lattimore is quoted rather than other editions. I've frequently come across books quoting Lattimore, and recently I became interested in a critical study of Homer called The War That Killed Achilles by Caroline Alexander. But reading s of it, the ers commented that Alexander quoted the Lattimore translation so extensively that one might as well read it instead. So I did. I've come to realize that no matter which translation one reads The Iliad is always magnificent. But having read Lattimore at last I think I prefer it, though it may be that he's fresher in my experience while Fagles is more than 10 years on. But his translation seems to suggest more of a sense of who those distant Greek warriors really were, primitive and superstitious, steeped in immoderation, childish anger and bravado. And it reads without judgement of that primitive nature, acknowledging that who they were and what they represented was the way of that ancient Aegean world. Another reason I prefer it may be that I think it the more challenging read in that it doesn't cater to readers' needs for direction in the form of stanza breaks and more Englished Greek names. The unbroken narrative of each book supports the momentum of the language, the verbal force of which creates an atmosphere of threatening, dark clouds under which these violent men slash and thrust. Lattimore's huge, muscular blocks of verse are better suited to contain the Babel of angry voices of men and gods at odds on the plains outside Troy. Lattimore's translation allows those people to be the mysteries they are....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Sep 24, 2010","Jul 22, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1372.The_Iliad

This is a kind of poetry I most delight in. The feel of his themes is both Western classical and Oriental mandarin at the same time, giving the poetry intellectual appeal, thought-inducing weight, and a feeling that in each poem something profound is being considered. He often writes about water. Because each poem seems like contemplation disturbing the still pool of idea, this seems appropriate. I found this very attractive poetry, highly philosophical, obscure enough that I couldn't touch the bottom of those pools the poems enter. I know Bringhurst, like Eliot, will require visits time after time to reveal different meanings, different colors. Reading Selected Poems struck an inner bell in me. Not only was it a gratifying experience to discover a craftsman who could so breathtakingly hammer poems into a confederacy of words and images and give texture to dreams, but the book itself is handsome. It's printed on magnificently lovely paper and beautifully bound and covered so that it rests in your lap like a satisfying work of art.

Now Fennelly joins the list. I'd not known of her until a matter of weeks ago. Pretty early in this book I was reminded of Sylvia Plath, even before I saw her spirit invoked by a blurb on the front cover. I think it's because one of Fennelly's prime themes here is her young daughter, just as Plath wrote about Frieda and Nicholas. The title refers to the tender hooks of love and need our children hold on with. And tenterhooks is anxiety. I don't see much of it here. Fennelly seems to see everything with an enlightened eye. I came to Fennelly via an erotic poem in an anthology. But she writes a nimble verse and uses muscular metaphors--about her daughter and motherhood, tinged with the sexuality that created the two. I like this poetry. Physically, too, this is one of the most attractive paperbacks I own. Much like the author, I imagine.

By beating the hammer of the artist against the anvil of his work he shapes the horseshoe of biography. I kinda felt that because Daugherty's critical commentary on Barthelme's work lacked punch he left the man as artist not quite rounded enough. Actually, what I think is that Daugherty's discussion of the stories seemed cogent and understanding but that the criticism of the novels wasn't comprehensive enough. It's through those novels--The Dead Father and Snow White, at least--that I'd come to my interest in Barthelme. Wanting to know where those novels as well as the later Paradise, which is in my future, came from, and why, sparked my read of the biography. I'm not sure Daugherty brought the man and his work together as a whole for me, the very purpose of biography. One area of the book fascinated me. Barthelme published frequently for many years in The New Yorker. The inner workings of the magazine, briefly discussed, are interesting. But more, Barthelme may have been too comfortable in the relationship, the author suggests, and by hugging the shore rather than striking out into deeper water of other publishing forums may have limited his reach. His work done, Daugherty stands grimy and sweaty holding up the horseshoe of his biography. It isn't exactly a wonky shoe but it may be a little thin for a heavy horse. Barthelme's eye was sardonic.

Remember when you were a kid and you wrote our your full cosmic address, beginning with your name and proceeding through Solar System to Galaxy to Universe? This is much the same. Potter, however, begins at the larger scale and works toward the smaller until his book becomes like a pointing finger: you are here. And also, faithful to his subtitle, A Portable History of the Universe, he does indeed narrate how we think the universe came to be as we understand it today, from the first fractions of the first second of the Big Bang to the birth of the Milky Way and our sun and the solar system until I came at last to where I was this morning in history, watching the light from our local star fill the street outside my window. Potter's telling of all this is as interesting as any I've read. His explanations of such arcane subjects as gravity and space/time and the nature of light are clear, easy to follow. I'd mention only 2 areas of tedium. As usual when reading about quantum theory my eyes began to glaze over and my mind to wander to thoughts of Scarlett Johansson. Not Potter's fault, but mine for thrashing about in depths over my head, but I still struggled with it. Secondly, toward the end his history starts to tumble and stumble as his story necessarily picks up speed. In limiting himself to describing the course of evolution and life on earth in 2 chapters he falls into survey.

Mathews claims that those drives, intrinsically a part of him, were used by Gauguin in producing his art. At the same time she admits that Freud himself thought that many artists seemingly achieved their work with such deep psychological underpinnings as part of their normal creative methods. Mathews says, as a result, that she's tried to project herself in a kind of ""postmodern understanding of clinical psychoanalytical practice."" To my mind the psychological interpretation of Gauguin fell away to allow the book to become a simpler, richer critical biography of an interesting man and artist.One of the ways Gauguin's considered a leader of modernism is his lifelong need to create and maintain an unconventionality. It extended beyond his art, the foundation of that leadership, to his own projection of personality and appearance, and to theatric mannerisms, flamboyant dress, belligerent behavior, and sexual attraction to young girls and boys. Gauguin was an unsavory character. At some time or other he treated everyone he knew badly--borrowing money he couldn't pay back, mistreating women, even the young daughters of acquaintances, abandoning his family, betraying and turning his back on friends who couldn't or refused to help him anymore. His sexual life and exploits are so emphasized and detailed in the book that I finally decided that it was more an accounting of his salacious and scandalous practices than Freudian interpretation.However, I think it very good biography. It's well-written and thoroughly covers each phase of Gauguin's life and work, from his beginnings as stock broker dabbling in art to the fascinating later relationship with van Gogh to his notoriety in the midst of the Parisian art world to his decision at last to work in Tahiti and the Marquesas because he understood himself and knew the loose social and sexual structure would provide him with generous inspiration, which is what happened. Not only are his major works critically examined by Mathews, they're presented in color on these glossy pages, making this a physically beautiful book as well as an informative one. While I wasn't sure of the Freudian approach to Gauguin, I found this a hugely satisfying biography.

I consider him one of the most influential poets of the 20th century as well as a poet to simply enjoy for his written word. So I'd keenly anticipated reading his letters. I wasn't disappointed. Their insight into the biographical details, of course, is intriguing. But in addition, though I'd already suspected this to be true, these letters to friends, peers, lovers, and colleagues show a wide breadth of literary knowledge and an ability to transmit it in a well-informed, helpful way. A true and generous friend to many, he worked unstintingly in behalf of others and their literary ambitions, as well as simply being a warm and kind man interested in the lives of those he cared for, which was practically everybody. Ginsberg's humanity was boundless and sincere, his support and encouragement of the arts often instrumental in promoting their advancement. A couple of minor difficulties, though. He and Jack Kerouac frequently corresponded in the style Jack relentlessly insisted was the most honest and from the heart, what he called spontaneous bop prosody. Those letters of almost interior monologue-like free association aren't always easy reading. And Ginsberg's letters to public officials aren't as interesting as personal letters written to friends and acquaintances. The editor, Bill Morgan, tried to be scrupulously various in providing the widest possible range of Ginsberg's correspondence, but I wish he'd included more personal letters. Still, it's fascinating reading. And probably essential for an old Ginsberg fan like me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 19, 2010","Jun 19, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2850771-the-letters-of-allen-ginsberg

I was living alone off campus and remember going to bed one night with uncertainty and fear of what events might unfold while I slept. I don't remember the date but think it must have been 27 Oct 62, the day Dobbs calls Black Saturday. He's written a gripping account of those days at the edge of nuclear war. He lays his narrative out in day-by-day and hour-by-hour detail told from the perspective of all 3 players, America, the Soviet Union, and Cuba. It's a terribly interesting history, both in terms of point of view and motives of the 3 leaders and in the revelation of developments we the public weren't aware of. The issue, as Dobbs tells it, was more dangerous than I'd suspected while at the same time less than an eyeball to eyeball confrontation because the moment Khrushchev was aware we'd discovered the missiles he knew he'd have to withdraw them. Because Kennedy and Khruschev immediately began to seek ways to resolve and compromise, the danger wasn't that one of them would overreact and start the war but that the military forces facing each other would create a shooting incident that would lead to a nuclear exchange. Amazingly, both the Soviet and American forces had nuclear weapons which could have been fired at the discretion of local small unit commanders. And Dobbs discusses at length the fact that, as the U. S. learned later, Soviet forces in Cuba were in possession of tactical nuclear weapons they'd have used against an invading force as well as in destroying Guantanamo. Reading the book I realized an element of good luck was involved in finding ways to solve the standoff without an underling firing a hasty shot which would propel the leaders into ""spasm responses."" I found it amazing, too, that Castro urged the Soviets to make a first strike against the U. S. As fascinating as the book itself is, the ""Afterword"" is even more so. In it the author discusses the consequences of the Cuban missile crisis. Dobbs emphasizes that we interpret history in the light of present day events, politics, and foreign policy. I've long felt that we can't understand our involvement and conduct of the Vietnam War without first understanding the events of October 1962. Dobbs confirms this but also goes further to explain how the crisis influenced the missteps in Iraq 41 years later. The crisis contributed, as well, to the collapse of Soviet communism by encouraging the Soviet Union to escalate the arms race in an attempt to keep up with American military might. Ironically, they developed a sophisticated and powerful military but couldn't in the end provide the Russian people with the basic material prosperity and spiritual fulfillment enjoyed in the west and so lost the war of ideas. I once heard someone describe the Soviet Union as being like a midget with the right arm of a normal man, strong militarily but ideologically bankrupt. The ""Afterword"" is filled with interesting material such as this. In the closing pages Dobbs is careful to assign credit for avoiding a 1962 nuclear exchange to the strong character of Kennedy and Khruschev. He's convinced that the character of leaders is instrumental in crisis management. And his comment that had a man of different character been in the White House on 9/11 the progress of foreign policy 2, 3 and 4 years later would've been different is a sobering one....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 03, 2010","Jun 19, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6481016-one-minute-to-midnight

J. Watson and the southwestern Florida coast at the turn of the century. I'Bone by Bone is the 3d volume in Peter Matthiessen's epic trilogy about E. J. Watson and the southwestern Florida coast at the turn of the century. I'd already read Killing Mr Watson, the 1st volume, when Matthiessen published his revision of the trilogy as Shadow Country. Rather than read that single volume, as fine as it's reputed to be, I decided to stay the course with the original 3 novels. So last year I reread Killing Mr Watson, then Lost Man's River during the summer. And now I've completed Bone by Bone and the trilogy. E. J. Watson had a reputation as an outlaw. He was thought to have killed Belle Starr in the Oklahoma Territory, later had to leave northern Florida under the shadow of murder, and all that baggage followed him to the 10,000 Islands where his neighbors feared him and considered him a man who'd go to any ends, even break the law, to be successful as a sugar cane grower and syrup manufacturer. Killing Mr Watson is told in the many voices of those neighbors. Matthiessen's treatment of Watson is as the Satan in the Eden that was southwest Florida around 1900. Lost Man's River occurs half a century later. It's told through Lucius Watson, E. J.'s son, and again the same voices are used in interviews to retell the story with different slants and perspectives. I thought Bone by Bone to be the most accessible of the novels, and I like to think maybe because it isn't in multiple voices but is, instead, spoken by Watson alone, those dreadful events finally given his point of view. As reader, I was able to establish and maintain a rhythm so that the story flows as smoothly as the tides so frequently mentioned. Without quite seeing himself as Satan, Watson recognizes the verdant coastline rich in foliage and wildlife is a heaven. But here Matthiessen sees the conflicts as the expulsion of Satan from heaven, Satan's fall, all overseen by the oracular 1910 passing of Halley's Comet. Who knows, in the end, the truth? The inhabitants of the coast, that region south of Naples, fear him as a violent man, a murderer responsible for many deaths and other shady happenings. Horrors proliferate. Watson's portrait of himself is that of one who cares for others while at the same time careful to control events to his social and economic advantage. He paints himself as well-intentioned but influenced by the designs of others, his innocent intention corrupted as events and situations slide out of his control It's for the reader to decide whether or not goodness triumphs, whether or not greed wins, whether or not evil is defeated. What's certain is that fear, rather than good or evil, is the greatest force at work in the islands. In my opinion, this final volume and the trilogy don't quite match a couple of other Peter Matthiessen novels: At Play in the Fields of the Lord and Far Tortuga. But he's a very fine novelist and with this trilogy has written something worthwhile. To me he demonstrates one of the most admirable traits of the novelist--elegance.

The war acted as catalyst causing processes in motion to speed up, to sometimes bring about collapse of ways of thinking or to shift identities or create new enthusiasms.

Blom tries to place the greatest influence of a particular reshaping in a proper niche within the spectrum of those years.

The insane character On p555 of The Savage Detectives is an exchange between Arturo Belano and Maria Ribot about the Jack Nicholson film The Shining. The insane character in that movie has written a 500-page novel in which the sentence ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" has been written in every conceivable way. Marie says, ""...how could it be a good novel when it was just one sentence repeated over and over again? That shows a lack of respect for the reader. Life is shitty enough without being stuck buying a book where all it says is 'All work and no play....'"" By that time in my reading of Bolano's novel I felt pretty much the same way. I was witheringly bored with it. I was tired of the characters, tired of the story, and tired of Bolano's authorial voice. Maybe the biggest contributor to all that boredom was the lack of variety. I think the voices spooling out the narration aren't different enough to sustain interest in a novel of this length. That's compounded by a saturation with Latin literature. After 40 years of Garcia Marquez, Jose Donoso, Carlos Fuentex, Camilo Jose Cela, and Jose Saramago and others it's difficult to find a Latin prose style compelling and fresh enough to hold our interest. Bolano, I'm afraid, isn't the answer. His edifice called The Savage Detectives resembles that unadorned architecture we've been reading for so many years and of which we've grown weary. One reason for my disenchantment with Bolano's novel was that after all the praise I'd heard heaped on it I realized it's a narrative technique we've come across before. This multy-voiced narration has been used many times, not only in Latin novels. Cela wrote 2 novels in this style, The Hive and San Camilo 1936. But the American Gilbert Sorrentino does it masterfully, and the South African novelist Andre Brink wrote a particular favorite of mine, A Chain of Voices, using this multi-voiced thread. William Faulkner. What those novelists knew that Bolano apparently didn't was that this method of narration stretches the patience of the reader, especially if the voices of the many narrators aren't given enough variety to convince the reader he isn't reading the same voice for 600+ pages. Bolano's novel is too long. It becomes the uncle and his family who visit for the holiday weekend that seems endless. Another reason for my resistance to the novel was that not only was it a merciless progression of voices cut from the same cloth, it was prose without nutrition. Bolano mentions Mexico City streets and localities without any frame of reference. In one of the later chapters, which takes place in a car speeding through a careful listing of small Mexican towns, we've given a 9-page conversation full of technical literary terms. None of this, the literary talk, the geographical listings, has any meaning because Bolano doesn't seem to use it for any artistic or metaphorical purpose in the novel that I could see. But the reader is presented with this over and over in the long course of the novel, and it makes for a bleak literary landscape. I feel like I failed as a reader because I know The Savage Detectives has been critically well-received. I know it was selected as one of The New York Times Book Review's best novels 2 years ago. I know all that, but I know, too, that I disliked it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Apr 14, 2010","Jun 19, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63033.The_Savage_Detectives

What's most important is that she left her remarkable stories and novels. One of those, Wise Blood, is a favorite of mine. I'm a little disappointed in this.

I was prepared for central characters larger than life and perceived as mythic, as is Voss himself and his parallel, Laura Trevelyan. I wasn't surprised by a sense of divinity, of a journey into a kind of hell. What's impressive is the way White uses language, how he controls impressions and the emphasis of his narrative with so few words. It's the same way a poet isolates a single word on a line or uses a space to point to meaning. So White can give us a physical picture of a man by describing how his bones fit in a glove. He can shift narrative by writing about how a horse drops dung. I like White's language better than his characters who carry the wright of myth, even though I'm receptive to suggestions of the mythic seen in ordinary lives. The novel is a parallel story of an exploration into the Australian outback by a German named Voss while a woman in Sydney seems to be tested in some of the same ways. But unlike other novelists who anoint characters with a kind of divinity--Cormac McCarthy and William Golding come to mind--White could never make Voss the character interesting to me. While Laura seemed plausibly a product of her time, Voss seemed to never take shape in terms of motive and energy. It's like Voss never filled the empty place in the novel the author had designated for him.

The harsh lives of the Chinese people in general, even starvation, were sometimes caused by Mao's policies. It's estimated his years of government were responsible for 70 million deaths. Was he a monster? Sure, I suppose so, as much as Stalin and Hitler and Pol Pot and others. But he was also a man. He was a husband, a father, and a friend to someone. He loved someone, sometime. It's okay to picture a leader's policies and direction as monstrous, but I believe at some level he's still a human being. Just as Hannah Arendt saw and pointed out the banal in Adolph Eichmann, Chang should have been willing and able to show the same banality in Mao. But she fails to allow him that. In my mind it makes for unbalanced, incomplete biography. The life and events punctuating that life are here--the young communist, the Long March, the Civil War, the Korean War, Chairman, the Cultural Revolution. I was surprised to learn how important Soviet help was to the Chinese Communist Party during the 30s. And also at how instrumental Moscow's steps were in keeping the Japanese bogged down so that they wouldn't be able to attack north into the Soviet Union. I also thought the analysis of Sino/Soviet motivations in Korea in the 50s interesting, if chilling. Some of the story is well-told. But because I feel Chang's over-emphasis on the negative approaches expose and polemic rather than comprehensive, complete biography, I wonder if exaggerations aren't present in accounts of Mao's administration of the country as a whole. Mao isn't a fun read--it's relentlessly negative. It's biased and imperfect because of that and because it leaves out part of the man. ...more",Notes are private!,1,61,1,not set,"May 08, 2010","Jun 19, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9746.Mao

Because I was intimidated by the complexity of the political events in Spain during the 1930s I'd put off reading it. Many years ago--1967--I read the Hugh Thomas history of the Spanish Civil War and had gotten lost in the mazes and Babel of parties right, center, and left, each accompanied by its own acronym and ideology. Beevor does a good job in that regard. He does what he can in his account to keep the fog away, to keep the parties and acryoyms tidily arranged and compartmented in ranks and files for reader ease. And that cleared the way for his story of the war in Spain, what it meant for the Spanish and for the rest of Europe. The most interesting aspect of the war was as a competition between the right and left in European and global politics. I'd realized this in a general way and had always understood the war as a proving ground for the equipment and military doctrines being tested for use in the wider war all of Europe knew was coming. I hadn't realized the grip the Soviet Union had on the Republican (government) side during the war. It was a grip which brought the government to the brink of becoming a communist state. As it turned out, the competition between Fascism and Communism--the Nationalists and Republicans in Spain--wasn't even a very close thing. German and Italian equipment and organization and efficiency easily overcame the Republican opposition which displayed many of the same weaknesses the purge-weakened Soviet Union showed in its inability to adequately prepare for war. Beevor makes all this clear, and his account is comprehensive, full. this is the first of Beevor's books I've read, and it's a good one....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Nov 26, 2009","Jun 19, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42660.The_Battle_for_Spain

Since there were no masts available to lash myself to, I surrendered and walked zombie-like to the cashier, cradling the book carefully. Drama aside, while I was a while warming up to Critchley's book, it lived up to most of its seductive song. His introductory remarks stated he intended to tell how the philosophers of history died and what we could learn from philosophy about the proper attitude to take in regard to death and dying. I didn't think the book very instructive. Not that kind of book, I'd say, more a survey, a roll call of what seems to be every philosopher of the past. What facts are known about their individual deaths are detailed. The more bizarre the death the more fun Critchley seems to have with his material. It's anecdotal and amusing. However, I didn't see that it would help the general reader cope in any way with dying or with grief. Or in learning anything about death as a subject. In fact, no line of thought was presented at all. If any trend stands out it's the general movement during the last 150 years toward secular thought.

I read the first volume of The Journals 3 years ago. The earlier volume was more interesting. The younger FowlI was a long time getting to this book. I read the first volume of The Journals 3 years ago. The earlier volume was more interesting. The younger Fowles was adventurous, eager to set out for the relative remoteness of a teaching stint on the Greek island of Spetsai, eager for the experience. He was an enthusiastic observer of everything he came into contact with and eager to learn from all he experienced. And he was intelligent enough to interpret everything in ways to feed his ambition as a novelist. The mystique of romance fit well with the intriguing atmosphere of Spetsai. It was there he met Elizabeth Christy, the wife of a teaching colleague, and they began the affair eventually resulting in their marriage and long life together.As the 2d volume opens, Fowles his found success as a novelist. Not only do readers like his The Collector and The Magus, Hollywood likes them, too. Some good novels follow: The French Lieutenant's Woman is a triumphant bestseller, and Daniel Martin an even stronger novel. And others after that, though eventually Fowles ceases to write fiction at all. But those are icebergs sticking up from the surface of a vast tedium. Overall, this 2d volume isn't the same savory meal as the first. Once you move away from the experiences inspiring The Magus and away from the romance with Elizabeth, there's not much reported here beyond the monotony of the everyday he and Elizabeth lived. Or not much Fowles chooses to let us in on. The life John Fowles describes is a little bland. Entries here report the little he tells about the writing of The French Lieutenant's Woman and the negotiations for rights to the film. Unfortunately those events are followed by one of the unexplained blank spots in the Journals when he apparently tired of his daily record. When he picks his journal back up 3 years later the film is in postproduction. He does occasionally write about interesting people he meets. He rubbed shoulders with Meryl Streep and Jermy Irons during the filming of The French Lieutenant's Woman. He's uncomplimentary about Michael Caine's work in the film made of The Magus. He met and liked William Golding and writes impressions of Salman Rushdie, whom he met soon after the beginning of the fatwa. Fay Weldon and Joyce Carol Oates and others have cameos. But such entries are separated by a lot of humdrum reporting. He doesn't have much to say about his work or about writing in general. He wrote about personal events which have little meaning for us. He wasn't deeply philosophical, doesn't have great lessons for us. Or at least he doesn't let us in on them. And he doesn't make naked reveals about John Fowles, the man, either. He was kinda stuffy, upright, guarded, a little cranky and irritable. He frequently wrote, as he aged, about what he perceived as the shallowness of western culture. He makes passing curmudgeonly comments about much of what he sees. He criticizes his family, reports on arguments with Elizabeth.

I believe this biography must have contributed to the positive perception we have of him today. As biography I think it very good. Truman is always seen in the context of the times he lived in, so that McCullough writes him as a turn-of-the-century farmer, or a First World War soldier, or a Missouri politician. Biographies, such as this one, written to present the subject as a product and player in the history around him, will always be strong biographies. It seems merely good before Truman became president. Afterwards, because it becomes necessary to explain the dynamic of events, the book becomes impressive in the comprehensive narrations of the great events of the day and Truman's role in them. Here is the decision to use the atomic bomb, the initial confrontations with Stalin, the decision to send American ground units into Korea, and the relief of Douglas MacArthur as commander there. Throughout the book Truman is seen as a courageous and just leader of the free world, friend to almost everyone, the beacon of democracy in the world beginning to be threatened by an expansionist communism, loving husband and father, and a champion of every right for all Americans. This is a very approving biography of Harry Truman. But I wondered if the book wasn't too loaded with the positive. I know that his administration was frustrated in its truce negotiations with the communists in Korea and therefore its efforts to end the war. That phase of his presidency is criticized by many and considered a failure. Yet it doesn't even receive a mention by McCullough, and I wondered if other negatives, those I'm not familiar with, were also passed over.

Different historians come to such widely varying conclusions about the events, the personaHistory is slave to the perspectives of those who write it. Different historians come to such widely varying conclusions about the events, the personalities, and the lesson learned that the general reader can be, in the end, misled about the true historical meaning of a particular period. For that very reason I've come to think that the way to discover the truth, or an acceptable truth, is to simultaneously read more than one book on a subject. In the last couple of years, with all this in mind, I've read 2 great blocks of books on the Vietnam War. And plan a similar reading for later this year. This curiosity about the truth led me to read Quicksand by Geoffrey Wawro and this, Tyler's A World of Trouble, together. Not surprisingly, the books have different strengths. In my opinion, Wawro's is the better history--he's a highly regarded historian and writes a more far-reaching, rounder account of America's Middle Eastern diplomacy and actions in pursuit of that diplomacy. Tyler's chronicle reads much more like an extended editorial, though just as gripping. He reinforces the 2 main themes of Middle Eastern diplomacy since World War II, the western need for oil and the state of Israel. Both determine the energy of diplomacy in the region. How presidents walk the tightrope of maintaining the flow of cheap oil to the west while dealing with the resolution of the almost constant low-intensity warfare over the existence of Israel and the adjunct issue of founding a Palestinian state defines their success or failure. Most, Tyler says, have fumbled. He's very critical of the presidents, and in his view the mistakes snowball with the years and succeeding administrations, growing more menacing and damaging to the Middle East as a whole as well as America's interests. He's quick to point out Clinton's susceptibility to the distractions of scandal, Reagan's nonchalance and focus on the Soviet Union, Carter's indecisiveness, and Bush's total lack of understanding of the forces at work there. Every administration fails to heal the wounds and stop the bleeding. Maybe the present one.... Both these books on the Middle East are penetrating, comprehensive, and compelling--even dramatic--reads. And they come to the same basic conclusions so that I feel I've arrived at a degree of truth. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 18, 2010","Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3269058-a-world-of-trouble

Because that was a history of atomic research, the Manhattan Project, and the resulting bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I'd expected Dark Sun to be a history in a similar style. It's partly that; the record of how thermonuclear theory was developed into a weapon is only a piece of the huge story he tells. Dark Sun, continuing the history of nuclear arms begun with The Making of the Atomic Bomb, includes 2 important facets of the nuclear arms story: espionage and Soviet nuclear arms research. Large portions of the book are devoted to detailing how the Soviet Union obtained atomic weapons technology from persons within the Manhattan Project and how they'd begun their own development by the end of the war. The story of how they acquired that knowledge as well as the stories of the individuals responsible for the espionage makes for fascinating reading. Also a necessary part of the history is the evolution of Soviet nuclear weapons and testing. There are many surfaces to these complicated events, but Rhodes's grasp of them seems sure, from the political maneuverings of high-powered intellectuals within the scientific community to a history of the Cold War and the arms race to well-honed portraits of the major players involved at all levels. Because the chapters dealing with nuclear theory, bomb design, and fission were over my head, I was grateful they aren't the bulk of the book; I struggled with understanding in ways I didn't remember from my reading The Making of the Atomic Bomb. The most fascinating chapters of the book--the accounts of espionage and the Soviet research and development--aren't technical at all, and they make for gripping reading. For me, Rhodes covers the Cold War and arms race and the many tensions and scares resulting from them too briefly. But, as I say, it's a huge book as it is. I was surprised by many things: at how extensive Soviet atomic research was before the end of the war, for instance, and at how single-mindedly Curtis LeMay and the men around him tried to effect a preemptive war with the Soviets, and at how destructive thermonuclear weapons themselves are.

MacMillan doesn't say that. However, her book goes a long way toward explaining the different ways history can be perceived, how history is bent toward a particular viewpoint, or misunderstood, or ignored, or even blatantly fabricated. One of MacMillan`s great themes is that history means what we want it to mean. We--nations, governments--use it to our best advantage. The book`s too short. It`s like an outline. She`ll present an instance of how history is used--how authoritarian governments use it as a means of social control, say, or how it`s used to determine national boundaries--and then discuss in detail how those uses have occurred in recent history. The descriptions and analyses are fascinating and full of insight. And her thoughts on recent history move as clearly and precisely as a surgeon`s scalpel. The books ends with a powerful flourish, like a symphony. She describes the famous appeasement of Hitler in 1938 at Munich. Then she thouroughly discusses how that event was used as analogy in U. S. foreign policy decisions during the Cold War and after, how we, trying to avoid the same pitfall, used and abused history.

The book was published the year following his death. I asked myself if she were publishing a juicy and profitable expose. In the end, because she continued entries about Hughes almost 2 decades after the affair ended and wrote a moving account of his memorial and his place in English letters, I decided the book was mostly a caring portrait of the man. Her intentions, I came to believe, were purer than I'd originally thought. The entries themselves are marked by a self-consciousness, as if she notes her time with Hughes with a novelist's eye, knowing she's going to prepare it for publication. Her interpretation of Hughes is interesting. I admired her piling layer upon layer of portraiture to present him as a force of nature, a picture he would have liked.

I like it that the breadth and depth of it seems to attempt to tell it all rather than casting some new and unusual hook to bring him to the surface. It's as complete and definitive as we'll get for now. But it's unstartling, too. There are a couple of reasons for that, I think. First is that by now Cheever's bisexuality is well known. The second is that the book is very sympathetic to Cheever himself. This may be deservedly so, but Bailey deftly covers such topics as his alcoholism and his sometime indifference to his children so that they appear to have not affected or inconvenienced anyone, as they almost certainly must have. Perhaps the approach is correct. Arguably the best biography is one in which the author isn't decidedly critical of his subject. But then the subject's warts appear to have been caused by someone or something else. His relations with The New Yorker Magazine often disappointed Cheever, but Bailey--again, maybe rightly so--assigns blame to the orneriness of the magazine's editorial staff and none (or little) to Cheever himself. A better example is his marriage. Bailey's account of John's marriage to Mary surprised me. Reading Susan Cheever's book about her father, Home Before Dark, I'd gotten the impression Cheever mistreated Mary, but Bailey lays by far most of the blame for the dysfunction on her. Because the marriage was so unhappy for so long without either of them wishing to divorce, or at least not the long-suffering Cheever, I wonder if we're given the whole picture of the relationship. I would think that an alcoholic husband who lusted after other men and who openly boasted of affairs with other women--the actress Hope Lange, for instance--might at least occasionally be hard to live with. Bailey, however, doesn't pin any of the marriage's trouble on Cheever. In fact, he's often a little unkind to some of those around Cheever. Mary Cheever is only one target. The book suggests William Maxwell treated Cheever shoddily in behalf of The New Yorker. I thought some tensions with John Updike were blamed on Updike. As Bailey writes Hope Lange at the end of their relationship she wasn't even nice, too tired of him for simple politeness, though it's not related what stresses exhausted their affair. I've spent time on these items becuse they're important to me. But they don't detract from the portrait presented or the critiques of his work. For anyone interested in Cheever as man and writer, this is the book. Cheever lives here in his warmth, kindness and generosity to others. And his extraordinary talent. Reaching the end of a long biography like this, one signpost of success is if the reader is sad at the passing of a subject brought vividly to life. I was saddened because Bailey brought Cheever to me so completely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2011,"Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3992503-cheever

I thought it poorly written, and I found in it some of the most unusual use of punctuation I've ever come across. Mis-punctuation, I called it. The maps are so detailed with terrain features and lacking in graphic representation of military operations that they're not helpful at all, a serious fault in a book of military history. I tried hard to be contemputuous and dismissive of the author's emphasis on describing the Soviet experience in Afghanistan through the experiences of individuals rather than a more measured and studied presentation of facts and interpretation of military operations and political objectives. I tried to poof away Feifer's breezy skeleton of narration. I tried to throw the book across the room in a conscious imitation of Dorothy Parker. But the deeper into it I read the more interested I became. Feifer's book isn't a history of the military operations there. Though it touches on the military causes and effects during the course of the war, it's more an account of policy and international relations and societies, both Soviet and Afghan. Its picture is big. It's my opinion, though, that in telling the history of the war at this level Feifer needed to add more detail about the issues he believes profoundly affected the war, Soviet corruption, for instance, or the nature of Afghan tribal society. To pass over fundamental details such as these makes a book like this seem superficial. Despite all this, as I say, it's the first history of the conflict I'd read, and Feifer did touch all the bases, however lightly, and came, at last, to some interesting conclusions....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Apr 2010,"Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6080308-the-great-gamble

In terms of detailing the diplomatic, political, and military events of the war he succeeds. He offers narrative and a bald accounting of what happened. At times he's a bit too meticulous in trying to describe some aspects, trying, I thought, to capture every facet of of a particular part of the picture. The antiwar movement is an example, I thought, where he seemed too detailed, even writing about his own involvement while a student at Columbia. His careful listings of Nixon's machinations while trying to find a peace on his own terms at South Vietnam's expense as his own political position eroded was another. Prados's conclusions, entitled ""The Reasons Why,"" soars. He presents perspectives which are fresh and convincing. Never have I read that one of the reasons for the allies' lack of success was because South Vietnamese leaders failed to understand Americans and never tried to explain the Byzantine nature of Saigon's politics. It's also in this conclusion that Prados elucidates how the war was never winnable (he also makes clear why the people defining the policy and prosecuting the war couldn't see this--events not yet become history). These revolve around his argument that we were forced by a multitude of circumstances into policies and diplomacies and doctrines we thought we were controlling, only to find ourselves in an untenable position, in an unwinnable war. Only in the early days of the Kennedy administration could we have avoided defeat by avoiding deep commitment. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 29, 2009","Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6557179-vietnam

I wanted to find books which would not only discuss every dimension of Southern slavery but would also define my perspective. Hahn's book is the first I've finished. While it wasn't quite the general overview I was after, it still offered new things to see and different slants by which to see them. For instance, he writes of how, in response to the war generally and to the invasion of the South by the Union armies, slaves left their plantations to flee to areas occupied by them, encouraging Lincoln toward emancipation sooner than he'd intended. This and their willingness to fight for the Union in large numbers was a significant ingredient in the outcome of the war. And, says Hahn, as a result of this mass migration and rush to security toward Union lines and into their service, it could and should be considered by historians as the largest and most significant slave rebellion in history. Hahn also writes about Marcus Garvey, a man I'd never heard of until a few months ago. The appeal of his emigrationistic and nationalistic ideas and his Universal Negro Improvement Association were very influential and was the inspiration for the NAACP, the Nation of Islam, the Black Panthers, and black power in general.

The countries making up the second world are those caught between the stable and prosperous and those who're poor and unstable, the third world. Khanna says those second world countries will determine, through alliances, which of the big 3 power centers will dominate in the future. He's heavily influenced by Toynbee's ideas of how the west can identify and challenge geopolitical stresses to help develop adequate responses to what some see as the natural decline of the west. Khanna's world is a geopolitical marketplace--the U. S., E. U. and China are businesses, and whoever has the most satisfied customers will be the strongest. He's careful to point out that the current competition, if unmodified or unduluted, will result in war. Underlying it all, of course, is the end of the American empire. His message is that history happens, even to America. The Conclusion, in which he describes just how steep and rapid is America's decline, is sobering. This is an interesting book, cover to cover. The geopolitical issues and problems are serious, he says, especially for America. Their losses and missteps, particularly, are always to China's and Europe's advantage. The arguments are convincing. But in the end Khanna becomes a little shrill, his examples noted as indicators seem selective, mentioned only because they support his arguments. In writing about crime and prisons, for instance, he calls America a penal colony.

I was confused by the first part, Venice, unable to decide what he was trying to do. But almost immediately after beginning the 2d section, Varanasi, I began to form an understanding and saw that the novel soars. It seems to be about duality. And about transformation. Dyer has written the 2 parts as the 2 sides of a coin. Venice is about life, I think. Jeff, in Venice, proceeds from death, or at least stagnation, into life, steered by the remarkable woman he meets, Laura. Venice during the Biennale is one big party punctuated by graphically written, enviable sex. A sense of unreality pervades both sections. In Venice, as Jeff achieves life, it's represented most by the art. Varanasi, where the unreal is the society he's immersed in, is much different. There, Jeff Atman, a soul in Venice, becomes ""the consciousness we all share."" There in the frenzied life along the banks of the Ganges where the crematory ghats serve to celebrate death, in the miserable living conditions of the people in the streets, and in the general atmosphere of death itself, Jeff as we know him begins to dissolve, to merge into his environment. Exposure to the intense spiritual atmosphere around him coupled with a worsening illness gradually overcomes his identity. Everything about Varanasi, Jeff finally realizes, points toward death. Varanasi is marked by Zen-like koans or proverbs in which opposites seem to be the same thing. Jeff muses at one point that not knowing what to do is the same as knowing what to do. In fact, the novel ends with a similar and final dart of inscrutability: ""What is here is also there, and what is there is also here."" I think it's all part of Jeff's failure to complete tasks and projects, a feature of his visit to Venice, too. The difference is that in Venice the letting go is a sign of new freedom (energized by Laura Freeman), whereas Varanasi's loss of will and purpose relate to surrender.

Augustus Rose is a man involved in intelligence work who's tortured for what he knows. Interwoven in the narrative of how his adversaries extract the information Rose holds is the story of his life, particularly his love for a woman to whom he was once married. The novel contrasts a day and a night and a day of torture with a day and a night and a day of love. I don't read many novels I'd characterize as action novels. But this one describes the violence we sometimes associate with the arcane world of espionage. In one scene an execution is narrowly avoided by using brute force, and in another a character escapes those sent to kill him by shooting his way out. However, it's also an espionage novel with philosophical ambitions. In writing about torture he has much to say about the moral arguments surrounding its use and its effectiveness. His writing about love focuses on the importance of tenderness and honesty, whether with prostitute or wife. Duncan brings the two together in his character Augustus Rose, pain and love woven into a whole whose seams can be explored as weaknesses later used to pull it apart.

Reading, I kept reining in my impatience by reminding myself the earlier volume was about motherhood and her daughter, Claire, while the heart of Unmentionables is a 13-poem cycle about kudzu. Wonderful stuff, but...kudzu? Poems about something as dull yet persistently hardy as kudzu do demonstrate her skills and strengths, and it helps place her in the heart of the South. And show that there's a rod of steel hidden in her own heart of gentleness. I think my own romantic inclinations help to make these poems work. But each of them carries the urgency of the kudzu she's courageous enough to write about. The leafy spill of words seductively clings and covers the reader with elegance. I'm in love with this woman. I am in LOVE with this woman....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 16, 2009","Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2028527.Unmentionables

At aWriting about Ashbery, John Updike took note of how prolific he is and how easily he seems to sit at his work to turn out poetry of this quality. At almost 1000 pages there's a lot of poetry here, and it's difficult. The poet himself has stated he thinks of a poem as a kind of environment to be inhabited. I think that's right in that you have to enter the individual Ashbery poem. You have to step inside and pull these poems around you. Most are very subtle. There are few hammer blows of epiphany. There aren't many electric jolts making ideas and vision sharp. Ashbery is slant intelligence and language like a house of mirrors. This was a slow read for me, taking slightly over a year. There are some rewards. It's like panning for gold....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2009","Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3484331-collected-poems-1956-1987

This is a great way to present poetry, by offering a poem a day by a collection of poets from an assortment of times and traditions, from Chaucer to young contemporary poets so fresh their ink is still drying. And day after day that variety and newness adds fun to my reading. I try to get to the day's poem as early as I can because sometimes these poems provide an affirmative quality and ways of seeing that give shape and tone to the rest of the day. My favorites here are by a couple of young poets I don't know, Amy Witting and Paul Farley. Another favorite is a lovely Charles Bukowski poem about his cat.

I'd put it off so long because at 856 pages of criticism it seemed such a monumental reading commitment. Having finished it today I'm alternatively kissing my hands and arms for being discerning enough to want to read it and slapping my wrist for waiting so long. I'm an Updike fan, one of what I sometimes feel is a dwindling population. I believe a handful of his novels are astonishingly fine examples of fiction. His short stories are, across the board and the years of his career, exemplary, as good as can be found. But this collection of his critical pieces has reinforced what I'd long suspected, or knew subconsciously, that his criticism is as strong as any being written today. He died recently, and at that time some wrote that he was surpassed in the field only by Edmund Wilson. I believe that. This volume is more than book s. It also contains general essays on literature and past masters of fiction, essays on current social issues, comments on film, art, photography, and religion. He even has interesting things to say about lust, a subject dear to everyone. The choice of subject matter veers in an arc wide enough to include the cosmic concerns of Melville and the racial tone of cartoons and cartoon characters of the 1930s. This is a ripe, lush crop of wise writing about literature, art, and culture, and it's studded with a spendid harvest of aphorisms. And, as always, Updike gives us all this in his gorgeous prose style.
