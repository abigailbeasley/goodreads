A priest who – I’m not sure if 'self-loathing' is the right term – is struggling with It’s 1930s Mexico, and we follow an ‘outlaw’ priest on the run. A priest who – I’m not sure if 'self-loathing' is the right term – is struggling with his belief that he is a bad priest.The internal struggles of a Catholic Priest's heart and mind, which to me seem fairly pointless, as they appear to be self-imposed, and also the internal conflicts created by religion such as witnessed here, is something I have little interest in. A couple of hundred pages of this was painful. I now understand Greene converted to Catholicism in the late 1920s. I have also learned that his books seem to be classified into two genres. First, the entertainment, suspense novels, and second, the more literary type, such as this work dealing with matters of faith. Note to self: I must remember to avoid the latter like the plague.However, I didn’t want this drab affair to go to waste as the history is fascinating, albeit terribly violent. Mexico during this period was destroying churches and shooting priests to move towards a secular society. Alcohol was also banned. Tens of thousands of people on both sides (Government and Christian) sadly died during this conflict. So, it was interesting from a historical perspective.My fascination came after reading this book. I had no relationship with any of the characters, and I found the plot a tad diffuse.

This book has been described as a piece of Dark Fiction - if that is indeed a genre, and it represents a spectrum, let’s say this little bundle of joy inhabits the really horrific, dark, murderous and sick end of that spectrum.The narrator lives in the Southern California State Asylum for the Criminally Insane – he has no hands because he, quite simply, chopped them off. His two-handed cell-mate is his scribe. The narrator creates a relationship with the reader immediately, he even apologises for introducing us to this journey of insanity. He warns us, the madness conveyed in this collection of twisted stories is CONTAGIOUS. Yeah, yeah – I hear you say – BUT there was a moment late in the book, where I was attending a séance hosted by our narrator – and I did indeed feel the chill down my spine as he ‘talked’ to me. It was at 1am admittedly, but yikes!!!The various POVs of each story (don’t worry our narrator drops in now and then to keep us on his miserable track), are again, unique, dark and at times violently depraved. We follow the misfortunes of a prostitute, criminals, a child living in some sort of crack-house whose best friend is a TV, I think – the devil himself even drops in, and so many more reprobates.I won’t pretend to understand everything here, it’s not just the content it’s the pace, it’s relentless, and it’s complex. The author is so clever, he changes format and style throughout. We even have poem titles “The Definition of Insanity”, and chapters that read like the Bible – or a variation of it. There’s even a really clever transcript of an interview between an asylum doctor, who later took his own life, and a leader of one of the cults of the asylum concerned. The pages really did look like a photocopied typewriter written interview – even with images of the paperclips at the top of the page. Wow – authentic.There’s not much joy here but reading this book and my experience was visceral. The author, Jarelle Phillips, is a star. Up and coming, and remarkably unique and shocking, but wickedly clever. I’m gonna stalk you and your books Jarelle Phillips – you deserve it!!5 StarsMany thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my ....more",Notes are private!,40,68,1,"Feb 21, 2024","Feb 26, 2024","Feb 21, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/179959262-the-madness

First person narrator, June Hayward is a struggling author, and the self-absorbed, jealous friend of Athena Liu – a very successful and beautiful author (in every way). This is not a spoiler because it happens first up – June witnesses the death of Athena, as she chokes on a pancake after a night out.June then discovers a completed hard copy of Athena’s next novel, a historic fiction set in WWI. You can guess what happens next. I listened to the audiobook. The narrator was fantastic. She made this very good story even better. Her whining, narcissistic, defensive, self-justifying voice was a pleasure to listen to – it fit the character of June Hayward perfectly.This story also provided great insight into the intricacies of the publishing industry. The editors, agents, publishers, sensitivity ers, marketing etc etc. It really makes one wonder (a) how an author survives the process and (b) how a book gets published at all.This story also spends time taking a satirical look at social media and its terrible impact on people who are hounded (justifiably or not) on platforms such as X.There’s also great insight into culture and race in publishing. I really liked this, I’ll miss listening to the narrator of June every day, as hysterical and self-absorbed the character was.

I just wasn’t sure, murder mysteries sometimes disappoint. This one didn’t. It’s funny, lively, and engaging. A bright adventure indeed. The Thursday Murder Club consists of four intrepid ‘oldies’ living in a well-to-do retirement village. Ron, Joyce, Ibrahim, and the fascinating and ever so mysterious Elizabeth. They meet to ‘solve’ old/cold cases every week. Elizabeth has ‘contacts and sources’ able to provide information on crimes and criminals. This story presents this quartet of sleuths with a cluster of real murders to solve in real time. This is when the fun starts. This author has a knack of keeping the story moving at a nice pace, with interesting characters. Some despicable.He also injects humour that had me laughing. Love it!One other thing I liked was the politics involved in residential villages for retired people. It reminded me of the time my parents lived in one. I reckon managing such a facility with its residents would be no walk in the park!!!! The residents can be a tricky bunch.

Why? The book is oThe Byzantine Empire by: A Complete Overview of The Byzantine Empire History from Start to Finish by Eric Brown is a heroic effort. Why? The book is only fifty pages and covers a period from the fall of the Western Roman Empire (in 500 CE) to the fall of the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire in Constantinople in 1453 CE. That is a lot of time, a lot of wars, it involves countless emperors – and there is skullduggery on every page (almost). So, the action here comes at you think and fast. It is also confusing – but the presentation here is as straight forward as you can get. But you need to strap in.I listened to this on the audio version, perhaps the hard copy has maps and timelines – I don’t know. I reckon that may help.This is a good introduction. Also, it may be something to keep on hand when reading more detailed studies. So, if you have had your fill of Romulus and King Superbus from the Republican period, Augustus, Nero, and Hadrian from the Imperial period – you may want to dip your toe into the Byzantine period, this is a good introduction book for you.Health Warning: As well as staying hydrated, looking after your gut biome, getting plenty of sleep and eating well – do not, I REPEAT, do not, read this in conjunction with other Byzantine material..I made this mistake of trying a total immersion treatment on this topic. I read this book at the same time as listening to a Byzantine podcast and reading a Byzantine book. All moving at different chronologies.

She’s been part of our television landscape for over 40 years. My first experience of Liz was watching the Today show on Channel 9 every morning in the 1980s. Morning TV was new and a bit exciting back then – for me anyway, and presumably others. After many years working on the Today show, Liz then worked for Australia's 60 Minutes, then after many years she had her own Investigative TV show.I feel she’s always been around, I like her. She’s pleasant, knows her stuff, can do ‘light and fluffy’, but also can make a subject squirm if required.This memoir covers Liz’s childhood and family life in regional New South Wales and details of her personal life. But most of the memoir covers her work – including the hundreds of people she has interviewed over the decades. From superstar musicians to serial killers. Also, she describes many of the hundreds of locations she has worked throughout the world – she and her various crews have been everywhere. I loved this and found the whole thing relatable because I've watched much of her work.The writing was wonderfully conversational too.Great stuff, Liz.

This is one major take away from this clever book - The Echo Chamber, by John Boyne.The Cleverley family (great name), consist of:George: A National Treasure…….(quote: George Cleverley), the father of the family has worked for the BBC for decades as a light entertainment presenter. He is a household name and much loved. He is having trouble with the new terminology, and etiquettes required in the modern world. There are millions ready to pounce on the likes of him when he errs, and err he does. Oh, he is having an affair.Beverley: Has a nice ring doesn’t it…..Beverley Cleverley? Mum is also partaking in extra-marital activities. Her marriage to George lacks the passion of years gone by. She is quite frankly a snob and would shudder at the thought of catching a bus and mingling with the great unwashed masses of London.Nelson: The oldest brother. Now this boy is an odd specimen. He feels more comfortable wearing costumes in his daily life, than not. He wears Scrubs, police uniforms and more. This invariably gets him into trouble as he goes about his daily business. He is a teacher – and is bullied by most. Nelson takes social awkwardness to World-class levels.Elizabeth: The middle sibling, she is uber-active on social media. Elizabeth enjoys using anonymous handles on social media – such as @TruthIsASword, so she can abuse with gay abandon. Obtaining a Twitter blue tick is a life-time goal hers. Elizabeth’s boyfriend, Wilkes, is a social warrior who doesn’t wash – I found him revolting and hilarious. The family could smell him well before he entered a room, oh and his underpants…….don’t get me started!!Achilles: Perhaps the most detestable of the family – even though they all seem to adore him. He will think nothing of extorting a few grand from middle aged men. He is charismatic and gorgeous – just ask him. There is one other cast member who needs a mention, a tortoise called Ustym Karmaliuk. Beverley is babysitting her Ukrainian lover’s pet as he needs to go back home to well……..put it about a bit. Ustym made my heart melt – poor thing.So back to my opening paragraph. This book and the grubby characters of the Cleverley family inflicted considerable pain on themselves, with consummate ease. But, on top of that – humankind, as a collective, with the creation of all consuming social media and easy to obtain cellular phones, has made it even easier for us to exact damage on each other and ourselves.There are some salient messages in this book, all while providing the reader with a great laugh. It is a wonderful, witty, ultra-sharp, satire on contemporary life, the power of the masses and cancel culture. It is also a wee bit scathing of aspects of wokeness. I feel so lucky to have read this. Oh, and John Boyne has written heaps of books, and this is my first. Happy Days ahead.5 StarsWoke: Aware, especially of social problems such as racism and inequality.Self-disclosure: I am happy to be woke, using this Cambridge Dictionary definition my value systems fit very snugly within these words. I suppose the question is – how far do ‘we’ go?...more",Notes are private!,57,83,1,"Jan 22, 2024","Jan 29, 2024","Jan 21, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57638052-the-echo-chamber

The male was a communist – a political persuasion not to the liking of Il Duce. We then follow the family for three generations in Buenos Aires. Following the woman’s death in 2001, her granddaughter attends the funeral and moves into the home left to her by her grandmother. This story draws parallels in the lives of grandmother and granddaughter.We learn about familial stories involving sexual violence, homosexuality, misogyny and betrayals of trust. This is grim reading, and the art reflects this. There is a dark foreboding displayed in the artwork here – minimal colours used, characters have large bodies and small heads, there are menacing shadows, fleas and no joy. I felt it suffocating.There is certainly generational grief going on – keeping in mind the grandparents moved to Argentina during a violent time in history, and in 2001 Argentina was experiencing one of its economic slumps. Life is hard.The only issues I had with this work was the writing was sometimes difficult to read, even magnified, the cursive was tricky to decipher. I also found the transition between timelines confusing at times.But overall, this was a worthwhile read that sustained my attention throughout.

It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body”?There’s no body. What would you do? I’d call the cops, then go home, and make myself a cup of tea, have a biscuit and put on the TV. It would be the shortest book in the world, boring too. So, thank God our narrator, and old lady called Vesta, didn’t do that – as now we have a story on our hands.Vesta, a widow – her husband died of cancer, is our narrator and she moved to a small rural place following the death of her husband. A place by a lake – sounds nice. Upon finding the note, she becomes a wee bit obsessed with trying to figure out this whodunit. But this isn’t a usual murder/mystery, what we get are the internal workings of Vesta’s mind as she trowels through theories of who this “Magda” might be and how she was done in. But, we also see Vesta’s mind unravel and obsess about her life and regrets. Her thoughts become more erratic as the novel progresses, and it seems clear she is descending into some sort of madness.At first I didn’t know where this story was heading, as it seemed we were focussing on this internal narrative of our main character. After about a third of the novel, I realised what was going on, and I was strapped in for the ride, and found it interesting enough to continue.This is not your normal whodunnit, far from it.

This group is my balm, my safe place, full of kind clever people with interesting stuff to say.On a personal level, my first whole year of retirement could have been more relaxing – mostly due to house issues, leaking ceiling (upstairs bathroom), internal renovations, solar unit – lots of workmen making me feel totally inadequate. There is something really intimidating about a young man with a tool belt saying “Hello” on a humid Tuesday morning. Oh yes, this year, I was finally discharged from my oncologist, five years post treatment – that IS remission. I AM happy.My worst experience this year on that count was standing in line at an auto shop, wanting to buy jumper leads for a car. I was sure I was prepared (car make, model, number of cylinders, colour), I got to the front – I asked the young girl for a set of jumper leads, she looked at me (sensed the panic) and with a steely eyed look asked “what type?”. It was then I ceremoniously shat myself, an accompaniment to the sniggers of the ‘handy types’ standing behind me. THAT’s PRESSURE!!I enjoyed 48, 5-star reads this year of around a 100. That’s a lot – too generous? I reckon if it blows your socks off – don’t hold back – TELL THE WORLD!My top 5 books for the year (so hard) – in a very particular order:1.

Oryx and Crake by Margaret AttwoodHonourable MentionsAussie legend, Colleen McCullough (Thorn Birds, the Roman Grass Crown series – OMFG) and Alan Partridge for the laughs.Study for Obedience by Sarah Bernstein - possibly my favourite book, but Jesus it was hard work because (a) It was hard work and (b) I had to drag two, antagonistic buddy readers to the finish line (you know who you are) ...more",Notes are private!,130,163,1,"Dec 26, 2023","Dec 26, 2023","Dec 20, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/62316199-2023-on-goodreads

Asia Challenges Africa’s Stronghold on the Birthplace of Humanity. You get the picture? It is all good stuff. However, I expected something a little more substantial. In my mind, this is more like pop-science. I have no reason to doubt the veracity of the statements made by the author here. Who am I to do that? This reads a bit like Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, but it is not as entertaining and certainly not as funny.Having said all of that - this would be a good addition sitting on most coffee tables.3 Stars...more",Notes are private!,46,58,1,"Jan 09, 2024","Jan 21, 2024","Dec 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40180034-close-encounters-with-humankind

When one listens to right-wing, conservative commentators on ‘shows’ like Fox News, or Sky News in Australia (go on, you know you want to.......), one would think LGBTQ+ issues have the future of our planet in their hands. When millions are starving, hundreds of thousands at war, the planet on the boil – a trans swimmer trying to get into the Olympic team, or teaching kids at school about trans and intersex issues spells the end of time, as we know it.This book puts us into the skin, the mind and body of an hermaphrodite, intersex kid called Calliope. Calliope is raised as a girl, has XY sex chromosomes, but her testes have not descended, and her clitoris is larger than ‘usual’. The reason I suggest ‘intolerants’ should read this is, to help them understand how difficult it is for people (young people) to deal with such issues. If this five hundred plus page story does not do that – then there is no hope.But it is far more than just a book on ‘trans’ people – it is a sweeping family saga covering three generations from the war-torn city of Smyrna in Eastern Turkey to Detroit in the USA. It is wonderful historical fiction, covering the Greece/Turkey conflict - as old as the ages, immigrants and their challenges and life in an industrial city like Detroit.Eugenides writes with no great fanfare, he describes the complexities of life and relationships with ease. He throws in comedic moment - because, let's face it, life can be funny. Very funny. But, I feel he also knows he is telling us a very important story. He does that indeed.What a book, what an epic, what an author. One of my favourites - I need to construct my all-time top ten in 2024.

A couple of feet high, looks like a panda, or a mole, or a crow (there are other types). You buy one for a few hundred euros, you take it home and charge it. It has three wheels on its base, some have appendages like wings, they all have eyes – and in my minds eye, they look a bit cute. If you buy one of these you’re called a keeper. But you can’t control it.Another person, perhaps sitting in a room in another country purchase the licence/software for your device and taps into your kentuki. This person is then able to control your kentuki, they don’t know you and vice versa. They start moving the kentuki, looking through the eyes of your kentuki and even making adorable noises. There is no other obvious way to communicate. The person ‘inhabiting’ your kentuki is a dweller. In effect you have a stranger roaming around your home.Some keepers get very attached to their kentukis, they love them like pets and everything is cosy. Also, some dwellers, have a whale of a time – they get to see another part of the world, experience the life of someone living in a different country. Happy days.If you’re reading this  – what would you rather be a kentuki keeper or a dweller. Please choose one. If I had to choose, as both have their issues – I’d probably be a keeper.This offering by the clever Samanta Schweblin is a riveting read. Chapters are titles as locations (e.g. Beijing – Lyon). Indicating the location of the keeper and the dweller. We follow the stories of the kentukis, dwellers and keepers throughout the book.Believe me, I became very attached to a couple of these bloody kentukis. To the point of feeling distraught when one was mistreated, even worse when one died. I was also horrified when a dweller ‘had’ to witness something terrible, imagine that!! Made all the worse because of the difficulty to make contact. This was book offers one helluva a ride.This is a play on social media and the blurring of our personal boundaries when communicating with those we don’t know, this never happens on Goodreads of course, because we all love each other and are all sound people. But, there are dark places and dodgy people on-line as we know (including the occasional ‘Goodreader’ of course), they’re everywhere. The level of interaction and observation offered by kentukis offers something new, something more intimate. It’s also not regulated. How come us humans are so good at implementing new things and then we scramble to regulate the nefarious impacts of these initiatives? Vaping and online gambling come to mind.I have read only one of Schweblin’s books before, Fever Dream (5 Stars!), that was also an emotional experience, scary. Review here Fever Dream.

A great way to complete this selection. 5 stars.If you’ve ever experienced anxiety, you know this - The anxiety that pulled his throat towards his stomach, the author must’ve experienced every miserable malady available to humankind – because her descriptions of them are spot-on.One of these stories involved a man seeing a massage therapist following trauma. The description of his sessions was an exact description of my sessions back in the day, even including the spontaneous sobbing (that I didn’t know was even there), Amazing writing.Another personal experience with this collection: I dream about my dad a lot since he died. I love him like no other, we were best mates. But my dreams are always bad, we argue and fight, and it’s horrible – again Schweblin must’ve known I was going to read this with her “The pain that stiffened him and terrified him in his dreams, the pain that tied him to his father and to his own image in the mirror, the yellow pain”.OMG – I love this author. I don’t know what it is, but every time I read one of her works she smacks me in the stomach. This is what reading is all about.My overall experience with this collection is 5 Stars Average story rating 3.47368 starswith a measurement of uncertainty of 3.5% and a biological variation of 4.6%.

The main character is never named. He is extremely wealthy, deriving his money from dubious means – exploiting Chinese people, and believes he is entitled to a long vacation in Europe. So, he and his family board a steamer and head across the Atlantic for the treats of the Mediterranean. If your are bit a fan of too much descriptive writing this might not be for you. However, in this story it really worked. The author painted a vivid picture of the opulence available to first class passengers on the ship, I felt as if I was watching a movie. This luxury was made more blatant by the contrast of conditions suffered by the crew – waiters, deckhands and people working in the engine room. All slaving away to fatten up the rich.There is a mood of impending dread in this story. The author drops dark hints along the way, as our bloated protagonist is depicted as an unsavoury sort. Apart from the way he gained his wealth, he possessed a latent lecherous bent. He thought he may have had a chance with attractive young women on the trip, keep in mind this bloated oaf is nearing sixty. Once they arrive in Naples, it all seems a bit of a let-down – it is miserable, he and his family are not happy. He argues with his wife and his daughter is unwell. When they go to Capri, same thing – all a bit miserable, he also has derogatory thoughts about the rusticity of the women there.Anyway, that is enough from me – as things get interesting and I do not want to spoil it. I did find it interesting the author mentioned Emperor Tiberius, it is also interesting Capri is where Tiberius committed his deviant acts, with little children, all beyond the prying eyes of those in Rome. I do not think Tiberius’ dishonourable mention is an accident, it only adds to the grim mood.Fascinating stuff, it is only fourteen pages – and well worth it.

There is no need to detail the too-Japan’s Holocaust by Bryan Mark Rigg provides a forensic account of the atrocities committed by Japan during WWII. There is no need to detail the too-numerous accounts presented in this book, safe to say – they are horrific. The author presents reasons for these atrocities. Japanese society was racist, militaristic and they possessed an absolute devotion to Emperor Hirohito. This belief in their Emperor was total, his line was said to have over 2,000 years of unbroken lineage to the Sun Goddess. The author also describes the violent culture behind such practices as ritualistic suicide and attritional warfare. The Imperial Japanese Army was obsessed with degrading anyone who did not share their beliefs. Atrocities against civilians, POWS and rape against women and children were the norm. The Rape of Nanking being the most notorious. I was astonished by the never ending and unbelievably brutal violence, both in scale and type, committed against defenceless, innocent people protected by international law. The number of references cited by the author was very high, 1564 in total. In my view it was unbelievable Hirohito escaped the death penalty during the Japanese war crime trials. He lived until 1989, as Emperor and he even opened the 1964 Tokyo Olympics! The author presents an argument to suggest the dropping of the two atom bombs by the USAF saved many lives, as terrible as those weapons are the death toll would have been significantly more if the Allies would have had to invade Japan and its Islands. The Japanese belief in attritional warfare, their unwillingness to surrender and the practice of suicide (troops and their own citizens) when defeat is imminent, would have made sure of that. There is a massive message here – we must call out, act on and be aware of the absurdity and danger of all forms of fundamentalism.[image]Hirohito – the grandfather of the current Emperor, NiruhitoHirohito fits comfortably in the same company as Hitler, Stalin and Mao Zedong.5 Stars (I upgraded my original rating on reflection)Many thanks to NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my ....more",Notes are private!,15,53,1,"Dec 15, 2023","Dec 24, 2023","Dec 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/194574831-japan-s-holocaust

Some stories were interesting, one or two tugged on the heart strings, many were skippable. No room for Lassie though?Each story was accompanied by artwork, which wasn’t that impressive. But to be fair, the author here seems to have a few other “…………., who changed the world” books, and this visual style seems to be the theme. I would prefer photos. However, it’s probably not that type of book. It’s one for sitting on a coffee table (or in my case the toilet, not in it, in the room) requiring the occasional ‘flick through’ rather than to be read like a novel.However, it’s a hardcover, looks nice and is worthy of consideration for all of us dog lovers.3 StarsPUPDATE!!!

We are plummeted into what must have been one of the darkest periods of human history. Not just because of the plague, terrible enough as it was, but because of the suffocating amount of superstition and ignorance. Let me just clarify, ignorance in the sense of not knowing about a certain thing or unusual event is fine, but creating fairy tales to explain such phenomena drives me nuts – so specifically, let’s say, witchcraft (burn her!!!!) and various flavours of dogmatic religious beliefs and practices drove me bananas. Still does.Anna Frith is the main character here and she is a widower living in Derbyshire in the 1600s. Her small town is hit by the bubonic plague. This terrible disease with a mortality rate around 40-60% or closer to 100% if left untreated. This disease provides for an excruciating death, as the bacteria Yersinia pestis explodes into the bloodstream causing fatal septicaemias (there are other forms too – such as pneumonias and more). One notable feature is the appearance of grotesque bulbous protrusions on one’s body, often erupting and causing all sorts of unsightly and painful deaths.[image]People are dropping like flies. The descriptions provided by the author are graphic and grim. I found this part of the story interesting, as it provided a taste of what life might have been like. There are various characters we can hate (like Anna’s dad) and characters we can love, like our narrator - Anna.However, towards the end of the story a few things happened that rocked my bubonic world. I did not expect some of these occurrences, in fact, I thought they were a little unlikely, unusually so. It was all a bit unsettling.I was also a little perturbed by the first-person narrative of Anna. She often used words like “shit,” which did not work for me, as (even stated in the book) people could be put in the stocks and have rotten carrots thrown at them for swearing. Her narrative was a bit too modern, it lacked authenticity.This was a bit disappointing as this is a worthwhile topic. Particularly considering our recent experiences with our own pandemic. But it did make me think – if COVID-19 had the same mortality rate as the plague or say the Ebola virus, we all would have been having entirely different conversations – those of us who were left.2 Stars...more",Notes are private!,48,72,1,"Dec 04, 2023","Dec 09, 2023","Dec 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1022970.Year_of_Wonders

Beagin’s offering is certainly in my top three reads of this year, I loved it. Greta is a transcriber for a sex therapist in a small town. The audio files are sent to Greta, and she performs her work, usually in her underwear, at home. She takes a particular interest in one of the therapist’s clients – a woman Greta calls “Big Swiss”. Greta imagines Big Swiss (she is from Switzerland) as a stunning woman with a massive presence. Big Swiss is a 28-year-old gynaecologist, she loves dogs but has never had an orgasm, she is married to a wealthy man in town. Greta is forty-five, she is also a dog lover and lives in a shared home which is a bit of a shambles. For example, there is a bee hive inside the house and the old place is falling apart. Her mother suicided when Greta was a girl. Greta has also shed as many responsibilities as possible – she yearns for a simple life.Anyone can see that Greta was not a horse person. Her hair was not long enough, and neither were her teeth, and as a child, she had not been mistreated by other childrenI found myself constantly surprised by the acerbic humour littered throughout this book, it made me laugh and often shocked me, not in a bad way – but in a guffawing, losing my nasal contents type of way. People age horrible. They suffer strokes. Their bodies and brains fall apart. But the male ego? Firmly intact until the bitter end.The transcripts of the sessions between the therapist and Big Swiss are fascinating, explicit, and often funny. I could not get enough of being a fly on the wall here – that is terrible isn’t it? But I loved it.Big Swiss and Greta meet at a dog park – and things kick off. This is an ideal group or buddy read book – I can imagine pro-Big Swiss readers, throwing muffins at Greta fans, and vice versa. There is a lot to digest here, lots of sides to take.Okay, this is important, this book is not all beer and skittles. It has some horrible violence and covers control and power in relationships.

Often disturbing, sometimes frustrating and occasionally funny. It’s a satire on life in a southern US town, a town where nothing much really happens, a depressing place of no ambition or joy.Mr Bobby Pickens, a middle-aged dude living alone in the family home, has his world disrupted by his brother – a good looking, ‘aspiring actor’ with a six pack and a sometime crook. His brother, F.X., decides to set up shop at Mr Pickens’ (the author uses this title throughout) joint, following his release from prison. This is a shock to Mr Pickens as he thought the house was left to him, to him alone, by his parents. F.X. comes with a VERY LARGE footprint – causing no end of stress for Mr Pickens. Mr Pickens works at a local store called Sonny Boy, managed by a tight-fisted, petty man, called Mr Randy. A salesgirl works there, and Mr Pickens has a crush on her – she is many years his junior, Antoinette is her name. But there’s also another woman in town called Burma, who seems to hold a flame in her heart for the hapless Mr Pickens. However, Burma has a fiancée called Emmet. Emmet would be the dullest tool in this toolbox – and that’s saying something!!!Mr Pickens had a spot on his back, on the shape of New Jersey, diagnosed as malignant by the lab……….referred to as ‘back cancer’ later in the book.There’s a smattering of other flat-lining small-town characters here, many religious (Baptists), who create drama in this story devoid of plot. ”Bobby, do you think you drink too much?”“I guess so.”“And we’re Baptists.”“Modern Baptists can drink. It’s only stuffed shirts like Dr McFlug who don’t.”“Well, I guess I’m a modern Baptist, then. Wanna get drunk?”I haven’t visited a southern small town in the US, but this book does create a unique feel – it is relentless in creating an aura of hopelessness. I have visited many and lived in some, small towns in rural Australia – so I get the feeling. You, know – shops boarded up in the main street, no jobs, small town gossip.There is fun to be had here – that’s if you like laughing at the misfortunes of others. This is something I can do – in the world of fiction of course. But this kind of hopelessness can also be funny in real life stories – providing no animals or small children are hurt.This is good fun and will give your emotions (good and bad) a bit of a kick up the bum – worth a try.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,26,43,1,"Nov 22, 2023","Nov 28, 2023","Nov 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/134209595-modern-baptists

I found a recent interview with Mendoza, and I found this quote of hers interesting:”In poetry, the dream is to be able to live off your work.

I’m an infiltrator, and it’s win-win: I get to do poetry, but now I also get royalties. And I get to make people who say they don’t read poetry, read poetry. It’s my dream and poetry’s dream"".……………..well Mendoza got this klutz to read poetry. She got me there!!This was so hard – not because it’s not good, because some passages, pages, sections had me transfixed. But because, I didn’t understand too much of it and spent considerable time confused. I needed a solid, defined narrative here – and it wasn’t there.I am sure this book would be a delight and mentally stimulating to someone who is a far better reader than I am – a more educated reader, and person with quals in literature, or an academic.

It is pre-WWII, and Miss Brodie is leading a group of six ten-year old girls. She is unconventional and doesn’t adopt the rigid learning protocols of the time. Instead, Miss Brodie employs a style based on telling stories, including stories of her own travels, romances even, and she attempts to inspire, by encouraging the girls to learn from history, romanticism, and the classics. Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she is mine for lifeArt is greater than science. Art comes first, then scienceThese methods are at odds to the Scottish school system, and the school’s headmistress Miss Mackay. In fact, Miss Mackay drops into Miss Brodie’s classes at random intervals in what seems to be an attempt to catch out this radical young teacher. Alas, to no avail – however, her attempts to find evidence of Miss Brodie’s unusual methods and personal life (to dismiss her) become more sophisticated as time goes on. She eventually does this to the point of attempting to discover aspects of her love-life with male teachers at the school by engaging the services of one or two of the girls – the “Brodie Set”.[image]Maggie Smith and 2/3 of the ‘Brodie Set’ in the 1969 movieBrodie is interesting because she is a character I was originally sympathetic to. However, as time progressed, there was something about her that made me uncomfortable. She did control the girls to an extent I thought was more about her than the girls. There seemed to be a certain, selfishness about her – parts of her personality that were a bit ‘off’. She even said the girls were ‘lucky’ to have her, as she was ‘in her prime’ – wow!Miss Brodie also had positive things to say about pre-war Mussolini and even pre-war Hitler (she did travel to these countries). But, reflecting on this – she wouldn’t have been the only one, at that time. Miss Brodie also had love interests with two male teachers at the school, all good – nothing wrong with that (unless you’re Miss Mackay) but it was Miss Brodie’s actions towards this later in the book I found inappropriate and totally unbelievable. The message for me in this story relates to the incredible impact teachers and other adults can have on young impressionable kids, they can be, and often are, life changing. I’m talking about non-parents here – as the result of parental influence is obvious.Did I enjoy this? If it wasn’t such a short piece I would have probably DNF’d. I am glad I didn’t because there were some surprises in the latter third. But I didn’t enjoy the young girl chitter, chatter, but I did find the life of Miss Brodie interesting in part.

She's a mother of two and her husband, Roger, is a decent diligent Government employee. They live in a ‘well-to-do’ area of London and seem to be ‘living the life.’One evening an old female friend of Phyllis sends over her twenty-something son to Phyllis and Roger’s for dinner. This young man, Nicholas, is an opinionated, arrogant, brash part of the new breed of young politically active gang emerging at this time in the UK.Later in the night, Nicholas kisses Phyllis. This awakes some previously hidden desires in Phyllis, and she needs to make some life-changing decisions that not only impact her, but those around her.This is a wonderful study of late 1960s London. The hot mess of conservative post-war people who lived through WWII, and the new generation who seem intent on questioning and protesting about everything. But, for me, this is really a book about relationships (it is a Hadley after all) and the decisions we make, and more importantly the life-changing consequences of these decisions. Most of us will have something to relate to in this story. For me, there was a great deal to reflect on – and I found this experience quite profound. How much freedom should we have in a relationship? Does total freedom mean indifference? For me, indifference is analogous to ‘not caring’? How do two individuals balance this out?In some ways relationships are a recipe for disaster, new relationships even more so. The trail of events in this story needs to be read to be believed.Phyllis is such an interesting character and gave me a great insight into the way this woman ticked. The other characters aren’t quite as well developed as Phyllis (thanks Jennifer!), and I found the last couple of chapters things became a little crazy and it seemed to finish in a bit of a rush. But it is still a 5-star read for me, as it was jam-packed with relevant and relatable themes and events.Many thanks to Jennifer, who was a wonderful buddy-reader. She asked me lots of questions and I loved that, she also shared her perspectives in a way that questioned my own beliefs and prejudices, and that’s good too.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,44,57,1,"Feb 26, 2024","Mar 06, 2024","Nov 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57992949-free-love

The couple, Topper and Sanya, flee to Miami to set up a safer, better life. In time, the couple have two boys – Delano, the eldest and Trelawny, the main character. There are eight stories here, all inter-related but non-consecutive. All involve the extreme challenges faced by immigrant families in the US. The author presents raw accounts of alienation, discrimination, violence, family breakdown and poverty. My word if life isn’t hard enough. It makes one wonder how some people living these lives keep going. Perhaps many don’t. Also, relationships can experience difficulties at the best of times, but these people have so many struggles just finding a home, a job, food, and some security – no wonder marriages don’t last. It makes one want to cry. Not from pity, but the abject hopelessness of this situation.Take Trelawney for example, such a decent boy. He loved reading, he was considerate and quiet – his father took these qualities as weaknesses. But this boy, just wanted to, and strived to be a productive human being. Thwarted at every turn. How many times was he asked – “what are you?” Meaning – what type of person of colour are you, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latino? Because you aint black, my man – that seems to be reserved for African Americans. I didn’t realise this tension existed. The real sealer in this gritty expose of immigrant life is the author’s use of the second person narrative. Now, I can’t recall being exposed to this form of narration, but it really worked here. After a short while of total confusion (mine), I settled down and really got it. This second person POV really made this an intimate experience. Instead of reading what Trelawney was thinking for example, I was Trelawney!!. The reader is the primary character, Wow!!!! What a treat. This is why we read, yes??Your father seems not to notice that you’ve spoken at all, and says ‘what if you do buy this house from me?’ which sounds like to you like ‘what if this house became exclusively your problem’?Narration like this, puts the reader front and centre. A novel experience for me – and considering the nature of the subject matter here, the author made the poverty, violence, discrimination, much more personal, or as personal as it can be.Brilliant.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,16,52,1,"Dec 14, 2023","Dec 17, 2023","Nov 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62969727-if-i-survive-you

They’re usually well-dressed, often qualified and inhabit that primordial swamp of senior/executive management of many, or even most organisations. We see them use jargon at meetings, tell staff how passionate they are about ‘employee well-being’ and they encourage us to ‘think outside the square’, ‘operate in that space’ and ‘reach out for one another’.My favourite celebrity idiot is Alan Partridge. This is his third memoir. Unsurprisingly, he has considerable material. Alan is pompous, selfish, narcissistic, hopeless, misogynistic, racist, and self-aggrandising. But he does love Toblerone and his dog Seldom.This memoir covers Alan’s attempts to breathe life back into his career as a presenter (TV or radio), but there’s more. There is a dual narrative here (described as ‘daring’ by Alan) as he also purchases and refurbishes a knackered lighthouse on the Kent coast.There are so many laugh out loud moments here – I can’t get enough of this man. Steve Coogan the man behind the creation of Partridge, is very clever. He has developed this character for around 30 years. Partridge is a mature product, like an 18-month cheddar cheese.I almost cried when Alan’s dog – “Seldom” – died at a fairground. Also, his denials of any romantic chemistry between Jennie and his co-host of TV’s “This Time” are unbelievably ridiculous. Allan treats his personal assistant appallingly and denigrates many other celebrities on British TV. Make no mistake, this bloke is bitter and pompous.[image]Alan here pictured with co-host of “This Time”, Jennie. Alan was lucky enough to snag a guest gig on the show following the illness and consequent death of the previous male co-host. You can sense the sexual tension between the pair. You can right??I particularly enjoyed Alan’s attempts to ingratiate himself with the locals in Kent. A community consultation session regarding the lighthouse is Alan at his cringeworthy best as things didn’t quite go as expected. Oh my, he really came across as a tosser.This book MUST, MUST, MUST be listened to. The funny thing here is not only the content, which is very clever – but it’s Alan Partridge’s voice, his delivery. He stumbles from one disastrous statement to another. I love this – so funny, so hopeless.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,54,57,1,"Nov 09, 2023","Nov 23, 2023","Nov 09, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/150085659-alan-partridge

This period commences from the reign of Augustus andPax: War and Peace in Rome’s Golden Age by Tom Holland covers the Pax Romana era of ancient Rome. This period commences from the reign of Augustus and ends at the death of Marcus Aurelius. So, we are talking about 27 BCE to 180 CE. This is considered the time the empire was at its greatest. Sure, there were wars and conflicts both within and without, but compared to the Republican period before, and the rest of the Imperial period after, Pax Romana was a time of relative tranquillity. The empire also covered the most territory at this time, during the reign of Trajan (the bloke I have an unhealthy fascination about), the Romans were – ‘large and in charge’, to be sure.There were some notoriously bad emperors during this time – the likes of Caligula, Nero, and Domitian were strutting their stuff. There was also the incredible sh*tshow called, the year of the five emperors, following Nero’s death (Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian). However, on the other hand there was the period of the five good emperors – Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. For me, this is the true Golden Period. It is worth noting Pax Romana ended abruptly with the reign of Marcus Aurelius’ son – Commodus. He was certainly one of the worst. Many significant events occurred, such as, the sack of Dacia, Jerusalem, Mt Vesuvius covering Pompeii and Herculaneum in ash, the conquest of those pesky Brits – so we see Hadrian’s wall. The stories relayed by Tom Holland (I listed to the audiobook) was riveting during the conquest of Jerusalem as was the account of Mt Vesuvius’ eruption..However, I did find Holland’s delivery, overall, to be flat and a bit too academic for my liking. Maybe I am still under the seductive spell of Mary Beard? I listened to her audiobook Emperor of Rome a few months ago, an audiobook experience extraordinaire!!!! Unfortunately, Pax did not reach those heights. Pax also lacked a seamless narrative, I found it difficult to follow at times.There is enough here to learn new material for those who love this topic (e.g. Pliny makes some memorable appearances), but for the newbie – I would suggest something a little more engaging.3 Stars...more",Notes are private!,11,34,1,"Nov 25, 2023","Jan 13, 2024","Nov 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62712920-pax

The British felt the need to prepare an ‘army’ of volunteers of non-conscripted men (many old, women joined later) into a UK based force to repel a German invasion. The politics (Churchill was a big supporter) behind the creation of the Home Guard was fascinating, as were some of the difficulties – for example, no uniforms, no weapons, little organisation, and lack of training. Over 1.5 million were eventually recruited and formal structures, and better organisation implemented.Dad’s Army was a legendary (9 seasons) BBC weekly comedy TV show created in the 1960s. This book discusses the creation of the show, and some of the many difficulties getting a show like this off the ground. Such as the issue of creating a comedy about a brutal war that only finished a few years ago. The detail here was just brilliant, the author provided a real behind the scenes explanation of program production.Then we move onto the show. The writers, directors, actors, scripts, sets and so much more. For any fans of this legendary TV series, this really is a MUST READ. We are also treated to many of the funny scenes and lines – there were so, so many.This clip is typical of the ineptitude of Captain Mainwaring:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMVP... One of my favourite memories, and it is still with me today – just like it happened yesterday. Is my brother and I, sitting with mum and dad watching Dad’s Army and Dad, not being able to breathe due to laughing – I’m not sure whether we were laughing at Dad, with Dad or at the show – probably all of that. Even just reading some of the lines and imagining the pompous face of Captain Mainwaring as he scolds Private Pike had bubbles of laughter ready to erupt out of my windpipe. Giving me so many warm memories, I almost wept. Those who have watched this show will remember the pompous Captain Mainwaring, the posh Seargent Wilson (and their interplay), the dopey Private Pike, the ever obedient and dutiful Lance Corporal Jones, the grumpy and forthright Private Frazer, the old dear – Private Godfrey and the geezer Private Walker. There’s also a host of memorable support characters. If you read this, you’ll learn a whole lot more about them.[image]The Cast of Dad’s ArmySadly, we also learn about them passing away, to the extent that the show needed to be cancelled after an impressive nine seasons. Now Dad’s Army is just a memory. My Mum and Dad are a memory too, as are the actors. But oh, what an emotional story. I’m sure I won’t be alone on that score. After I finish this , I will be putting my own copy of this book, back to sleep in my bookcase and just the thought of that makes me choke too.

What a complex (and painfuNorwegian playwright, Henrik Ibsen’s work Hedda Gabler, introduced me to one of my favourite female leads in recent memory. What a complex (and painful) character she was.Hedda is an unhappily newly married woman who has just returned to Oslo after a European honeymoon. It’s clear she was bored witless by the academic efforts of her husband, Jorgen Tesman, during this trip. He’s a sincere, accommodating young man, and spends much of his time and effort researching European history for a book he is writing. He has high hopes to provide for the high expectations of his wife, she is the daughter of a general and hasn’t had to do without much during her privileged life.There is another academic on the scene, a man called Eljert Lovberg, now this guy has some sort of sketchy past – we don’t’ get to learn about this until later in the play, but his actions – previous and current – have a significant impact on the turn of events in this story. There is another young lady coming in and out of scene, called Mrs Elvsted, an old school friend of Hedda. They didn’t really hang in the same circles as each other – however, Mrs Elvsted is also involved in the various interpersonal relationship (past and current) involved here. It’s messy.I found the storyline riveting. It held my interest from start to finish. But for me, the real interest was Hedda. She is a very demanding young woman, totally unsuited to her new husband. I don’t think he gets that – like most blokes, he’s a bit slow off the mark when it comes to relationships. But she’s more than just demanding. She shows signs of being selfish, narcissistic, revengeful, and cruel – for starts. But it’s all couched in the rigidly stuffy, social mores of nineteenth-century Norway.The ending surprised me. Now to check out some of the Hedda Gabler plays available on YouTube.I enjoyed this one so much I started another of Ibsen’s plays immediately after - Wild Duck.4 StarsFootnote: There were numerous notes, in pencil, made by a previous reader in this book. I found it really amusing, it was almost like a buddy read! Most notes were innocuous – however a couple stood out. The first was ”kill yourself”, the second ”Lying bitch!!”.Now this added to my enjoyment – it made me pause a few times and think about this person, who they are/were, what they were like and what they thought of the story. One thing I can say for sure is, this phantom buddy reader of mine was emotionally invested in Hedda Gabler.

The second time, he hid the makeup all over the apartment, stuck in every nook and cranny he could findMy heart rate increased to critical levels after reading this.There are some wonderfully tense interplays between Ivy and Wes. Quite tense, for example at dinner on one occasion, Ivy orders beef – ‘to prepare for battle’ – it’s that type of thing that keeps this reader from sleeping for another half an hour. It’s intriguing – relationships are fascinating. Wes is not above payback. In fact, he loves itNow, I have focussed here on the relationship aspect of this story. There is a helluva lot more – for example, Ivy and Wes may have been part of a hit and run many, many years ago – and they are now under scrutiny from a female detective who is as determined and as gnarly as rusty nails. They MUST work together – yes, these two!! You reckon they'll pull it off?Very enjoyable.4 StarsFootnote: There was one particularly offensive line in this story. One of the characters was looking for an alias and quite wisely made the sophisticated decision to choose the name “Mark” – this prompted the startling retort:”Mark? Of all the names in the world, you picked Mark?”I fell off my chair. ...more",Notes are private!,5,85,1,"Oct 19, 2023","Oct 23, 2023","Oct 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52379875-a-twisted-love-story

Dry. Crack crackly cracklingShe's back home now, our first person narrator, Peach, she tries to patch herself up. Needle, thread, labia.All this, and her hopeless parents, obsessed with sex and each other darting tongues, suggestive innuendo. There’s a baby in the house. Lightly dusted in sugar. He melts a bit , usually outside, always sweet. Leaving sweetness everywhere.The rapist – Lincoln – is described in a disgusting way – he’s greasy, meaty, fatty, bristling with gristle, all contained within a translucent casing. A huge, greasy fat sausage. Be careful. Some sausages can be delicious. Green is Peach’s boyfriend. He is a tender lad, and the interactions between he and Peach give the reader a breather. A refreshing change from the smells, tastes, sights of depravity, decay, and deviance laid before us. There’s a lot of it – watch it! Green has a rolly polly mate named Spud. Emma Glass and her food similitudes. Another one.Peach’s belly seems full. Kiss my lips, piss on a stickThis has been described by critics as ‘art’. I can see why – the author uses words as playthings, she’s a poet, even I can tell. This is the first time I have appreciated the work of a poet; the way Glass toys with cadence and sound had me re-reading passages, re-passing the past. Tying my tongue.My fingers slip on the plastic, oiled, slick, no need to lick, the plastic parts. The dismemberment plan. Hack and stack. Chop. Stop. Neat slices slowlyThis work is an assault on the senses – all of them. Glass paints a vivid and violent picture of the ramifications of rape on the victim, mentally and corporeal. Peach’s teacher, the considerate, Mr Custard was my favourite character. He knew. He wanted to help – at first, I found him ridiculous because Mr Custard appeared to be melting, dripping on student desks. His face started sliding off (his eyes went first) – in the sun, of course. But I got used to Custard – and now I understand why he was the way he was. If I he was at a barbecue, in the sun, I’d sit next to him.Unforgettable.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,3,60,1,"Oct 14, 2023","Oct 19, 2023","Oct 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34957071-peach

This account covers the period from Augustus (27 BCE) to the teenage Elagabalus (reign ended 222 CE).Usually, any account of the Emperors of Rome is chronological. You know, Augustus (the great), Tiberius (the miserable), Caligula (the nutter), Claudius (the unexpected), Nero (the ginga ninja – but also a nutter)….and so on. Well, Professor Beard here, tackles this lot of Emperors differently. That is, by Topic. Food, slaves, succession, administration and so much more.The section on Imperial Dinners was brilliant. Caligula used to nip off with the wives of male guests, have sex with them, return the poor woman to the table and proceed to demean her and her husband. Elagabalus used to have colour themed dinners – the black ones were sure to scare the guests, he also introduced “whoopee cushions” to the world at his dinners – this gender fluid emperor was a genius!! Skin flint, Tiberius, served up yesterday’s leftovers for a ‘feast’ the following day – bahahaha. The fact is, Imperial dining is a particularly revealing lens into the world of the emperor from Sadism to generosity, luxury to terror. The imperial dining room was a site of danger as well as pleasure for the unsuspecting guests. Poisoning had an uncanny close relationship to cookery. There’s a chapter on the Job Description of an emperor. They had so much correspondence, it makes one wonder how they go through it. They probably had their minders reply to much of it. But one thing that struck me was the ‘light touch of power’ in the empire. There was only 1 administrator for every 300,000 people – amazing! Succession was another wonderful chapter – the complexities involved. Also, the importance of adoption in determining who would be heir. Many, or most adoptions involved an emperor adopting an adult male as son. It does seem to me, that adoption (i.e.. selecting an individual with the right skill set) was far more successful in producing decent heirs than by birth. For example, the year of the 5 Good Emperors - Nerva (was appointed by the senate after Nero), Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, all adopted, were considered good, great, emperors. However, Marcus Aurelius allowed his biological basket-case of a son, Commodus, to take over after his death, and that ended in tears, to put it mildly.The chapter on women was enthralling. Women of the Imperial House helped to both guarantee succession and simultaneously threaten to disrupt it. Messalina’s intrigues with one of her aristocratic lovers (for apparently she had many) who were apparently ready to stage a coup - resulted in her being put to death on her husband’s – Claudius – orders with him quipping – “Am I still Emperor, am I still emperor?” Brutal stuff.The equally promiscuous daughter of Augustus, Julia, who was known for having a keen sense of humour only took on a lover when she was pregnant to her husband. She was quoted as saying “I never take a passenger on board, except when the hold is already full”. That is brilliant – I hope it’s true!Interestingly, Mary Beard starts this book and ends it with a discussion on Elagabalus. He’s a little-known emperor. He reigned 218 CE – 222 CE. He was only a boy, aged 14 – 18 years during his reign. He was from Syria and came to be emperor due to some tenuous link with the royal bloodline. This young boy was responsible for a massive empire. Imagine that? I was squeezing pimples at that age and arguing with mum and dad about how long I could stay out with my mates - he was ‘large and in charge’ of an empire! He was also different, he dressed flamboyantly, much to the horror of the Roman Conservatives, he was a follower of the Sun God (hence the name), in fact he installed Elegabal as the chief deity, thus causing religious difficulties in Rome, not helped by his marriage to a Vestal Virgin!! Yes, a Vestal Virgin!!!! But importantly, Mary Beard paints a picture of a human being, a person, a young boy – probably gender fluid. Notably, he even asked one of his surgeons to cut him a vagina. Mary Beard humanises these people. She brings them into your lounge room, she introduces us them as folks, and I love her for that. If you have even slightest inkling to know more about this crazy gang – read this. If you want an extra-sensory experience, listen to Professor Beard’s audiobook as I did – it is quite simply, magic.[image]Elegabalus……poor lad (my opinion) – executed to make way for Severus Alexander.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,24,111,1,"Oct 11, 2023","Oct 29, 2023","Oct 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/128747007-emperor-of-rome

This is why I found The Split by Sharon Bolton a pleasant surprise, from the get-go.Felicity Lloyd is an ‘Ice Scientist’ (wow) and spends her professional time studying glaciers on an isolated island called South Georgia – not far from Las Malvinas, in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Felicity also lives in Cambridge, UK, when not working remotely. And it’s back home where things get a bit testy.For example, she believes there is someone coming into her small flat at random times, fiddling around with her stuff and even sleeping there. For example, she will find cigarette butts out the back garden – as she is a non-smoker, this is slightly disconcerting. I found this aspect of the book a little scary, as there have been times I check under my bed (you know the type?), or run up the stairs to my bedroom quickly, and lock the door before a murderer can chase me down and cut me up into wee pieces. But to be fair, I only do this when I am here alone. Yes, there were some very chilling parts of this story, the stuff that makes the hairs on your neck stand up.Felicity is also consulting a psychologist called Joe, as she needs to be medically cleared to return to South Georgia. This seemingly routine exercise gets tricky, as Joe seems to be able to draw out some of her insecurities and apparent history of the worst kind of abuse as a child. Her concerns about the anonymous ‘housemate’ give rise to the possibility of paranoia – Dr Joe was able to draw this out of her too. The scenes between patient and psychologist in the consulting room were fascinating. Then there’s this bloke called Freddie Lloyd, just released from prison for murder and is trying to hunt Felicity down. She is very aware of this, and he is persistent, and vicious. Homeless people play a significant part in this story, which is good to see – providing a window into how our homeless brothers and sisters live.Oh yes, Joe’s mum is a copper – and a very interesting character indeed. Snaky, I’d say. She plays a role in trying to hunt down the various incidents that seem to be surrounding our good Ice Scientist.There are heaps of twists – seriously, I was blown out of the water by some of them, and none were ridiculous. There is tension, suspense, a dash of romance and of course an exciting ending.I’ll give this one a solid 4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,33,40,1,"Oct 10, 2023","Oct 18, 2023","Oct 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45046750-the-split

Is a cheeky little graphic book about the brilliant Argentinian FootballerLeo Messi.As a passionate football fan, this little book is right down my alley. More importantly, this would be ideal for any young kid (I’d imagine 5-10 years of age) to inspire them to play our great game.The art here is fun and colourful. I love the way the artist paints Messi, as small. He was and is. He's a wee man. What a wonderful thing to inspire a young footballer - particularly a small or tiny young kid - to become a footballer. We follow Messi's introduction into team football in Rosario, Argentina – encouraged by his Abuela. We also learn about his health involving growth hormone treatment because he was so diminutive . But also, his stellar ability, so much so that – Barcelona, one of the world’s biggest clubs (….almost as big as Leeds United), showed interest in the lad at 13 years of age The rest is history. I will carry my experience to the grave just last year, visiting the Camp Nou in Barcelona and seeing for myself some of the trophies won by this great player. One thing that strikes one about Messi, apart from his obscene ability, is his humility.[image]Often lauded as the best of all-time, for me, it’s close between Messi and Maradona – either way, Leo is brilliant. Winning the World Cup last year was the cherry on the cake for him, as it's often said - and I agree - ""one cannot be considered the world's best until one wins a World Cup"".It's a great little picture book for the young ones.

A story involving our narrator, the youngest of a bunch of siblings. Siblings she haThis is perhaps the most thought-provoking read for me this year. A story involving our narrator, the youngest of a bunch of siblings. Siblings she has been trained to serve and satisfy their every whim. She moves to a ‘Northern Country’, to live with her eldest brother, recently separated. To a country she doesn't know the language. The home of her ancestors. We’re not told explicitly, but we’re lead to believe her ancestors were driven from this land. Hated. In fact , our narrator is frowned upon by the locals, ignored and ostracised too – as her ancestors may have been. She is isolated. This is bleak, dark, and a bit frightening. There’s also some bat shit crazy stuff here that is a bit unsettling, not only because it’s hard to find meaning in them, but because these occurrences border on farcical. Enter the three legged dog Bert the other dog with a phantom pregnancy and a weird owner (putting it mildly), the dead new born piglets with ‘oh so smooth’ skin, the little dolls made of sticks – and more. I’m not sure our narrator is unreliable as such. She’s unhappy, alone, deprived and self-loathing, and a bit mad, to be sure. But unreliable? I’m not sure (Note: I have since learned more about unreliable narrators - see thread below - comments with Lisa). There’s references to Jewish life in Hitler’s Germany, only one or two – but enough to perhaps draw the parallel of this woman’s experiences to those who were persecuted by the Nazis in Hitler’s Germany. Is this ‘Northern Country’ Germany? We never find out. Does it really matter? As the feelings here experienced by the narrator – could be experienced by anyone. Someone with a stutter, a disability, a black person, or a Muslim. Anyone who may be seen as different from the collective.This is a must re-read.

Initially, I really enjoyed this, largely because of a young man, a nihilist, named Bazarov. He accompanied another young man, called Arkady, to the latter’s family home to meet his widower father, Nikolay, and his uncle Pavel. Immediately, there were some uncomfortable discussions to be had as the opinionated Bazarov proved to be a taciturn, contrary (and in my opinion, arrogant) character – who spent his time disagreeing with everything Nikolay and Pavel had to say. There was a particular animosity between Uncle Pavel and Bazarov. Personally, I thought Bazarov was a complete tosser, and I would’ve thrown him out of my home, no matter how much Arkady fawned all over him. Arkady idolised him.Despite my fractious relationship with Bazarov, I found him interesting as a character and whenever he appeared in a scene I made a wee “whoop” noise of delight (nothing too creepy, mind you), as I knew drama would ensue. If you read this, keep an eye on the relationship between Bazarov and Pavel – it crumbles dramatically.The young men also visited Bazarov’s family farm, I found this part of the story incredibly sad – the parents of Bazarov, were almost ‘cap in hand’ gratefully simpering, in appreciation for their son’s visit. Bazarov seemed to exploit this, and even worse, he became increasingly indifferent to their love.There’s also a love story in this liquorice all sorts, chop suey type of tale. Romance erupts when the boys visit a local aristocratic family – admittedly, this was interesting, too. I think the theme in this story is the differences between the old and the young. Seems obvious, I know. However, I could write a few pages on the theme as I see it – and that’s the difference between nihilists and the rest of us. What an annoying bunch.Admittedly, the literary messages here are probably way above my ability to identify, define, and analyse.I found this interesting in parts, but it was also all over the shop (for me) and didn’t seem at all cohesive – a bit like this !Good enough to recommend (the story, not my ).Just. 3 starsIf you'd like to read a far more insightful  of this interesting book , check out this  by Yules https://www.goodreads.com//show.......more",Notes are private!,29,49,1,"Oct 03, 2023","Oct 10, 2023","Oct 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2659589-fathers-and-children

This ship was purchased from the East India Company in 1739 by the The Wager is one of the most fascinating true stories you could ever wish to read. This ship was purchased from the East India Company in 1739 by the Royal Navy. In 1741 it formed part of a fleet charged with the mission to sale around the Southern tip of South America (YIKES!!!!) and hang out in the Pacific Ocean to menace the Spanish fleets of the day.The fleet consisted of six warships (of which Wager was one of the small ones) and two transport vessels. Before leaving Portsmouth, the Navy were required to recruit enough people to make up 120 odd crew. This was a feat in itself, it proved so difficult (with people deserting) they had to employ disabled and injured crew from other ships just returned from previous voyages. Many were stretchered on board no less! Anyway, the Captain of Wager, died before reaching Cape Horn and Lieutenant David Cheap, a young, stern, keen officer, was appointed as acting captain. Captain Cheap was later to become a much maligned (perhaps unfairly) historical figure – all due to the events that were about to unfold.[image]OMG!!!Upon passing through Cape Horn – which is known for the strongest of winds, massive waves, currents, and icebergs disaster struck. Wager had not travelled sufficiently far enough West before turning North (Captain Cheap was often blamed by his crew) and she struck ground within a group of remote and desolated island at the Western tip of Southern Chile and was shipwrecked.Before the shipwreck of Wager, the sets this up beautifully by introducing us to the main players and detailing what life on a ship of that time was like. The politics, discipline, working the sails, duties, the food, the duties of the surgeon, all the dangers involved, the dreaded scurvy (oh dear!!) and lots more. By the time Wager reached the tip of South America, the crew were in no fit state to operate this ship – largely due to scurvy. The descriptions of the sufferers was horrible, even for someone who’s spent his life working with faeces, sputum, urine, and pus – I found it a bit much. Once shipwrecked – there were instances of looting, fighting and conflict among groups, murder, mutiny even cannibalism was considered – imagine staring at your workmates with this in mind. The group split into groups, they tried to live off this barren land, and in effect they became walking skeletons, most died. I cannot describe that happens after the crew split into groups and decided on various courses of action to go home. You’ll have to read this to find out. It is brilliantly written, it is the ultimate ripping yarn.There is a lot to learn here, but at no stage did this book become an effort. It passed through me with ease. Highly recommended, you will not believe what happens.5 StarsNewsflash: I believe there's a movie either in production, or currently being made re theWager, starring Leo DiCaprio (as Cheap??) and directed by Martin Scorsese.

Sam suffered severe injuries, resulting in her being paralysed from the chest down. As a physically active person, who loved to travel and get amongst it – her life changed forever.This memoir starts with Bloom’s childhood – which included working in her father’s Newport Beach bakery in Sydney’s north, her love of surfing and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Cam. She loved the ocean - something that i still very much a part of her life. We witness the couple's shared love of travel, as they visit many ‘off the beaten track’ places, and they eventually settled down and had three boys together.Sam’s journey to overcome her shocking injuries is described in detail, as are her struggles. One thing I really appreciated about this story was her honesty in stating - “this isn’t a motivational story” and if the reader is looking for someone who is “at one with her wheelchair” – it’s best to look somewhere else. In this way, Bloom’s story is brutally honest, and genuinely faithful to how so many people cope with serious, life-changing/threating illness or injury. She nailed it.But for me, the prize goes to the baby magpie, named ‘Penguin’, who fell out of a nest and became a member of the Bloom family and was instrumental in Sam’s recovery. This part was truly heart-warming, and further illustrates the beautiful hearts animals possess. This is explained further in the best-selling Penguin Bloom book.Check out the book cover picture taken by Sam’s photographer husband Cam; it is one of the best photos I’ve seen in a while.

Her boyfriend, “Jack”, is a journalist and the father of the developing little bundle of joy growing inside her. A bundle they lovingly call ‘Wally”. These two are madly in love and share some warm, adorable, funny moments. However, all is not well. The reason is that Jack seems to be hiding something. Rachel first notices this when she first meets his rugby mates (after many months together) – where they call him ‘JD’. Why? His surname is Ross. What follows is a suspicious Rachel, crossing quite a few ethical boundaries, to find out more about her beau. This makes one think – what is acceptable when trying to find out more about a partner? Particularly if he/she is not forthcoming, or obviously hiding something, something terrible. Would you check their emails, if you could work out their password? Would you use confidential records – legal or health records for example, to find out more? Well, this story, soon develops a head of steam, and asks plenty of ethical questions like this to the reader. It was riveting, but unsettling. Perhaps Rachel has a dark secret too? Also, who is to judge when someone (partner or not) commits a terrible act, or any act that had tragic consequences? Are we too quick to judge? There’s also the question, does our partner need to know everything about us?This was a rollicking ride, I was riveted. I couldn’t put the bloody thing down, even my Colleen McCoullough read about Caesar has been pushed aside because of this story. There is nothing sadder than a fully grown, hardcover 900-page book, sobbing in a bedroom – while its owner pays 100% of his attention to a new book on the block. Anyway, rest assured I will climb into bed tonight and beg for forgiveness – I have no shame.There’s an interesting parallel here between the two main characters. They both have a thorny past – even though the author makes some sort of comparison between their previous deeds, I think it was a long bow to draw, as to me, they are very different scenarios. However, it does go to show – no two situations are the same.The importance of forgiveness also raises its head as the story progresses. The power of forgiveness – the hurt involved in not forgiving. But heck, are we obliged to forgive anything or everything?I like this author and will certainly read her again.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,26,41,1,"Sep 15, 2023","Sep 19, 2023","Sep 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32599702-everything-but-the-truth

Indeed, some moments are very chilling, but there’s also suspense, mystery, and romance. Oh, and as one would expect from Wilde – there is a good dash of comedy. Canterville Chase, an impressive old English property, sold by Lord Canterville to an American family by the name of Otis. Lord Canterville (bless him) was so honest he warned the prospective buyers about a vicious ghost who has terrorised the inhabitants of Canterville Chase for centuries. This did not deter the Otis family – who didn’t believe in ghosts. In fact, they were quite disparaging about the whole idea, which miffed English sensibilities.The hilarity occurs in the first half of the story, the Otis children made fun of the ghost when he appeared, mocked him even, they also suggested certain products to get rid of his ‘squeaking chains’, or the blood stain on the carpets. This mortified the ghost. The young twins even set up booby traps for the old, miserable, spectre. Talk about demoralising. But this aint no comedic piece. All this mockery was followed by a story of some substance, with some worthwhile – not cheesy – messaging, there is also some genuine ‘spookiness’, enough to make me turn off my Kindle and go to sleep. Really.Yes, death. Death must be beautiful. To lie in the soft born earth, with the grasses waving above one’s head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.When the time comes – that will do me.If you like Oscar Wilde and are looking for a lively read – I recommend this little beauty.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,35,74,1,"Sep 14, 2023","Sep 20, 2023","Sep 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45685.The_Canterville_Ghost

It is worth mentioning the author here, as he writes in a style that anyone would find accessible and Caligula by Suetonius is one entertaining read. It is worth mentioning the author here, as he writes in a style that anyone would find accessible and entertaining.Biographer of the first twelve Caesars, Suetonius, is the most utilised source of the life of Caligula (b. 12 AD d. 41AD) There are others, mainly Tacitus and Dio Cassius, but in the case of Tacitus his work is incomplete, and Dio wrote a few centuries later. Suetonius was a secretary for emperor Hadrian (reign 117AD – 138AD – he’s one of my favourites) and had access to all the records of previous Emperors. One thing about Suetonius that makes his work so accessible to anyone, is his writing. It is sensationalist, it almost reads like a London daily tabloid rag. It is said, he also relied on gossip and other informal sources, but historians (or the ones I listen to anyway) suggest he is an excellent source. Gaius Caesar or, Caligula (emperor # 3), was well-bred to be sure, having direct links to both the Julio and Claudian bloodlines. Hi father was the pin-up boy Germanicus, who was touted to be Emperor one day, but a suspicious death in Syria put paid to that. Agrippina was Caligula’s Mum, Augustus his great grandad, Livia his great grandmother. Talk about royal blood! Unfortunately, his two older brothers were executed, probably by the taciturn, perverted Tiberius (emperor # 2) – in fact, as a late teenager, Caligula was put under the care of Tiberius on the island of Capri. Sounds nice doesn’t it? Not until you know what went on in Tiberius’ lair – it really sounds like a horrible place to be. After his mum, Agrippina, was exiled and killed, this poor young lad was left with three younger sisters. All of whom he was later to have sex with. However, he was particularly devoted to Drusilla – to the point of deifying her.[image]""The love of Caligula’s life – his sister Drusilla""The first third of this biography covers Caligula’s childhood and the early part of him being emperor. He was initially popular, largely due to the unpopularity of the detested Tiberius. But things started to turn rotten soon into his brief four-year reign when he became uber-cruel and increasing extravagant with the Empire’s money. Suetonius writes, only on page 20 of 50:”So much for Gaius (Caligula) the emperor; the rest of this history must deal with Gaius the Monster”What follows is quite simply a litany of atrocities. I won’t detail any of them here, many of you will be aware of much of his behaviour, but there will be others you will learn about fir the first time. If you want to know the details you may want to read this biography, it is as interesting as it is shocking.[image]""Let them hate me, so long as they fear me""Caligula was eventually killed by a mob of elites, in a stabbing frenzy. It seems Caligula’s total disrespect for the Senate and other powerful people was too much. His uncle, Claudius, succeeded him – reluctantly. It’s interesting to note that Caligula, liked to keep Uncle Claudius around his court, as a butt for practical jokes – his uncle had a bad limp, a speech impediment and was a bit of a nerd.If you read this, I know you won’t regret it.Simply brilliant.5 StarsFun Fact Those of you who are interested, may note Caligula, as emperor #3 - and Tiberius as #2 - meaning Augustus was #1.

Reading about this historian’s life experiences was fascinating, as she touched on some of the most significant events of the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries. Faust was born in 1947 in New York City but was raised in a ‘well-to-do’ family in segregated Virginia. She tells her story by introducing us to her family. I was absorbed by the stories of her family’s (grandfather, father, and brothers) involvement WWI and WWII. This provides an excellent context to understand how Faust ended up the way she did, a woman with a formidable sense of social justice, a strong moral compass. A ‘good lefty’ methinks.As a young girl Faust saw the freedoms her brothers enjoyed and wanted that for herself. This put her at odds with her mother, something that lasted until her mother’s death when Faust was a young woman. I remember her saying, she “didn’t want to return home when her mother was alive, but also didn’t want to return home when her mother had passed”. That was so sad to read.As a college student in the 1960’s, Faust was an active student advocate as well as being heavily involved in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam movements. I found her experiences in segregated Virginia illuminating, it really wasn’t so long ago. This story also got me thinking about the never-ending conga-line of important social causes humanity needs to confront and deal with moving forward. To be sure, the 20 century was packed full of significant events and important social issues to be addressed. But this continues – today we have inequality, climate change, LGBTQI+, populism, conflict, AI and so, so much more. This made me feel a little pessimistic (and I’m a glass half-full of cream kind of bloke) about humanity’s ability to deal with these matters.There is much more in this memoir, it is worth a read. I love the way this woman has a strong moral compass and was and is willing to be active in making this world a better place to live. I like her.4 StarsMany thanks to NetGalley for providing me with an audio version of this book, in exchange for a ....more",Notes are private!,20,51,1,"Sep 07, 2023","Sep 30, 2023","Sep 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039162-necessary-trouble

Alas, I was a tad disaAfter reading Tessa Hadley’s Late in the Day I came to this book - The Past, full of high expectations, very high expectations. Alas, I was a tad disappointed.Set in a dreamy village in South West UK, sisters Harriet, Alice, Fran, and their brother Roland meet up for their annual summer sojourn at their deceased grandparents’ cottage. The place is old and in need of renovations, they must decide if they keep the house or sell it. Hadley paints a vivid picture of a home full of golden memories. Her wonderful writing also describes the local countryside, with it’s overgrown vegetation, winding paths to nowhere, long grass and forests and wildlife – I felt like I was there.Fran brings her two little kids – Arthur and Ivy, and Roland has in tow his new third wife, Pilar. A beautiful Argentinian woman, sexy, professional, and polished. She’s yet to meet the three sisters, tough gig hey? Roland has also brought along his sixteen-year-old daughter Molly who hangs around, perhaps a bit too much, with Alice’s ex-boyfriend’s son – Kasim. This young man, is absolutely cock sure of himself. This three-week holiday is full of simmering discontent and conflict. Naturally, old resentments erupt among the siblings, and the unexpected guests add a lighter fuel to the mix. I was on a five-star roll initially with this, as the suspense sucked me in totally – I was trying to figure who was going to fight with who, how Pilar and Kasim were going to fit in, all while learning about the siblings’ relationships and resentments.BUT – halfway through I started to find certain aspects a little tiresome. The author spent considerable time following little Ivy and Arthur around as they explored the landscape, including a dilapidated cottage near to the house. Even though the dilapidated cottage added mystery to the story, I found the whole ‘kid-thing’ tiresome, there was a lot of it. I also didn’t really have any feelings towards the characters, despite the excellent writing I just wanted them all to go home, so I could get on to my next book. That’s never a good sign. Oh, I did have some feelings towards Kasim – I thought he was a self-assured Muppet.Hadley’s beautiful writing is still on display though. Perhaps my high expectations ruined this for me a bit.3.5 Stars – rounded down to 3 Stars...more",Notes are private!,15,38,1,"Jan 15, 2024","Jan 19, 2024","Sep 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28925168-the-past

Oh my, I am so thankful I didn’t.Alex and Christine are married, as are Zachary and Lydia – they’ve all been close friends since schooldays and early adulthood. There’s history there. Out of the blue they learn Zach is dead. Make no mistake this is a massive loss, Zach is a wonderful guy – compassionate, interested, kind and a bit of a cuddly bear (I think).

Sometimes these days I almost think I can do without the present. The past is enough for me, It’s enough for my life.”After that statement, I had to lay this book on my chest and think. “Yes, I know it”.I loved Christine, she is such a willowy, kind, whispering type – she has her art and quietly goes about her life. For me, her husband Alex, is an arrogant, moody, opinionated prick. Vain too.Alex thought holding hands was for children, not for men touching womenZach’s death occurs early on.

They were flying jets and shooting rockets into the heavens. The only concern I had, was to make sure to be home for dinner at 6pm. Life was safe, sunny and easy.On the other side of the world, in 1974 Boston, life was a whole lot different. This was a turbulent period, in which Boston Public Schools were being desegregated. Kids from black schools were going to be bused into white schools, and vice versa. This caused a significant amount of civil unrest – protests, riots and the like.We see this period largely from the perspective of white people of Irish heritage in the housing projects in the south of Boston, they’re called “Southies”. They are working class, territorial, poor – surrounded by crime and racist. They (or the people we meet in this story) hate the black people in adjacent poor suburbs, and the also hate other kinds of ‘others’.Mary Pat is a mother who has already lost a husband and a son and is now dealing with the disappearance of her coming of age teenage daughter. She is a woman not to be messed with. It seems her daughter’s disappearance is associated with the death of a young black guy whose car had broken down in the wrong suburb, and he’s chased to a train station – and killed. The circumstances around this murder, however, are opaque.A broken person can’t be unbreakable. An unbreakable person can’t be broken. And yet here sits Mary Pat Fennesey, broken but unbreakableThere’s a rich plot here, involving a large cast of characters, many criminal – they live a life steeped in crime, violence, drugs, and hatred. It isn’t nice – it’s gritty. Unfortunately, we only see this world, from the perspective of the white people, it would have been interesting – and I was expecting, an alternative narrative of white/black/white/black. But alas, that wasn’t the story.But what I did like, was this true-life saga desegregation and the incendiary practice of busing kids between white and black schools. This, for me, was a point in US history worth knowing about – and 1974 so recent really. Many of these people are still alive – do they still hold the same views? Is this area in the south of Boston, the same? There was also a powerful message which became more apparent towards the end of the story, this was the generational transfer of racist hatred.When you’re a kid and they start in with all the lies. They never tell you they’re lies. They just tell you this is what it is.Anyway, the story here is interesting and credible enough to keep one’s attention, I found it interesting, suspenseful, violent and I was totally invested in the characters.This is a good read – 3.5 stars, marked up for learning something new.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,33,75,1,"Aug 22, 2023","Sep 06, 2023","Aug 22, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61812308-small-mercies

This is my least favourite of this series, but I stCaesar’s Women, #4 in the Masters of Rome Series by Colleen McCullough was one hell of a work-out. This is my least favourite of this series, but I still loved it. Let me explain.Caesar’s Women isn’t the best title. Sure, there are numerous key women in this instalment, and many bump into the rake-like Julius Caesar, many even partake in horizontal refreshments with the man. In fact, Caesar uses this act, putting his ‘body on the line’ if you like, to cuckhold various political opponents. He was prolific in this regard. The three prominent women in his life, and in this story, were his mother Aurelia (a wonderful, strong, no-nonsense type, a true Matriarch), Julia (Caesar’s beautiful daughter, perfect in every way – betrothed to an acne ridden, uncertain, young Brutus, and later handed over to Pompey the Great – some 30 plus years her senior), and his main lover Servilia (Caeser’s main sex interest – vampish, sexy, an absolute Machiavillianette, oh and she's Brutus’ mum, a political player extraordinaire).......yes, THAT Brutus.[image]Servilia – Brutus’ mother, Caesar’s primary loverSo yes, there is a focus on some significant women in Caesar’s life here BUT, this is really ALL about politics. In other words, the political rise of Julius Caesar. The juror, orator, charmer, looker, senior consul, fixer – and let’s not deny it, well hung Patrician. Sure, he’s had some minor military success in the East as a young man, but his major military campaigns – eight years of genocide in Gaul, are yet to come – this will be the story of #5 in the series Caesar I expect.But heck – this was so, so heavy on politics. [image]Aurelia – Caesar’s mother, what a woman – this lady was ‘large and in charge’My word I miss the gargantuan characters of Marius and Sulla in previous instalments, the wars, the military shenanigans with only a dash of politics – that’s my ideal cocktail. If you read this episode, you’ll have none of those famous military campaigns, none of the slashing and burning, the fights within and without. This is about the Senate, the Tribune of the Plebs, the Equestrian class, Consuls, Magistrates, Praetors, Governors, and law courts the list goes on. But we meet interesting characters like Cato, Cicero (oh what a wordsmith – he could filibuster with the best of them, and he knew it), Catilina, Hybrida, Curio, Bibulus, Crassus, Ahenobarbus (Nero’s ancestors – the real Ginger Ninjas, a horrible lot really), Piso and so many more. Put it this way, there were around 600 Senators – I think I met half of them. [image]Cicero – one of Caesar’s political foes. Cicero was fundamental in exposing the Catiline Conspiracy, which resulted in the execution of the conspirators – without trial (massive scandal). This famous incident is covered in this bookSo, this was dry at times – perhaps too often. You know the type of book when you pick it up and one’s eyelids become heavy within 5 minutes. Yes, that riveting. But it was wonderful – the amount of research Mrs Mac must have done would’ve been colossal. The 200-page appendix is a testament to that. But, slogging through this one has been well worth it – I feel this fascinating period of pre-Imperial Rome is very much embedded in my marrow now. Something that can only be attained by spending too much time absorbing material such as this. Sure, this is historical fiction, and Mrs Mac takes liberties, but when one randomly checks the main story points – to be sure, they did happen.This is one for devoted lovers of Ancient Rome.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,2,57,1,"Aug 19, 2023","Oct 11, 2023","Aug 19, 2023",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3417.Caesar_s_Women

As a Stage 4 cancer patient myself, in remission for a couple of years now, the idea of being in control of one’s final moments has some appeal. This pesky cancer of mine is incurable and will probably snaffle me up one day. The idea and ability of having the choice of when and where to die, and with whom – is important to me and many others experiencing similar circumstances.It seems legislation lags the will of the majority on this issue. Brian and Amy therefore cannot follow this course of action in the US and decide to use the services of a company in Zurich, Switzerland, called Dignitas. This is a heavy, emotional journey. The reader is likely to love Amy and Brian – I did. Not a perfect couple by any means – who is? But totally in love. We follow the onerous application process, Brian’s condition, their story, their lives, and the end. It’s not all sad. It’s even amusing at times – as these things often are.

I loved it, not because I agree with this sentiment. But because it was the thoughts of a man I initially loathed, however, as this work progressed the writer developed such a beautifully layered* character – I felt like I identified with him, in some way, on a deeper level.That made me squirm.This is a brilliant novella of a man (our narrator) who seems to cruise through life, apparently not caring. To the point of seeming to not have any opinions, views, or desires for anything at all. He attracts a small gaggle of undesirables, who are as equally as dislikable as him. Unexpectedly, he did attract the affections of a nice young woman – it did make me think, “what the hell was she doing?”.Our narrator, who seems to glide through life, doesn’t have it all his own way and becomes involved in a situation he is unable to extract himself from. A situation he will find it increasingly impossible to elude.Dark, gripping, revealing, psychological and quite simply, brilliant.

The more I read of the classics, the more I realise there were some very funny writers back in the day. Class acts like Gogol (obviously) Voltaire, Wharton (Xingu), Kafka – I understand the likes of Austen and Trollope can be funny too, but I am yet to read them – I am sure there are many others. The Importance of Being Earnest - is a very funny take on some of the etiquettes and norms of the chattering classes in 19th century England. Imagine living in such suffocating politeness, a society with overwhelming social protocols. It would be terrible.Many would be aware this is a farce involving two men who use other names/identities to escape their ordinary life and go elsewhere to…….misbehave. One of these characters – Jack Worthing – uses the name Earnest to escape life in the country, to chase a woman in London. Jack achieves this by saying he is going to visit his troublesome brother Earnest.Jack’s acquaintance (I hesitate to use the word friend) is a mischief monger called Algernon Moncrieff this upper-class twit is a total tosser, overbearing, amoral, deceitful and self-indulgent (…..and these are his better qualities!). Well, “Algy” uses an alias for nefarious activities, too. He is called Bunbury. There are a couple of hapless young ladies involved with these gentlemen, and they are Gwendoline and Cecile. They become entangled in the confusion and the farcical situation created by Jack and Algy. We also meet the ultra-stuffy Lady Bracknell – the type who readily turns her nose up to anything she deems to be below her high expectations. She’s too easy to dislike.We end up with a total farce involving more than one Earnest, more than one engagement, and absolute confusion. There were times I was confused, too. Social norms of the day are turned on their head, the upper class are mocked, and the idea of engagement and marriage are trifled with. It’s magic.This play is very funny and so easy to read. Wilde was obviously a genius; he would’ve been great company.Highly recommend - 5 Stars.Anyway, I’m obliged to go to Melbourne today to take care of my older and problematic cousin, Felix, as he’s leaving prison, and I will be helping him reintegrate into society. I’ll only be a couple of months, or so…….byeeee!!!

It’s been a few days and I am still loitering about in 1970s Chicago with the Hildebrandt family.Russ Dad, he’s an assistant minister at some sort of modern church. He has 4 kids and is married to Marion. It’s a tired marriage. He’s a resentful man – and is particularly jealous of a fellow minister, Rick. They don’t talk – mutual animosity. Russ fancies a widow called Frances; I must say she does sound a tad sporty, and she flirts with him too. It seems Russ might be ripe for the picking. The church kids – and his own kids, think Russ is a bit of a sap. We’re not sure what Frances thinks of him.Marion Doesn’t seem to have much joy in her life and it’s easy to feel sad for her lot. I think she’s a terrific mum. But when a marriage aint working it’s a real case of 1+1= - 4, rather than 1+1=4. Many of us know all about that. Marion has obviously ‘grown apart’ (how often to you hear that?) from her husband and vice versa. She’s particularly close to Perry – kid number 3. Marion’s back story is one of the best parts of the book, almost a novel within a novel.The kids from oldest to youngest. Clem goes to university, avoided the Vietnam draft. Has a passionate affair with a girl at uni. He has the strongest of bonds with Becky - kid number 2. My eldest is called Becky – so I am automatically in love with her – bright, beautiful, has a presence – she gets mixed up with a decent guy in a church band called Tanner (he has my seal of approval). Kid number 3 is Perry - he’s unforgettable. I think he’s about 9 when we first meet him – he has a MASSIVE intellect, but with that comes a lot of other stuff – he’s a troubled boy. If it makes you high – he’ll get it and sell it. Then there’s the youngest Judson - he’s almost an extra (in my view) cute kid – his main relationships are with mum and Perry.Throw this lot into the 1970s – and the politics of a thriving church, and a youth group with all the shenanigans associated with that. Also, characters like Rick – (the guy Russ hates, yes – hates) – who just so happens to be charismatic, interesting, interested and a people magnet. The ‘dangerous’ widow, Frances adds to the excitement and intrigue. There are also some fascinating interactions with Navajo tribes – we see that when the youth groups visit their land to ‘help’ with works and maintenance as part of their Christian obligations. This part of the story really made me think of how ‘us’ white people think, and often patronise, First Nations people – all with the best intentions. But we are often hopelessly misguided. It really confuses me how to best handle matter – I feel all at sea.Faith does play a significant role in this and as a non-believer, I was initially worried. But the deep dive into faith and how the characters deal with their beliefs, was to me, so very interesting. It was so well done; I believe I have a slightly better understanding of the smoke and mirrors (to me) of this aspect of the human condition. That’s a good thing methinks.Overall – just brilliant. I was thrilled to learn recently this is the first of an eagerly anticipated trilogy as the near-600 pages of this chunkster was nowhere near enough.5 StarsNote to a mate: Tezza sorry – I promised less than 400 words, I seem to have checked in at 624.

She is also missing her mother, who died a while back, leaving her father and her to run their laundry business. But it’s really the 13-year-old Marjorie who runs the show. Dad is sad.Now this is where Graphic Novels hit the mark for me – we usually use our minds-eye to envisage a character in a novel, and that’s cool. But here, the image of poor Marjorie shows a truly sad girl. She's really miserable. She appears awkward and totally despondent as she deals with the downs of her life and the stress of dealing with obnoxious customers in the struggling family business. Oh dear.It just so happens, a bunch of ghosts – you know, the conventional sheeted ones visit Marjorie’s laundry from time to time and cause all types of mayhem. Now, there’s a bad man involved, and his name is Nigel Saubertuck – what a nasty bloke he is too – well, he’s trying to con Marjorie into handing over the business to him in exchange for a bogus offering.This work has the classic good vs. evil elements with the added dimension of the old-fashioned ghost adorned in their white sheets – who play a major role in the outcome.I enjoyed this 4 StarsMany thanks to NetGalley for handing me a copy of this enjoyable book in exchange for my thoughts....more",Notes are private!,3,47,1,"Jul 21, 2023","Jul 30, 2023","Jul 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38958846-sheets

Yes, this heroic effort of mine (let’s not deny it), this time, resulted in me obtaining a freshly bloodstained copy of A Hero of Our Time by Mikhail Lermontov.Russian poet and author Lermontov was strutting his stuff in the 1830s. He was arrested for an invective poem early in his career, banished to serve in the Army in the Caucasus due to being involved in a duel, cited for bravery twice (but the Tsar refused to give him the award) and eventually he was killed in another duel in 1841, following a trivial personal insult. Dead at 26.The author’s knowledge of the Caucasus mountains is on display in this book, his descriptions about this beautiful part of the world are nothing short of atmospheric.[image]The Caucasus as described by our author Lermontov.However, this is a story about a man. The despicable, Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin. Admittedly, he is superficially charming. But he is a seducer, a rake, cynical, Machiavellian, uncaring and selfish. Pechorin manages to weasel his way into various situations in all types of society leaving behind a trail of broken hearts and dreams. This man is flawed to be sure.When referring to a beautiful woman who fell for him, Pechorin reflected “The ignorance and simple heartedness of the one becomes as tiresome as the coquettishness of the other. If you like, I still love her I am grateful to her for several sufficiently sweet minutes. I would give my life for her, only I am bored in her company.”This unusual adventure is told by an unnamed narrator who describes Pechorin from the perspectives of several individuals and even Pechorin’s own journals. This is a gripping story, a ripping yarn. I cannot spoil the ending – but Pechorin’s character is deliciously revealed as the story progresses. Oh yes, he is a bastard of the highest order. The clever thing is – one would never know if meeting him casually. It makes one reflect – these people really do walk among us.Grigory Alexandrovich had teased him so unmercifully that the boy was almost driven to drown himself”I often ask myself why I strive so doggedly for the love of young ladies, whom I don’t want to seduce, and I don’t want to marry!”Pechorin, is not a one-dimensional being, he is complex. There are times the reader may feel sympathy for him. This examination of a man, and the implications of his behaviour is certainly worthy of a read – I am so glad I did. It is such a shame this author died so young.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,4,104,1,"Jul 20, 2023","Jul 26, 2023","Jul 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/750487.A_Hero_of_Our_Time

The book starts with recollections of the time immediately prior to Henry going to war – we learn about his wife Mabel, his children, and his life in Britain at the time.Henry was caught by the Nazis on the Franco-Belgian border in mid-1940. Reading the details of a participant in the war in Europe, one realises just how brutal it was – the German’s attacks were ferocious and unrelenting. Henry was part of the medical-corps, and as such was often looking after injured allied soldiers in makeshift conditions, with meagre supplies. You can really feel a sense of hopelessness regarding his situation. When captured – they were kept captive in various labour camps, eventually he and his fellow POWs were marched to Poland to be detained in Auschwitz Camp IV, for POWs. The treatment he and the other POWs received on this march (death march) was appalling. Stragglers were either left to die, or shot.Henry regularly added to his secret diary up until the end of the war in 1945. Naturally, we read about the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and the even-more brutal way they treated others, such as the Poles and Jews. He survived five years of not knowing if he was going to be alive at the end of the day – imagine the fatigue, mentally and physically?Henry was a keen musician, and a good one at that. He was given the responsibility of creating and managing the ‘camp band’. They would put on shows periodically for the Germans as well as the POWs. It seemed to be the main thing that kept him going. That and the love for his family, particularly his wife (“the wife”), Mabel.The final few chapters details Henry’s return home following the end of the war. This was no easy thing, as you could imagine. Sometimes it’s difficult to reintegrate back into family life after a hard day at work, imagine doing the same after 5 years as a POW? For those interested in WWII history, you will find this a worthwhile read. The book was written by his granddaughter Jaci Byrne, taken from his notes he kept secret during his time in captivity.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,3,31,1,"Jul 18, 2023","Jul 31, 2023","Jul 18, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/55170568-the-music-maker-of-auschwitz-iv

This beautiful woman is engaging, capricious, untidy, and attractive – mysterious too. She is beautiful on the eye to be sure, instantly attractive; everything seems exciting about her.

Importantly, she doesn’t give false promises. Just because others fall for her charms, and they are substantial, does that mean she’s obliged to reciprocate their emotions towards her?

However, it offers more than a mystery to be solved. This genre and I are relative strangers, but due to reading s from GR mates, it piqued my interest.The story is based in Scotland and our main character, John Docherty, needs to place his mother into a nursing home following a stroke. He also needs to deal with her house and contents as Dad died a while back. His younger brother, Chris, is absent, living overseas and enjoying the high life with a wealthy girlfriend. Chris does visit John early in this story, and then takes off to Europe leaving John to deal with sorting out his Mum’s affairs.When John was a wee boy, his older brother, Thomas, disappeared assumed dead. John cannot remember this Thomas, in fact John cannot recall much of his childhood. He is now a teacher, and with all he is dealing with he starts to have serious attendance issues, much of this due to heavy drinking. John has a relationship with a lovely woman called Angela who has a little daughter – John is lucky to have this woman, any reader would hope he can hang onto her as he spins out of control.When sifting through the family belongings in his Mum’s house, John discovers something that changes everything and sends him on a journey which not only hopes to find out what happened to his missing brother, but also reveals dark family secrets.This story ventures into dark areas, parts are confronting. I had a couple of ‘oh gosh’ moments – for sure. I could not put this one down and have been reading it into the early ours of the morning and absolutely loving it. I always feel like I am doing something really naughty when reading past 2 am. Good hey?The characters are all nicely fleshed out, and this is unpredictable, dark, and even darker in some places. I am sure if you enjoy a good mystery, you will love this. As a bonus you will have plenty to think about when you have finished. Highly recommended.

There were many attempts to usurp power from the monarchy, the Tsars weren’t popular. Nicholas II has been characterised as the most useless of the useless, and early in 1917, under considerable pressure, he abdicated and later in the year the Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin, overthrew the provisional Russian Government. [image]Nicholas II, the first, the original, the truest Communist ‘joke’After several years of brutal civil war – Lenin’s mob, the Bolsheviks, ended up victors. What followed was 70 years of brutal communist rule by the Soviets.This easy-to-read piece covers the main players during the period leading up to the 1917 revolution(s) and up until Lenin’s death after the Russian Civil War. There is so much to learn here, the amount of information is perfect for lovers of history to learn about this pivotal time. The author skilfully provides just enough information and depth to makes this meaty enough for history lovers. There are some great pictures and photos too.This piece also gave me reason to really think about the implications of politics. It really is a matter of live and death. I highly recommend this to those wanting a leg up into this period of Russian history. It is fascinating. I will certainly be digging deeper into various aspects, and actors of this period of Russian history in future.[image]Lenin committed many crimes, but by far the greatest was to have left a man like Stalin in pole position to take over from him [image]Lenin thought Stalin was a ‘good soldier’ someone to do the dirty work – however, due to Lenin’s early death the vacuum was open for Stalin to step in, and step in he did.4 StarsMany thanks to NetGalley for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for my thoughts....more",Notes are private!,3,71,1,"Jul 07, 2023","Jul 20, 2023","Jul 06, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/86476222-the-russian-revolution

I’m not sure about you – but when I read that, I knew I was in for one helluva ride.If any of you have watched Black Mirror on Netflix (I loved it), this collection is similar. It’s disturbing, ‘in your face’ and outrageous. I really had to sit and think at times “what the hell was that about?”.Like when I was put inside the head of a school shooter, an all to familiar scene in the US. Or when the first-person character I was inhabiting woke up to find a foetus on his pillow, a foetus that punched him in the ear – only to be joined by his foetal twin sister not long after. They bickered like most siblings do, as they slowly expired over the course of the fifteen pages. This, a story about abortion. Wow. Then there’s the piece about a guy working in a clothing store – mundane right? It was, until customers started killing each other as they rushed into the store on sale day “Friday Black”. Punters haggling for the best price as bodies were being stacked in the corner.

This usually does the trick.The Diary of a Madman by Nikolay Gogol did not disappoint. In this short story we witness a low-level clerk, Aksenty Ivanovich Poprishchin, descend into madness. Gogol writes this in the first person as a daily diary. This gave me a real sense intimacy with Poprishchin. Almost like he was chatting in a chair next to me,As with many Gogol characters, this poor fellow is obsessed with hierarchy and status, he’s also miserable. His diary shows he is frustrated, and he speaks very disparagingly about his colleagues and the head of department. However, his adoration of the director is nothing short of sycophantic. He is also obsessed with the director’s daughter, who is about to be married.The first sign of madness occurs when he overhears two dogs talking to each other on a street, one of these dogs belongs to the director’s daughter, which becomes important later in the story. These two dogs write letters to each other, no less!Each entry starts with the date – for example, October 4th. I was really taken aback and did chuckle when an entry stated the date as April 43rd 2000, these headings continued to indicate further deterioration – another example is Madrid, 30th Februarius – now that did make me laugh!!!”I was so worried I put my socks and shoes on and hurried into the state council room to instruct the police not to let the earth land on the moon”Poprishchin, continues to plummet into insanity – he even thinks he is a Spanish monarch. Even though this was an amusing story, I did fell very sad for this chap – really, there is nothing funny about this at all. It’s a credible study of what someone with a severe mental illness may experience. I felt guilty for laughing at him earlier in the piece. [image]So, if you like absurdity, a bit of humour (guilt or not), random unrelated nonsense, talking dogs (they write too!), romantic tragedy, during an interesting period of history – you’ll like this. I have enjoyed other Gogol short stories more – but this was entertaining, a bit funny, sad, and engaging. 4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Jun 17, 2023","Jun 17, 2023","Jun 17, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/11099209-the-diary-of-a-madman

He attracts attention no matter where he goes, a real presence. Basil HallwardA classic indeedDorian Gray is a superbly handsome young man, stunning. He attracts attention no matter where he goes, a real presence. Basil Hallward, a painter, adores Dorian and paints a portrait of the young man. Now, there is something special about this painting – in fact, Basil said ” “but I really can’t exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.”. Sounds a bit weird doesn’t it. But there is something very different about this painting.Dorian is struck by his image ” I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose?”. The wish of keeping his looks is Dorian’s first mistake. A mistake he will pay for dearly.Along comes the odious Lord Henry Wotton. Oh my, I found this bloke tedious. Every conversation he was involved in, always ended up with him quipping a one-liner. In addition to this superficiality – as quotes without any real substance, are in my view, he had a terrible influence on Dorian. As well as complimenting him (to put it mildly) about his looks, he encouraged him to seek pleasure in everything he does. Henry told him not to suppress desires. He corrupted Dorian totally – and turned him into a selfish, narcissistic young man, who did nothing but admire his own looks and suck the pleasure out of everything and everyone around him. Henry’s views of women were appalling too. I wonder if Oscar Wilde shared many of the views espoused by Lord Henry?For there is only one thing worse than being talked about, and that’s not being talked about I didn’t know that was a Wilde quote, can you believe? This reminds me of a Monty Python sketch back in the day – this really typifies everything Lord Henry is about, and perhaps even Oscar Wilde himself. Take a look!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXZJF...Oscar and the chattering classThere are certainly homosexual undertones in this story, there’s intrigue, suspense, and abject tragedy. There is also much to be said about art. I read a book, earlier this year which was full of Wilde musings and indeed, he had a great deal to say about art,  here https://www.goodreads.com//show.... There are many messages in this book about the subject – I’m looking forward to looking up references to learn more about his thoughts on this.This is a dark story. I ended up feeling sorry for Dorian, he was corrupted utterly by Lord Henry and turned into a nasty, hedonistic type. However, there was one occasion when he was happy, but alas – this was taken from him quick smart. Dorian does commit a foul act in this story – something quite shocking, this among a litany of bad deeds.Will Dorian reform? Will he see what he’s become? If you haven’t read this one you’ll have to find out. To me the ending kind of made sense, nothing to complicated. The writing is also unintimidating, some classics can be difficult to read (for me anyway) but Wilde used plain language, it was easy to follow. Perhaps except for one chapter, which was a bit of a slog.A wonderful story. I was lucky enough to share this experience with Antoinette who was great company during this buddy read!

For me, this book is in three distinct parts:1.	Bloody interesting (the Octopus bit)2.	Bloody fascinating (the general evolution bit)3.	Bloody confusing (the lengthy bits about consciousness and the philosophy of consciousness)The author suggests the octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. Meaning (I think) , our last common ancestor goes back some 600 million years, hence – the eventual mammalian side of the tree, evolving from our common ancestor, slowly developed into beings of incredible intelligence (us). However, the Cephalopod (octopus) line developed into a whole bunch of other creatures, with limited brain capacity (various invertebrates for example) except for the Cephalopods – who are clever. So, the author suggests these bright, cheeky, curious creatures – and their intelligence developed independently and separately from our side of the tree. This presents an interesting study of brain development separate to us...............My God, I hope that makes sense.It's really, intelligence different from our own.Captive octopuses squirt water at only certain individuals in labs, they escape, they perform well in experiments to demonstrate decision making and intelligence. They have a fascinating relationship between their ‘central’ brain – the one in their cute head – and the brain-like neural structures in their legs. It’s fascinating – the big brain ‘casts’ out the leg towards a target, and then the mini brains do the rest – such as grab a crab for lunch. Amazing stuff. This is just one example of scores of interesting things you can learn in this book.[image]Curious, fiendish, mischievous, aware, playful and absolutely BEAUTIFUL – these creatures can maintain eye contact in captivity, usually in a tank, and when the researcher’s back is turned – they make a run for it – they even use tools, to create a place to rest in the wild!!!!!I was also fascinated by our last common ancestor with Cephalopods. The thin worm-like creature with little slits for ‘eyes’, swimming around the oceans 600 million years ago (other sources I’ve read indicate up to 750 million years ago). [image]Bear with me with this idea: If you and your octopus mates were having a barbie and invited this chap around – you and the cephalopods present would both be entitled to say, “Would you like a beer Grandad?”The lengthy section on philosophy and consciousness – put me to shame. I tried to understand – I achieved this periodically, but I was lost in the woods. More my problem than the author’s (it’s me, not you). But I’m sure there’s some bright sparks out there who will get it. In some ways this book was a case of ”The more you know, the more you know you don’t know”My plan now is to have lunch, have a snooze and then re-watch My Octopus Teacher on Netflix through new eyes. Highly recommended.4.5 stars rounded down due to my scuffles with consciousness and my concern for these bright, sensitive creatures being held in tanks in a lab. There were also results of experiments whereby the poor things were dissected – not by the author, it needs to be said. But I found these very occasional parts incredibly confronting and sad. Oh, we could’ve done with lots of pictures of these beautiful animals too.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Jun 11, 2023","Jun 26, 2023","Jun 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28116739-other-minds

This story delivers The Fountain of Silence by Ruta Sepetys is the best book I have read this year and I’ve been lucky enough to read some good ones. This story delivers suspense, history, violence, love, heartache, Madrid and even one or two chuckles.This piece of historical fiction commences in 1957 during the dark days of Francisco’s iron-fist rule of Spain (1936-1975). The main character, Daniel Matheson, is the son of a rich Texan oil tycoon (el texano) who is visiting Spain to sort out an oil deal with the Dictator. Daniel is in his late teens and has some ability as a photographer – as such, he spends his days taking pictures of the country and its people. This is a risky endeavour – as taking a photograph of a subject like the Guardia Civil, could result in a beating and a prison stay. Nevertheless, Daniel is curious and brave.[image]Daniel was inspired by great photographers like Robert Capa – this taken by Capa during the moment a loyalist (anti-fascist) soldier was killed during the brutal civil war. Capa was quoted as saying “If you’re photo isn’t good enough, you’re not close enough”. Alas, Capa died in the field.Danny Boy meets a beautiful young hotel maid called Ana who is assigned to look after his wealthy family – Daniel and Ana have some sort of affinity with each other, but it’s Franco/Catholic Spain, fraternising isn’t easy. Everyone who isn’t a maid, has oneA key part of this story is the terrible program of stealing, yes stealing, new-born babies (by informing the parents the baby died) and selling them to wealthy Spaniards (Fascists) and other nationalities. It is estimated that three hundred thousand babies were adopted to ‘more deserving’ parents up until 1980, can you believe? [image]Franco’s brutal Guardia CivilThis ties into ‘the Ana and Daniel’ story – I won’t tell you how, because I don’t want to spoil. The cast of characters is super interesting – such as a poor gravedigger boy who wants to become a matador, Ana’s poor family living in squalor, the US Ambassador to Spain (this is a relationship worth learning more about), hotel staff and importantly Sister Hortensia and the people and babies at the inclusa and many more. Fortune born into, unearned. The mute accomplice of fate that determines futures and carves lines to dividePart two of the book commences at the time immediately after Franco’s death in 1975. Massive changes afoot, but a country in disarray. I can’t give you any further details as it will give the story away.[image] El Vaille de los caedos – (The Valley of the Fallen), a massive Franco monument – the tallest cross in the world. Forty tonnes of bones of civil war victims are buried here. So was Franco – he’s not now, as it caused a tremendous amount of controversy – no wonder!!The author manages to mix a story about love, and horror and she manages to do this with care. You can almost smell it. Reading Sepety's ""Author's Note"", she describes the amount of research she did and the love she has for this beautiful country and its wonderful, resilient people.Sepety’s writing is sublime. Make no mistake this is a mighty story with relatable characters. I highly recommend this.

How lucky to have a trifecta of satirists and piss-takers on hand now, just waiting for me to pluck out a story and have a ball. The other two being Gogol and Kafka, of course. This piece was written by Voltaire in 1759.Candide was an impressionable young man, he was a very gullible, kind hearted young man. He was influenced by his tutor, a man called Pangloss. This man’s mantra was this world we live in is “the best of all possible worlds”. Or as is said down under “She’ll be right mate.” Everything will work out in the end, for the good. This had a massive impact in the impressionable Candide.Pangloss was a professor of metaphysicotheologico-cosmolo-nigology. He and Candide were living in a castle in a place called Whestphalia owned by the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh. You can imagine, as soon as I read these words, I knew I was in for one helluva ride. [image] Candide caught in the act of trying to seduce the gorgeous CunegondeCandide falls for the scrumptious Cunegonde, the Baron’s daughter. As soon as the Baron discovers this – Candide is kicked out of the castle and what follows next is a journey across the globe whereby he encounters many dreadful people and situations. The horrors he experiences, sees, or hears from other people include, rape, murder, enslavement, thieving, whipping, the inquisition, earthquakes, monkeys chasing naked young maidens and biting their buttocks, burning at the stake – to name only a handful.The villainy of mankind presented itself before his imagination in all its deformity, and his mind was filled with gloomy ideasCandide started to have serious doubts about Pangloss’s overly optimistic philosophy of life. In fact, Voltaire spends considerable time dismantling the notion of supreme optimism here, and he does an incredibly good job. He also explores the idea of happiness, and fulfilment – and his view on how to achieve that.This book is a lovely amalgam of philosophy, history and fun – my  has only scratched the surface.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,71,1,"Jun 26, 2023","Jul 02, 2023","Jun 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19380.Candide

It is educational and useful – I can’t believe this was in my bookcase and I forgot about it.[image]It’s not all about ancient history, e.g., you can learn about this magnificent structure. It’s at one end of the Forum, you will see this easily, it dominates – it’s modern and massive. The Vittorio Emanuele II was built to commemorate Italian unification and completed in 1889..

Because of this book.The photos are and high quality and numerous, the paper is glossy and heavy/thick. It isn’t cheap. Well, it was but, you know what I mean. The history and descriptions are serious and scholarly.

This is a clever examination of darker sides of our personalities – surely, we all have one? Some darker than others no doubt. In this case, as we know – Dr Jekyll’s potion unleashes his darker version in the form of Mr Hyde. A despicable creature without morals who commits various nefarious activities around London Town of the late 1880s.Mr Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable deformation, he had a displeasing smileThis novella is presented in short chapters describing key events and is described from the points of view of various protagonists. It closes with Dr Jekyll’s full statement of the case. For such a short story, there is a lot here. The idea of Jekyll creating a version of himself with only his “evil bits” contained, to commit its heinous acts with gay abandon, is fascinating. Is Jekyll innocent in this endeavour? Does the fact that he is prepared for his evil side to commit crimes, while his suave side can strut around with impunity a good thing? I don’t think so. [image]Dark, dank London – what a settingThis Penguin Classics version of this story is excellent. Each section/chapter contains many notes – providing context, and other interesting facts for the reader. This really adds to the experience. Apart from the psychological intrigue here – I enjoyed the feeling of dank, darkness of London at this time – it must have been a dreadful place to be.The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or deathI’m not so sure this was a real horror experience for me, more psychological intrigue and just a bit chilling.I will read this again and read about this again so I can indulge in another serve of scientific intrigue, compound pharmaceutical techniques, next level psychology, murder, and mayhem.

The story is set in 1945 Barcelona. Daniel is the son of a second-hand bookseller. He is taken by his father to a place called “The Cemetery of Forgotten Books”. This is a gothic, cobwebbed, library of old books – rare ones. Books kept nice and snug in perpetual safety, safe from oblivion. Daniel is given the opportunity to select a book, a book he can take home and keep – he chooses one called The Shadow of the Wind written by an enigmatic character called Julian Carax. Daniel learns Carax is from Barcelona, his home. Young Daniel is transfixed by this story and the author of this book that sold only a handful of copies. He needs to find him and know more. Intriguing right?The Good BitsFranco’s Spain is something I have recently been introduced to and this aspect I found interesting. This story doesn’t dwell on fascist Spain – most of the horrors are described through a nasty man called Inspector Fumero, a very cruel man who works for the regime. You wouldn’t want to experience his wrath. This helps contribute to a consuming feeling of fear and suppression – it was palpable. I also enjoyed the gothic ‘feel’ of this piece, the descriptions of Barcelona, at this time, really hit home for me – enough to keep me reading. I also liked the focus on books, stories, and storytelling.The Daggy BitsA major issue I experienced was, there are numerous characters, with their own stories – switches in narratives, and timelines – 'twas excessive. It must be said, the author did pull it all together at the end of the story. But I was confused well before that – and was frustrated, rereading passages – maybe I should have just sat back and let it sink in, you know – flow. But I just couldn’t find a rhythm. I was confused, detached, and was left wondering. Also, some of the characters were a bit annoying, like Daniel’s homeless mate Fermin. Too unreal, cocky, and trying to be funny in situations that weren’t so funny (yeah, yeah – I know I do that too, but this guy was too much).Usually, I don’t mind this, as the progeny of horrific situations can be humour, dark humour, but I found him a bit tiresome.In summary, I won’t labour the point, but this was a real slog. I persisted because I thought it would get better. You all know the feeling when you feel a sense of dread when you must drag yourself to a book for your next session? Yes? You know, stuff like shouting at the dogs, squatting butterflies, swearing at the warm tropical breeze as one reaches for the book.I probably will remember this one for all the wrong reasons. The bad outweighed the good.2 Stars...more",Notes are private!,2,70,1,"Jun 27, 2023","Jul 02, 2023","May 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind

Here, I’ll highlight some of Sensational by Ashley Ward takes the reader through each of our five senses in a fascinating and sometimes humorous way. Here, I’ll highlight some of the items I found most interesting.Animal species view the world quite differently. For example, birds have 4 types of colour receptors to our three. So, when we see a starling it’s a dull, mottled brown – but to another starling it’s a lively mix of purples, green and blues. Reindeer can see in the UV range – this makes lichen stand out in the tundra and on it goes. Vision is often voted the most important sense. In fact, this illustrated anatomically – as vision receptors number around 200 million and consumes most of the brain’s processing resources – in fact more than the rest of the senses combined.Do you know the most hated sounds for humans isn’t the sound of a barking dog, a child screaming, a dentist’s drill or nails screeching down a blackboard ?– the most frequent winner in studies is the sound of someone vomiting. Uuuuurrrgghh – I can’t argue with that.Music is discussed, and our appreciation of it.There’s a magical sense not only of the beauty of music but also in the sense of bringing people together The author illustrates this with the following version of “Ode to Joy”. The people watching and listening are enthralled. It's great to see.Please check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxLbm... it’s wonderful and if you are anything like me you’ll have a tear in your eye and the hairs on the back of your neck will stand up (particularly if you’ve got your headphones cranked!!) Smell - the sense I found the most interestingThis chapter I found to be the most fascinating. We smell by odour chemicals in the air getting stuck in the sticky mucous of our nasal passages, and transported to receptors at the top (7cm in) of our nasal cavity. Here, there’s a postage sized area of olfactory receptors – around 800 of them. These receptors then code information to the pea-sized olfactory bulbs and then onto the brain for processing. All this takes a fifth of a second – aren’t we super clever?There is still so little we know about smell – such as what molecular structures result in a certain smell. Smell is very difficult to measure. Imagine identifying the limitless combinations of molecules responsible for the many, many different smells we experience. Surveys repeatedly show (in Western countries) that smell is the sense we would be most prepared to lose – I think I would concur with that. It’s worth noting that humans perform very poorly in smelling studies – for example, studies show that one half of subjects were able to identify the smell of an orange, a fifth of us identified coffee and very rarely cheese was identified by odour alone. I think that’s surprising.Women have us blokes beaten in the smelling stakes. The author even said our (men, us, me) often can’t smell our own body odour, whereas the women in our lives, using their stellar olfactory senses (up to 50% more neurons) can smell us a mile away. Personally, I think that’s unfair, and I have little time for show-offs. Also, heterosexual women judge men on their smell!! We are set up to fail dammit!!Men tend to have a predominance of Corynebacterium in their normal skin flora – which produce a cheesier flagrance whereas women’s armpits seem to favour Staphylococcus , lending the hint of onion to their bouquet. Love it!!!The author also overs touch and taste in easy-to-understand detail and humour leading into the last two chapters where he discusses how our senses work together, as a team. Sometimes, this can be disrupted in a condition called synaesthesia. This is where an individual may shake someone’s hand, and in addition to sensing touch, they might taste lemons. This discussion was fascinating, as was the last chapter, which discussed perception. This last chapter ties everything together. There are individual differences on how we perceive and interpret certain stimuli – is my red the same as yours, or my description of a wine’s bouquet as the inviting smell of iron filings the same as yours? Perception was mentioned repeatedly throughout this book and is obviously key to how we experience our world and those in it.This book is terrific. The author knows his stuff – in some places, the information he provides is dense, but it moves on when one has just had enough. The author is also funny – and I appreciate that (always). 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars - I’d better have a shower now....more",Notes are private!,2,83,1,"May 12, 2023","May 28, 2023","May 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61157642-sensational

This book introduces the reader to Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Marius, the legendary military hero and consul and Sulla his offsider - dashing, cavalier and a brutal military leader. The Grass Crown is #2 in the series (97-86 BCE)  https://www.goodreads.com//show...We continue to see Marius and Sulla run rampant throughout the provinces, but importantly and super-interestingly, we see their relationship start to deteriorate. This ends up being bloody, nasty, and very interesting indeed. We first see Julius Caesar, as a young, bright, shiny little boy.Fortunes Favourites # 3 in the series (83-69 BCE) – mostly covers the post-Marius period (he died in 86 BCE), the poor guy finally succumbed to a couple of strokes. Young Caesar looked after him during his period of sickness. Sulla is old, haggard, toothless, bald (red, curly wig – yes!!) and drunk. But he still has his wits about him, and he ends up marching on Rome (a big – no, no) and makes himself Dictator. Now dictatorship is incompatible with Rome’s Republican model (Senate, Consuls, Legates, Censors, plebs etc) as it places the power in the hands of one man – in this case, Sulla. Dictatorship is usually reserved for times of calamity, as is the case now. The Roman Republic is a mire of corruption and is not functioning as it should.Without delay Sulla creates a list of proscriptions – those who need to die (usually because they were allies of Marius) and, importantly, have their assets seized by the state to fill Sulla’s pockets and the pockets of his sycophants. This is a comprehensive (….and loose) list and is acted upon with violent relish. Sulla introduces draconian changes to the political system and judiciary. He installs numerous standing courts for specific crimes, Senators are forced to sit on more juries, the Assembly of the Plebians is dismantled among many. All memory of Marius is cancelled – a process known as, Damnatio memoriae. Here, statues and images of the great general and seven-time consul are destroyed, the Marius hard-drive is erased. However, many citizens still love him.In addition to the expansive geographical scope covered, here is a massive cast in Fortunes Favourites - the most significant three (for me) are:Julius Caesar: In his twenties. He holds a massive intellect, and his oratory skills are second to none (except for Cato perhaps). He also develops into a powerful political player, a go-to-man, if people want things fixed, or problems sorted – they see Caesar. His relationships with women (his mother, auntie, wife, daughter, and his scores of lovers predominate – he often cuckolded rival politicians – “taking one for the team”. Caesar is uber-Machiavellian. Pompey: Perhaps the most arrogant, self-assured, but capable General one could come across. His troops love him, the populous adore him. He earns his stripes leading battles in Africa and Sicily. Pompey does, however, eat some humble pie when he gets a spanking in near Spain later in the book. But Pompey being Pompey – he comes back better than ever. Oh, he’s good looking too.Crassus: A dour, meticulous, capable military leader. Crassus had blue blood coursing through his veins. He was instrumental in the defeat of Spartacus in the Third Servile War a conflict that caused considerable embarrassment to the Rome. The space McCoullough spends on the “Spartacus Incident” is the size of a novella, this is the beauty of McCullough’s penchant for writing massive books – it has it all!!![image]They will become the first triumvirate in times to come Apparently, Pompey was handsome. Now, I'm no Robert Redford, but Pompey - handsome???Crucifixion is explained in detail, a punishment used by Crassus when punishing the runaway slaves in the Spartacus revolt. Details such as – if the victim was scheduled for a quick (merciful) death – their legs were broken, thus prohibiting the person to support themselves with their feet – they would therefore hang from their arms and hands and die within hours. However, if one really wanted to make a point – no bones were broken, and the victim would support themselves with their feet and legs and die slowly over several days. Crassus crucified over six thousand slaves after defeating Spartacus, by placing crosses everyone hundred feet along one side of the Appian Way from Rome to Capua. An intimidating sight to be sure.Crassus also felt the need to ‘decimate’ his legions as they were inexperienced and often fled the arena of battle in the early days of his command. This involved groups of ten soldiers drawing lots and the unlucky one was beaten to death by the others. Apparently, this improved morale.McCullough’s research is colossal and discussed in the Author’s Afterword. There were times I needed to check if events in these books happened and yes, they did happen. She includes mentions of her references and a two-hundred-page glossary which is interesting reading. Oh, and one other thing – there are maps galore! What else does one need?What a masterpiece.5 Blistering Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,45,2,"May 23, 2023May 07, 2023","Jun 07, 2023May 23, 2023","May 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/550344.Fortune_s_Favourites

That is an amazingly MASSIVE number – I almost vomited trying to get my mind around that number of years. He accomplishes this in just over 240 pages.The author breaks the book down into:1	The inanimate phase: 13.8 billion to 3.8 billion years ago.2	The animate phase: 3.8 billion to 315,000 years ago.3	The cultural phase: 315,000 years to the present.4	From the present to the future, near, deep and the end.If you look at the previous passage, you will notice how little time we have been here and how insignificant we are in the overall scheme of things. It has taken us billions of years to show up, and we’ve been around for only 300,000 years and we will probably disappear in less than that time. Thereafter, Mother Earth and the Universe will trundle on for thousands of billions of years until it finally expires.The themes the author uses consistently throughout are:1	Complexity of society (there’s an interesting cycle described here).2	The energy flows of that society/organism/being.3	Communal learning (how we develop and innovate).This above provides a nice framework for this author to express and make sense of some of the complex issues discussed here.This is an intelligent book, professionally written, and it obviously moves fast – very fast. But to pull off something like this in such a short book is an impressive feat. Our planet has already been through a lot – fire and ice, wet and dry, extreme violence, hot and cold – there will be plenty more to come, to be sure.The author does close on a lovely note by saying “Be brave, be good to each other”. For the short time we are here, individually and as a species, amongst all the complexity and pushing and shoving, I couldn’t think of a better way to finish.

This industrious woman works seven days a week collecting and washing the clothes of the inhabitants of a small country town in Central Florida. Her husband of 15 years, Sykes, is a cruel, lazy, promiscuous man who has beaten his wife for the fifteen years of their miserable marriage.Delia’s habitual meekness seemed to slip from her shoulders like a blown scarf.

There are also some clever tools used by the author to convince the reader there is something about to happen, foreboding – suspense. Poverty and race is also a theme – and the author also used some religious metaphors to add to the expectation of an inevitable (unpleasant) ending.Delia went clear to the rail without answering him. A triumphant indifference to all that he is, was or did. From my experience the death knell in any relationship is indifference. The point of no return.The ending is indeed inevitable and necessarily horrific. [image]For those who don’t know – as I didn’t – Zora Neale Hurston, was a filmmaker, anthropologist, and a writer.

Hagar was born in 1886 and is now 90 years old, living with her onlyHagar is the protagonist of The Stone Angel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence. Hagar was born in 1886 and is now 90 years old, living with her only living son, Marvin, and his wife Doris. This book is essentially Hagar reflecting on her life and recalling pivotal moments and the decisions she has made along the way. This is done via Hagar’s POV, which adds intimacy to this story. By the end, the reader will have no doubts what Hagar is ‘all about’. (Or don’t Canadians say ‘aboot’?).I’ll try and describe Hagar in a few choice words: Opinionated, grumpy, direct, unhappy, large, unfriendly, judgmental. I think she would have been a handful to be around. Of course, using single words provides only superficial understanding. The author is so good here, as she shoves various nuances our way involving some not so 'black and white' situations, as we embark on a journey of Hagar’s life. But to be honest – I didn’t really like her, not when I first met her anyway.It's clear Marvin and Doris want to put Hagar into a Nursing Home. As you could well imagine, Hagar is not too pleased. Laurence gives the reader a chance to pause and be sympathetic to Hagar here (first person helps), but we also can be sympathetic towards Marvin and Doris. She’s forgetful and certainly not well. I didn’t like Doris very much, I must say – and I think she often, quite intentionally, put Marvin in difficult situations. She also foisted an annoying clergyman onto Hagar at the most inopportune times, much to the annoyance of the old lady. That would’ve been way too much to bear.Some of the memories told include Hagar’s childhood – her mother died early, and her father was from Scottish gentry, quite rich when he immigrated to Canada. Unfortunately, he didn’t leave Hagar any money when he died. There are some painful memories involving her brothers as well. Bram is another character we meet – this guy was Hagar’s husband. Here we have another individual we can get our choppers into and dislike with a passion. I didn’t like him one bit, he was stingy with his time, money, and emotions. His marriage to Hagar was miserable. The question that kept going through my mind was, would Hagar have been happier if she married a better man, someone more generous? Or was her abrasive manner partly, or fully responsible for the miserable life she seemed to have lived? I think a bit of both – but if one really thinks about it – no matter how dislikable Bram was, I wonder if Hagar would have found a more emotionally giving man? I really doubt it – I think Hagar would have presented a dreadful first impression.We come across other family members, such as her other son John and old school ‘friends’. People she meets in hospital and a couple of strangers who happen to fall into her orbit. Laurence’s spare prose provides very profound understanding of Hagar and her world, particularly on an emotional level. I felt sorry for Hagar, and this book wrapped me up in abject sadness. I life not lived, or hardly lived. Our choices – this story provided me with some opportunities to reflect on my own decisions, good and disastrous, and the impact these decisions had on my life, but also (and more importantly) on the lives of others – many dear to me. Only a good book can make one visit corners of one’s mind and heart to places we don’t really want to go.Hagar did make me laugh sometimes. Her descriptions of others – although always harsh - were often funny (to me). She had an eye for flowers, which made me scurry to Google and see what a particular flower looks like. I am a flower dumbo.I would like to thank my buddy-reader Lisa for enhancing this experience many times over. Lisa prods and pokes me; she asks me questions about things I wouldn’t normally think about – and I am finally understanding metaphors and symbolism. And how to spot the little buggers. I can’t be lazy reading with Lisa – and that’s good. She also has this quiet way of making fun, I like that too.Lisa's  can be found here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...All in all, brilliant.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,"Jul 02, 2023","Jul 11, 2023","May 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1102322.The_Stone_Angel

This one pulled a few surprises and was one of the most imaginative stories I have read for some time.The main character Joe is getting over the death of his grandmother who looked after him as a child. The chapters involving him are narrated in the first person, it gave me an intimate sense of what he is about and what he is going through. However, there is another timeline – this one, narrated third person is about a son of a Pakistani immigrant (to the UK) – Imran. Now this boy has been radicalised and has turned into someone his family do not really know anymore.  Joe’s and Imran’s stories seem destined to meet.Senor Ansbro is an exceptionally good writer – he not only writes about the ordinary, the light and fluffy – he also descends into the grittiness of marginalism and violence. But there is more, the author also introduces a mystical element and funny enough it all works. It all works perfectly.

I have only come across this author once before. A few years back I read Family FurnisHow I Met My Husband is a delightful 10-pager from Alice Munro. I have only come across this author once before. A few years back I read Family Furnishings - collected short stories 1995-2014 and gave that collection 5-stars -  here - https://www.goodreads.com//show... I absolutely loved it.One thing I recall was the simplicity of her writing.This story is set sometime soon after WWII and we follow young Edie – she does not do well in high school, so her parents push her into employment as the help in a country house owned by a veterinarian and his wife and two kids. Edie bakes cakes, does the washing and various other chores and her employers are decent enough.One day an airplane comes scuttling overhead and lands in an adjacent field, previously occupied by a fairground. Chris, the pilot – he learned to fly during the war – sets up joy-flights for this small community. One day Edie meets Chris – I won’t say exactly how they met and what Edie was doing when they met – but meet they did.Anyway, after this ‘coming together’ our story unravels. There is nothing particularly sordid going on here, it is just a normal thing that can happen to anyone – but the situation does contain drama. For me I experienced the usual anxiety when there were risks involved, the potential to be ‘found out’ – also, there is a scorned lover and a wonderful surprise at the end. Oh and of course, being a small township – there is a village gossip, a detestable woman called Loretta Bird. Oh my – I wanted to tell her to shut up. This was light, breezy and fun. The characters were nicely fleshed out in not much time at all, and it was all quite normal and written in such as way – where there was attention paid to detail, but it was written with such ease.I like Alice Munro and will immediately scour GRs to find my next one from her.This was an offering from the GR Short Story Club – it has been a while since I’ve read one from this group, so I need to get back in the saddle.

Almost accidentally funny.Sam had disappeared at the time, with an engineer, an elderly German refugee, Dr Vogel – Dr Vogel, cruelly bent, deaf in one ear, but known to be the greatest expert in Europe on recorded atmosphereYes, Sam Brooks’ department was responsible for the BBC’s archives of sounds. Such as door hinges, footsteps, waterfalls etc. When I read the description of poor old Dr Vogel – I had to laugh. The laughs were quick-fire resulting in that bubble of latent laughter in my chest, ready to go, to be ignited by the merest touch of mirth. Even an exclamation mark could’ve set me off in this part of the story!The BBC is a cross between a civil service, a powerful moral force and an amateur theatre company that wasn’t too sure where next week’s money was coming from.The humour here is typically British, it’s very self-deprecating and whimsical. It’s all acted out in an environment of German Bombers dropping their ordnance on Britain at the time. The author so, so cleverly weaves this light story amongst that horror. That’s clever.I found the first half of the book hilarious; I was constantly laughing. However, the second half I didn’t find funny at all really – now I am not sure if that’s because I was in a different mood, or if it was the writing. So, this experience was a bit uneven, and the character development wasn’t such that without the laughs – I wasn’t left with much else. Having said that – this read was worthwhile, and I will certainly read this author again.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Apr 16, 2023","Apr 20, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/319386.Human_Voices

He believes all his problems can be solved if he acquires more land. So, he’s in a perpetual cycle of selling and vuyong up land elsewhere. He eventually ends up in a faraway place and is offered a very good deal. The offer is interesting, as he needs to walk for a day, in the blistering heat, and create a perimeter of land. This plot will then be his. Sounds good, right? Well, the theme here is Human Greed and how it impacts human behaviour. GREED. GREED. GREED. This was interesting, albeit slightly predictable. 4 StarsThe second story What Men Live By, is a story steeped in religious messaging.

This story is heavy on religious messaging – in fact, it starts with several passages from the bible.

You know, typical Sedaris.He also shared funny jokes – these obtained from people he met on tour, usually during book signings – my favourite:A man is getting ready for bed, when he hears a knock at the door. He opens it and looks down to see a snail. “Yes,” it says , “I’d like to talk to you about buying some magazine subscriptions”.Beside himself with rage, the man rears back, kicks the snail as hard as he can and returns to bed.Two years later there comes another knock on the door. The man answers, and again he finds the snail, who looks up at him and says, “What the f**k was that all about?”That was one of many times I howled with laughter during this delightful read.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Apr 04, 2023","Apr 06, 2023","Apr 04, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52826760-themes-and-variations

Protagonist K. enters a small village located under a large castle on a mountain, its winter, dark, cold, and forever snowing. K. enters an inn and announces he has been engaged by the Count of the Castle as a land surveyor. The initial suspicion and hostility of the locals is transformed into silent acquiescence as a call is made to check with the Central Office of the castle to check K’s. story.Needless to say, Central Office have never heard of K.Now we enter “Kafka-World.” It is a nightmare comprising of self-important, often invisible, administrators (senior and junior), inept assistants – such as secretaries and messengers, inefficient and ineffective departments a bloated self-serving bureaucracy and suspicious and unfriendly locals. All of this, snugly ensconced in a dark, cold, unfriendly environment.K. is buffeted between all the above, he is certainly determined (bahahaha – poor bloke) and he is obsessed about contacting a senior official called Klamm, this guy has all the answers apparently. K. is usually lead on – he gets many false promises if he’s lucky, lots of dead-ends. He’s also allocated two of the most useless assistants one could ever meet – both act like 4-year-olds and make his life worse. Funny enough - K. also ends up being a school janitor and ends up with a fiancée called Freida (Klamm's ex). There are too many other unhelpful & odd characters to mention here – but if you read this you will find the distractions and diversions annoyingly numerous. One can only feel for K. his pain, frustration and desire for help and friendship is palpable.One main, if not the main reason I read is to ”feel”. For an author to make one feel frustrated so completely, a bit angry, to feel bored more than once – and also to chuck in a couple of laughable scenes (more like chuckles really – or irritated chuckles), is no mean feat. Kafka achieves this absolutely and completely. The weight of the novel is considerable. So much so, that I was going to DNF on many occasions. But what compelled me to continue was twofold:1.	My man, Kafka spent a lot of time and effort creating this befuddling world, so I felt an obligation to spend a lot of time in it.2.	To get the whole “Kafka Experience “one must suffer and gobble up every annoying word and situation. So, I did.Without giving the ending away, this story ends mid-paragraph. This was Kafka’s last work – so we can draw our own conclusions whether he died mid-sentence or not. But, in a nightmare story like this – perhaps there is no ending.I hated and loved this.5-StarsNote for those of you who haven't read Kafka - I'm not sure this one is the best to start your bizarre journey.

A human version of All Creatures Great and Small perhaps?.......a quietly amusing medical romp amongst rolling hills, cotton wool ball sheep in the fields, harmless quirky country patients – all in all a relaxing piece to savour.Well, I had to read this bloody thing thrice and I am still trying to figure it out.Our Country Doctor receives a call from the family of a seriously ill man in a village ten miles away. It is snowing, the good doctor has no horse to pull his carriage. So, he goes into the pig sty (yes - pigs to pull the carriage) and lo and behold there’s a couple of strapping horses there, perspiring flanks, twitching muscles – with a groomsman no less, and they’re ready to go. The groomsman is a sleazebag and decides to stay behind to have his willing way with the house maid (Rosa)– who is terrified of him and locks herself in the house. The ten mile trip to the sick man takes a second or two.Now this is where it gets weird. The sick man’s family are babbling indecipherably, the patient is in bed, thin, afebrile, with empty eyes and shirtless. He asks (wheezes) to the doctor - “Let me die”. The phantom horses have loosened their own straps meanwhile and are looking through the window, curious (as they would be). The doctor then starts complaining to himself, reflecting on his own troubles – he doesn’t have his own horse, patients rely on him all the time, unnecessary call-outs in the middle of the night He then discovers a suppurating, ghastly, worm ridden wound on the hip of the patient……..this is when things get weirder…….[image]Okay if you want to know the rest you might want to check this one out.My Thoughts/Reaction - Confusion, insomnia (I read it in bed x 3), incontinence, perspiration, weight loss and a dark, persistent itching on my right hip, and a foreboding feeling of impending doom.Analyses from other sources - Failure, sexual competition (the groomsman), chaos, inability to act, blame, self-pity – plus countless others….The number of analyses I read were proportional to the number of different opinions I saw – I realised each has their own, different, perspective. Which is fine of course, maybe this little story is meant to be opaque and open to individual interpretation? Maybe, Kafka is laughing at us all?4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Apr 02, 2023","Apr 04, 2023","Apr 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/221524.A_Country_Doctor

What a read – what a story, this piece of historical fiction is based on real events using fictional characters created by amalgamating real players of this period of WWII Rome.We are right in the thick of the Nazi occupation. The Nazis are stomping all over the shop, committing all sorts of atrocities and trashing people and places. There are a number of heroic locals committed to making the Nazi’s malignant presence as difficult as possible. Monsignor Hugh O’Flaherty, who would be right up there with Count Rostov as one of my favourite male leads, runs an underground group called The Choir . This clandestine group assists Allied POWs to escape and go into hiding to evade the clutches of the SS and Gestapo. A very dangerous business indeed, and the most frightening illustration of the horrific danger here, is the presence of a cruel SS officer, Paul Hauptmann. You will be hard pressed to find a more sadistic human being than Hauptmann. He was a family man too. Many of these obscene war criminals were – filing down the teeth of prisoners to pulp being interrogated during the day and tucking their kids in bed at night.Four thousand frightened prisoners crammed like abused beasts, half starved, into a couple of barbed-wired stony fields. One doctor, a drunken pervert. No letters. Two latrines. Compulsory hard labour. Frequent beatings.There is a lot of suspense here, a lot of tension, this is a thriller – you will be on edge. For those Romaphiles among us, we see the sights – to assist us, there is a detailed map inside the front cover (I love maps). There are horrors and fascinating characters. This author uses a highly effective way of developing the main characters (largely, choir members) by inserting a few pages on each, spaced throughout the novel. These passages take the form of interview records or reports. I found this such a clever way to build the characters into something tangible. It also assisted with plot development. An interesting aspect of this book, for me, involved the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Nazi aggressors. The Pope even makes an appearance in this story. I need to read some non-fiction of this aspect of the war – there is a lot to learn and try and understand.The last chapter was incredibly emotional.This is a superb 5-Star effort by O’Connor....more",Notes are private!,0,73,1,"Apr 25, 2023","May 03, 2023","Mar 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61447882-my-father-s-house

Dermansky serves up the scenario of a male university professor having sex with a female undergraduate. The good professor then turns up (and stays) at the student’s house and becomes involved with her mother. This student’s father has recently left the mother for a beautiful female pilot. There are a small cast of extras including a pair of sexy female twins, one a lesbian and one straight. The lesbian twin works with the student’s father, and is renting the, the professor’s flat. The straight twin is the professor’s best friend. Things go pear-shaped in this romantic farce. Of course they do.Coincidences run free. The most likable character was a standard poodle called Princess – the professor’s. Yes, this guy is involved in everything and is well up to his neck in it.I was unsure about this when I started, but after a chapter or two – I just LOVED IT. I was so immersed in this romp, I was even reading it as I was walking between rooms, on the toilet, outside (I never read outside – it’s too sticky), I took it in the car in case I broke down, and of course I read it in bed.Brief chapters are rotated between each of the characters and are written in the first person. This produces an immersive experience. There were even suspenseful, risky undertones humming away in the background – I never quite knew how this was going to finish.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Mar 30, 2023","Apr 02, 2023","Mar 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49130301-very-nice

He has written a book that reads like a novel – EveritAuthor, Anthony Everitt’s, Alexander the Great – His Life and His Mysterious Death, is amazing. He has written a book that reads like a novel – Everitt presents a rollicking story of life in antiquity including warfare, geopolitics, riches, violence, realpolitik and uber skull-duggery.Alexander came to power following the assassination of his father, Philip II of Macedonia in 336 BCE. His father was also military leader of great note – so this desire to conquer must’ve been in the familial blood. His relationship with his Mother Olympias, a significant figure herself, was solid for the duration of Alexander’s life. Soon after he grabbed his father’s throne – he campaigned in the Balkans, Thrace, Illyria, Thebes – and he led the League of Corinth (the Greek states – except Sparta) with the lofty ambition of invading Persia – ruled by the Great King Darius. He also dropped into Egypt and nipped over to India ……..a step too far?.Alexander believed he was related to Zeus and Achilles – the latter being an idol of his. Apparently he didn’t go anywhere without Homer’s, The Iliad. Alexander sailed with sixty fighting ships to the land of Troy, where he flung his spear from the ship and fixed it in the ground, and then leapt ashore himself the first of the Macedonians, signifying that he received Asia from the gods as a spear-won prize. (Diodorus XVII. 17)[image]I would have loved to have seen this – imagine!! Yes he may have said, “get that ginger bastard with the glasses and the dodgy knee” – but it would be worth the risk!!The author includes some fantastic, informative maps, of signiciant battles such as The Battle of Gaugamela, and The Battle of Granicus River as well as others. These maps include the locations of infantry, cavalry, mercenaries – the Generals. It’s fascinating – it puts you right there.. This never-ending war certainly presented logistical challenges. Imagining feeding 40, 50, 60 thousand or more troops? This lot pretty much devastated farmlands of the countryside they were progressing through – you can imagine it. He also struck an unusually low casualty rate amongst his troops. This was probably due to a combination of Alexander’s brilliant leadership but also his troops were battle hardened – many left over from the reign of his father King Phillip II. Hardened old codgers. But it wasn’t all beer and skittles – many were sick of this ongoing campaign, even though Alexander paid them well, looked after them, they wanted to go home. So mutinous actions did foment from time to time. Conspirators were dealt with ruthlessly. Alexander was brutal (Impaling makes me a little twitchy) – he could flatten a city, kill everyone, sell captors into slavery - but he could also conduct a softer take-over and use local administrators to keep the place running pretty much as it was before. He had the insight to make sure local populations were needed to maintain the Empire.The author, quite naturally, ends the book detailing (as much as he can) with the death of this gigantic figure. He discusses some of the theories surrounding his death and pros and cons of various theories. He died at 32 years of age, and what an impact he made.I’d still rather have a beer and veggie burger with Ragin’ Trajan, but I’d SMS Alexander if Trajan was unavailable.5 StarsI need to mention, the last one hundred or so pages contains a glossary and a timeline of significant events, he details his sources – this makes interesting reading too.

The main character is a retired agent called Peter Guillam, living in Brittany (which does sound like a beautiful part of the world BTW) and is recalled to the UK as the British Secret Service faces possible legal action due to a colossal blunder that occurred during an operation back in the days of East vs West in Europe . A couple of children of two innocents who were shot dead back in the day are seeking some recourse.Guillam is interviewed (interrogated) by two smarmy, young British Civil Servants (one of them is a guy called ‘Bunny’ would you believe). Our retired agent is required to remember what happened many years ago during this episode, when the Stasi and the KGB were doing their thing, as were the Western Secret Services. I don’t think I will elaborate on the plot as it’s complex and I think I’ve said enough.There are big serves of double agents, spies, codenames, monikers (my favourite being a lady called Tulip), double crossing, hopeless bureaucracy, deaths, mystery and a complicated plot, with numerous (+++) characters.I did need to re-read passages as I did get lost a number of times. But it was worth the effort.George Smiley (I have heard of him!) seems like a legendary character and makes some memorable appearances. I also like the way the author tends to make those stuffy, upper-class types look and sound a bit silly. Whether he does this intentionally or not, I don’t know – as they tend to sound a bit silly and are full of their own self-importance anyway – I think.The author leaned heavily on field reports, Secret Service memoranda, minutes and other correspondence as a mechanism to tell this story. I really enjoyed this method as it provided a sense of realism. Again, this is not a genre I spend much, or any time reading – but after this effort I think I’ll read a bit more – in fact I thought I just heard le Carre’s Agent Running in the Field muttering something in Russian under its breath from my bookcase.

This ordinary world he paints throws up some extra-ordinarily bizarre events. Non sequiturs of the highest order are thrown around too.Life can be like that, hey? Pinball, 1973 (The Rat #2) follows on from Hear the Wind (The Rat #1) with the nameless narrator and his drinking buddy The Rat, spending considerable time at the bar tended by “J”. Again, there is a lot of smoking and drinking beer in this novella. Murakami sometimes describes the act of smoking or lighting a cigarette in great detail – just as a person (in real-life) may sometimes observe these actions in great detail, maybe unintentionally.The themes here are similar to The Rat #1 these include, loneliness, loss, relationships, and the ordinariness of life. There is a striking blandness of the lives of our main characters. Interestingly, this is interspersed with some truly unusual happenings – such as our narrator one day finding twin sisters in his bed, they stay with him for two months, they all sleep together. However, the author mainly focusses on the fact they make good coffee and spend their time looking for balls at the golf course ‘next door’. He also started a thriving translation business, the admin assistant has a penchant for repairing holes in the armpits of his sweaters. But, our guy never seems happy, or sad – just neutral, indifferent and cruising through life.Where there is an entrance, there is usually an exit. That’s the way things are made. Mailboxes, vacuum cleaners, zoos, saltshakers. Of course, there are exceptions. Mousetraps for instance.However, the one thing he does seem passionate about is pinball. He played a particular machine at J’s bar, and developed quite a skill for it, the machine was called ‘Spaceship’ and had three flippers (3 flippers back then was new and exciting - believe me).One day, the machine isn’t there – so our protagonist engages the services of a university lecturer in Spanish to search for this machine – bizarre right? I think this is one thing our main character is truly obsessed about. Almost nothing can be gained from pinball. The only payoff is a numerical substitution of pride.Murakami’s musings of pinball are considerable – something I can relate to as I played a lot of pinball, usually on Sunday nights during my university days. I remember those days fondly. Life was simple.The Rat seems to carry on where he left off from the first book of the series – living a dull life. Drinking and smoking, much of his time spent at J’s bar. He does have a brief encounter with a woman – which doesn’t appear to be going anywhere, probably due to The Rat’s ambivalence. Surprisingly, The Rat makes an important decision towards the latter part of this book – something I will look forward to following in The Rat #3.Her breasts were small, and though her trim body was beautifully tanned, it was a reluctant rather than a boastful tan, as if it had been acquired without her approvalThis plotless wonder, where nothing much really happens, apart from the pinball odyssey – is so interesting because Murakami pulled me in several surprising and unexpected directions throughout.If you do read this, expect the unexpected as you proceed through a dark fug of banality. 4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Mar 06, 2023","Mar 08, 2023","Mar 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/591978.Pinball_1973

The major themes here are love, life, loss, lies and literature - oh and drinking, eating and smoking. The unnamed narrator is a 21 year old man studying biology at a Tokyo University. One summer, he comes back to his small hometown in Kobe, near the sea. This is where most of the story is told. Each chapter is brief, to the point, and contains snippets of the narrator's life – childhood included.We hear about the 3 girls he’s slept with, we meet his barfly friend “The Rat” (this is the 1st of the Rat Trilogy BTW), these two guys drink a lot of beer and smoke heaps - over these 130 pages. The Chinese bartender “J” is prominent and makes great fries. The most interesting part for me was the narrator’s interesting relationship with a girl with 9 fingers – who he found on a toilet floor. The 3rd girl I slept with liked to call my penis “raison d’etre”The Rat’s favourite food was pancakes, hot off the griddle. He would stack several in a deep dish, cut them into 4 neat pieces, and pour Coke over the top.Rat thought this was a perfect way to “blend solid food and drink”. Interestingly, Murakami inserts a fictional American writer called Derek Hartfield into this story. Hartfield’s biographical details are included, as is a summary of a fascinating short story written by Hartfield called Martian Wells. There’s a number of poignant moments here and a handful of warm smiles. There are many beautifully written parts in this story that gave me reason to “feel”. To me, this story had an atmosphere of “otherness and loneliness”.

Some examples of chapter topics include - seeking out misfortune, turn an obstacle upside down, view the world from above, embrace your lack of control, prepare for the worst and be your best self. My main interest in stoicism is historical, as two greats from antiquity are major players in this philosophical practice:Seneca (5 BCE – 65 CE) – one of the wealthiest men in the Roman Empire, an advisor and mentor to Nero (something one could say, ""the proof was NOT in the pudding""), but well connected and possessed a great mind. His book On the Shortness of Life is one of my ‘go-too’ books, when I want to read something inspirational about the importance of using our time wisely. It’s our most valuable possession.It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of itMarcus Aurelius (121 – 180 CE) – the last one in the period of the five good emperors. He was a man with a great mind and his Meditations is a philosophical work that is still relevant today, all written while he was on the battle front warring with the Germanic Tribes of the day.The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.Both are quoted heavily in this book – as are others such as Epictetus and many others.Death is the ultimate motivating force for us to be our best selves, because if we can truly say on our death bed that we always did our best, death holds no power over us………..I like that.For those looking at adopting practices to become your ‘best-self”, improve well-being and happiness, this may be a book you may find handy.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Feb 26, 2023","Mar 12, 2023","Feb 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53509714-stoicism

This is a really interesting short story, containing numerous themes which become apparent the more you re-read the story, and the more you read about the story.This one was written in 1912 and involves a businessman named Georg who is writing to his friend who now lives in Russia. His friend set up a business there which showed early promise, however it appears he is now struggling and lives a solitary, miserable life. Georg is torn about what to write him, does he tell him he is engaged now? Does he tell him his business is going gangbusters? Georg is aware enough to be considerate of his friend’s feelings and emotions. So, Georg, goes into discuss this dilemma with his father in the next room. His father is old and incapacitated, requiring care. It is clear Georg is a devoted son and spends his time also caring for his father. After raising the topic of his friend to his father – the latter launches into Georg, criticising him, insulting him, questioning some of his assumptions (such as the existence of this friend) and accusing him of various nefarious deeds.This has a massive impact on Georg, resulting in him acting in a dramatic and spontaneous way. It seems from my further reading this story, one of his most acclaimed, is a reflection of his own relationship with his father. It also, outlined to me – in an extreme way, the importance of how we speak to people, particularly loved ones, and to consider consequences.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Feb 24, 2023","Feb 24, 2023","Feb 23, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/12361530-the-judgement

Amor (the nice-ish one) is the only family member who wants the family to honour the promise of house and land to Salome. This is a running theme throughout.“And you still don’t understand. It’s not yours to give. It already belongs to us. This house, but also the house where you live, and the land it’s standing on. Ours!”The issue of Terra Nullius, exploited by colonialists everywhere.This is a sprawling family saga set in a politically intense South Africa from the 1980s to almost 2020. The mood is not bright, it is all a bit of heavy graft. The narrator is unusual, sometimes he/she would go off on a chatty tangent or express an unusually judgemental opinion of a character – you would think you were sitting having a coffee with this unnamed person. At times this third person narrator, seemed like a first-person narrator, he/she was that emotionally involved – I hope that makes sense.This is clever writing; it is immersive and a real page turner. My favourite type of book – a handful of people, a family, stuffing things up, arguing with each other and essentially making life a lot harder than it should be. There are also touches of magical realism thrown in here and there, not a lot – if you blink you will miss it. There are also moments of humour – one or two laugh out loud moments. Funerals, done badly can often be hilarious I think. Some of the supporting characters, often religious, are almost satirical.”I want them to open the coffin”.“But why?”“I want to be sure it’s my brother inside”.“Of course, it’s your brother inside, he cries, his own hysteria suddenly matching hers. Whose brother would it be?”I really enjoyed this.5 Stars (so much for 2024 being the year of stingy ratings)...more",Notes are private!,50,93,1,"Jan 05, 2024","Jan 08, 2024","Feb 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54633172-the-promise

This haemorrhagic virus, had a morality rate of between 50-70% (depending on the literature) and is contagious enough to cause significant outbreaks with many deaths. One thing I found interesting here is that most patients presented with severe diarrhoea and vomiting (as compared to bleeding). Imagine the challenge in keeping the patients areas clean and free of virus when patients were repeatedly and violently vomiting, defecating and soiling themselves. The challenges were overwhelming – such as trying to follow sound infectious control protocols by cleaning up mess, and wearing PPE in the stifling heat, so much PPE, the doctors were unable to use something as basic as a stethoscope. ETUs, particularly in remote regions experienced challenges such as procurement, patient transport, infrastructure, power, comms, building standards to name a few. When we approached him, it was clear his pants were soiled with diarrhoea and his shirt stained with vomit. He was covered in his own body fluidsBut perhaps the major challenge was a result of the complicated and violent history of Liberia. This country was created by the transportation of freed African-American slaves in the early to mid-1800s. This group quickly became the ‘ruling-class’ with the local tribes (of which there are many) often being subjugated by this group. Liberia’s history is complex, and the author spends time describing this as it has an impact on Liberia’s ability to manage such an outbreak. [image]Check out the blue filamentous Ebola virus, mobbing this cellI was particularly interested in the capacity of pathology laboratories to provide rapid turnaround times for Ebola PCR testing – as these results determine, not only the most appropriate treatment of the patient, but the most appropriate location (e.g. isolation) for them. Until these results were obtained, many sick non-Ebola (keeping in mind many Liberians were sick anyway) patients would be mixing with Ebola patients – thus putting further strain on resources and importantly, increasing transmission rates. Initially the turnaround time for testing was 5-days, but this was eventually improved to 1-day. This impressive TAT was achieved by a US Navy mobile laboratory.The country’s institutions were poor, government and other bureaucracies were mostly corrupt, there was significant and savage internecine conflict – the most significant being the Civil War from 1989 to 1997 more than 200,000 Liberians were killed, and around a million displaced as refugees (the population was only just a bit more than 2 million). Some of the accounts I have read of the violence during this war are nothing short of horrific, truly horrible. So, there is little wonder the country was in a total mess well before Ebola reared its ugly head.The turbulent history of Liberia, is a cause of much civil mistrust towards Government and foreign actors when trying to implement an outbreak containment strategy – e.g. many Liberians believed the whole thing was a Government plot and they were spreading the disease via the ETUs.Here is a documentary I watched today about the first Liberian Civil War – the American tyre company Firestone was up to its ears in the politics of this war, as they were managing the worlds biggest rubber plantation at the time. I don’t think I like look at a tyre the same way again - seriously.

I devoured this because I loved it. Dr Marsh i2023 has already been a stellar year for reading, And Finally, by Henry Marsh has made it even more so. I devoured this because I loved it. Dr Marsh is a retired UK neurosurgeon, he’s 72 and has was diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer, how’s that for relatable? So, Marsh tells his cancer story of course, but he intersperses this by digressing into all sorts of interesting areas – this man is surely a polymath. The polymath content exceeds the cancer stuff considerably BTW.  However, the subject of death is the ribbon running through this book, I can recommend this to everyone, because death is one thing, we all have in common. Eternity is not the infinite prolongation of time but instead its abolitionA tiny aliquot of Marsh’s offerings – He used to mountain trek, and he discussed mountain sickness. The DNA of Tibetans contain DNA from Denisovans - early hominins who interbred with Homo sapiens, resulting in more efficient oxygen binding haemoglobin - wow. He also discussed the dilemma surgeons have in referring patients to a colleague who may have more of a chance of success operating on a specific case/brain tumour. His discussion on the politics and management of public hospitals was something I could identify with, and it was interesting, and comforting in a way, to read the labyrinth of useless bureaucracy exists everywhere (but there are ways around it). Also, the reluctance of specialists giving out percentage chances of survival (or death) to cancer patients – which is true and why this happens. The types of receptor cells in insect retinas. The desire of humans to significantly elongate life and the research (and the farcical thinking) associated with this. Woodwork. Transposing results from mouse trials to humans, the danger associated with this because ”We are not, it has been observed, large mice - I laughed hard at that one. Anaesthesia (he loves general anaesthesia as do I), etc etc etc – so, so, much interesting stuff.For me it was his writing on Advanced Prostate Cancer I found the most fascinating. He takes the reader from pre-diagnosis to death, and how, having a probably terminal (sooner or eventually) disease impacts the patient. Marsh’s exhaustive precis of the final stages of dying with this disease is interesting, captivating and thought provoking. His personal experience of androgen deprivation therapy – ADT - (removing our testosterone) was, for me, hilarious. I howled with laughter when he described looking in the mirror, after he was on ADT for a year or so (I was on this stuff for about 2 years) he said:“I have acquired the plump and hairless body of a eunuch, and look rather like an outsize geriatric baby””I snorted like a hog when I read that. It is SO true!! One thing I remember was the glee at seeing my own hair grow back on the top of my head – it wasn’t quite swishy and luscious, but it was apparent nonetheless, and also my smooth skin and hairless limbs were a never-ending source of wonder. But these interesting or positive side-effects were outweighed by my burgeoning “Man-Boobs,” extreme fatigue, very hot flashes, muscle weakness and mental slothfulness. Phenomena I am experiencing and managing to this day.This is NOT a grim book about a confronting topic, it is bright, bouncy and fascinating. I can recommend this to everyone – it is outstanding. 5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Feb 26, 2023","Feb 28, 2023","Feb 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60784634-and-finally

This is a retelling of the sI gobbled up David Vann’s Halibut on the Moon, so I was keen to read another Vann without delay – enter Bright Air Black. This is a retelling of the story of Jason and the Argonauts with the monstrous Medea taking centre stage.This book only describes part of this story – we are in 1300 BCE and are fleeing Colchis, a city on the coast of the Black Sea. We are on board the Argo with Jason and the boys, and Medea has chopped up (yes…..) her brother and is throwing parts of him into the sea so her father’s (King Aeetes) pursuit of them is held-up as he retrieves chunks of his son from the water. They are in possession of the Golden Fleece which, all going well, will be presented to King Pelias in Iolcus, Greece and will give Jason the throne. Sounds easy right?[image]Vann’s writing here is sublime. The way he describes the seas, skies and the journey is immersive. If you read this, do not rush – this is to be read slowly. If you do that you wont regret it. Medea on the stern where her brother's remains have fused to the wood, dried and shrunken and infested with white maggots I was fascinated by the fact Medea’s decomposing brother was referred to on numerous occasions. [image]The fracas involving the dissection of Medea’s brother. I did not think it would look this disorderly – but when I think about it, her brother probably wasn’t compliant.Anyway, I am obsessing about this scene again. So, Medea is the star of this show, Vann depicted this character in such a clever way, there were times I could not stand the woman witch, but there were periods – I felt for her, sympathy even. But even after feeling sorry for her, Vann would make her do something monstrous and I would be back to despising her!!!There is a lot of violence here, a few surprises – particularly for readers like me who are not familiar with the story, so for me – the ending was a real SHOCK!! To get the most out of this, I found the need to finish a few chapters and then go on-line and read up about some of the characters who dropped in. Looking up maps of this part of Jason’s journey was interesting too.There are some very, very memorable scenes – like lads with olive oil having fun, Medea riding a corpse, and who can forget the chewing of a fresh testicle. I am so glad I made a David Vann shelf on GR – as this is now my second addition to it, and it will not be my last. I am not giving this 5-stars for two reasons (1) Jason’s character was not developed at all – one would assume this is intentional by Vann (because he knows what he's doing) but fleshing out Jason a bit more would’ve been nice and (2) I enjoyed Halibut on the Moon a little more. I have just discovered, one of my favourite men from antiquity, Seneca – wrote a play about Medea, so I must look for that. I am finally getting to understand what this Greek Mythology game is all about, this would be my 3rd or 4th Mythology book – so I think I have my ‘eye-in’ and I will be reading more as it is so fascinating, explicit, violent and good fun.Even though I gave the book 4-stars, this was a 5-star experience all due to my buddy reader - La Profesora - Jennifer.

They both treat poor Circe appallingly – in fact, the whole family does. They think she’s stupid, ugly and they can’t stand her voice (she sounds like a mortal apparently). It was this treatment that signed me up to become a passionate member of “Team Circe”. I love her – she sometimes referred to herself as ‘not very nice’. Personally, I didn’t see it. Perhaps, I’m blind to her charms.[image]Madeline Miller brings Greek Mythology to life – in a lively, bright shiny way that is easily digestible to the reader. It’s an adventurous romp of the life of the witch-god, Circe, as she is forced by her father, Helios (no less), into exile to live on the island of Aiaia (it was fun finding out how to pronounce this word). She is alone on this island, save for a bunch of animals, and nymphs who seem to drop in and out of sight.Miller uses the main character and her life on Aiaia as a vehicle to tell us stories about numerous other characters of Greek mythology. A terrific mythology refresher course. This was the aspect of this book I appreciated the most. The story never stood still – as soon as one sub-story was told, we were onto the next.It needs to be said, these Gods are a bunch of cruel bastards and most (all?) have super-charged sex drives. They’re a horrible lot really – apart from ‘our Circe’ of course!! One character I found particularly interesting was the hero of Troy, Odysseus – who drops into Aiaia and produced a boy-child with Circe. As brilliant and heroic as Odysseus was, he was a right moody geezer, never present – always hankering for something over the horizon. I thought this aspect of him was a great reflection of the modern male, we can have the tendency to be absent, restless, difficult to please sometimes.[image]Odysseus – he was well-moodyThere are countless family dramas in this wonderful book, lots of fighting, spells, peril and suspense. I was rivetted to the page on many occasions. The Circe spell I enjoyed the most was when she turned a bunch of dodgy sailors (she was feeding and providing shelter for – no less) into pigs. Could you imagine having such power? This book has nudged me in the direction of reading The Odyssey – but somehow, I don’t think it will be written in such an entertaining way as this belter of a book. One more comment – during this read, I occasionally had this warm feeling inside of me – I’m not sure what it was – but I’d like to think it was the same warm-cosy-fuzzy glow I felt as a child when my parents read stories to me – safe, fascinated, enthralled, eyes wide-open, agog.

He used Chinese massage to alleviate pain in his patients, one of these patient’s was one of the biggest monsters of all-time. The man in charge of the SS and the Gestapo, the man responsible for Nazi Concentration Camps, responsible for the death and torture of millions and a part of Adolf Hitler’s inner circle. Heinrich Himmler.Dr Kerston used manual manipulation to alleviate the disabling pain experienced by Himmler, this pain rendered him helplessly immobile. Himmler had tried conventional medicine to no avail, Dr Kerston was able to relieve Himmler’s pain instantly. This made Kerston indispensable to Himmler, he was essentially permanently on-call. Himmler considered him a friend – possibly his only friend. During their sessions over the years, Himmler was incredibly open and frank with Kerston. The good doctor also was able to befriend Himmler’s private secretary – Brandt – which was very useful.[image]Dr Kerston and HimmlerKerston was able to use his influence and ‘friendship’ with Himmler to secure the release of many, many prisoners held in camps or prisons. He was also able to secure favourable treatment for many other victims of the Nazi crime machine. These details were extracted from Dr Kerston’s diary.This is a fascinating inside look at the way the Nazi hierarchy viewed the world, also of how Himmler’s mind worked and his obsession with pleasing and following Hitler. There have been some reports that Kerston’s impact has been somewhat exaggerated – and I did find it interesting how his this account recorded what Himmler was thinking at times – but even if only 50% of what Dr Kerston claimed to influence was true, he saved numerous lives. I think, to be fair, his impact was significant, his efforts are well-documented and involved the cooperation of other significant parties – such as the Finnish Government of the day – and they could easily dispute his claims if untrue.An excellent read for those interested in this shameful period of human history. This book has given me reason to spend some time watching various movies like The Pianist and Inglorious Basterds, I think I’ll keep watching more material of this period for a while (again).

A great coffee table book. It’s as big and impressiveMy 12 year old self would have enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed it as a 59 year old bloke. A great coffee table book. It’s as big and impressive as the subject matter. Titanic by David Ross not only has great photos, drawings and images of real historical artefacts, it is written very nicely indeed. The author starts with providing background on transatlantic travel, the owners and management of White Star Lines, the company responsible for the building of Titanic (and 2 other giant, luxury ships – Olympic and Britannic), by the construction and engineering information, the voyage, the sinking and the aftermath.Construction details were impressive and fascinating (…..I was going to say riveting – but I thought better of it). The scale of the engineering was overwhelming. For some reason, whenever I am exposed to details of massive engineering projects I get a funny feeling in my tummy, as I couldn’t imagine being responsible for such a project. The size of the boilers was incomprehensible – they used to expunge 100 tons of ash a day (a 100 tons of ash!!!), the ship carried 7000 tons of coal – yikes!! The electrical power generator was the size of plant to power a large town or a city at the time. The company achieved a comparatively low number of occupational injuries during construction - 8 workmen were killed and 28 seriously injured (out of 4,000 workers), this was considered to be a comparatively low number, it still sounds a lot doesn’t it?There are approximately 165,000 workers employed in shipyards in the U.S. Between 2011 and 2017, there were at least 45 fatal accidents (4.0 per 100,000) among shipyard workers,8 higher than the rate for all U.S. workers. (Ref: CDC https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/cm...)[image]The fitting out of this beast was a massive project too. Edwardian fittings and furniture – nothing was spared for first class (325 passengers), second class (285) was comfortable too – and I was surprised to see the relatively good-ish standard for third class (a noisy swarm of 706 punters). There were so many interesting bits of information provided – such as the coordinates where the dramas started happening 42N 50W. This sent me racing to (well not really racing, I only had to move my finger) to Google Maps and check out the area for myself. It was unusually cold, icebergs were breaking off the east coast of North America frequently (do you know little bergs are called ‘grunters’?). Titanic was required to change course (southwards), but it wasn’t enough and they were unfortunate enough to glance one, after trying to take evasive action – there were a number of eyewitness accounts described, as there were of the sinking. This made the even so very personal. The water temperature was a lethal minus 2 degrees celcius, the sea was also very calm - making it difficult to see any icebergs.Controversies were described, such as the ‘fact’ of one of the owners pushing the captain to speed up to break the transatlantic record, the insufficient number of life-boats, some decision made by the crew at the time. All made the more personal, by photo’s of the people involved, evidentiary documents and more.I highly recommend this, I couldn’t put it down. I would expect the large, hardcover edition would be a masterpiece. The balance of text and graphics is perfect – as is the detail provided, also the details of the people involved.

In fact, it is similar to how I felt at the end of this book. It was drab, boring - relentlessly so. However, there were some interesting bits at times.Greene tackled the interior of Liberia with a team of ‘servants’ – who carried hammocks, boxes of whiskey, and other essential supplies through thick, wet, dense jungle. They encountered native settlements at the end of every day – each with undulating degrees of hospitality. The chiefs were largely a mad bunch – there were rats, small dangerous insects, snakes, a mulitidude of diseases not limited to fevers, dysentery, plague, and conflict.The narrator also travelled with his female cousin – who wasn’t mentioned at all really - this puzzled me. He also reflected on his thoughts on his life experience throughout this trip – I didn’t find anything about him or the trip particularly illuminating. The description of the trip was only moderately interesting. In fact, this story was compared to Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, which I enjoyed. In my view, this comparison is ambitious as Conrad’s work was brilliant.One positive for me, it kicked-started my interest in Liberia, this poverty-stricken, violent, West African country – with a Government based on the US Model, and populated by freed US slaves back in the day. This research was a massive learning experience, and one I have found to be very interesting indeed.But as a travel book – nah. It really is a two star effort, but I’ll give it three because it initiated a vibrant flow of my research juices.One other thing, this book also reinforced my love of the great indoors.

I came into this one blind, and I was expecting Wharton to provide aEthan Frome is my fourth Edith Wharton story and again, she has not disappointed. I came into this one blind, and I was expecting Wharton to provide another humorous study of the stuffy upper-class in New York society.Well, this is not what she delivered on this occasion. Ethan Frome lives in a rural fictional town in Massachusetts in the early 1900s. He only just scrapes out an existence from an unproductive, worthless piece of land. His horses are old and knackered, he has an old guy who helps out and a very sickly wife called Zeena who seems to be mostly bed-bound and miserable. This would normally engender some sympathy in the reader, but it is clear Wharton’s intention is to paint Zeena as a mean-spirited, hyper-critical person. I couldn’t stand her.Early on we discover Ethan was badly injured in an accident many years ago, leaving him physically impaired, but still able to perform some duties. We are not sure what exactly happened to cause his injuries – Wharton adds a little tension and suspense here, as we discover the cause of his injuries. The hapless Ethan, also had to care for each parent before they passed away, and now he is caring for Zeena. Wharton makes us feel for this poor guy – it’s obvious the cards haven’t fallen his way………….and on top of all this, it is freezing cold, typical of this state in winter I understand. This gives the whole story a feeling of extreme hardship and misery.Enter Mattie Silver, a young bright bubble of a woman, who comes to the house to help with the house duties due to Zeena’s incapacity – Mattie is related to Zeena, and is taken on because she herself has hit hard times. The three main characters of Ethan, Zeena and Mattie weave an interesting web – all largely as a result of Ethan’s obsession with the girl.This makes for a fascinating story. Ethan is obviously conflicted, not only due to societal norms of the day, but also (in my opinion) due his own moral compass – Ethan is a good bloke. But how much can the man put up with? Wharton increased the tension as this story progressed, growing to a surprising crescendo. I wont say if the ending was sad, happy or in between. But, my oh my, Edith, you’ve done it again!!4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Jan 31, 2023","Feb 02, 2023","Jan 31, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5246.Ethan_Frome

I first realised this when I read her book The Blind Assassin , that Margaret Atwood has a brain the size of a planet and an even bigger imagination. I first realised this when I read her book The Blind Assassin , that story took me places I didn’t expect to go. Oryx and Crake is the result Atwood’s imagination operating in over-drive, this is one intelligent, wondrous and a troubling story of a post-apocalyptic world. We aren’t sure how this apocalypse occurred.First up we are introduced to Snowman (our narrator) who lives in this future world, in a tree, he wears a sheet and oversees a group of humanoids called The Children of Crake. These people are different to humans, they are childlike with a simple innocence about them. Snowman scrapes out an existence and looks back at his past pre-apocalyptic life when he was a child as a boy named Jimmy. This story follows these two timelines – pre and post-apocalypse.Snowman/Jimmy is our main character, we learn about his childhood and his friendship with a genius boy called “Crake” (real name Glenn). Crake is an unusual boy who seems to march to a different beat, he doesn’t act like a usual lad, but after a while he and Jimmy become close mates. Crake is very, very intelligent and this sets him on a path of studying at the best academic institutions and he is eventually employed in genetics (creating new hybrid species) all this, while Jimmy battles through lesser-known schools and ends up working in advertising.Jimmy’s father was a genetic scientist and he didn’t show much affection towards Jimmy, in fact he was rather cold and critical towards him. Jimmy’s mother was a bit of a nutter and left the family one day, out of the blue. Jimmy grew up angry and sex obsessed. Oryx first spotted by the boys when watching a child pornography video, when she was a small girl. Beware: Even though there are some fantastic scientific ideas and concepts going on in this story and even some funny interactions between Jimmy and Crake, the back-story of Oryx is sad, dark and confronting. Anyway, as adults they meet Oryx and there is a rivalry between the two (probably more from Jimmy’s point of view) over Oryx’s affections (sex). Crake seems indifferent.Snowman (the older Jimmy) is a sad lonely character, he doesn’t find much value in his relationship with the innocent, agreeable Crakers. Eventually, he decides to look for more supplies by visiting the compound he, Crake and Oryx worked at before the apocalypse event. This odyssey of Snowman brings the two timelines together and everything is eventually revealed.The above description is a hollow attempt at describing an intricate piece of work which includes so many scientific factoids (and facts), a bizarre world of genetic developments, great main characters, a few laughs and lots of ‘oh gosh’ moments. It’s also a very human piece as Atwood takes us on a journey of friendship, friendship gone bad, obsession, rivalry and jealousy, the dark side of humanity, innocence, religious themes and the future. Future naval-gazing is perhaps the most fascinating aspect here – how far can we, and should we, push scientific (genetic) advances? How much power should be put in the hands of scientists and corporations? After just emerging from a pandemic, we know some of the issues caused by infectious agents - imagine what kind of conversations we would be having now if the virus wasn’t a SARS virus, but a haemorrhagic, highly contagious virus with a mortality rate close to 100%? Even if it had a mortality rate close to that of Ebola (60+ %) our conversations would be very different – many or most of us would not be here.It truly makes one wonder, with scientific developments forging ahead, the destruction of so many ecosystems and species in this world and with humans being what we are – the type of scenario described in this book – well, maybe it isn’t so fictional.Atwood, is not only a great writer she is quite simply a genius.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,2,91,1,"Jan 16, 2023","Jan 22, 2023","Jan 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46756.Oryx_and_Crake

This one was “well-moody”. I want to read more froWinter in Sokcho by Elisa Dusapin is one of the most atmospheric books I have read in a long while. This one was “well-moody”. I want to read more from this author.This story is based in Sokcho, a popular tourist resort town in the north of South Korea, not far from the border with North Korea. The young woman narrator is unnamed and is working in a run-down hotel managed by a miserable man called Park. Our narrator has a relationship with an idiot boyfriend who wants to be a model in Seoul – they have no love in their relationship. He often suggests she should consider having plastic surgery (bad move), Interestingly, plastic surgery is raised by several characters in this story. I don’t know why. Is it a common thing in South Korea? A famous graphic-novel artist called Kerrand stays at the hotel for some time to draw inspiration from the area for his next ‘prize-winning’ piece of work. Kerrand and our narrator have an interesting relationship of sorts. He treats her with indifference, ignoring her at times, interested at other times. Kerrand wants her to teach him about Sokcho and Korea – personally, I think he’s a bit strange. The narrator seems infatuated in him – but this isn’t presented in any obvious way, just the way she interacts with him, and thinks about him. I was hooked on where this was going, would they jump in the sack, would they have a plutonic relationship – or was I overcooking the whole thing?A couple of things:1.	The writing is sparse, almost barren. Because of this, I was totally engrossed.2.	The general mood here is bleak. Sure, the fact Sokcho is being smothered by a brutally cold winter plays a part. However, the continued war with the North – still no ceasefire – means people are living on a knife edge. There are still sporadic acts of cross border violence occurring – how can this not add to the stark, bleak mood of a place? The narrator’s mother and auntie are uber-dragons and treat the young woman appallingly. Not in any physical way – just the things they say such as “you should consider plastic surgery”, “eat more”, “don’t get fat” – criticising her cooking, her clothes. I felt like picking the girl up and bringing her home – she wasn’t receiving any warmth from anyone. I can’t even recall her smiling or being the least bit happy.Fugu – a dish made from the ultra-toxic puffer fish makes an appearance. The fact they start cutting into this fish while it is still alive is appalling. The mother also removes the teeth of the poor blighters, so they don’t bite each other in the fish tanks – that must hurt too. The certified chef then needs to skilfully remove the skin and the toxic viscera before slicing it for human consumption. This dish, eaten raw is a real delicacy. Up to 100 people a year die eating this fish, due to not preparing it properly. Anyway, this story had me gripped. The writing was frugal but totally engaging. The characters were interesting, and this reader just had no idea where this was going. A story about people and place, no plot needed.I loved this.Thanks to my buddy readers Candi and Pedro for putting up with my over-exuberance on this one, I couldn’t stop banging on about how much I loved it ...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Jan 04, 2023","Jan 09, 2023","Jan 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52873922-winter-in-sokcho

I’m also aware it’s a beautiful country.The Shortest History of Greece by James Heneage has filled in the huge gaps of knowledge I have of around 3 millennia in around 250 pages. This book achieves this in a way that is easy to digest and interesting. The book contains, maps, photos, and information boxes so the reader isn’t presented by page after page of slabs of text – it’s easy on the eye. The last 200 years was the most fascinating. I just didn’t realise how much change, disruption and violence the people of Greece have been through during this period. There were Civil Wars, Invasions by the Ottomans, Italians, Nazis – interference by so-called super-powers, lots of internal political shenanigans and crippling foreign debt – it makes one wonder how Greece is still standing. The resilience of the Greeks is staggering.There is also sufficient detail here and some good references used by the author – for a reader to follow up on to hunt down more information. For example, I am fascinated by the Greek Statesman Eleftherios Venizelos (b1864 - d1936), I will also read more about WWII and the chaotic period afterwards,There is a lot here, it packs a punch and is a great foundation to form a basis for further reading.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for furnishing me with a copy in exchange for my .5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Jan 11, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59738184-the-shortest-history-of-greece

There are many who believe the victim numbers are significantly higher. This book describes the life of Peter Sutcliffe, including comments from his friends and most significantly his relationship with his wife Sonia. The author meticulously details each of the victim’s murder’s, including the horrific injuries sustained by these poor women, most were sex workers. This section was gruelling and confronting. However, the part of the story I was most fascinated by concerns the court proceedings at the Old Bailey in London. It was interesting to note the prosecutor was none other than the Attorney General himself, Sir Michael Havers (father of actor Nigel Havers). Anyway, Sutcliffe pleaded guilty on the grounds of diminished responsibility to be charged for manslaughter. The judge listened to both the prosecution and defence team regarding this plea deal but was unable to accept it. The judge decided a jury would need to decide if Sutcliffe was suffering from a mental illness (manslaughter) or if he was a cold-blooded killer (murder). The author then described the details of the prosecution case (cold-blooded killer), the defence case (paranoid schizophrenia), psychiatrists, victims who survived attacks, those closest to the defendant, police officers and remarkably, Sutcliffe himself. We read the judge’s interjections, advice to the jury and sentencing comments. The author also describes the considerable challenges imposed on the police and specifically the senior officers in charge of the case, this over a gruelling 5-year period.I was fascinated by the details of the court proceedings and the advice offered by the medical experts. This author has written a detailed account of this case and this book is one well worth reading for those interested in the subject matter or true crime in general.Many thanks to NetGalley and the publishers for providing me with an advance copy of this book in exchange for my .4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Jan 04, 2023","Jan 15, 2023","Jan 04, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63266164-convicting-the-yorkshire-ripper-the-trial-of-peter-sutcliffe

This ‘interesting’ auntie invites the family to take over the farm called Drogheda when she passes – along with her vast inheritance.Sounds good, doesn’t it? However, it all gets a bit complicated and messy. The most interesting character for me in this story is Father Ralph de Bricassart. This character was terrible conflicted – he loves Meggie with all his heart, but his love and devotion to God – as a Catholic priest – make this love story as memorable as it gets. Father Ralph is on a trajectory that will take him to the Vatican, he's very handsome, charming, intelligent (the bastard!!) and turns heads wherever he goes.There’s one detestable guy in this, a bloke called Luke O’Neill. This man is a tosser of the highest order – I won’t give anything away for those who haven’t read this, but I felt like shaking him. He treated my favourite character in this story deploringly. In fact, his journey also took us to Far North Queensland (even Cairns where I live). McCullough describes the intolerable humidity of FNQ perfectly – everything from the sweet smell to the suffocating moisture.Fun Fact: BTW I thought I saw Luke O’Neill down Cairns main street the other day, I was determined to confront him but, you see - I have this dodgy knee and I’m still a little particular about social distancing, so I vehemently muttered something rude under my breath as I walked past him. He got the message alright!!!!In addition to love and family, a third major theme here is Christianity, particularly the Catholic version. The sacrifice mere men of the cloth need to commit to is no small thing, the torment must tear many priests to bits. Hey, listen, I have only mentioned a few of the great characters here – there are many, many more – such as the acerbic Justine, the beautiful boy Dane, fighting Frank, earnest Paddy, ever so patient Rein – and so, so many more. If you read this or have read this – no doubt one or more of these characters has or will wedge themselves in your mind or heart. I’ve stuffed a couple of them in my heart that’s for sure.The bird with the thorn in its breast, it follows an immutable law; it is driven by it knows not what to impale itself and die singing. At the very instant the thorn enters there is no awareness of the dying to come; it simply sings and sings until there is not the life left to utter another note. But we, put the thorns in our breasts, we know. We understand. And still, we do it. Still, we do itDoesn’t that take your breath away? McCullough’s prose here is a bit special. There were many ‘oh gosh’ instances in this epic, a few moments causing me to stop and ponder, and a couple where my heart fell through the floor. Oh man.Stories like this aren’t just intergenerational tales about people and families. More importantly, they are stories that make us reflect on our own life, our own relationships and that is what this reading game is all about I suppose. Just finished this book and  & it's 11pm here – I will sleep very, very well tonight indeed.

In fact, I am sure I am not alone in saying it is the fun, fascination, laughs, learning and sometime sobs on GRs that get me through tricky patches throughout the year – so a massive thank you to all I have interacted with throughout this year. CHEERS!!!This year has been a seismic one for me as I retired after 35 years working in public pathology laboratories, with the last couple of years being very difficult. In 2022 I also had some Ca related septicaemias and some surgery, a few haircuts, and even fewer beard trims. I am still showering daily – whether I need it or not, as that’s the type of guy I am. There’s been family dramas – still unresolved, and a wonderful holiday in Spain. But when all is said and done, I am really glad 2022 is over. Reading continues to be my constant, my stabling influence, the thing I can run to any time of day to forget the world and live in someone else’s world just for a little while. I cut my target back from 100+ in previous years to 80 in 2022 as I wanted to read more ‘chunksters’. However, this plan – like many others, turned into a complete Porton-cock-up, as I read more short stories than ever and only read one ‘chunkster’. Not a bad thing, but it wasn’t the plan. I hate plans anyway – they’re a bit shit, so I wont be doing that again.So, 79/80 books – and these are my winners and losers.The 5 Best – in some particular order1.       The Count of Monte Cristo, by Dumas: I wish this book had an infinite number of pages.2.       Pnin, by Nabokov: this wee man (Pnin) made me laugh and cry, and then laugh again.3.       Rabbit Run, by Updike:  I love Updike’s writing, his characters and his mind.4.       A Room with a View, Forster: or Howards End – both brilliant, the definition of classic.5.       Daddy Love, JCO: Shudder!! Confronting dialled up to 10 (pure genius). The one’s I didn’t like 1.       The Tale of Two Cities: By some bloke called Charlie “Bubba Chuck” Dickens.I enjoyed pretty much everything else and also the short stories I read – it has been a fantastic reading year. I am lucky enough to learn things from many of you to become a ‘better reader’ and I loved the Buddy Reads this year too – they are a lot of fun to be sure.One new objective I have this year is to read some work from illustrious GR friends (Kimber, Kevin, Sara and Robin) so that is something to look forward to. Imagine that? Knowing authors. Much love to all on here and let’s have a cracking 2023! Cheers Mark...more",Notes are private!,0,140,1,Jan 2022,"Dec 31, 2022","Jan 01, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/58628750-2022-on-goodreads

These guys exist in the present time and meet in what can only be described as ‘very unusual’ circumstances. I liked Hugo, a lot, a clinical killer but he has a big heart, an unusual mix indeed. Then we have Vincent, Hugo’s Irish mate – a big lump of a guy, with a toupee and a man who loves a pint. When we all travel back to 1970s Mexico (…..yes 1970s Mexico), we meet some good guys like Pablo – a poor shoeshine lad and his dad, who plays a trumpet in local parks for spare change. Maria, a housekeeper and cook – had me salivating and there’s an interesting butler – who reminded me of the slimy Smithers from The Simpsons – uuurrrggghh, there's a few more too, including a handful of nefarious, violent dudes out to inflict misery.The star of the show for me though was Luna (see cover). A beautiful, cocky, confident adolescent with bleach white hair. Now this girl is unusual, she even smokes cigars heavens sake! I’ve told you nothing about the plot here – it’s not necessary. All I’ll say is if you want a rollicking adventure, with good guys and bad guys, a love story (or two), some history, a taste of tacos, violence, and the odd chuckle, all wrapped up in a warm blanket – read this!But be warned, this isn’t all beer and skittles, Mr Ansbro did take the liberty of stuffing his fist down my throat and pulling up my insides through my gaping mouth.

I found this section of the book a little tiresome as it seemed he was showing off a bit, a bit of the ‘big boy’ syndrome and there was so much of it.Zonfrillo has lived an interesting life, a life of considerable success but he certainly has experienced significant highs and lows. Trouble seems to find him. Scottish born, to a Scottish Mum and an Italian Dad. It was the Italian side of his family where he found his love of food. He helped in his dad’s barber shop as a teenager and eventually found himself washing dishes in a local restaurant – this was the start of his culinary journey.The amount of bastardisation or hazing in kitchens back in the day (hopefully not now) was considerable, even physical abuse of apprentices from senior chefs was tolerated. Jock managed to find his way into better kitchens and ended up working for the legendary Marco Pierre White – the best chef in the UK at the time (1980s). Zonfrillo ended up in Australia and worked for some of the best restaurants in this country, eventually he started up a restaurant at Penfolds Winery (in my beloved Adelaide) called Orana. This restaurant was often acknowledged and won awards as the best restaurant in the country. One thing I really admire about him is his passion in creating dishes from ingredients from our First Nations Tribes. They have been using these for tens of thousands of years! He spent much time in outback communities, learning about these ingredients – how to find them, how to use them – and then he created his own fine cuisine dishes at Orana to introduce them to the public at large. He is also responsible for creating the first data base of Indigenous food and ingredients in partnership with Adelaide University.This indeed was impressive, as was his work and thoughts about being respectful to animals – who are ‘kind’ enough to donate their bodies for our culinary pleasure. He also had some interesting things to say about the incredible amount of waste ‘high-end’ restaurants create when making their fancy dishes. Like throwing away 2/3 of a spud to create one perfectly dimensioned chip.[image]Eucalyptus Smoked Mashed Potato with Native Thyme OilZonfrillo was married three times having four kids. His self-reflection on this journey was something I found interesting and worthwhile. Readers who have experienced marriage/relationship breakdowns, parenting from a distance, mental health problems and addiction could very well find this insightful.Despite some of my issues with this book, I did find it interesting and worthwhile – I couldn’t put the bloody thing down. Jock Zonfrillo is now one of MasterChef Australia’s judges and he does seem like a really decent bloke, a bloke with a lot of heart, desire and talent.

Two beautiful cities and a gorgeous state, wilderness on steroids. One of my favourite places. Limberlost, Arnott’s third novel, is about an Apple farming rural family in Tasmania around the time of WWII.The father seems preoccupied with the fact two of his sons are off fighting the war leaving young Ned at home, with his older sister to help around the orchard. Ned is a wonderful little man, a great character – he pulls on the heartstrings that’s for sure. He hunts rabbits so he can sell the pelts for the army to make slouch hats – as worn by Aussie soldiers (see below). Ned wants to buy a boat with the money earned from his rabbit pelts. But the thing about this young guy is, he just seems a bit uncertain of himself and he is always, I mean always, seeking external validation from his father and older sister. [image]ANZAC WWI Soldier wearing the characteristic Slouch HatAt first glance the characters in this book appear a little underdeveloped. Particualarly the characters not called “Ned”, and in my view this seemed to read as a young adult story. But the more one reads this story, the more we see the slow meandering threads come together. This also applies to the various random anecdotes and jumps in time, these also make sense the more the reader proceeds.Arnott ever so cleverly pulls it all together to craft an emotionally potent story. I finished this last night at around 1am – and after reading the last few pages, I said “wow”. You all know that sort of ending? Well, this is one of those reads – I really liked it.I will have trouble explaining this – so here goes. Ned has an experience in this story that produces a specific visceral feeling within him. A real – and I quote “swelling, a ripping expansion, a hugeness that rang through him for the length of his life.” Something he never felt, nor could reproduce again. Does anyone else have this sort of ‘one-off’ specific, abject, heartrending feeling? Something caused by an earlier experience that can never be reproduced, and something never felt again – even during other crises in our lives. I do – from a time when I was 10 years old. This feeling seems just around the corner but also unreachable – it plagues me sometimes. Well Arnott describes this with such precision in the closing part of this story – I found it chilling.Yes, there are some confronting scenes of animals being shot, or drowning and being caught in horrible leg traps, some are still alive after many hours. Something I find distressing at the best of times, but the pull of the story kept me going. I think I will remember this and young Ned for a while.Many thanks to Ebba for buddy reading this one with me, always a pleasure!! But, I’m not so sure Ebba enjoyed this one as much as I did. Or it could have been the fact I sent so many pictures of Quolls and Bilbies to her, she became a little bit overwhelmed!!!4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,4,82,1,"Dec 23, 2022","Jan 03, 2023","Dec 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60302358-limberlost

I’ve read a couple of Faulkner’s novels As I Lay Dying being my favourite, and surprisingly I found his stream of consciousness writing easy enough to follow with a little bit of effort. So, I am kind of a fan.This nine-page wonder, written in the third person, was more difficult to read than either of the novels I have read. It took me a while to get into the swing of things and there seemed to be a lot of extraneous material contained within the narrative. There are certainly some passages I don’t completely understand, and some I had to re-read.This is set in the late 1800s and is about a family of tenant farmers whose patriarch has a history of arson – putting it simply. Now this father is a dark, miserable creature who has been to war and finds himself having to defend allegations of burning property.The story opens with a testy scene where his little boy is required to lie to defend him after another barn burning at a hearing before a Justice of the Peace. The prose describing how the wee boy feels during certain times in this story hits home like a punch in the stomach – he was always conflicted between the love and obligations towards his family and doing what is right.Why the father did what he did is open to question (in my mind) – was he anti-authoritarian? He certainly has those tendencies, didn’t he like the rich? Ditto. Or was he just an arsehole?There is a lot here and I highly recommend it, it will make you think about the rich/poor interface, obligations to family and poverty – and probably a bit more.4 StarsAnother great offering from Leonard and the Short Story Club – magic ...more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Dec 20, 2022","Dec 20, 2022","Dec 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3120865-barn-burning

People like motor mechanics, nurses, vet nurses and even a couple of executive chefs. Yes, these people know how to work under pressure, manage time and are customer focused.One of the ex-chefs in the lab (Troy), lent me a book called The Perfectionist by Rudolph Chelminski a fascinating biography of one of France’s best known 3-Star Michelin Chefs, a guy called Bernard Loiseau. Bernard started his career kitchens in 1968-71 – he worked for the famous brothers Jean and Pierre Troisgros. These guys (particularly Jean) demanded absolute obedience, devotion and hard work. Total discipline and attention to the smallest detail were the order of the day. Bernard had a big mouth and was always the first to ‘crack a joke’ or speak up when he shouldn’t – he often found himself in trouble, he also had a burning desire to become a top chef – THE top chef. Apprentice chefs truly starting their working lives at the bottom – cleaning, scrubbing, peeling. This book revealed to me how far down the pecking order they were.After stints at various places Bernard crossed paths with restauratuer Claude Verger in 1972, who eventually purchased a famous regional restaurant called La Côte d'Or in Saulieu in 1975. Bernard became the head chef, a wonderful opportunity for a young man of 25 years of age. One thing struck me here - that is, there are many first class restaurants in small French country villages and towns.Talented, obsessive, hard-working with a brilliant palette a massive smile and a magnetic personality – meant the Michelin Stars eventually came rolling in for Bernard. This was no mean feat – eventually he gained his 3rd Star in 1991. During this journey, he went through two marriages, almost became bankrupt, worked incessantly without a break (his restaurant never closed and he was always on-service), he was always on the phone engaging journalists, other chefs and industry movers and shakers. He never stopped.Bernard always sought external validation – in a big way, He would also ask colleagues, friends and clients – if he was any good. If his menu was good enough, if the sauce was tasty enough – in fact, reading about all his attempts to gain approval became a little exhausting. It was also clear from the testimonials of those close to him that he suffered from bipolar disorder. He had extreme highs, followed by terrible lows.At this height – bearing in mind he had no spare time, he wrote books, was a celebrity chef and even had his name attached to various supermarket foods. He was everywhere.Bernard used a shotgun given to him as a gift by his second wife to commit suicide in 2003. He shot himself in the head, after a lunch service and telling one of his young boys to 'go play in the garden'. Apparently, he is not the only top chef to die by his or her own hand, or by stress related illness. These people seem to die in their 40’s and 50’s. This was terribly sad, because Bernard seemed like such a fun man, he was very talented, and this was only exceeded by his generosity. He was such a generous man. A good man.[image]I am so glad I read this, thanks to my chef mate Troy, I now know about a man who deserves to be known about. This is such a good read – much of this resonated with me for various reasons and I found it to be a very emotional read, giving me lots of reason to reflect.

Kabuyo Miyamoto, an American-Japanese man is accused of murdering a fellow salmon fisherman whose body is found mysteriously tangled up in his fishing net. San Pedro Island is a very small community, everyone knows each other – Salmon fishing is a major industry as is farming crops such as strawberries (yum). There is a substantial Japanese community on the island and during WWII this group of people were subject to unpleasant treatment by the locals and even worse, discrimination, racism and suspicion of corroboratring with the enemy from both local folk and the US Government. Xenophobic sentiment is bubbling over, this had been distilling for decades. The plight of the Japanese-Americans was a significant take away for me after reading this book – I didn’t realise how poorly these people were treated during and after WWII. Many had even fought for the US Army after the attack on Pearl Harbour for heaven’s sake! [image]This book started off as would any other courtroom drama – so I strapped myself in, as I was well in the mood for such a story. Well, after only a few pages along comes our first flashback – this annoyed me a bit, then another and some flashbacks even had their very own flashback, within a flashback – yes, they came thick and fast. This, when all I wanted was a good courtroom scrap.Of course, Guterson was using this device to provide the reader with an in-depth perspective of the community and the people in it. Once I got over my hissy-fit and stopped stomping all over the house, huffing and puffing - I sat down, grew a pair, and really, really enjoyed it. In fact, I loved it.There’s a whole lotta ‘small village’ crime stuff here, there’s the victim, the alleged murderer, their wives/husbands, kids, relationships, sad stories of loneliness, small town politics, WWII, nasty skulduggery and more.In fact, Guterson force fed this witless reader, who thought he was starting a mere crime/courtroom drama with an in-depth tale of people and relationships in a rural community. These 460 pages have a lot in them, but Guterson writes them with lubricated ease – it’s even gentle, as the name suggests.One last thing, I would imagine this part of the world – North West USA & South East Canada has have some of the most beautiful scenery in the World, I’d love to go!!A very solid 4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,"Oct 31, 2022","Nov 25, 2022","Oct 31, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/77142.Snow_Falling_on_Cedars

A self-made pickle many of you no doubt have experienced before. I happen to be reading 5 books, all brilliant so my spongey brain is saturated with facts, fiction, sage advice, beauty, horror, society's underbelly and class distinctions. Hence the need, today, to refresh myself with a sweet cup of tea, two ginger nuts and a snappy short story. Something with a beginning an end, nicely tied off with a bow, all in a single sitting. Enter Araby – by James Joyce. A charming story about a teenage boy infatuated with the sister of one of his mates. This girl lives over the road in an early 1900s Irish City, so our lad gets ample opportunity to see her.Oh boy, this young fella lost his heart and mind. I’m not sure if teenage girls fall for someone in the same way, but the way Joyce described this lad’s infatuation was a blast from the past for this reader.I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish bloodAnyway, he finally gets to speak to her – or more correctly listen to her, his replies are mumbled, he loses the ability to speak (been there). So, he decides to go to a local market, called Araby, to win her heart by buying her a wonderful gift. How exciting! You’ll have to read this if you want to know what happens. Loved it – this one struck a chord with me. Joyce captured the mood of the boy and the surrounds of working class, early 20th Century Ireland wonderfully – all in 5 pages!

This, followingThis story opens with two teenage daughters, Edie and Mae, moving from Louisiana to New York to stay with their absent father, Dennis. This, following a suicide attempt by their mother, Marianne. Fourteen-year-old Mae is thrilled to be with Dad. However, Edie, the tricky sixteen-year-old, would rather stay back home to be close to her mum, who is in a psychiatric hospital. Edie cannot stand her Dad. This story is about relationships. Toxic relationships. For example, Dennis (Dad) used Marianne (Mum) as his muse for his writing, so much so that he literally sucked the life force out of this hapless woman – and created an empty shell, a crazy woman – who lost herself completely. Then he left her and the kids. Dennis was and is a narcissistic bastard, and he made a habit of using people for his art. Something he was to repeat with friends and even one of his daughters. Marianne – due to her state of mind and behaviour - was impossible to live with, destroying relationships with family and friends, to the point of extinguishing any sympathy that may have been there initially. Despite that, I really felt for her.The two sisters, constantly fought, jealousy seemed to define their relationship, not helped by Mae being ‘pro-Dad’ and Edie being ‘pro-Mum.’ However, Mum seemed to favour Mae, and Edie spent her time trying to win her Mum’s affection. Do you get the picture? It's not an uncommon theme, perhaps? There are numerous characters in this story – Dennis’ sister Rose, who is clearly not a fan of Marriane. The power of attorney of Marianne, an old family friend – who is clearly ‘over her,’ love interest of Edie Charlie – a neighbour of Dad (oh she also has Marcus), Dennis’ new beau Amanda – who’s definitely ‘one beer short of a six-pack’…….and others.The story moves backwards and forwards in time from the civil rights movement in the 1960s – when Dennis and Marianne first met (they were really in love), to the 1990s and later. The author moves between characters using first-person narration. This made the whole deal more intimate, visceral even. I loved this – I was hooked from the very first page. I could not stop thinking about the characters. How can one not? Jumping in and out of the skin of all these characters.My word, there were dramas. Ugly fish abound.If you are after jealousy, toxic relationships, family dramas, madness, suicide, narcissism, sex scenes, and a handful of bombshell happenings – this one is for you!A word on my buddy reader, she made this 5-star read even more enjoyable for me. I loved (and was embarrassed by…) the way she thought about plotlines I was incapable of conjuring up myself, she fired some great questions around too, she was ‘all-in’ and got excited, and we had a laugh – thanks Antoinette!5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,51,67,1,"Mar 18, 2024","Mar 26, 2024","Oct 04, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40663721-the-deeper-the-water-the-uglier-the-fish

Too easy.The second in the series Rabbit Redux - I found to be a trickier affair.Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom returns 10 years after the first novel, where he spent considerable time going walkabout, and now we see him back with his wife Janice. They have a teenage son, Nelson. He works for a printing company, and he doesn’t really like his job – but he works with his dad, and they do go for a drink at a local watering hole once a week. This seems to be one of his only outlets. His marriage isn’t happy – the couple are still recovering from the death of their baby daughter Rebecca, and other events that occurred in Rabbit, Run. Janice drinks a lot, they argue, it’s all pretty miserable.Janice leaves Rabbit for a guy she works with leaving Rabbit to his own devices with Nelson at home. He meets a young girl called Jill, and through her a black drug dealer called Skeeter. They end up living together.What you haven't done by thirty you're not likely to do. What you have done you'll do lots more.One thing is certain – Rabbit’s downward spiral we witnessed in the first book of this series continues. There’s not a lot of joy in this book but the writing is powerful, there are some very strong themes, and the sex is explicit.We were all brought up to want things and maybe the world isn’t big enough for all that wanting.The strongest themes, depicting 1970s America, in this piece, for me were:•	The Vietnam War – Rabbit is ‘pro’, very ‘pro’ – and will argue with anyone.•	The Moon Landing – this even really did consume us all at the time.•	Racism – anti-black sentiment is thick; the racism is overt.•	Nixon – and all that•	Sex and Drugs – seems to be everywhereThere is only four chapters in this book – I found those involving the comings and goings of Rabbit and his relationship and issues with Janice fascinating. Updike really does dig deep into the dramas between the pair. I would describe their marriage as vicious.But the chapter regarding Skeeter, which covered the time when Rabbit, Nelson, Jill (the young girl) and Skeeter all lived together was really hard work. I really was not looking forward to picking the book up during that ordeal, but it went on and on and on. The living arrangement between Rabbit, Jill and Skeeter was twisted – and a bit too much. It wasn’t so much that I was confronted by it – I just found it all a bit unlikely, over the top and repulsive. I just could not imagine a father letting that happen. Anyway – maybe it is me.But there is no doubt Updike deserves the accolades attributed to him as one of America’s greatest modern writers. There were so many passages I needed to re-read and digest the prose, some (to be honest) I couldn’t figure out. Either way – this was worthwhile, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as the first. Does one have to enjoy a book to rate it high? I think so – but that’s just my view. But if you’re after an uplifting experience, forget it. If you want your mind to gnaw on lots of themes, depravity, sex, misery and old fashioned bad luck – this will be worth a look. These pretty boys in the sky right now, Nixon’ll hog the credit but it was the Democrats put ’em there, it’s been the same story ever since I can remember, ever since Wilson—the Republicans don’t do a thing for the little man.Did I leave this book with any hope?

Now, let me get something straight this engaging short story isn’t all about captive members. However, I did find this passage particularly striking, frightening even.My Evil Mother: A Short Story – by Margaret Atwood is an instantly gratifying story about a fifteen-year-old girl and her relationship with her unusual mother. This poor girl is made fun of at school for having a strange mum, apparently she had an ”invisible but slightly alarming aura”. In fact, other parents would never leave their children under her care for fear of returning to find their infant in a roasting pan. According to the daughter – her mother “would never do such a thing. She was evil but not that evil.”The father, who left the mother when the girl was a young child – now has another family. The mother used to tell her daughter she turned him into a garden gnome and sent the kid out the back to seek solace from this gnome when she was upset. I believe Atwood was playing with the notion of fifteen-year-old girls thinking their mum is evil because of the way they may be a bit controlling, overly protective, constantly lecturing, always right. This girl does argue with her mother a lot. But the author does leave the door slightly ajar for us to wonder if in fact, the mother is a broom-riding witch. It’s made clear at the end; it is worth the short wait.I did find one description particularly delicious – this one of the girl’s gym teacher who was a “Stringy woman with a chicken neck who was given to hectoring.” I have an inkling; this is one reflexive description you would not see on an on-line dating site. Hahahaha – loved it!A fun and very clever short story.

Two reasons for this – (1) The author’s writing and pacing is perfect and (2) My strong feelings and support for Lucrezia commenced as soon as I met her., and became stronger as the story progressed. I worried about her constantly.The story is set in renaissance Italy (mid-1500s), we start in the royal palace of the Medici’s in the in Florence – Lucrezia is a daughter of Cosimo I de Medici (the Duke), and she is a bit of an odd child. She seems to live in a world of her own and sees the world differently to others and as such is ostracised somewhat from her siblings. She does however, have a wonderful relationship with one of the house servants, Sofia – an older woman who is harsh at times – but she seems to understand Lucrezia. There is a scene between Sofia and Lucrezia that hits the emotional jackpot with me - and it wasn't really overly sentimental - just cleverly written and conceived by the author.Lucrezia’s oldest sister, Maria – is betrothed to the soon to be Duke of Ferrera, Alfonso. What a fine specimen of a man he is too – athletic, handsome, powerful with a massive personality. Alfonso (24 yrs old) marries Lucrezia (13 yrs old – yes 13!!!) and they go to live further north, across the Apennine mountains to Ferrara (not that far from Bologna). However, it may as well be in a different country as Lucrezia can’t visit her family easily – it’s one heck of a trek. No bullet trains back then unfortunately!It’s evident – Lucrezia (or any young girl like her) has no control when it comes to matters of who to marry and where she will live. Marriages between royal families are for political expediency.Lucrezia’s new ‘home’, in the grand Castillo of Duke Alfonso II, is much different from the Palazzo in Florence, forgetting the obvious – like she has no family or friends there – the court in Ferraro seems to be a more solemn place. Entertainers (like the Castrati) singing opera after dinner, compared to acrobats, and nanos back home in court in Florence. Also, the children in Florence were raised by a loving mother and father - Eleanor and Cosimo.This story is really about the relationship between Lucrezia and Alfonso (he needs an heir), and the interplay between Lucrezia and his Alfonso's sisters and other members of his court – watch out for his best mate Leonello. The ‘marriage portrait’ part of the story, is important as Alfonso demands a perfect portrait of his young bride – the unveiling of this painting, in the presence of the artists is one of many terrifyingly suspenseful scenes in this story.I don’t think I have read such an emotionally suspenseful book like this, in a very long time. The author reveals slowly, the characters are beautifully developed – even the horrible ones, it’s atmospheric and dark.This is a must read, particularly for those interested in historical fiction. This is as good as The Disappearing Act of Esme Lennox/i>, another of Maggie’s gems.Many thanks to my buddy reader Lisa – always fun and educational, as Lisa picks up on things I miss!!Lisa's brilliant  is here https://www.goodreads.com//show...5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,2,121,1,"Mar 20, 2023","Mar 28, 2023","Sep 27, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62237869-the-marriage-portrait

Utterly cold - minus 75 - totally treacherous, the building of fires along the way became essential for their survival - to thaw out wet hands and feet.I found it interesting our man operated without imagination – perhaps that is the trick to not fearing anything? Economical of mind, do not waste time and energy considering scenarios, possibilities – just deal with what is, not what might be.He was surprised, however, at the cold.I love the way his dog was not too keen to proceed in front when they both came across fragile ice – too right, sensible pup!! But human’s can in no way, no matter what experience we have, can match the instinct of animals. They know far more than we – they do it without imagination too!!Seventy-five below zero, the importance of building fires quickly became the main priority here. One needed to thaw out wet boots, and feet, mittens, and hands. Not to do this would invite numbness, uselessness, frost bite and inevitable death.There pure instinct and nature of dogs continued to shine, it is in their marrow – I am forever amazed by how clever our animal friends are.I found this a very well-written story; it was nicely paced, and the author created suspense when required.

Not to the point where I can wax lyrically in front Raphael’s ‘The Holy Family with a Lamb’ - just loud enough to sound like a complete wanker.

Forster, so why not Howard’s End? Why notAfter I was totally bowled over by A Room with a View - I felt compelled to follow up with another from E.M. Forster, so why not Howard’s End? Why not indeed – I am so glad I did as I met – Margaret (Meg) Schlegel, but more about her later.This book was right up my Strasse.On reflection, as this wasn’t necessarily apparent to this reader at first pass – this is a study of how different classes interact in pre-WWI England and how they contribute to the ever-changing landscape of English society moving forward.We have three main groups, all very different and all become more intertwined as the story evolves. Firstly, we have the Schlegel’s (my favourite) a well to do threesome of two sisters Margaret and Helen and their slothful, younger brother Tiddy. The Schlegel’s live in a nice part of London and spend their time enjoying conversation with friends, connecting with anyone really – even strangers, appreciating art, going to the theatre, and just enjoying life. Secondly, we have the Wilcox’s – Ruth and Henry are the parents of several unikable children. They are a money driven family, their considerable wealth is derived from industrious activity and not a moment is wasted on such things as social mores, the arts and connecting with others. In my view, this is driven by the patriarch Henry a difficult character to say the least, his wife is a little softer in this regard, in fact, her relationship with the adorable Margaret is something to watch for as it has a massive bearing on how this story develops. Thirdly, we get involved with the Basts a poor couple - Leonard Bast and his wife Jacky. They live in relative poverty – I felt really sorry for Leonard as he tried so hard to elevate himself by obsessively reading and attending such things as the theatre, alas, he couldn’t quite make it. So, these three cohorts become inextricably related and a beautiful property in a hamlet called Howards End in Hertfordshire. Although this place is fictional, it is based on Forster’s childhood home (see below).[image]I was later to learn (from my buddy reader Lisa and some further reading) that there are a whole bunch of metaphors flying around here depicting life in England and how it is about to change. By the way, I am still a little clueless about spotting metaphors and quite frankly wouldn’t know one if it fell on me – but I am practicing. I will be sure let you all know when I spot my first one! In hindsight I now see the metaphors in this story, so that’s a great start methinks.This is a terrific character piece about class and society. I loved it. I also love Margaret (I have already sent an SMS to Lucy Barton BTW), the fact Margaret is long dead is a porential problem, but nothing I can’t figure out. Margaret was compassionate, patient, clever, funny, and beautiful.I would like to thank my buddy reader Lisa who gave me a strenuous workout. The thing I liked about buddy-reading with our Lisa was, she asked (interrogate is a bit strong) me lots of questions during our read and there was also some great general chit chat about things in the book. It certainly added to my experience on this one making this a 5-star read.

It is unlike anything I haveThis is a tricky , it is hard to do Death of the Adversary by Hans Keilson any justice at all, as it's complicated. It is unlike anything I have read before, but it is about a topic I have read about many times before.We are talking about 1930s Germany the period of the ascension of Adolf Hitler, and importantly, the horrible consequences that followed. Even though Hitler isn’t mentioned by name – the author refers to him as B, us readers have a good idea who the author is referring to. Our main character is a boy who becomes aware of the growing stature of his enemy - B – this is a very gradual process. We know it’s just a matter of time before B spills his poison throughout Germany and the rest of Europe. The interesting thing here is, there are no typical scenes of Nazis in jackboots beating up the Jewish population, burning books, smashing shop windows, and herding people onto trains. Instead, we follow the innermost thoughts of our boy as he comes to terms with B as his adversary. Unusually, there are only 4 or 5 scenes in this book. These scenes predominantly detail the thought processes of our main character. The reason I mention ‘thought processes’ is – they are a central theme as the boy tries to (fruitlessly) rationalize the relationship he has with his enemy – B. He suggests B is essential to his own survival, and vice versa. I get the latter – i.e. Hitler needed to create an internal enemy, in the form of the Jews for his own needs. But I found it difficult to accept, a Jewish boy relied on the existence of Hitler, for his own survival. For me, that was a difficult argument to sustain, but the author returned to this many times. I needed to stop and think often.There are some harrowing scenes – not in the sense of florid violence, it was more subtle than that. For example, our boy was slowly excluded from the playground games at school, this was gradual and insidious. It was upsetting to read. The impact on the child was profound. As was the time his father described the way he packed his own rucksack, for the inevitable time when he would be forced to ‘go away.’ He described it to the lad with such animation, it was obviously an attempt to distract them both from the upcoming horrors. Imagining these types of scenes happening millions of times during these dark days certainly made me reflect about the gravity and depravity of these times. It was also unbelievably sad. I many ways a lot more sad than watching or reading about descriptions of violence - this is about feelings and thoughts.I’ll give this 4 stars, its impact was massive, its style unusual, unique even. But I do know there are some readers on GR friends who will find the literary tools and brilliant writing on display here wonderful and will give this a glowing  and 5 stars.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Sep 14, 2022","Sep 19, 2022","Sep 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8642793-the-death-of-the-adversary

No matter how interesting the characters of a story are initially, no matter how promising the premise, no matter how much you are looking forward to the experience - it doesn't matter a hoot if the characters are like cardboard cut-outs and the author does't seem to care about them resulting in this reader caring about thm even less.This glaring fault was majestically combined with a storyline that had so much promise, but ended up being so unfathomably unbelievable it was yes........unbelievably unfathomable.I'm not trying to be funny, nor am I trying to be overly negative.

This was a startling discovery, as the Judge was known for his unfailing honestly, and this money was far more than what he would have earned as a Judge.So, what does Ray do - declare it? Share it? Take it? Is it clean or is it dirty money?This discovery is followed by a train of events leading Ray into situations he would never have imagined, including threats to his life and safety. During all this, Ray is required to deal with his younger brother – a professional addict (drugs and booze) called Forrest.Ultimately, this was a disappointing effort. It started off interesting, but it lost its head of steam midway, and it didn’t recover. The mediocrity of the middle section was only exceeded by the disappointment of the ending. I know these stories are all about plot, but a tipple of character development does help – I thought this story was short on this, I didn’t really care for Ray, or the other cast members for that matter. A big shame as I thoroughly enjoyed The Broker.Listen here Johnny Gee – once I have a great experience with something or someone (as with The Broker), I become a very sticky type, so you can’t shake me off this easily!!I will continue ploughing through my other Grisham Booty – but not yet.2 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Sep 03, 2022","Sep 07, 2022","Sep 03, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5352.The_Summons

This is a Wharton-like comedic piece taking a cynical look at the chattering classes, it is also a love story – a magnificent love story!We start in the beautiful city of Florence in the early 1900s – where a small group of English well-to-doers are sharing a guesthouse – nattering, bickering, gossiping and drinking tea. It seems most of this group were held captive by the suffocating requirements of high-society and all its associated social mores of the times. Our main character Lucy is a likeable but flighty young thing and is being chaperoned by her cousin, Miss Bartlett. Now I found this cousin of Lucy’s particularly unlikable, she is a bit of a ‘stick in the mud’ and sounds like dreadful company and not a good influence on lovely Lucy at all. To provide some insight into how the English upper crust viewed locals when overseas, read these comments which were particularly discomforting: ”I quite agree with you, Miss Allen, The Italians are a most unpleasant people””An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge”There’s a couple of religious blokes along for the ride – Mr Beebe (a rector back home) a good natured and harmless fellow, and then there’s Mr Eager an ex-pat, living in Florence who is particularly detestable. Uuuuurrrgghh – but the most disagreeable of all for me was the poisonous Cecil Vyse. This man, who ensnares the delightful Lucy into engagement – is rich, upper-class, negative, snide, a smart arse, a know all and boorish (and they are his better qualities!). Any story like this needs a hero – and this spot is capably filled by the old Mr Emerson wonderfully assisted by his son George. These guys are great, particularly Dad – he speaks his mind, is generous of spirit and a very open book. But he tends to offend those around him, which is hardly surprising.Oh my, what a suffocatingly proper bunch. So for those who haven’t read this classic, this is a love story – like any good love story, the progression to the desired outcome and be bloody agonising, there were times I felt like jumping into the page and giving those concerned a good shaking (dangerous I know!!!) and making them stop, listen and see – and just follow your feelings and your hearts!Sometimes love stories are the most suspenseful of all.This was truly sumptuous. Not only does Forster describe the place of Florence (and Rome – see Baths of Caracalla pic – sorry I tend to relate everything to Rome!) beautifully, but he also creates the scenes making the reader feel like we are there. However, some of the depictions of the Italians were not so flattering. He describes the intricate dynamics between the stuffy characters brilliantly. Very tongue in cheek at times – not quite as biting/funny as Wharton though in my view. Forster also describes the inner-workings of women so well, (Disclaimer – see I am a fella…..”Mark”, so I cannot be 100% sure) and all of their associated dramas. [image]Lucy was lucky enought to visit the Baths of (that bastard) Caracalla - one of the nastiest Emperors of Ancient Rome, and a complete tool. But this complex was very impressive This is a page-turner, it wasn’t unusual for me to go to bed at 1am, I read and enjoyed this slowly. This afternoon I will shut the curtains and blinds, make a cup of tea (grab a couple of Oreos – not English I know), crank up the volume and enjoy.

Paul is a young man at the end of his high school years in Pittsburgh in the early part of 1900. Paul was a misfit – he had the uncanny knack of offending all he encountered, he also was offended (or disgusted) by all of those around him. Paul despised his working-class home, school, and town. He did not like his family – right down to the hairs on his father’s legs, he could see under his night gown, when Dad was scolding Paul from the top of the stairs.His teachers said “There is something wrong about the fellow”.He caused trouble at school, trouble at home, trouble everywhere. However, the exception was the local theatre where he was an usher. Here he spent time backstage, and this was the only time, the only real time he was happy, at home.

Four men, on a life boat trying to reach shore in rough seas The Open Boat by Stephen Crane - this month's The Short Story Club choice was rivetting. Four men, on a life boat trying to reach shore in rough seas is the story Crane uses to take the reader through a whole gamut of emotions, and boy does he do this with style.I thought this was a terrific story with a suffocating sense of foreboding. The tease of being so close to the shore then having to return to the open sea was just terrible, imagine that. I can understand the ""oh so close"" frustrations with Lady Fate - how cruel, but Fate (if such a thing exists) and Nature, as pointed out in this story - is disinterested. I prefer the term indifference, yes nature is indifferent to the destiny of us mere humans. This was the overwhelming theme for me in this story.Wave after wave after wave – indifferent.Other important themes for me - included the strong bond between the four seafarers experiencing this ordeal. Imagine - the proximity between the guys, the importance of working together to combat such a formidable adversary - Nature, an uncaring combatant indeed. The bonds you would forge with the others would last a lifetime - provided one survived.They we past exhaustion, so exhausted one considered the sea to be a comfy bed, something he would slip into with exhausted relief, if the boat were to capsize.

Backman (now Marco) is a potential target for intelligence agencies around the world due to him possessing software able to disarm various satellite intelligence systems. The very thing that put him in prison in the first place. It is not clear exactly why he was pardoned, not initially anyway.I must say it is a refreshing change to read a story with a plot. For some reason, my preferred stories are character based – this is the first time I’ve ever read Grisham, or any thriller/spy type story, with the possible exception of a Le Carre tale when I was in high school. I think I need to change this!What made this super interesting for me was Marco’s life in Bologna, he had to learn Italian in quick time, so he had to fully immerse himself in Italian life - such as frequenting cafes, tourist sites, and various other places under the watchful eyes of his handlers. The fact, I have been to Bologna meant I recognised many of the wonderful sights – Grisham captured the mood of the city brilliantly.[image]The beautiful towers of BolognaAnyway, this plot is complicated and there are many players - FBI, CIA, Mossad, Saudi, China, and Russian secret services, Politicians and more. Marco is constantly looking over his shoulder. There is an ominous feeling throughout this story. Grisham can certainly spin an interesting tale, he had me totally invested to the point I would get that sinking feeling in my stomach if Marco was in danger, or even if he was answering his door or crossing a street.I really, really enjoyed this and now I have a new author to enjoy. 4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,2,54,1,"Aug 16, 2022","Aug 25, 2022","Aug 16, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1110.The_Broker

Or a silent meditation retreat - oh my, that made me laugh.I can honestly say, the first three quarters of this story is nuts. Things just seem to happen to Richard; I know I’m making no sense but when he ends up riding on a stranger’s back down a hill – you realise this is a ride YOU MUST BE ON.This story isn’t silly – even if it’s bright, funny and a bit mad.There are some very serious themes here. How does this man (Richard) who’s made a fortune playing the financials – in what is a fairly sensible, structured, disciplined world – become a guy who decides to take on a woman, as a friend, who he meets in a local supermarket sobbing like a baby because of her miserable life. Richard’s new friendship with the owner of a donut shop is equally as unlikely.Richard seems to have gone through a seismic shift towards acceptance. Life throws stuff at him, it’s dealt with, without him dealing with it. We could all take a leaf out of his book – who knows, we may make a few new friends, or try a new class, or let life go on around us and not try and control outcomes. See what happens perhaps!!!There are some heavy themes here – such as the relationship Richard has with his son Ben. One or two of those scenes are full on drama and very intense. The pent-up pain and resentment of a child who Richard left when he ran off from his ex-wife (Ben's mum), so many years ago.This one made me stop and think. It made me seriously reflect about decisions I have made in my life and the impact my actions had on others, such as my kids. Sure, we sometimes think about these things, BUT this book made me REALLY think about it, wallow in it, really think of the consequences of my actions. To be sad in the moment. To be uncomfortable. To not like myselfThis was a powerful tonic.For what seemed like a light-hearted romp, turned out to be a forensic examination and rumination of this reader’s own life. You know, Richard’s experiences in this story, would touch on so many people. I would be surprised if any one reader couldn’t find something to draw on here.So, this is funny, sad, impactful, bright and exciting. I couldn’t get enough of it, and I am so glad I read it. So many thanks to Clare at work for chucking this one at me one morning – she gave me what I would call a ‘hard’ recommendation.

After reading this latest instalment ofMy devouring of this story was completed last night and I’ve been thinking a lot about Lucy Barton ever since. After reading this latest instalment of the “Barton” series, I can truly say Lucy and I have been on some incredible journey together. But the thing is, I have no idea what she looks like. She did mention blonde highlights in this book, but that’s a about it. That’s the quality of Strout’s writing – even though I know Lucy so, so, so well and love her to bits and bits. I don’t need to know what she looks like. Skin is, after all just a few layers of protein, carbohydrates, water and gunk that cover each and every one of us – but it’s not who we are, we don’t need to know what Lucy looks like. Strout makes her appearance redundant. The author’s sparse writing – and it is sparse – tells us everything we need to know about this gentle, thoughtful woman. I feel I know Lucy better than many people I mix with in my own life. Importantly, Strout also allows us, the reader, to fill in the gaps in her characters. She respects us in this way. So, who knows - Maybe my Lucy is different to your Lucy? It would be a lovely experience to compare each and everyone’s Lucy – you think?Lucy’s ex-husband, William drags her upstate New York, along with their daughters to get away from the Big Apple during the carnage of the first wave of the COVID pandemic. They all stay at different houses, and all strictly observe requirements of mask mandates, distancing, isolation periods – William (being an obsessive scientist) wouldn’t have it any other way.I like William too – he’s a funny bugger, funny as in ‘funny’, not funny, funny. There’s certain gaps in his character I can’t fill in. Maybe he’s a typical bloke? Certain scenes – for example when Lucy wants to describe an event that has happened in her day and he looks up from his laptop with impatience, which quickly turns to boredom. This is noticed by Lucy. Because she tells us by saying “I noticed that”. Oh dear – I know what William did there, I know only too well – the need for the women in our lives to tell their stories, the need for blokes to get to the point. Poor Lucy – it’s heartbreaking, but she reflects on these things with such insight and understanding it’s almost superhuman. She will say things like “I understand why he thinks that”, or “I noticed that”.Lucy doesn’t seem to blame or condone. She just remembers and, says. How gentle.There are people they ‘meet’ from a distance, upstate. We get to know their stories too. Also, William’s half-sister comes into his life in a bigger way. We also see relationships change and develop between all the characters, some relationships are created and even lost. The types of variations all of us see and experience everyday of our lives. Nothing extraordinary, but profound when you think about it.This is the best. I will remember this story - I want to tell you that.5 StarsMany thanks to NetGalley for providing me with an advice copy of this wonderful book, in exchange for my ...more",Notes are private!,0,139,1,"Jul 22, 2022","Jul 24, 2022","Jul 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60657583-lucy-by-the-sea

(Note: I imagine the carpet is so worn like a racetrack – because he probably walks the same path each evening – lap after lap, after lap). This man was even so sad he questioned the ghost, asking him if he had found the right department – it seems he doesn’t believe he is worth visiting. They argue about who should close the door. Our unhappy gentleman also sees this ghost isn’t so little and has feminine attributes – to the point of telling the apparition – “If you were a girl you might not lock yourself in a room with me”. I thought that was a bit creepy, a lot really.Eventually, after several terse exchanges with this ghost, our miserable man leaves the room with a candle and argues with a neighbour about such things as whether one can feed a ghost, and whether ghosts exist if one doesn’t believe in them. Heady, stuff. Eventually the man goes back to his room to sleep.If you’re after confusion, absurdity, spookiness, criminal sexual tension, and darkness.

The US President was quoted as saying ""We must never lose sight of what this is about - a waste of a potential child"". This made me take stock - imagine a Court making a decision where I wouldn't have control of my own body? Imagine that? Such a topical issue.The reason I purchased this story - I stumbled across a fascinating lecture given by Adichie in Germany about significant consequences of colonialism, and facing truth.Here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Cxh...Another example of how a short story can introduce one to a new author, I'll certainly read more by this clever and insightful author.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Jul 17, 2022","Jul 17, 2022","Jul 16, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58552170-the-visit

The tale of how Little Dog, ended up with this name is interesting as are many other aspects of Vietnamese culture the reader will discover along the way – such as, the way large families would name their kids numerically (1,2,3,4….etc). I discovered this previously in a previous read - and autobiography of Australian/Vietnamese comedian Anh Do, his family was full of numbers! The relationship Little Dog has with his mother is fascinating, it really is a mix of intimacy, tension and violence. The relationship with his Grandmother (Lan) is interesting too – but perhaps the one that got me the most was his relationship with an American boy called Trevor. In fact, I was rivetted by this relationship – I wont give too much away but the author described it in such as way as to make this reader feel young, uncertain, excited and scared again. That can’t be an easy thing to achieve.  The author is a terrific writer, his prose is beautiful.  There were certain passages in this book that really made me take a breath – I’ll throw a few at you right now:Their voices subdued as the wind swarms hugely above them – needles clicking down like the hands of smashed watches.I am writing to reach you – even if each word I put down is one word further from where you are.Every grain of rice you leave behind is one maggot you eat in hell.” One of the most confronting scenes I have ever read is contained within this story and it involves a drunk and drugged monkey having its brains eaten by some horrible humans. Really. I don’t think I will ever forget that scene. There were a few chapters though were I seemed to lose my way. The author changed his style from the predominant style of 'normal story telling', to one of using short bursts of poetic prose. I found this disconcerting and confusing and it did nothing to help me understand what was going on. I found it frustrating and I didn’t feel the story needed it.  In the end, I was looking forward to finishing this, yes it had some real highlights and it spiked some real emotions in me, but I felt the overall effort was uneven and a little confused in parts. I’d like to thank my buddies, Candi and Pedro, for reading this with me!!3-Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,"Jul 14, 2022","Jul 22, 2022","Jul 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880609-on-earth-we-re-briefly-gorgeous

I’m only new to the World-of-Wharton but already I can see how much she loved spending her time critiquing the lives of the ‘well to do’. In this story, I was instantly hooked when the setting was a restaurant balcony overlooking the Roman Forum – FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!!!! [image] Our two main characters, were ‘ripe but well cared for middle aged’  women - holidaying in Rome. The two women spent the afternoon and evening reminiscing about days gone by, much of this illustrated by flashbacks to their lives in America. Anyway, the conversation starts out nice enough – however, there is some inherent acrimony amongst the pair. One woman is jealous of the other, and the other looks down on her friend. This becomes more apparent as the story progresses. Well, one of them throws the other a verbal grenade – I don’t want to spoil it. The ending had me stunned. Imagine sitting on the balcony of a restaurant, guzzling Aperol Spritz and gobbling peanuts with Wharton (sniping at the rich), Gogol (drinking Vodka) and Sedaris (talking about his Dad) for company, overlooking the Roman Forum on a lovely sunny day?

I didn’t expect that – so sad, but also right, I think. I’m blathering.Newland Archer, like so many in high society 1870s New York, was a slave to the norms required of him/her. The expectations of what to say, how to behave and appear were profound. Uber-Groupthink. I believe Archer was quite progressive in some of his views – such as the right of women to make their own decisions (I am sure this was conditional). However, he was certainly a player – a man of the times.Archer's choice to marry May, without being too judgemental – was gutless. It was only May’s decision – conscious or otherwise – to choose the ‘happy path’ and, be ever so subtly indifferent to Archer’s longing for Countess Olenska that kept their marriage together. May’s words to her son Dallas the day before her death described how safe she felt with Archer because - ”…..when she asked Archer to give up the thing he wanted most. He did”. I’m not so sure May asked him per se, but she did present some clear opportunities for Archer to pursue the Countess, but it didn’t quite happen. During this time the exchanges and glances glances (ever so subtle) between May and Archer said everything.If you’re after an elaborate period piece, a story told in no great rush, said in a way one can almost smell the azaleas on the table, the cigar smoke and the horse dung on the street – and if you’re after a piece where you will be implanted into the minds and hearts of 1870s New York aristocracy. You must read this. I thought it was only “Old Europe” who played the ”being suffocated by the rules of society” game – well the Americans were seemingly expert at this game of emotional twister too.[image]Broadway in 1870I’ve really told you so little about this book it’s embarrassing – this isn’t a  – it’s the product of an antipodean spewing forth his thoughts and emotions onto a page immediately after reading the last page.

The invited author is a hoot too – she comes in with an attitude the size of a house. There’s a total misunderstanding here about Xingu, which turns into a tangle of confusion, bluffing and uncertain groupthink, as everyone ducks for cover to try and make sure they don’t come across as the fool.

Anyway, no need to detail the story – as most of you know it. So, here are some thoughts of this little beauty.Mr Stevens was such a dedicated soul, a single-minded professional, totally dedicated to his craft. His focus on dignity was a joy to behold – I loved the way his father (who was also a butler of note back in the day), was his inspiration to maintain dignity. Stevens maintained this even during the most difficult of situations – the scene where his father was dying, and Lord Darlington and guests were being demanding was unbearable.Miss Kenton was almost the opposite of Stevens. Yes, she was disciplined and very able – but she had a spark, and she could be roused to anger very quickly. I really enjoyed the interplay between our two main characters, particularly when Miss Kenton would put Mr Stevens ‘back in his box’. The poor man – he didn’t quite know what to do.There was an underlying passion (maybe that’s too strong a word) but some kindling of a potential romance between the two of them. But, with Mr Steven’s dedication to his cause – we always knew his desires, assuming he had some, would never quite surface. I found this aspect of the story utterly heartbreaking and a bit frustrating.Mr Stevens’ narration was perfect. Totally stuffy, as you’d imagine him to be. However, the real treat here was the way he digressed. Even his digressions had digressions – and more!! If any of you Brits have watched the Ronnie Corbett ‘comfy chair’ sketches – it reminded me of that. Stevens and Corbett were masters at losing the thread of a discussion. This is one of the best narrating efforts I have experienced.Oh my, the sadness experienced once I competed this story last night was deep. Such a heavy sadness - as sad as an ending can be – ‘twas just two people sitting at a bus stop.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,137,1,"Jun 30, 2022","Jul 02, 2022","Jun 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28921.The_Remains_of_the_Day

The story is based in the Sydney suburb of Cabramatta. This suburb has a large contingent of European and South East Asian immigrants – particularly from Vietnam. As an aside, of the twenty thousand or more who live in Cabramatta, over forty percent identify as Buddhists. This story involves a young Vietnamese Australian woman called Ky who returns home to Cabramatta from her job a journalist in Melbourne following the murder of her younger brother Denny. Denny was beaten to death in a popular Vietnamese restaurant called Lucky 8, there were numerous people in the restaurant that night, but no-one saw anything. Ky is surprised to discover the police didn’t order an autopsy and haven’t identified any suspects, despite the murder occurring in such a public place. She goes about attempting find the killer/s. Was Denny – who was a high achieving senior school student and a good boy – involved in the gangland drug scene, or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time? This book is far more than a murder mystery, it’s also a glimpse into the lives of Vietnamese immigrants, who came over to Australia in large numbers following the Vietnam War. As Ky interviews various people in the local community the reader will learn some of the challenges and issues this community have needed to navigate in a country that used to openly employ a ‘White Australia’ policy. I found the interaction between Ky and her parents particularly interesting, as her parents had their heads and hearts very much in Vietnam, and the juxtaposition Ky needed to navigate between her parent’s ‘old ways and the expectations of living in a bustling city like Sydney was challenging. I enjoyed the murder/mystery aspect of this story, but I found the narrative of this immigrant enclave far more fascinating. However, I found it a little distracting the way the author frequently switched from ‘murder investigation mode’ to ‘SE Asian immigrant mode’ - the latter usually involving flashbacks. Having said that, this is a sound effort and for those who have an interest in a different type of murder/mystery this might very well be right down your alley. 3 Stars Many thanks to Netgalley for providing me with a copy of this book in return for a ....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Jun 27, 2022","Jun 30, 2022","Jun 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59856071-all-that-s-left-unsaid

Back in Gogol’s day it would have been horse-drawn carriage, women in their finery and men in tails and hats – nowadays it’s a sprawling, glittering modern street – no doubt (not so sure what it’s like today though) full of tourists and locals alike.The narrator commences with a detailed description of the type of people who traverse this public space. He breaks the day into discrete periods of time, as the type of personage using the street varies, depending on the time of day. You know, kids in the morning, hookers at night type of thing. The detail the narrator provides is meticulous in its detail albeit a bit rambling, the narrator describes the types of clothing worn, mannerisms of the various people, their jobs, their facial hair, scents, noises – the lot!! In some ways, I found the descriptions over the top and even sycophantic. It was like an over-zealous travel brochure.Anyway – now we see the classic “Gogol manoeuvre”. Two gentleman one a painter (Piskaryov), the other an army lieutenant (Pirogov), spot a blonde and a brunette woman swishing through the human tide of sweat, smell and racket. Both young ladies are stunning, they appear to be delightfully flitting on their way to wherever they’re going. Now each of these gentlemen feels compelled to follow (stalk?) these beauties and follow them they do. All I will say is – the results are surprising, shocking, mysterious, and a bit funny.[image]If you feel like being ”Gogolled”, or you need a thoroughly good “Gogolling” today – try this one.

My first read of this author, I will read all of his books, you can tell how good a writer is when you automatically create a new shelf on GR.We have the Lamberts – Enid and Albert, an elderly couple, living in a mid-western conservative town in the US. The house is big and unruly, they raised their three kids there back in the day. Albert is suffering from a progressive disease, perhaps dementia and/or Parkinson’s. Enid has her hands full; Albert has his big blue chair and his basement (laboratory), their exchanges are sad, funny, impossible and cruel. Then there’s the three kids:Gary: Married to Caroline, they have three kids living in Philly. He’s an anally retentive sort, kind of depressed and seems to be completely dominated by his wife. He’s also a miser, too careful, too particular for me. He seems depressed, is unhappily married and not really likeable.Chip: A hopeless type, but likeable enough. He finds it hard to keep hold of a woman. His inability to maintain any sort of responsibility and his lack of means are a problem. He sees himself as a playwright of sorts. Unreliable, spontaneous but an okay kind of guy.Denise: The youngest of the three, has been married, but is now single – she’s had relationships with both sexes and is an obscenely talented chef. I loved Denise; I wish I had met her back in my early twenties. But methinks, I would have been intimidated by her, she’s not without her issues and faults though – but what a fascinating lady! Sexy too.This author writes like no other – his characters are so layered, we start off with the two parents and we progress through each of their kids nice and sloooow-like. We shoot backwards and forwards in time, schooldays, boyfriends, girlfriends, arguments, mates, injuries, good things, bad things, jobs, affairs – oh man, everything. Everything we, ourselves, experience in life. The things that make us what we are. I don’t think I’ve known any characters in any book I’ve read – well maybe apart from the likes of Trajan, Hadrian and Nero – as well as I now know the Lamberts. Franzen frequently takes us on unexpected tangents with this cast, and I would think “why is he taking us here?”. Well perhaps there is no reason why – apart from building the character, so we know who they are. I know the Lamberts - I am intimate with them. Surely, that’s what character pieces are all about?The narrative moves us steadily to a Christmas Day gathering in the family home, a Christmas which Enid believes will be their last one together due to Alfred’s ill-health. If you read this, you will be very aware – Christmas Day will be a torrid affair. It doesn’t disappoint. Poor, poor Enid – this elderly lady had her hands so full of Albert. I saw bits of this with my father looking after my mother when she had dementia – poor Dad was at his wits end, and he wasn’t well either. You will all find something to relate to in this book, to be sure.Even though each character, particularly Gary (in my view) act awfully sometimes. Such as the way Gary speaks to his poor Mother at Christmas time. Even though it’s uncomfortable to watch, the reader will know WHY he acts like that. The reader is fully informed of each character’s make up – we know why, we understand, we have empathy. Oh my, this was such a riveting read, I was hooked from page one and the story about Arthur’s Blue Chair.Loved it, love the author and the Lamberts.5 Stars....more",Notes are private!,1,79,1,"Jun 12, 2022","Jun 24, 2022","Jun 12, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3805.The_Corrections

All sprinkled with macerated characters from his life, both family and strangers. I laughed a lot. Highlights for me included Sedaris harping on about his daggy Dad. I could really identify with his father’s underpant home get-up. As soon as Dad came home from work, all clothes were shed except his undies. He would then happily open the door to strangers, receive guests and sit at the dinner table like this. It is such a relief to have my own behaviour externally validated. Hey it’s comfy!  The story about his dad banging on about how good or great - one of David’s classmates was at swimming, was hilarity at its underpant-wetting best. Seriously funny. His Dad wouldn’t stop going on about this other kid’s Olympic prospects, his manner, his looks, everything. One day David beat him (amazingly) and all Sedaris’ dad could offer in the car on the way home was “Only Just”.  Sedaris’ visit to a taxidermist was uncomfortably funny. He went there to purchase a stuffed owl. Something he had been obsessed about for quite some time. He needed one. (Sedaris seems to have these obsessions – for example, towards the end of the book – he asked Hugh for a plastic model of a human throat for a Valentine’s Day gift – oh my, that induced a spontaneous guffaw.) Anyway, back to the taxidermy shop, the taxidermist immediately identified David as a certain type of individual and didn’t hesitate at showing him his special collection, such as a stuffed pygmy he dragged out of a secret cupboard. Apparently, this poor person was shot back in the day – David Sedaris, as you would expect, had a number of questions whirling around his mind – the main question being - ”how much?”. This Sedaris offering was slightly different from my previous experience as there are several short stories (4-8 pages) presented which have nothing to do with his direct life experiences. For example, in one memorable piece – the narrator was an intolerant conservative who was angry about the Government allowing Gay Marriage. ”What next -  marrying a pizza??”. There was also another great satirical piece where the narrator made a sign where she referred to the American President as an ""Indonesian Muslim Welfare Thug Hands Off My Healthcare You Kenyan Socialist Baby Grandma Killer”. She asked her son for feedback, all he could say was “Well Mom…..it’s a little busy”. Sedaris is a master of observation to be sure. 4-Stars   ...more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Jun 09, 2022","Jun 12, 2022","Jun 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790837-let-s-explore-diabetes-with-owls

I reallRoman Myths by Martin J Dougherty provides the reader with an informative journey through the history of Rome with a focus on Roman Mythology. I really enjoyed the fact this book didn’t only discuss Mythology as it can become a little too ‘unreal’ – however, the author here also talks about real Roman history and weaves mythology into the events, days, and lives of Rome during antiquity.In addition to this, and this is something that always gets me a little animated, is this book contains brilliant visuals. The photos of artefacts and paintings dispersed throughout this piece are numerous, illuminating and are high quality. Like this one:[image]Botticelli’s Birth of Venus The most widely known depiction of this Goddess. The link with Greek Mythology (The Greeks called him Zeus and us Romans called him Jupiter) is clearly described, but the Romans also had lots of other deities they prayed to – like gods of entries, windows – you name it. Fascinating stuff. Imagine trying to leave for work on time: Packed lunch ✔, keys to the chariot ✔, feed the dogs ✔, then pray to the Gods of plants, doors, food, honey, the seasons, disease (blight) to name a few. You’d have trouble getting to work by home time!The book ends by reminding us of the influence of mythology on us modern day people – e.g., the names of the planets, constellations and even things like rockets we send into space.

Those memories that bring some sort of strong sensory recall.In this instance there was a lot happening to the senses. Visually – the setting described was wondrous, the smells – bacon sizzling, biscuits baking. The people – new shiny buttons and clothes, the neutral behaviour of the men, surely caused some uneasiness in our main character – only to be betrayed by their total kindness and generosity, and the young mother nursing the wee baby. The tastes - bacon, biscuits, and coffee. Oh, and the sounds - I bet the oven was crackling and the bacon was sizzling, and the baby was most likely cooing.

One day, he gets fired from his menial job, goes back home – a single room above his parent’s garage – and decides to leave for Hollywood. He’s managed to save around 40 Grand, so he buys some expensive clothes (Hugo Boss suits and the like) and glamourous accessories, gets his hair done, and travels to Hollywood to enact his long-time dream of ‘being famous’. So, this is all about Lancelot visiting various haunts in Hollywood and being recognised as a superstar. He loves it!! He is even recognised by the occasional writer or director who say hello and things like “Jim it’s great to see you up and about again”. This made me very curious about why James Jansen was laying low. There were some amusing bits, such as when Lancelot/James was invited to talk to a bunch of acting students and even do a role play with them – but being Lancelot, he couldn’t act.  There is a dark thread running through this story, you know something sinister will happen and there’s a very good chance it will end in tears. It does get a bit edgy and suspenseful and for those reasons I found myself thinking about Lancelot/James when I was doing other things – good sign hey? But let’s make one thing clear – Lancelot is an utter arsehole. This is really a story about stardom, and how it might feel to be famous from the perspective of a narcissistic, sociopath. It also provides us with a perspective of those people who are totally and utterly obsessed with celebrity. It was for these reasons I found this quite interesting.  This was an enjoyable enough experience that didn’t rise to any great heights. This Ralph Malph lookalike gives this one 3 Stars.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"May 27, 2022","May 30, 2022","May 27, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11107366-famous

A period described as “The scramble for Africa”. Kurtz operates at a virtually inaccessible ivory station half-way up the River Congo. Marlow hears numerous stories about a man called Kurtz. For example, his ability to acquire massive amounts of ivory is legendary, as is his facility to work seamlessly with the local tribes. No mean feat at all – considering the subjugation, violence and atrocities committed against the native people by the Imperialists.Marlow is tasked with fixing a knackered steamboat at one of the stations lower in the river. This takes some time, so we experience the languid existence of these pioneers and their accompanying and captive savages. The author takes the time to describe the oppressive, sweltering, almost pointless conditions of these outposts. He also creates high-level uneasiness in the reader, violence is either florid or simmering just under the surface. The native people, of course, are treated appallingly – sure some are engaged in work such as keeping the steamboat boiler going, but most are subjugated to abject slavery. Black corpses litter the landscape.The African workers were dying slowly – it was very clear. They were not enemies, they were not criminals, they were nothing earthly now – nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom. Brought from the recesses of the coast in all legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl away and rest…..The journey up-river is confronting. Tropical jungle seems to be creeping towards, and over the riverbanks, wanting to swallow up the steamboat piloted by Marlow, and inhabited by white pilgrims and subject natives – including cannibals . He observes (he thinks), hundreds of sets of eyes within the dark green, watching his every move, also, dark shadows moving amongst the shadows. It’s very atmospheric. It’s worth dwelling on this writing, re-reading, putting the book down and thinking, imagining. The eventual meeting with Kurtz is not what I expected at all. How about I just refer you to the painting by Phil Hale below? This book has given me reason to checkout more works by this ‘moody’ (his paintings, not him – well he might be moody, who knows!) artist. His work is stunning.

The introduction to this novella also says ”Conrad would have been astonished by these contemporary reverberations”. Indeed, Mr Conrad, your work has given this reader a thorough shake-up all the way forward to 2022 – and reminded me why most, if not all of today’s so-called first world countries are wealthy.

The veracity of this accusation is opaque to say the least, but either way – it has a profound impact in him and his reputation in the college and the community. This incident sparks a whole bunch of events that change his life, and the life of those around him forever.Roth’s style reminded me somewhat of John Updike. Now, I’m not an expert on either writer, only read one work of the former and two of the latter – but to me, the resemblance is striking. So, if you stridently disagree – be gentle. The characters in this book carry the day. They are complex and so, so human. I defy any reader not to identify with some (it will probably be many) character traits or references in this book. I certainly did.So, we spend considerable time with Coleman (of course) and his parents, siblings, previous loves, and new ones. My word, his family was so real I almost picked up the phone. The author then dissects a fascinating woman called Faunia Farley, a janitor – supremely sexy and one of the most resilient, interesting, and attractive (I’m not focussing on just physical here) characters around. Then we get under the skin of Vietnam veteran Les Farley, oh my, what a soup of extremely messed-up viscera. We also meet Delphine Roux, the chic, intelligent, massively qualified but surprisingly insecure boss of Colemen Silk, in fact she occupies a position previously held by Colemen – a recipe for disaster, right? The interplay between Colemen and Delphine are brilliant – we have all seen the type of thing before.[image]My mind’s eye image of DelphineRoth constructs each character with so much care, depth, and weight of history – I really did understand who they were. Oh my, I hope that makes sense – in other words, we all act in ways that are a product of our past, genetics and our environment (I believe) – and that’s the way it seems to be. Because, in a book like this we get to get inside each character in a very deep way, their behaviour makes sense. This even includes atrocious behaviour. We don’t need to like or support their actions, or the person – Roth arms us with the tools to understand. Well, that happened for me. [image]My mind’s eye image of Les FearleyThere is also the issue of how an institution of higher learning can groupthink in such a way as to ostracise a peer and orchestrate the downfall of a colleague based on such superficial, flimsy, evidence. I was surprised to witness a group of people act in a way one would expect from a bunch of adolescents. Perhaps this is what Colleges and Universities are like? – as is the case with many workplaces?If you are still with me, Coleman harbours a massive secret It is worth waiting for.This is a difficult  to write, there is no way one should spoil Roth’s traps and tricks. The depth of each character is such that a 500-word  cannot do any of them any justice. All I can say is if you haven’t read it – you must!!5-Starsps.

Rush is a very successful writer of the mystery genre, he lives in a small town in New Jersey and is a well-known person about town. He is a very decent man, very decent. He’s married to Irina and they have three adult children who live away from home. Rush also writes under a pseudonym “Jack of Spades”. Rush’s stories are quite formulaic where wins over evil and everyone goes home happy. Whereas Jack of Spades’ stories are nastier, darker, uber-Macho, and quite horrible.  Rush writes his own stories in a thoughtful planned way, but when he writes as Jack of Spades, which is usually around midnight after a couple of whiskies, the writing is more organic or visceral, the words fly onto the page without much consideration. Sometimes he can hardly remember what he wrote. But write them he does, and they sell like hotcakes. Nobody knows he writes under this name, not even the publisher or his family. Wife, mother, helpmeet. It is good of you to love her. But why do you love her? Is she not one of those who have worn out your love? A wife s an emotional parasite. You are the parasites host. Easily, the wife’s skull might be broken in a fall. In the night, on the steep steps – easily.  Rush receives a letter in the post from a wealthy old lady, C.W. Haider, who accuses him of theft and plagiarism. The letter requests his attendance at t court hearing, failure to attend would result in his arrest. Rush is stunned, as he is a good man who would never do such a thing – this is when the fun starts. Sick. Macho-male. Novels to make you think – but not nice thoughts I don’t want to spoil the fun – but we start entering a world where things get a bit murky. Things don’t really seem as they should but this reader thought, quite smugly, he was second guessing what was happening.Suddenly, I was in a frontloading washing machine, not knowing who was, who, or what was what. But importantly, for someone who is easily befuddled, I wasn’t totally confused. I was still alert and lucent throughout. Maybe like a patient being awake while having one’s appendix removed. Oates was doing something to me (again), I could almost foresee it, I didn’t want it to happen because everyone was so dammed decent – but we don’t always get what we want, right? Ridiculous, to be playing “Daddy”! Too many years of playing Daddy! No more Daddy than Jack of Spades is Daddy. It all ended up a bit messy and terribly confronting.  Another experience in an Oatesesque world of absolute Oatesisms at its Oatesy best!!! 5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"May 19, 2022","May 22, 2022","May 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23281515-jack-of-spades

I’ve heard good things about this author and now I know why. This story doesn’t mess around, in fact he races through time – he covers the period from Augustus to Hadrian (14CE to 141 CE) in only 700 pages. (note: Colleen McCullough uses over a 1000-pages to cover just 20 – 30 years when she writes about Sulla and Marius). So, Empire is a bit different, not only in substance but in style, compared to other HF works I’ve encountered about Rome. Saylor really does rattle through a lot of stuff here. There are plenty of sources for Saylor to draw on relating to this period. Reliable sources are obviously the biggest challenge when writing about antiquity, but the period of the Emperors is quite rich in various material. Historians, letters, poems and relics abound. The author uses a patrician family of Augurs (religious officials) to tell this story. He starts with Lucius Pinarius and we proceed through the generations. This family go all the way back to the period before Rome was Rome. The Pinarii are also distantly related to the royal-bloodline – and are close enough to the Imperial Circle that we can follow the real stars of the show, that is – the Emperors, their families, hangers-on, Senators, Philosophers, Praetorians, Architects – the lot. As the story is based in Rome, the characters often traverse through familiar places like the Roma Forum, the via Sacra, the Pantheon, the Colosseum (the Flavian Amphitheater), Hadrian’s mausoleum, Trajan’s Column (my favourite – I almost cried when I first saw this treasure), various other Fora and Arches, and so many other sites, too many to mention. I really enjoyed learning about how those clever people built these structures and how they enjoyed or used them. Also, learning about sites that no longer exist, like the Colossus of Nero was fascinating. Oh, there are also fascinating maps at the beginning of the book of Rome and of the Empire. Because of the amount of information packed into this effort, and the author’s obvious desire to mention everything noteworthy (things we may already know from our own learning) he contrives situations to make situations happen. Initially I found this a little off-putting and a tad obvious, but once I knew what the author was up to, I was belted in for the ride and loved it. If a reader is vaguely familiar with some of the quotes or happenings of these times, you can see how the author is creating the scene to make it happen – I still enjoyed that. Maybe a bit like someone who has watched Star Wars for the upteenth time, waiting with anticipation for a scene they know is just about to come about, and they can mouth the words. Magic!I highly recommend this book, this series, and this author to anybody who is interested in Ancient Rome. It’s particularly good for the uninitiated, because it touches on so many significant characters – and if one of them takes your fancy you can focus on them for further reading.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,May 2022,"May 18, 2022","May 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8273834-empire

Yes, I immersed myself totally by listening to Russian Male Choir music on Spotify and asked my friends to refer to me as Mark Robertovich Portonovich, admittedly with limited success. But being a sensible man – I drew the line at wearing a Cossack Costume down the Cairns Esplanade – I don’t need to be mocked and ridiculed. No time for that.How Ivan Ivanovich quarrelled with Ivan Nikiforovich (or How the Two Ivans Quarrelled) is a superbly farcical, bitterly funny, study of the absurd. Oh my, what is there not to love about these Russian (well, Gogol was Ukrainian – an important distinction) authors? Gogol, plays on a landscape of infuriatingly moribund bureaucracy, populated by grotesquely hilarious characters, many of the most hideous are corpulent, he always describes physical attributes in wicked detail.Little feet like cushions, a figure like a small tub, scandalmonger, swore like a trooper is a typical Gogol description – this one of an infuriatingly bossy woman who rocked up at Ivan Nikiforich’s periodically, stayed for a day or two or many months and took charge of his place. Even to the point of scrubbing the poor man’s naked body with vinegar and turpentine when he had a cold. He, an otherwise, large and in-charge individual, totally submitted to this overbearing interloper.[image]Gogol - Look at the glint in his eye, mischief personified. Imagine chatting, laughing and gobbling down Potato Piroshki with this blokeThis story is about two important personages who live in a rural community, they’re quite wealthy, well known in the community and are famous for being the best of friends. They live next door to each other, they walk each other to church on Sundays, pop around to each other’s houses and are pretty much inseparable. However, things turn south when Ivan Ivanovich peeps over his best friend’s fence one day and notices an old rifle. Ivan (I) immediately walks around to Ivan (N)’s house (who happens to be lying completely naked in his loungeroom trying to escape the heat – the description of this individual is hilarious) and offers him two bags of oats and a brown sow for the rifle. Ivan (N) will have none of it, he wants to keep it – this enrages Ivan (I), they exchange mild barbs for a while. The well-spoken Ivan (I) mainly being offended by the less sophisticated Ivan (N)’s blasphemous language. The ”negotiation” culminates in Ivan (N) calling Ivan (I) a GOOSE. This causes great offence to Ivan (I) resulting in a total fall out and nuclear acrimony. Court petitions, vandalism of property, verbal insults follow. Petitions are presented to the local judiciary. The court scenes were just hilarious, a real riot of inefficiency and bloated incompetence. It’s Kafka-esque, over-administration at its best – run by an amusing judge who incidentally had a permanent line of snuff stuck to his upper lip. The scene when the judge persistently offered Ivan (I) a cup of tea, almost made me wet myself. It went on and on, it’s even making me laugh right now thinking about it.This author is quite simply magic. He takes the mundane then introduces some sort of event or person who disrupts the whole show – things fall apart in the most ludicrous ways imaginable. I can imagine Gogol had a wicked smirk on his face when scribbling these stories – he would be a real hoot to hang around I reckon.A copy of this can be found here https://nmi.org/wp-content/uploads/20...5-Stars - this one is better than The Overcoat...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Apr 28, 2022","Apr 29, 2022","Apr 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/398133.How_the_Two_Ivans_Quarrelled

In the last couple of days, I’ve had the pleasure of reading two of his short stories – the first of which was Ivan Fyodorovich Shponka and his Aunty. Isn’t that a title to wet one’s whistle? Ivan Fyodorovich is a young man who was a well-behaved little boy at school, he was even a class monitor – (do you remember monitors at school?). He was diligent, nice enough, not brilliant. He served in the military and not long after ending his service he received a letter from his Aunty who was managing some land for him in a small Eastern Ukrainian Town called Gadyach, as both his parents were no longer alive.[image]A terrific old photo of Gadyach - you can imagine sloshing through the mud, the earthy smell of pig dung and the whiff of woodfires as you toddle along to the Inn for a Mushroom-Cocktail and Beetroot SandwichesAunt’s letter asked him to come home to manage his estate, as she is getting old. On the way he meets a bossy neighbour of his estate called Grigory Grigoriviech, this boorish man had to squeeze into the Inn Ivan was staying. Note: Many of Gogol’s more farcical characters have a high BMI, probably in the clinically obese range. This seems to be a theme. Grigory insists Ivan MUST visit him when he arrives – he insists!Gogol’s descriptions of landscape and character is wonderful. He is mainly describing the ordinary, but he always exaggerates depictions of farcical characters, many of his descriptions border on the grotesque and are HILARIOUS.Anyway, when Ivan arrives ‘home’ in Gadyach – he learns from his Auntie that Grigory Grigoriviech sits on a parcel of land that actually belongs to Ivan. Ivan eventually challenges Grigory about this at a dinner – and conflict and intrigue follows. Gogal at this best, introducing some drama into an otherwise ordinary situation.This wasn’t as good as The Overcoat, but good enough to be enjoyable and a bit funny. I’d give it 3.5 stars, but I’d raise it to 4.5 due to a trick I've never encountered before, at the conclusion of this story. It kind of blew me away. I felt I had been “had”.

Particularly if you’re the type to zigzag when walking along footpaths while trying to avoid busy little ants trying to earn a living on any ordinary day.The narrator of this story finds a caterpillar in her bed and instead of flushing it down the toilet (god forbid) she decides to attempt a rescue and return it to its outside habitat to continue with its life. I like the way the author took a little time to describe the hairless body of this little bug and it’s manner of movement to try and give the reader some understanding that this bug was a beautiful little thing with attributes all of its own. A bit like us perhaps.The author also plays with the idea of time and forgetting. How significant a loss is and how this might diminish over time. I mean, for us that happens even with loved ones – the acute, sickening hurt of the loss of a loved one, does dull in time – even though it never disappears. How about for little beings we come across – the downward curve of giving a toss as a very steep downward slope indeed. It may even intersect the Y-axis in a matter of minutes., if not minutes – certainly hours.So if you’ve have ever avoided riding your bike over a cane toad, or imagine a springtime nest contains a family of wee birds twittering about their day, this is for you.Many thanks to Debbie, who’s  piqued my interesting in this short, short story.Oh BTW, the ending left me a little miffed.3-Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Apr 17, 2022","Apr 17, 2022","Apr 16, 2022",,,view (with text),/book/show/60694478-the-caterpillar

Well, this earthy smell added to the sweaty sexual under and overtones of this one. All during my lunch break at work, no less. Our male character travelled down to London for a job interview and stumbled across the vivacious Blanche, in a shop......She had on a sort of kimono loose, with big orange flowers all over it. I remember thinking it rather fast. Our main character liked Blanche’s kimono, she even asked him to feel it – it made him feel ‘quite helpless’. Indeed, I think he lost all power of rational thought. He ‘got a bit flustered’.  All of a sudden he and her were down the East End, scoffing Jewish food, swilling cheap wine all in a horse dung imbued, sweltering, noisy part of town. It suddenly became apparent our sweaty hero was in strife, as he started drinking unconsciously. I feared the worst – or the best, for this young, otherwise conservative engaged young man. After this impromptu encounter, he couldn’t get the Kimono and Blanche out of his mind. Nor could I quite frankly. I was praying my work phone wouldn’t ring as I could’ve quite easily spat down the receiver “Is that you Blanche??”. Thank heavens it stayed quiet.  Our affianced protagonist at one stage even experienced catastrophic ecstasy – WOW!She was like a pear, soft and full- juiced .......apparently.and overflowing with passion. Beside her, Hilda (his fiancee) seemed like an empty eggshell.......oh dear. There is obviously no conscience in passion. This man had clearly lost his senses, become abjectly witless. But one could also say he scaled the highest peaks of pleasure, sure some of his actions may have appeared irresponsible in the cold hard light of day – but heck, you only live once. There is a sobering message here though about choices we make and the regrets and sadness that can follow. Also, consequences, not only for yourself, but to others. How do you balance your own desires with those of others?

Then she delivers – and boy does she deliver – WHAM!!This story begins with a young mother walking back to her car in a shopping mall parking lot, holding the hand of her 5-year-old boy. An everyday, innocent event. Then, everything changes forever. We see stories of abduction on the news, we read about them, the whole idea is suffocatingly horrid. But what we never know (thank heavens) is what is happening to the poor child, after been snatched. This book changes that. The third person narrator, all knowing, describes the feelings, thoughts, and motivations of all involved – we see things we shouldn’t see. I was repulsed, horrified and heartbroken.We are not only exposed to these atrocities, we also witness the suffering of the mother and father, the impact this crime has on them as individuals, and their relationship.

These diaries were part of a daily ritual, obsessively completed at the end each day. Would you make a cuppa, grab a chocolate bikky or two, slap on some Enya and sit down and read them?Well, I would if they contained only good stuff, or trifles such as:“Mark left the Vegemite out of the fridge this morning, I wish he'd put his bloody stuff back!!”Easy Peasy – yep, I’d lap it up. BUT, my guess is, a serious diarist writes all sorts of thoughts and feelings, their diary contains details of their inner soul . Naturally, this would include times we (the surviving partner) weren’t at our best. After being around the block quite a few times, I know for sure these diaries would make for some uncomfortable reading. Sure, we all think we have some degree of self-awareness – however, this would pale into insignificance compared to the crystal clear 20/20 vision of our long-term partners.They know us. Good and bad – Oh my. Do we need to read that? Particularly after they’ve gone. What purpose would it serve? Isn’t it a bit late to address one’s shortcomings? But, it could and perhaps should be a valuable exercise in understanding how the love of your life felt during good times and bad.The Legacy a short story written in 1940 by Virginia Woolf takes us down this precarious path. Gilbert Clandon, a career-minded politician starts reading the personal diaries of his wife, Angela – who died in tragic circumstances. The diaries commence with hum-drum stories of the trifles of married life. However, Woolf introduces the reader to a trail of clues to provide the reader with a sense of foreboding for worse things to come. There is a lot here and Woolf handles this masterfully. What is the price of a neglected relationship? The ended is swift.

I was very close to giving this 1-Star, but I was sufficiently interested to discover who the murderer was, so I finished it, but I almost bailed. Our homosexual Insurance Investigator, Dave Brandstetter, is sent to check out the death of one of his company’s clients, an old guy called John Oates, who was found dead – presumably drowned – on a beach. Note: I wouldn’t normally, make mention of the sexuality of our chief protagonist, but this author very clearly emphasises this fact, and the sexuality of other characters in the first two books of this series I have read. Dave is still struggling in his relationship with Doug, a character I found particularly difficult to warm to. Doug was just to bloody needy – I mean poor Dave couldn’t travel away for the night for work without Doug having kittens about being alone. I don’t know how Dave put up with it.Anyway, Dave needs to sort out what happened to the hapless Mr Oates. The rub is Oates was about to remove his only son Peter from being the sole beneficiary in his will. So, it seems Peter is the chief suspect. Dave’s interest here is, if Oates is murdered his company doesn’t have to cough up the money.Two things annoyed me about this book:1.	The descriptions were, over-elaborate to the extreme. They went on for two long and seemed to focus on extraneous items that seemed to have no bearing on anything. However, one of my buddy readers (Ebba) did point out they may contain clues. Of course, this is an indicator of my inexperience in the mystery genre – but even so, it was a bit much. Tedious even.2.	The end of each chapter often finished with the introduction of another new character the following chapter then involved this new person. So, the cast grew as the story went on. It seemed to me the culprit would just parachute in out of nowhere and there you go – we’re done. I won’t say if this did in fact happen, but I couldn’t get it out of my mind that it would.Either way, I didn’t look forward to picking this one up to continue reading it. That’s a sure-fire way to know it just isn’t working.

Jemisin my fourth read of this amazing Forward Collection Series is my favourite one so far. An unnamed main character, sometime in the very distant future, is sent to Earth by a small colony of ex-inhabitants called The Founders. These people left Earth (they now refer to it as Tellus) due to the planet being un-liveable, presumably due to over-population and climate change. The reason for this character being sent to Tellus is not immediately clear, but it is revealed they need a substance to take back to their colony to ensure their ongoing survival.This colony are obviously super-advanced, technologically. They seem to be able to generate different types of skin (they call composite) the quality and features depend on the rank or status of the individual concerned. They also have a very, very dim view of the people currently inhibiting their former home planet. One observation of the current Tellus inhabitants is:”Nothing’s changed with these people. They still build societies around their least and worst instead of their best and brightest”In fact, The Founders seem to have evolved into a highly intelligent, almost perfect variation of the standard human being. The latter, pretty much being what we are now – that is, all shapes and sizes, variations in height, girth, hygiene. Current Tellus inhabitants are seen as a motley, primitive lot. No wonder they left them behind in search of a new home to create perfect people.But are things as straight forward as they appear? All I will say is, I was well ad truly hoodwinked by this author – things are certainly not as they seem. ”The idea of doing something without immediate benefit, something that might pay off in ten, twenty, or a hundred years, something that might benefit people they disliked, was anathema to The Founders”………………sound familiar?This is such an intelligent and insightful story. To be honest, I was wondering where it was going initially but towards the end its message came at me like a thunderbolt. What a message it is too. This series has certainly piqued my interest in science fiction. Oh dear, I am going to need another set of eyes to read this new genre (to me) – now there’s an idea for a story!!5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Mar 13, 2022","Mar 13, 2022","Mar 13, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/49669410-emergency-skin

This ‘someone’ knows where the woman is going, and eventually ends up at a large house called “Summer Frost”. This person, parks next to the Maserati and goes into the house, looking for the woman. Again, this person seems to know what to expect and where the woman is going (how, and why – we don’t know). The person enters a room and comes across a bath full of blood containing a man with stab wounds. Ultimately, the pursuer and the woman end up on the beach heading towards a cave. That’s all I’ll say because not long after the abovementioned scene, a decision is made taking this story down a path of no return. In short, this story Summer Frost by Blake Crouch is fascinating. This, the third book I have read in the absorbing Forward Series  is my favourite so far. This interesting offering involves artificial intelligence, existentialism, technology gone bonkers, wealth, lots of mystery and all cooked in a rich sauce of science fiction.I truly wish this wasn’t a novella, but a sprawling trilogy. But then again, maybe one of the attractions here is – less is more. I’m not sure if any of you have watched the Black Mirror series on Netflix, well I reckon the Forward Collection is very similar in style and substance . Stories about the future, technology, the good and the bad – but mainly the bad, or at the very least unsettling.

I came across A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay is a horror story, it’s also a tribute to the entire horror genre and a story about two sisters. I came across this well-respected author, after reading one of his short stories the titled The Last Conversation, I thought this was more sci-fi than horror. But remember Alien, The Thing? Sometimes sci-fi/horror genres merge, I reckon.Marjorie (14) and Meredith (8) are two sisters, one of which seems to be possessed by the devil. Mum and Dad are at their wits end trying to handle some real dodgy behaviour that would put any parents under pressure. Dad has lost his job of many years and money is an issue, this guy is also a bit ‘lost’. A common story of a patriarchal situation falling to bits – he feels worthless, and guess what? He turns to Catholicism. The Mum at times seems passive character at times, sometimes she takes command – but she seems stuck in a no-mans-land between her kids and her husband. The narrator is little Meredith (Merry), a little girl hard not to love. Due to a lack of money, the family makes the brave decision to engage a production company to invade their space, with people and kit, to film the troubles and exorcism in a reality TV program. This is a brilliant tool to examine the dynamics of this troubled family. Merry also runs a horror blog some 15 years forward in time. The author cleverly uses this latter tool to  various ways creators use different techniques in horror films. If you’ve been on this planet for 40 or more years and/or follow this genre you will remember so many films and books mentioned and discussed in this ‘blog’. It’s a bit of a feast for lovers of horror – I’d imagine.On the front cover of this book Stephen King says, “Scared the living hell out of me and I’m pretty hard to scare”. That is a massive compliment to be sure. Mmmmm…..I’m a very jumpy bloke, and I can honestly say – I only had one scary moment, and that was more chilling than horror. I found this disappointing, if I read a horror story or watch a horror film I want to be really scared. But the story was good enough, it kept me interested and there are some very unpleasant and confronting scenes and concepts here. It’s a solid effort.The blog mentioned in this  did ask its audience:Scariest book you’re read:	Mine is The Exorcist.Scariest movie you’ve seen:	Jaws and The Blair Witch Project for me.What’s yours?4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Apr 26, 2022",May 2022,"Mar 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23019294-a-head-full-of-ghosts

TheMost of us are touched by Cancer at some time in our lives, whether it be via a friend or a family member, or we may suffer from Cancer ourselves. The experience may be fleeting, or our lives may be obliterated. The Emperor of all Maladies – A Biography of Cancer the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee presents an all-encompassing look at Cancer, from how it was considered by the ancients up until the challenges confronting modern medicine. Cancer is the character here, from birth – but not yet to death. Every other biographical subject written either has died or will eventually die – perhaps this biography’s subject will never die.As a history lover, I was fascinated by stories from antiquity such as Imhotep, a physician plying his trade in Egypt around 2600 BCE. He reported “bulging masses in women’s breasts, spreading under the skin”. He used a whole host of treatments for other maladies, such as balms and poultices, but for this disease all he could write in his notes regarding treatment was “There is none”. Bone tumours have been found in Mummies – it makes one think how that poor person suffered, with no treatment or palliation available. Slow miserable deaths. Cancer is as old as humankind.One particularly gruelling episode covered was that of the early surgeons, let’s say 1850 to the early 1900s. This is when radical surgery was invented, the words used by our author are “they brazenly attacked Cancer”. If margins were positive, why not extend the margins? Some of the examples cited sounded more like mutilation than surgery, particularly with radical mastectomy procedures. We proceed through various other therapies – the fascinating origins of chemotherapy, experimental radiation, adjuvant therapies and the rise of genetic and immunotherapies.I really found it worthwhile reading about the stories of the people suffering from Cancer. Even though there was a leaning towards leukaemia in this book, most other Cancers were considered. It’s the patient stories I find the most interesting and indeed the most helpful. I’ll listen to a Cancer story any day – in a café, on a bus, in a waiting room. It doesn’t have to be a good story with a happy ending, in fact – the bad stuff is just as riveting to hear, it’s also just as helpful. But we also need to be mindful that each patient deals with this disease differently, some of us bang on about it, others don’t. I have found Oncology waiting rooms some of the nicest places to be, there isn’t much moaning about not getting a car park, there’s often some smart person saying something a bit odd or funny, but above all there’s a feeling of belonging. I hope that makes sense. One of my fondest memories was the 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles we all used to do in Radiation Oncology.Sorry, I digress, one can only admire the clever scientists and doctors who have worked tirelessly, over many years to help find remedies to treat this awful disease. One thing that will strike you if you read this, is the variation in Cancers types, not only the obvious difference between say Breast and Prostate Cancer, but also the differences within the ‘same’ Cancer’ I just makes one think, a single cure for Cancer is just not possible (I don’t think).The only criticism I have is, it’s quite a heavy book – not so much because the subject matter is Cancer, but the author does go into some detail when describing various advances in therapies, research, genetics and more. It’s easy to get lost – but this book is certainly authoritative. It’s a meaningful piece of work.We might as well focus on prolonging life rather than eliminating death. This war on Cancer may be best ‘won’ by redefining victoryThis is highly recommended, particularly for members of the Cancer club, or for those close to someone who is.5 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Mar 06, 2022",May 2022,"Mar 06, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies

This collection I stumbled aYou Have Arrived at Your Destination by Amor Towles is the first book I have read from the The Forward Collection series. This collection I stumbled across, quite by accident, it is the brainchild of American Author and Screenwriter Blake Crouch. He asks the question “How does anyone know at the moment of a scientific discovery where their work will ultimately lead?”. Brilliant question hey? He also asks, “Should we let that uncertainty stop forward momentum, or do we roll the dice and let the chips fall where they may?”.Crouch gathered a few well-known writers to contribute to this intriguing short story collection, asking them to consider the same questions. Among the writers involved, apart from Towles, are the likes of N.K. Jemisin, Paul Tremblay, Veronica Roth, and Andy Weir.Amor Towles’ effort is an intriguing eighty-page story about a couple (Anne and Sam) who need to use IVF to conceive a baby. They engage the services of a company called Vitek. This mob not only offer IVF services they also perform a little ‘genetic nudging’, so the phenotype of the child conforms to the requirements and preferences of the parents to be. Sam and Anne want a boy, called Daniel. To this end, Sam visits Vitek to watch three videos about the projected life of Daniel from babyhood to adulthood. Amazing high-tech-fantasy stuff. Gets one thinking.If you ponder this (or ruminate in my case), it’s not a massive leap to imagine in a few (? 30-50) years this scenario could very well be commonplace. Uuuuuuurrrrggghhhh – sounds a bit daunting and horrible doesn’t it? Or does it?I won’t give any more away regarding this story, but it is brilliant. I loved it – and to be honest, I still don’t really understand the ending, but I need to read some s now and see what others think.Highly recommended.

During this journey and her time in Greece she had a number of conversations. It is these dialogues that deliver a powerful study of loss, relationships, friendships, reflections of self, perspectives of others, and many other elements of what it is to be human.Perhaps one of the most compelling parts for me was when the man she sat next to on the plane took her on a boat trip for a swim in the beautiful Aegean Sea. Once anchored in a cove, they observe another boat with a family, and she thinks about this family (they look happy), and she makes assumptions watching them. The family of course and each of its members would have their own perceptions of their own reality (they might be dreadfully unhappy), also their perceptions of each other and of themselves would differ – in short, there may be no reality at all.I couldn’t sleep last night thinking about this book. I was dwelling on the question of ‘who the heck we are?’. To be sure – the perspectives of others towards us wouldn’t hold true (largely), even those who live closely to us wouldn’t know exactly who we are. Most fascinating to me is - we probably don’t even know who we are. One reason being we spend so much of our lives, being someone else. Meaning, we spend so much of our time looking after, managing, responding to the needs of others and the world around us. What have we become through other people? Is the idea of ‘self’ an illusion?[image]we are so crammed full of our own memories, obligations, dreams, knowledge and the plethora of day-to-day responsibilities – gleaned over years of listening, talking, emphasising. We can no longer be certain what has happened to us and who we have becomeThis self-reflection has made me think and I have no bloody idea who I am. Seriously, it’s an uncomfortable feeling.

Shame really, as myIn One Person by John Irving was a struggle, there were a few highlights of interest – fascination even, but most of it was dross. Shame really, as my previous two reads of his, Garp and Owen Meaney were terrific.This one centres around the life story of Billy, it’s a coming-of-age piece starting with his dubious beginnings, through to his school and college days and then his career as a writer. The focus is really about the lad coming to terms with, and his life as a bisexual. Poor Billy used to believe he was experiencing crushes on the “wrong people”. For example, he loved the school bully – Kitteridge, and he had a crush on the local librarian, Miss Frost. In fact, Miss Frost and Kitteridge are only two of the fifteen or twenty significant characters in this long story. That’s a lot – but to be fair, the author made it easy to follow who was who in the zoo.What I likedThe stuff I liked (20% of this novel) was the fascinating insight into the lives and loves of gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Whether it be the guilt experienced by younger people, or the world of gay clubs, where certain devices are used to enable gay men to fully explore their sex lives or the judgement and horrible attitudes some people have towards this group of people. There is a real focus here on transvestitism, and transgenderism (referred to as transexuals – as much of this book is set in the 1960s). Also, towards the end of the book – the focus on the terrible AIDS epidemic was insightful. Not only how the gay community dealt with the condition but also the progressive nature of the disease and how these poor people suffered as they headed towards their inevitable demise.What I found tiresomeThe remaining 80% of this effort was tedious. It read like a gossip magazine, a real ‘he said, she said’, or ‘he did, she did’ style of narrative. It was dreadful. I mean, this went on for pages and pages and pages. It never ended – and I just didn’t care. I don’t recall Garp or Owen Meaney being anything like this. The author also endlessly referred to plays written by the likes of Shakespeare, I mean ENDLESSLY, as the book also centred around a local stage performance group. The characters were often cast in interesting (to the author) roles, maybe to highlight certain aspects of their personalities or sexual orientations. Irving just overplayed his hand in this regard massively. What was he thinking? Surely, he was bored witless writing this?I can normally find something interesting about anything, and as described previously, the LGBTQ stuff was genuinely worthwhile reading. But one thing that drives me totally to the point of wanting to stick pins in my eyes are “he said, she said/he did she did” stories, whether it be in a book or in real-life. Sure, we all need a bit of that, but when it dominates it’s horrible.There you go. This was a no story, story. I only persisted because of some of the interesting topics that popped up from time to time. I should have stopped on day two.2-Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Feb 26, 2022","Mar 05, 2022","Feb 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12758317-in-one-person

They have a child; life is bleak, and he decides to run away. He ends up in the reluctant arms of Ruth. What follows is a very gritty description of ordinary people living ordinary lives and putting up with the consequences of big decisions. To my mind, the events in this story are happening today, under some roof, in some suburb of some country, somewhere. In many all over the shop.  figure out where you’re going before you go there That’s enough for the plot as most of my friends on GRs would have read this book – so I just want to dot point some of my thoughts and (yes) feelings about this rich piece of work, because my ‘feeling gland’ has been working over-time the last few days and is still pumping out whatever hormones it pumps out, to make me feel this way, 24-hours after completing this classic. This rambling list of mine is riddled with spoilers: ·        Yes, Rabbit is not unique in the respect he wants to run away. From my own experience and observations, men (yes, us) have the propensity to disappear when things aren’t right, or more correctly aren’t perceived to be right. Rabbit is a master at this. Incorrigible.  ·        The consequences of running away, are usually dire to those impacted. This insult can be felt by the people we run away from (wife, children, in-laws, friends) and/or to the people we run to (new partner, stepchildren, new friends).  ·        In Rabbit’s case he ran back AGAIN! When that happened, I practically fell off my chair! What?????  ·        The consequences of such actions can be a matter of life and death. In fact, the death of poor little baby Rebecca June, made my heart break – I am sure I am not alone. Poor little girl, an innocent bystander. She just needed a bath. ·        A man doesn’t have to physically leave to actually leave a marriage – take the episcopal priest Jack Eccles. He left his family as his mind was always with other people, trying to solve their problems. His wife knew it, and this worsened during Rabbit’s troubles. But Jack was a good guy – in my view. ·        Sex is very often (more often) a physical, rather than a loving act. Updike does a wonderful job (I experienced this with Roger’s Version – which I loved) of describing sex scenes. Make no mistake, these acts are devoid of love and are downright gritty. Updike takes his own sweet time painting these sex scenes. Often ugly, riveting.·        The author does a wonderful job of putting sex high on the list of prime motivators for men. Rabbit is fixated by his desire for sex and women, anything can set him off. One classic scene of him sitting behind a woman in a hat, with blonde curls escaping below the brim at a church service, gave him reason to act in the basest way when he got home - until he inevitably expunged his ‘terrible clot’. ·        Relationships with parents define us. Look at the way Rabbit’s mother treated him. He was very familiar with dismissive and insulting behaviour directed at him. So, when Janice or Ruth talked down to him, or dismissed him in any way  – it never deterred him, it might not have made him happy – but he still pursued what he wanted. His member remained engaged and curious, unsatisfied. ·        Rabbit certainly believed his life was empty. The fact he was a high school basketball star may have had something to do with this as he couldn’t achieve those same heights in adult life - working as a vegetable peeler demonstrator or selling used cars at his father-in-law’s business. Bland stuff indeed. ·        Running away achieves nothing in the way of positive outcomes, most likely the opposite occurs.Sleep this night is not a dark haunted domain the mind must consciously set itself to invade, but a cave inside himself, into which he shrinks while the claws of the bear rattle like rain outside For what it’s worth I’m not sure who I liked in this story, I know this is a warts and all reveal on ordinary people but........... yikes! Okay my most likable is Priest Eccles.Most dislikeable is Rabbit (or Ruth). Updike must have been EXHAUSTED during and after writing this story. Each sentence on every page seems to be constructed with great thought and care, nothing is amiss here, it’s detailed but seems to be free-wheeling. It is rich, dense, and dirty. I was totally immersed in the world of Rabbit Angstrom and I am so glad there are more books in the series – I need to see how he gets on. I am not optimistic. 5-Stars...more",Notes are private!,12,128,1,"May 30, 2022","Jun 06, 2022","Feb 25, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40656712-rabbit-run

Our narrator is Roger Lambert a Professor of Theology aRoger's Version by John Updike has been one of my most bizarre and finest reading experiences. Our narrator is Roger Lambert a Professor of Theology and a former Methodist Minister. He’s married to Estha – and it’s a stale,somewhat jaundiced marriage, his wife appears to like the material benefits and profile of being the wife of a senior academic, but she's not so keen on Roger, and is yearning for something else. Enter Dale Kohler, a smart-arse (my words) religious zealot who seems to have an impossibly vast intellect.This young fellow visits Roger one day to ask for his advice on how to apply for a study grant to run a project to prove the existence of God. Yes, the existence of God. Dale says he will achieve this by creating various mathematical models, on the campus computer (it’s the 1980s remember) with the aim of demonstrating some sort of intelligent design. Dale is also a friend of Verna a single mum, who lives in a rough part of town. Verna is a beguiling young woman, a bit crass, rough and ready, loves men, drugs and alcohol. Verna is also Roger’s niece. On Verna, she was perhaps the character I warmed to the most. The poor girl had a hard life and didn’t always act in her own best interests. One scene involving her young child towards the end of the book I found particularly confronting. Updike has a certain wicked streak when describing people, such as:Verna was an inch or so shorter than Edna, and had a course shapeless nose inherited from her blond fool of a fatherThis type of treatment is handed out to all or most of his characters, I love it. Oh, Updike also goes into enormous detail describing places and things – this can be tedious if not done properly, but this author delivers it masterfully. He made the whole world I was in – a little more vivid.Brain FodderThe exchanges between Dale and Roger regarding the Dale’s idea of demonstrating the existence of God are intellectually challenging to read and understand and at times are totally incomprehensible, particularly when the author is at full throttle. Roger is appalled by Dale’s idea of trying to prove the existence of God, he snipes and picks, criticises and tests many of the young bloke’s assumptions and assertions. Richard firmly believes the whole “God thing” is really about faith.Now, I haven’t counted the pages devoted to the arguments between these two – but it’s a lot. Updike has clearly done a colossal amount of research for this story. The amount of information thrown at the reader regarding Theology/History on one hand and Science/Cosmology/Mathematics on the other is NUTS!! Initially, I jumped onto Google repeatedly and yet still failed to truly understand some of the arguments presented, then I just gave up. But I don’t believe the reader needs to fully understand all aspects of each argument as it is clear what the positions of Dale and Roger are. It truly is fascinating.Updike must have had a brain the size of a planet. Some of the maths and ‘big-bang’ stuff just blew my mind (in a bewildered, enjoyable sort of way).When Dale was criticising the commonly held scientific view of the start of the Universe he would throw out to Roger conundrums such as (keep in mind Enzymes are proteins):“You can’t make proteins without DNA, you can’t make DNA without enzymes and enzymes are proteins. How do you do it?”A mind-bending thing to ruminate about before going to sleep. But these are the types of arguments Dale posed to support his Divine Intervention hypothesis. My thoughts: I’m not sure how strong God is with Organic Chemistry - perhaps he has a team of scientists working behind the scenes? My money regarding creation is on ""pure chance and luck"". Also, there is so much we do not know, why should we fill it with belief? Or maybe the very first proteins came about from shorter protein segments (peptides)? See you can go bananas thinking about this!!This is a bit interesting…https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...The Sex (or Pornogrpahy)Surprisingly, we see two carnal relationships develop into highly erotic, steamy and saline crescendos of ecstacy, in this story. I won’t say who are involved in these trysts, as that would spoil the fun. But the sex is full on. The eroticism scenes are long, described in intricate – perhaps graphic detail and are quite interesting, I don’t mind saying. They did have this reader quietly looking over his shoulder in case someone was sussing out what I was appreciating over my shoulder. Perhaps ‘appreciation’ is the wrong word, maybe ‘fascination’.A little like Nabokov’s work with Lolita, there are some unsavoury (maybe that’s a bit strong) aspects to these scenes and their context, but it’s the skill of the writer that had me engrossed. But make no mistake the sex here is explicit, and unapologetically pornographic. The NarratorAs the title suggests, Roger is our narrator. Roger’s discussions with Dale, are therefore Roger’s Version, which is fine. But you do only hear his invalidation of Dale’s intelligent design ethos. Then there are the sex scenes – well, Roger isn’t omnipresent (like God) so his descriptions of some of the sex scenes (not involving him) are obviously a result of his fertile imagination, as he obviously wasn’t present. He certainly possesses a fecund mind. One wonders about the veracity of this narrator’s story though – it wouldn’t stand up in court, that’s for sure. I came to this conclusion because a part of me believes Roger is also a ‘bit dodgy’ (Dodgy Rodge) or ‘sketchy’ – I wouldn’t like him as a mate, put it that way.What a mix:1.	Mental Gymnastics2.	Sex3.	Dodgy NarratorJohn Updike could very well end up being one of my favourite authors if this keeps up, I just know my second book of his will be equally as good as this one.

Nothing worked. Of this author's work I've read State of Wonder and Bel Canto and was disappointed by both. Particularly the latter which is one of the worst book's I've read. However, I've listened to Dutch House and gave a good score and I'm guessing that's because of Tom Hanks' narration. Perhaps.

There is a whole tapestry of white/black issues covered here and our main character needs to question some of his assumptions of what it is to be black, white, mixed-race. Dick is a relatively well-educated man and is sometimes conflicted. There is also a romantic element to this story.I gave this audiobook a mid-range score for two main reasons (1) it didn’t reach any great heights, the stories were almost thrown at us in vignettes, rather than as a cohesive narrative and, (2) I found the narration a little too pedestrian.

This book has countless s here on GR, many of them 5-stars, so there’s no need to trot out a detailed revamp of the story. Suffice to say, we follow editor Susan Ryeland as she reads a typescript of a novel called Magpie Murders by an unlikeable chap called Alan Conway. Conway is such a disagreeable, capricious sort – he doesn’t seem to have many friends at all, universally disliked. But he is successful, his Atticus Pund series is a bestseller and this sleuth is a typical Sherlock Holmes type who is often called on to solve murders.Conway’s book is based in a 1950s fictional village in Somerset, England. This is a classic setting, we have a vicar, a doctor, upper class toffs and working-class punters. There are relatives and friends who have experienced some sort of drama which could result in a grievance worthy of killing someone – perhaps. We also have Atticus Pund, our clever detective. This whodunnit is difficult to work-out, there are clues and red herrings everywhere.The second thread is the contemporaneous story of Conway’s editor – Susan Ryeland, reading his novel. This part is equally as fascinating as the main story. In fact, it also becomes the ‘main story’. Susan says at the start – the implications of Conway’s novel was “life-changing” for her. To me that was a massive hook and it really piqued my interest. I asked myself “how on earth can a work of fiction impact on the life of the editor of the author’s publisher”?

Reasons being (a) it is so good and (b) I love the character Professor Timofey Pnin. I did get lost in a couple of passages. I think this is due to the writing of Nabokov as it’s a bit too clever in parts for me, but I will make a point of understanding the whole thing one day. But I got 90% of it – I think.Pnin must have been a sight to behold, he had a bronzed bald dome, was clean-shaven and his absence of eyebrows were partially concealed by tortoise-shell glasses. He had a thick neck and a solid apish torso – but his legs were disappointingly thin, and his feet were almost feminine. Pnin is a hapless academic at the fictional Waindell College in America, he’s an émigré, having to leave his homeland due to the Russian Revolution. We catch up with him, mostly, when he is in his fifties – but Nabokov does move the reader around chronologically, these changes in timelines were sometimes difficult to spot for this reader – hence, my confusion at times.He was essentially homeless. He spent his entire career renting rooms from various faculty members. My favourite ‘room-lords’ were the Clements family. The father being a scholar offering a course on The Philosophy of Gesture, this family maintained a warm, understanding affection for Pnin throughout this story. His reasons for changing his lodgings so frequently (about every semester) were mainly sonic. Ha – I love that! He was also quite a particular man. For example, every lunchtime he washed his hands and head. I also loved the way he extolled the virtues of having all his teeth removed, to anyone who’d listen, and the author’s description of his meaty tongue exploring his now cavernous fleshy mouth.Like so many ageing college people, Pnin had long ceased to notice the existence of students on campusThis story has a persistent ribbon of sadness running between the laughs. Poor Timofey Pnin seems to maintain his love for his ex-wife, Liza. In fact, she asked Pnin to look after the son of her second marriage (to the guy she left Pnin for) while she galivanted around – no doubt seeking a new suitor. Yes, she did marry a third time, but Pnin sobbed uncontrollably when he realised, she didn’t want to return to him. How sad. The son, Victor, did seem to be a nice lad though – small blessings.….in a heated exchange between Professor Bolotov, who taught the History of Philosophy, and Professor Chateau, who taught the Philosophy of history: “Reality is Duration”, Bolotov’s voice would boom. “It is not” the other would cry. “A soap bubble is as real as a fossil tooth”You know when you read a passage in a book and it sends you into hysterics? Well the following was one for me, I LAUGHED OUT LOUD: re-read it and LAUGHED EVEN HARDER. …..the housekeeper was married to a gloomy and stolid old Cossack whose main passion in life was amateur bookbinding. A self-taught pathological processI’m still chuckling.Be careful though, as we are presented with some stark reminders of the grim times of the Russian Revolution, their Civil War and WWII. Such as the time Pnin reminisces about Mira, a Jewish girl he loved when he was young. Poor Mira ended up dying in one of Hitler’s concentration camps, soon after she disembarked from a cattle truck. This made me put the book down and think, and ponder and imagine this horror happening not once, but over six million times. How can one not feel despair?“Pnin-ian English” was always amusing. Such as his persistent interpretation of Mrs Thayer as “Mrs Fire”. There are many examples throughout to saviour. Pnin finally found a house he wanted to buy; a small affair full of all sorts of “Pnin-isms”. Anyway, he held a house-warming party. Many people he invited found reasons not to attend, but the small gathering who did were all people who liked Timofey Pnin. There was a certain warmth about this gathering which I felt in my chest. I was happy for Pnin, and he did have a nice time.I found myself liking the characters who liked Pnin and despising the ones who didn’t. I was certainly on Team Pnin and I don’t think I could be friends with “Anti-Pninists”. I think they would have a very mean soul to say the least.The housewarming gathering occurs towards the end of this book, there is an interesting conclusion to the story – I won’t say if it’s happy or sad, for those of you who haven’t read this work. The narrator stays anonymous throughout but more information regarding this phantom player are revealed in the last chapter, which to this reader, was an interesting reveal.What an absolute delight. I am so glad to have met Timofey Pavlovich Pnin, he will stay with me for a long time. 5-starsNow to savour the s of others and check out some professional analyses.

The first, is a stellar five star read, but the second dropped to three stars for me. For some reason, Mr Nesser must have become distracted, maybe he was cooking, or watching Squid Game but the fizz of the beginning, became a little flat.Valdemar Roos is a fifty-nine year old guy married to a woman he doesn’t really like, with two step-daughters who despise and disrespect him and an estranged son he hasn’t seen for years. He had a job in an accounts department at a local business – a job he hates, and he doesn’t like the people he works with. They don’t seem to like him either. Oh dear.As Valdemar is the same age as me, there are aspects to his story, and the way he feels that swept through me. I found aspects of his character and his way of thinking very identifiable. Even though his situation is quite different in so many ways, it must be an age-thing. Maybe a bloke thing – I don’t know. I hope that makes sense. I liked him, but I probably wouldn’t have him as a friend – because he is so very sad. He wins a lottery and decides to buy a little hut in the middle of the forest. He quits work, secretly buys his hut and pretends to drive to ‘work’ each day to spend quiet solitude in his new abode. He loves it. But things start to happen – of course. We meet new characters, some nice some not.Even though I love Gunnar Barbarotti, this story didn’t really need him. It didn’t need a mystery. I would have been content with a story solely about Valdemar, his life and the lives of those around him. In many ways, the mystery spoiled it for me. Oh, and the mystery really wasn’t that mysterious. Hence the lack-lustre, pedestrian three-star second half. I think my fellow group readers are going to lambast me for this view!This author’s characters are so fascinating. Really human, and they’re always permeated with a nice touch of “funny”, here and there. I love Gunnar Barbarotti and his sidekick Eve Backman and their families and lives. At book number three, I am totally invested in this lot.Thanks again to William, Nattington, Neale and Nataliya for the group read – it always makes it so interesting and I do like the way you set up the group William - Cheers mate.

Here we experience such themes as relationships (good and bad), separation, addiction, depression, family life, kids, affairs, death, and any other curveball us hapless humans experience during out brief time on this planet.The main character for me was Claudette, a beautiful actor, quirky and by any measure a real handful. She’s Parisian, and the author portrayed her so well as being moody, flighty, detached and obsessed – one could see her flicking her hair and stomping around when things were not right. The main male character is Daniel who is her husband – he is a linguist, and he comes with some considerable baggage from previous relationships – this includes kids and some heavy experiences. He struck me as a bit of a klutz, but very bright – someone who could easily annoy Claudette. He could also charm her unexpectedly. I loved them both.”Go on then” she cries. “Bugger off to Sussex, go and see this friend I’ve never heard of, see if I care!!!” There are so many kids, step-kids, ex’s, old friends, and other characters that I sometimes lost track of who was who as O’Farrell introduced these people using different timelines and places (Donegal, New York, Paris, London and even Bolivia!), and sometimes it threw me. But this should not be a problem for most of you with your bright and elastic intellects!!O’Farrell really described the profound, heavy, sluggish emotions associated with breaking up so accurately, I could feel the pain. Her writing made me draw on my own dreadful experiences in this regard. Just a smell, a trinket, a jacket can bring it all back. Another very heavy theme here is that of abandonment, the life-long consequences and collateral damage caused by either a mother or a father (usually) pulling up stumps and leaving a family – oh my. O’Farrell describes the points of view of all parties in these dramas so well. It was resonating as well as enlightening. Niall will lie awake and wonder if he had imagined his father, dreamt him up. Had he ever been there at allThe last one hundred pages were riveting, totally.A relationship is a story, isn’t it? They all have a beginning, a middle and an end – sometimes the end occurs when someone dies, sometimes when one party asks something like, “maybe this is the end of our story?.” A simple sentence can be the death knell – that is it. There was something that set apart a man who had grown up among women – mother and a clutch of sisters - from a man who hadn’t. Men of this ilk were more evolved…..……………………..is this assertion true ladies of GoodReads?One last comment, and I quote:Daniel is watching the red digital numbers on his alarm clock mutate into their successors. ‘5’ gains an extra descender on its lower left corner to become a ‘6’. To become a ‘7’, the ‘6’ must lose all of itself, all its left-hand side, all its middle and lower strokes, the only consolation, he tells the ‘6-soon- to-be-7’ is that you’ll get them all back for the full house that is ‘8’.Confession: This reader has been caught out talking to ‘two bars of soap side by side’ or any number of other household objects – I know EXACTLY what Daniel was thinking when consoling the number ‘6’ on this occasion. No matter what it is, Maggie O’Farrell will find some way to connect to the reader – she is quite simply one of the best.5 Stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Aug 26, 2022","Sep 03, 2022","Jan 08, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/26128897-this-must-be-the-place

Enough of the naysayers I shouted (at them!!). Alas, my current total book count sits at the modest amount of a shade under 300. I’d be the first to admit, my lofty target is proving to be a little challenging, I’m not even halfway there for heaven’s sake. However, this Antipodean is not too proud to admit the sheen has rubbed off my ambition – therefore I have lowered my lifetime goal to Reading every book ever written in English. Please note: This does include American English as I am always accompanied by my 5th Edition of Barrington-Smythe’s English English to American English Translator, thus enabling me to decipher such words as Cleats, Broil, Sidewalk (and Curb), Fanny, Faucet and terms like “The John”. Little did I know my younger (and only) brother's name means “Toilet” to most of my GR Friends.This year has been challenging, as has been the case for most of us. Australia has finally joined the Pandemic Party, so my workplace/profession has been inundated with swabs. We are also seeing a conga-line of bureaucrats, consultants and politicians who can’t quite grasp the fact we still need to provide diagnostic services in haematology, biochemistry, bacteriology, transfusion, and anatomical pathology – it’s all COVID, COVID, COVID. To be frank we are getting smashed, day in, day out. On a personal note, I’ve had some health hurdles to overcome – such as three Streptococcal Septicaemias, one of the many sequalae of my cancer and associated treatments and surgeries. Each of these episodes requiring a week in hospital, attached to drips and pieces of kit, and I was just too buggered to read (which was the greatest shame of all!!).So, here’s to a swab-free, healthy 2022. I think this goal may be even more ambitious than my reading goal.Thanks to a few of you lot, I have been introduced to some magnificent authors in 2021. Namely Patty Highsmith, Joyce Carol Oates, and Vladimir Nabokov. I am seriously considering changing my name to Mark Patty Joyce Nabokov-Porton. Seriously, I am obsessed with these authors. My top 5 for 2021 are (in order)1.	Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov2.	Oh, William! - Elizabeth Strout3.	Deep Water by Patricia Highsmith4.	Pursuit by Joyce Carol Oates5.	The Trial by Franz KafkaI won’t list my bottom 5, as best to concentrate on the positive. I would like to thank everyone I have interacted with over the past 12 months on GR. It’s not only my reading that has been so enjoyable, increasing my knowledge, exposure, and interest in so, so many things. It’s the “smiles, laughs and gosh’s” I have experienced reading various s and messages, not to mention the buddy reads. But it’s also been really, really, nice to get to know a few of you a little better – this all makes the whole reading experience the best, and this crazy world of ours a little better and a whole lot smaller.Thank you to all my GR mates, and thanks for making 2021 a 5-Star year for me in so, so many ways.Cheers Mark...more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,Jan 2021,"Dec 31, 2021","Jan 01, 2022",,,view (with text),/book/show/56127226-2021-on-goodreads

This is my first book Fadeout by Joseph Hansen is a succinct mystery about the disappearance of a guy called Fox Olsen in 1970s (I think) California. This is my first book by the author and I quite enjoyed his writing style, his sentences were almost bullet points at times, but they did the job. He created a vivid picture of Fox, his lifestyle as a gay man, and his friends and family. The interesting thing about Fox's disappearance is, his car was found but not him. So is he dead or has he gone walkabout?The distinction matters - well of course it does, because our main character, Dave Brandstetter, is an insurance company investigator. So he needs to find out what happened, because if he's dead his company needs to pay, if he's not dead - happy days! It was a nice twist on a mystery not being solved by a copper, using a insurance investigator is a nice change. It worked.Oh, by the way Dave is gay too. In fact, there's a lot of gay references in this book, and we get a good perspective of some of the discrimination gay people have to contend with, such as being referred to as 'faggots' and nasty stuff like that. So we have a chop-suey of likely scenarios, a gaggle of unlikeable characters and a wee dose of political intrigue (just a bit). The final outcome was satisfactory, and kind of made sense but I did have a problem with the ending - not so much the outcome of the mystery, just something involving Dave. It was all a bit too tidy for my untidy mind.The author can write though and his description of a young lad with cerebral palsy called Buddy was so very well done:Buddy's head yawed again in an unmeant parody of ecstacy. His mouth worked once more at the smile and the words ""If you don't......mind....playing another.....potzer"", Hoarse shout of indragged laughter, crooked wave of the handSo it's really 3.5 from me, graded down because it's not a 4.Thanks so much to Ebba and Julie for the buddy read :))3 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 21, 2022","Dec 30, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/21157906-fadeout

This collection commReturning to Carthage by Ben Sharafski is an anthology of six short stories all interrelated involving an un-named male narrator. This collection commences with the narrator as a young man travelling around Laos. He has a girlfriend (Cathy) he would like to marry back home in Sydney. However, she once told him “if you ever go to bed with someone else, I don’t want to know about it, hence our young Sydneysider took this as an open ticket to sleeping with other women he came across. The outcome in Laos is predictable (her name was Noi) – this is one illustration of how human this man is, good or bad. We then proceeded through stories describing his marriage to a Japanese woman called Naoko, having children with her, and my favourite involved the death of his Mother in Tel Aviv due to Cancer. The author also finely weaves in detailed sub-stories about people such as Naoko’s parents and grandparents, his own extended family, and various people they meet along the way. These tangential pieces are totally fascinating. He also takes us to Israel, Carthage, WWII Manchuria and Germany, Sydney, Laos, the Philippines, and others. The author effortlessly included fascinating topics such as collecting (coins and artefacts), history (modern and ancient) – this thrilled me no end. I particularly liked his numerous references to Jewish culture and some of the issues involved in the ongoing conflict in Israel. So, there is plenty to learn here – all while following the stories of ordinary people who are experiencing love, loss, betrayal, death, and temptation. I found the last story the most powerful – it is called Waiting. It involves the narrator returning to Israel to care for his mother in the closing stages of her life due to cancer. He described the oncology process and all other associated side-effects and issues with such accuracy and feeling he must have some experience with this disease, either personally or with someone close. I could not put this final story down and read until 3am (unusual for me) totally gripped by the happenings on each page. This cancer end of life story, fed my real-life, and personally necessary need to read anything about the impact of this disease, not only how it impacts the sufferer but also its effect on loved ones and carers. It drove me to tears and I felt that ‘thing’ in my chest, and then quite happily went to sleep. Such a wonderful collection of stories, so worthwhile, I can’t recommend this enough. I have absolutely no idea how this author effortlessly packed so much into this short story collection.

Much better than the stifling, humid tropical Christmas here in Queensland.

This couple have a young daughter Kate, living in a mental institution. There’s a whole cast of unsavoury people in Maria’s life – such as her bitchy ‘friend’ Helene and her abusive husband BZ. Maria has sex with a married man, who’s child she is carrying – she is forced to have an abortion (scrape, scrape), a very unpleasant scene. Maria has an agent who seems to be the only person interested in helping her, however, his motivation is probably to protect Carter’s image. She has a creepy, disgusting neighbour and an old friend of her father’s drops into and out of her life.This story is melancholic, dark, violent, and miserable – a stark contrasts to the glamour and faux happiness of Hollywood. Maria passively moves through this story as a lifeless, limp, victim of emotional and verbal humiliation and physical abuse. Her relationship with Carter is damaging and wretched. Her husband and her friends always seem baffled and annoyed at Maria’s lack of concern or interest in anything. She just doesn’t care. The question I have is, is this a product of her environment or was she like this anyway?Even her time with the troubled Kate, is horrible and upsetting. To maintain some sort of structure and routine in her life, Maria drives the freeways around California, starting at the same time every day. She drives all day, in her Corvette, going nowhere in particular.I am new to Didion, this being my first foray into her work. Thanks to GR mate Mary who also recommended I watch a documentary about her, one quickly discovers she is a fascinating free spirit who seems obsessed with the disorder and dysfunction of individuals and society. This is typified in this sad story, as we see the dismantling of Maria as she wallows in a broken world.This passage typifies Maria’s antipathy towards everything, her penchant for doing nothing:For the rest of the time Maria was in Las Vegas she wore dark glasses. She did not decide to stay in Vegas: she only failed to leaveEven though this part of America is sunny, I imagined this story to be in black and white – grainy at that.Play it as it Lays is a very powerful story and it deserves to be read and re-read.

So many complex theories, so many Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by Neil deGrasse TysonWhere does one start writing a  of a book like this? So many complex theories, so many names of particles, planets, galaxies, quarks, and quasars. So much physics, theory, and history. Forget about this being a book for people in a ”hurry”, this is complicated stuff. Don’t be in too much of a hurry, take your time when reading this. So, to continue the themes of topsy turvy thinking, upside down confusion and downright blatant ignorance – I will start my  by describing the end of the book.The final chapter Reflections on the cosmic perspective, I found to be utterly profound. After all was said and done in the previous chapters it’s important we think what this is all about. Tyson describes a study were subjects felt ‘insignificant’ when being taught about the universe. A feeling I am sure we have all felt when trying to grapple with such weighty matters. Some of us (me included) have felt the same when pondering the very small world of quantum physics – tiny, tiny particles zipping around sub-atomic space. However, Tyson makes the point to feel inadequate and feel miserable about it, is a measure of our ego. Humankind is such a minuscule part of this wonderful universe; we are no more significant or less significant then all the creatures who live and who have ever lived (Oh my – I love that!!). I mean, numerically we aren’t significant – for example, There are more bacteria in one inch of our colon than all the people who have ever existed. Intellectually, sure we are more intelligent than say Chimps (or Rugby Players) with only a minor genetic variation between us and our furry friends (the Chimps). But what’s to say there are no other intelligent life forms out there, more intelligent than us caused by an equally miniscule genetic variation? Imagine what they could do? Calculus in the womb? The Count from Sesame Street playing with the imponderable infinity?Perhaps, feeling more humility about our place in this universe (and Earth) is a good thing. Reflecting on our place as just one member of a family of life and matter. Understanding we are breathing oxygen previously breathed by others, drinking water once consumed and urinated by all manner of life forms, using Carbon atoms in our essential biochemical molecules handed down to us by forests and algae. In fact, we’ve been recycling for millennia. We are very much a part of this world, Solar System, Galaxy and Universe/s - but we’re not in charge of it. The universe is indeed a cold, dispassionate place but the most beautiful thing one could ever imagine. I was moved entirely with Tyson’s closing thoughts, not because of my lack of theism and the congruence of his thinking with mine (although that always helps) – but because it makes sense and truly puts this reader at total peace with how things are.Onto the science....The chapter on Invisible Light was one of the most fascinating. The discovery of invisible light, that is, light with wavelengths longer than red in our rainbow such as infra-red and radio waves and the discovery of those wavelengths shorter than violet in our rainbow such as ultra-violet, x-rays and those nasty gamma rays. Importantly, he describes what we do with these invisible light rays, particularly with regards to astronomy, how we detect various rays of invisible light to study different features of our universe.Dark Matter and Dark Energy featured heavily. This stuff makes up 27% and 68% of the universe respectively, leaving only 5% for the stuff we can see – like planets and stars. It’s this 95% of stuff we know hardly anything, or nothing about that make scientists incredibly excited. These were ‘discovered’ when Hubble showed the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, not being retarded by the pull of gravity. Hence, some other form of energy is pushing the universe to expand it faster and faster. Maybe the next Newton or Einstein is in utero, right now, ready to unleash his or her intellect on solving the mysteries of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Surely that’s not much of an ask – expecting answers to the misunderstood 95% of the universe. It’ll happen – to be sure.Tyson describes Einstein as a “Bad Ass”. Meaning he was strutting his stuff in his theoretical physics world, with just his mind and something to write with – and really clever experimental physicists since have confirmed his theories such as The Theory of General Relativity and Quantum Theory. Einstein’s remarkable work has truly stood the test of time. So, if you want to have your mind spiked into action in a smart, easily digestible (mostly) way – this is a book for you. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Tyson which was excellent, and I found it added to the experience. This book needs a re-listen – for example, next time I might be more interested in the chapter on Between the Galaxies and can read up on that topic and bore family and friends shitless again.

He enters in Chapter 1 – Happy Days!! He’s still the same odd, special, clever, and funny, Gunnar Barbarotti. He is still searching for meaning by slavishly following his self-imposed algorithm of awarding points to God if a prayer of his is answered and debiting God points if his cry for help is wilfully ignored. The Christians amongst us would be relieved to know, God is very much in credit throughout this book.Sometimes I think it must be the Devil who invented religion, so it can put itself between human beings and GodThe story starts with the Inspector receiving a letter detailing an upcoming murder. This is the first of numerous letters he receives, each one baffling, the link between the victims and Barbarotti, is also a mystery. Each chapter commences with diary notes from an unknown person on holiday with five Swedes in a French holiday spot in 2007. These notes are written in a place called Mouserlin five years earlier (2002). The dynamics between the six holidaymakers is interesting, the characters aren’t particularly likeable, and the identity of the diary’s author remains unknown. The diary notes (4-6 pages) are then followed by a brief commentary (2007) describing the crimes this mystery person has committed.There is a big swag of mystery here – it really is all quite baffling. This author is such a good crime writer, but more importantly he creates splendid characters. Believable and often funny or odd, the interactions between them very natural, interesting, and sometimes hilarious. For example, the useless local Police Boss, Chief Inspector Asanunder, had a mouthful of poorly adhered false teeth – he therefore ‘clicked’ his way through various conversations and seemed to play with them, resulting in more clicking. Asanunder had me reaching for my incontinence pads!Throughout these negotiations, Chief Inspector Asanunder had adopted his customary low profile and advisory role, but as no one had sought his advice, he had not been required to strain his false teethThe relationship Barbarotti has with his closest colleague, Inspector Eve Backman, is so natural and jam-packed full of acerbic and mutual piss-taking, is magic. It’s the type of good-natured ribbing we see in most workplaces (certainly mine). Aside, when I was recently told by a specialist I needed to wear pressure stockings to combat my lower limb Lymphedema – my first thought wasn’t “Oh shit, this is going to be inconvenient in this hot weather”, it was – sadly “Oh shit, those bastards upstairs (in my lab) are going to make fun of me if I continue to wear shorts to work.” Hence, I immediately purchased a fine fleet of long pants – a rare event indeed. That type of healthy ribbing. (Bastards!).Inspector Barbarotti also has a sweet relationship going on with a woman called Marianne – between them, they have 5 kids. So, there’s the potential of a bit of “Brady Bunch” happening sometime (fingers crossed). Nesser skilfully takes us from crime scene to crime scene and back and forth between 2002 and 2007 and he takes us to a conclusion that makes sense, it isn’t ridiculously fabricated and importantly, it could possibly have been spotted by the expert mystery reader (not I). All of these grisly murders and police investigations are interwoven with fascinating character interplay.So enjoyable.4-StarsThanks so much to fellow buddy readers, William, Nataliya, Neale and Nattington for increasing the enjoyment levels of this terrific novel, and series....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Dec 03, 2021","Dec 18, 2021","Dec 03, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40518227-the-root-of-evil

One follows Casey, a young English girl, who leaves London to work as a Nanny for a rich Hollywood family, around 20 years ago. The family she works for is a bit mad, the mother, a ‘wanna be’ actress, is highly strung and very difficult to be around. The father is a bit mysterious, there’s a couple of kids. A baby and a precocious young girl. Casey has her hands full and things go pear-shaped. Enough said.The second, tells the story of Rachel, in present day England. Rachel works at a dog shelter; she lives on her own and is having an affair with a married man called Alex. Their relationship is full of passion and she is madly in love with him. Alex has not divorced his wife Anna at this stage, and Anna is not happy Rachel is seeing her husband. Again, things go pear-shaped. Enough said.These 2 stories are linked and the author tackles both in alternating chapters. She tells the story in a very snappy, clear way – no messing around, everything written is relevant, important to the story and it had me thinking. It was so enjoyable, thought provoking as it contained more than one mystery. The ending was believable in a satisfying sort of way.Excellent stuff and I’ve just added another book by McGowan to my TBR list, if it’s half as good as this one, it’ll be enjoyable.4-StarsMany thanks to NetGalley, the author and publishers for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my ....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Nov 30, 2021","Dec 08, 2021","Nov 30, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/57060445-i-know-you

The written word hasn’t made me laugh out loud like this for ages – and you all know how funny words can be. A truly funny passage can be read, read again and re-read and one can be guaranteed to throw up a guffaw each time. It really gets the good hormones pulsing.Ms Pritchett is an obscenely talented comedy writer who has written for shows such as VEEP, Succession, Smack the Pony and Miranda to name only a few. Succession, just happens to be one of my favourite shows, I have always thought “this is so brilliantly written” – well now I know who to credit.This book contains a series of vignettes depicting and inflating (no doubt) some of the most absurd elements of Pritchett’s life. These short stories range from 5 lines to 2 pages in length, most being only a paragraph. So it’s a quick, punchy read.Pritchett is self-deprecating to the maximum – For example, I love the way she describes her shoulders as “Muppet Shoulders”. She also deprecates her loved ones, such as her partner “The Moose” and her two little boys “Scrap and Speck”. I’ll share with you some of the most memorable moments for me, only a small samples you understand – as I don’t want to spoil the whole book, in case you read it (…..and you need to!)I loved him so much (when writing about her baby boy) I thought I might pop. I missed him when he was asleep and waited impatiently for him to wake. I kissed him so often I worried he might erodeEventually my doctor referred me for some tests, I was sent to the INFERTILITY CLINIC. That seemed harsh. We didn’t know yet. It’s like calling the eye clinic the BLIND CLINIC. Or the cancer ward the DEATH CLINIC……….yes there is some wonderful Dark Humour here too!…..my toast popped out of the toaster and, simultaneously, a flaming mouse was catapulted out of the other side. It was both spectacular and deeply upsettingBut there are times Pritchett reaches into more serious themes such as her own mental health, the me too movement, suicide ideation and the time her school friends made a teacher cry (that was sad). So, after all the laughs, you get a sober smack in the face.

This most prolific of authors seems to jump around writing about all sorts of The Hazards of Time Travel by Joyce Carol Oates is something different. This most prolific of authors seems to jump around writing about all sorts of genres – and to me, that makes her constantly exciting. This little dystopian beauty is initially set in America in 2039 and we follow the life of 17-year-old Adriane Strohl. She lives in a new America (NAS – Northern America States, an amalgam of Mexico, Canada, and the US) run by a small group of immensely wealthy individuals (sound familiar?) who hold absolute power over the populous.Oates hurls a countless definitions and acronyms at the reader initially – terms such as MI – Marked Individual, these poor sods had to express gratitude to the powers at be for being exonerated of their crimes, these were often trivial offences by our standards. There’s the EI – Exiled Individuals, whereby, for slightly more serious misdemeanours one was exiled to another place for a period. EI’s were given new identities, new lives, and a whole swag of stringent requirements they must follow. For more serious crimes, the individual was vapourised, terminated into oblivion even. Nasty stuff. They also had a Caste Rating system - CR. Whereby CR1 people were white and CR10 were black and the remaining 8 CRs were every shade in between. How horrible is that?Anyway, Adriane’s graduation speech (in 2039) put her in a spot of bother, our protagonist always had an energetic mind and loved pushing the boundaries. The result was, she became an EI and was transported back to 1959 North-Midwest States in an area that was known as Wisconsin. Adriane couldn’t move more than 10 miles away from the centre of town, she was given a new name and was an undergraduate at the local university. The debates in psychology 101 were fascinating and had me scurrying for other resources, some of the debates were great to read. An acceptable student couldn’t really deviate from the norm and a standard pass, standard answers to standard questions was all that was needed. No challenging thoughts and ideas in this world thank you very much.One of the most interesting aspects of this story was Adriane experiencing 1950s Christian Conservatism – some of the stale thinking. Her experience with hair rollers (we call them curlers – not as though I use them, I read it somewhere) for the first time was interesting, something she had to do while sleeping, yikes!!!!! She also used a proper typewriter for the first time – some of us know what they are – clackity, clack. I think Adriane found the young women in 1959 to be a tad insipid (for want of a better word), unfair? Perhaps. Also, there often seemed to be a haze of blue cigarette smoke around the place – you get the picture? Oates painted a vivid world.Adriane came across many people during her exile, some she suspected are fellow EI’s – but even mentioning the fact one is an EI can lead to being vapourised/terminated. Yep, this is a true dystopian nightmare. There’s also the question, is this a real world? Or is it all just a dream?This work had a suffocating impact on me.There is so much more to say, BUT I don’t want to give anything away, apart from saying I was utterly engrossed in this story. Initially, I was put off with the procession of abstract definitions and the mixed s this work has received . But after the first quarter I settled in, and towards the end I was fully strapped in, locked and loaded, teeth gritted, pedal to the metal, goggles on with my luscious locks blowing around – some may say, all wind-swept and interesting. I was there!!!!!!! It was bloody brilliant – what a year this has been and what a writer JCO is. Look out Patty – there I said it.

The retelling of one of the biggest, most vicious battles of WWII (?ever) is a gruesome, detailed read which, at times was difficult to read. Not only because of the details of countless atrocities, but also because of the volume of detailed military details contained within. No wonder this book has received numerous accolades.Hitler described Operation Barbarossa as a ”Battle between two opposing world views” when he commenced the Nazi invasion of Russia in mid-1941.The German advance on the Eastern Front progressed until they reached the area East of the Don River, approaching Stalingrad and the mighty River Volga.The Russians managed to re-group and counterattack. This was known as Operation Uranus. By the time the battle of Stalingrad commenced – the conflict on the Eastern front had been going for 12 months - soldiers on both sides were already exhausted before the battle for Stalingrad commenced. They had endured 12 months of freezing temperatures and scant supplies.Stalin treated soldiers who surrendered appallingly, even those who were captured by the Germans earlier in this battle and survived the Nazi POW camps (which is a feat in itself), were sent to the Gulags upon returning at the end of the war. Both sides expected their forces to fight to the last man. Hitler also would not hear of any of his soldiers surrendering. He would have nothing to do with ideas concerning the retreat or surrender of the encircled 6th Army in Stalingrad. They had to fight. Hitler was also very involved in operational details.The conditions, particularly during the winter, were atrocious. Supply lines were strained, or simply cut-off, shelter was difficult to find. Also, decisions on what types of supplies required were misplaced – such as Hitler’s underestimation of the winter clothing needed. German soldiers, looted clothing from civicilans, and their shelter – to the point of tearing down their houses. Often leaving these poor people without shelter, food, farm animals, and even clothes.The Nazi’s main force, the 6th Army, was eventually surrounded (ringed) at Stalingrad by resurgent Russian armies. This was the most appalling part of this conflict as the war of attrition stepped up to inhuman levels effort and endurance. Hitler’s orders of ‘never surrender’ were largely followed, and as such the daily grind of freezing temperatures, lack of shelter, hunger, thirst, no supplies, and atrocities continued until the Russians eventually destroyed the 6th Army – resulting in tens of thousands of POWs. Of course, the starving German soldiers were neglected by a Russian regime who showed them little sympathy – the Russians were struggling to feed and cater to their own forces and civilians.

There are two sections of photographs too. Many accounts used by Beever are taken from soldiers’ letters to home from both sides.A  can not ever do a book like this justice.

A few weeks ago, I read a collection of short stories of his life, it was interesting enough.  However, this effort is his first book that takes us from the time he was a little boy in Glasgow, to a hoodlum in Elizabeth, South Australia, up until he joined the Rock Band, Cold Chisel.  His childhood in Glasgow was a thick soup of violence, misery, poverty and adult alcoholism. His parents fought constantly,  his mother tried to feed the 6 kids with no money as Father spent it all on whiskey at the pub. This is a real gritty expose of life in this type of environment.  Then the family decided to move to Adelaide, South Australia and ended up in the Northern Working-Class suburb of Elizabeth. Now, this is the area I spent my adolescence. So, there were heaps of familiar aspects to this part of his story – Elizabeth, the shopping centre, Gepps Cross, the Abbatoirs, the Drive-In and so, so much more. It was good to revisit those places. But his adolescence was violent, drug and alcohol ridden and full of crime and thuggery.  His stepfather, Reg, was an absolute saint. He took the responsibility of raising 6 kids (not his own) with relish. He loved them all selflessly and unconditionally. Amazing. In fact, Jimmy called him Dad, and took his name, Barnes.  The book ends as Jimmy joins the band that makes him famous – Cold Chisel.  I enjoyed this, it was familiar in a way, but a great depiction of a life surrounded by violence, poverty, drug and alcohol abuse.  For any Jimmy fans out there, I recommend this.  4 StarsFor those of you who haven't hears any Cold Chisel songs - e.g. Rebecca belowThis one you might find him a bit 'shouty' - those who don't like him say he shouts, but I love himhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BiJK...

After reading a number of her books, I am used to being tricked, duped, played with – or surprised with certain character revelations (or not), shocked even. There’s usually a good dose of sordid events, murders and usually a whodunnit element.There is a murder in this book and a little bit of violence – tick!! But it didn’t really play a central role in the narrative. This story is really character-based, involving the themes of love, control and relationships centred around a ‘small g’ (straights and gays) bar called Jakob’s in Switzerland.Our main character is a lovely oldish gay man called Rickie who seems to be the heartbeat of this community. Everyone knows Rickie and his popularity is enhanced by his ever-present pup, Lulu – this wee dog does tricks, wears sunglasses and scarves, walks like a person and keeps everyone entertained. Highsmith paints a detailed picture of Rickie, his thoughts, profession, sex-life – a wonderful inside world view of the spontaneity of some of his sexual encounters. This bit I liked, I really liked Ricky and adored Lulu.The other significant character is Luisa, a young woman who is apprenticed to a control freak called Renate. Luisa lives with this dragon lady, who demands to know where she is, what she’s doing and she will even lock her out of the apartment if she comes ‘home’ late. There’s no doubting this is an abusive dynamic, one which inflicts more misery upon a young girl who has suffered enough in her life. Luisa has a relationship of sorts with a dashing young bloke called Teddie (Ricky fancies him too!) and a young lesbian called Dorrie. There’s also a smattering of other characters, one or two of them dodgy, but all in all, an interesting bunch of punters.This is all interesting stuff and it’s well written. BUT, I’ve spent the last few days expecting to be Highsmithed and it didn’t happen. In some ways this level of excitement, expectations, nervous energy and over-analysis (on my part) of every character and what they were doing was exhausting!!! I’m knackered!!!!This well written book was the last Highsmith wrote before her death. Something, I couldn’t get out of my mind for some reason. I need to score this one purely based on my level of enjoyment and alas, my expectations just weren’t met. Others may like this, as it’s not bad.Yes Patty, it’s you it’s me!!

The first thOne time drummer of Nirvana and founder and songwriter of the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl, is one of the best-known musicians on the planet. The first thing you learn about him (but most of us fans know this anyway), is that he’s generous and a nice bloke. This comes through in spades in this autobiography, it’s also evident for those of us who have seen the Foo Fighters live – the only time I saw them, they played for almost three hours. It was the best live show I have ever seen (they played with Tenacious D FFS! – how lucky was that?) – and I’ve been to a few concerts over the years. The only bands I reckon I might enjoy more would be ACDC or Radiohead – they’re on my bucket list.[image]In this audiobook, Grohl talks about his humble beginnings, living with his mom and sister in working-class Springfield, Viriginia. I really enjoyed hearing his early experiences practising drums on pillows, and following local punk bands as he was growing up. Even though he wasn’t musically trained, he had enough pluck to put himself out there and, even though he said he benefited from serendipity at times, I truly believe he made his own luck. One can only admire the guy. The way he phoned for an audition to the well-known band Scream, when only a young inexperienced home drummer, was admirable, yes – he got the gig, and the rest is history. He doesn’t say it – but he had balls, but he's never cocky.Learning about his time with Nirvana was interesting, the capricious Kurt Cobain was difficult to work with at times, a junkie – but what an obscene talent. His death had a massive impact on Grohl, despite Cobain’s tricky character, he was also a heroin addict – which was a whole different world from Grohl’s world of smokes, weed and booze. They seemed to grow apart when Cobain started to down spiral.Grohl played for a number of bands over this time, often as a guest (see the link to Queens of the Stone Age below – you’ll get an idea of Grohl’s energetic drumming style). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88r_...

Jack, though, was a maker of beds, a love letter you mailed to yourself in the morning that arrived at the end of the dayAhhhhhhh……Jack is a man after my own heart. I have never viewed my compulsion (and it is) to make my bed each morning expressed so precisely – maybe “love” is a wee bit strong, but it’s a nice gesture one does in the morning to be totally, utterly, absolutely and wholeheartedly basked in at night. Elizabeth McCracken’s collection of a dozen short stories contained within a showcase called The Souvenir Museum throws out wonderful moments like this throughout. I am sure there are other insights that passed me by but would mean too much for other readers. This collection was delightful.To be sure, not all stories were engaging – some, I finished and thought, is that it?, the message seemed to pass me by. But others, I completed and expunged a lung full of stale air. Then I sat and thunk for a short time. I think this collection started slowly, however, about halfway, McCracken started warming up and from then on this book went from a 2-star time waster to a 4-star cracker.The story A walk through the human heart was a powerful piece for this acute on chronic reminiscer. The scenes involving Thea rummaging through various second hand/junk shops – was a bit much at times. My time for reflection.You know this openly ornithophobic ginger man had no idea what a Grackle was until I read this book. One story referred to them, in a sort of magical, spooky type of way. I thought they were like Gremlins or some sort of Mythical Creature or a snap crackle and pop brekky cereal– No, no, no fellow readers and more specifically, Antipodeans – A GRACKLE is a monstrous, sharp beaked flying missile. These winged beasts stalk and watch us humble humans, as we go about our business – in the Americas no less – they're a bit like our Magpies, but without the white splashes. Nasty stuff – but we live and learn.My favourite story was Birdsong from the Radio a cheeky/dark story that seemed quite humorous to start with but was really quite dark and miserable in the end (my favourite sort). I was instantly hooked when I was introduced to the young mother Leonora who always wanted to nibble, munch and nuzzle her little kids. Oh my god – my poor 4 girls (and various dogs and cats), have had to put up with this hopeless father constantly chasing them to tweak a cheek, nibble a chubby elbow, or blow a raspberry on a little pink belly (not the cats and dogs). I loved the start of this story – I kind of thought “Yeah that’s me!!!!”……but the author tricked this punter as it all turned a bit dark – Leonora just wasn’t well - and I was kind of sad I fell for it (and her) in the first place. Dammit!! But on reflection, isn’t that what reading is all about? Experiencing he whole gamut of emotions? I think so. Six of these stories were probably fair to middling. Three were very good and the other three were brilliant. That’ll do me for a collection of a dozen short stories.4 Stars...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Nov 09, 2021","Nov 16, 2021","Nov 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54496117-the-souvenir-museum

Thanks to Nattington for inviting me and William for running this group read. I am so thankful, as you’ve introduced me to a terrific author. An author I have already created a shelf for no-less, as I am certain this won’t be my last Hakan Nesser experience.The story revolves around a Hermansson family gathering in a small Swedish town to celebrate the birthdays of Dad, the boorish Karl-Erik, and the favourite daughter, uber bossy Ebba. There’s a useless brother called Wanker Rob (yes you heard right) and an unusual younger sister called Kristina – with an even more unusual husband. There are some kids around, such as the brothers Kristoffer and Henrik. One scene, involving one of these brothers literally took my breath away. OMG. Perhaps the only family member striking up any sympathetic emotions from this reader is the Mum, Rosemarie – poor lady.Anyway, it’s described on the book sleeve, so it’s not a spoiler – two members of this peculiar family go missing. So, enter the star of the show Inspector Gunnar Barbarotti, this guy is clever, odd, a tad special and hilarious. His God algorithm is a stroke of pure genius (and funny) and his relationship with his colleague, Inspector Eva Backman, is wonderfully honest, real, and full of genuine work-colleague ribbing. This is the first novel of five, of the Barbarotti series – I will certainly be rifling through this lot over the coming months.For me, this was very much a character-based piece of work – they were all fascinating.

This story is a stark reminder of how contemporaneous, the subjugation of people of colour and mixed race is in America. By the way – this badge of shame is not unique to the US, countries such as Australia have committed all types of atrocities on the original custodians of this continent. Others include the Belgians in the Congo, the British in India/Africa, the Spanish in South America – so on and so on and so on.This particular story commences in 1930s Florida, following the lives of Ellie and Mavis Turner. The girls are members of a farming family who benefit from systematic racism, much of which is extremely violent. Their parents are racists in the truest sense of the word and happily attended lynchings, these events were often accompanied by family picnics, with nice cakes and tasty biscuits, refreshing beverages and smiley group photographs of families alongside the poor mutilated corpses of their black victims, usually swinging from a tree.If you check up the number of lynchings in the US from the late 1880s to the 1960s, you’ll see Mississippi is the leader of the pack, followed by Georgia – and Florida is in the chasing cohort (present tense intended).Ellie was a nasty, manipulative and spiteful young woman who would think nothing of pointing her finger at a young black man for taking advantage of her, when the true story was clearly the opposite. Mavis’ naivete was astonishing, she was bullied by her older sister, but make no mistake she was very much a co-beneficiary of the rampant racism of the time. This is considered more thoroughly in the latter half of the book. Sliver (midwife) and Mamie (housemaid for the Turners) are other significant female leads in this book. These were black women working 24/7 keeping the whites living the lives they believed they were entitled to. There are numerous Mulatto (offensive term – I apologise) babies and children around, these poor kids, the obvious products of black/white sexual encounters.A previous read of mine, White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo, made mention of current day black women being indifferent (at the very least) to the tears of white (usually Liberal) women, often expressed following the latest act of violence committed against a black person. These white tears, were often the very tears which culminated in the violent deaths of countless black men (and women) back in the day. A hapless white lady, tearfully pointing the finger at some poor black guy. Talk about a power imbalance.This story mainly follows the lives of Ellie, Mavis and Sliver. However, there is also a large cast of other white, black and mixed race people present – each adding to the harsh reality of this story. Their narrative’s are worthy of some thought and reflection for the reader.In some ways, tales such as Handmaids Tale are considered as some sort of dystopian fantasy. But, this seems exactly how black people lived in the latter part of the 19th to the mid-20th Century. Faith also, seems to play a keen role in both narratives unfunnily enough.Again, much like DiAngelo’s work – being a fair-minded, liberal thinking white person isn’t enough. White people have always and continue to benefit from institutionalised, systemic racism. This story hammers this important point home. A powerful, heavy, dark story of a period of very recent history.4 StarsMany, many thanks to Netgalley and the publishers of this book for providing me with a copy of this powerful story in exchange for my ....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Oct 30, 2021","Nov 04, 2021","Oct 30, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56651206-the-shade-tree

As discussed during a GR update – I commenced reading this book just before another Emergency Department presentation of mine, and during this stay I spent time in Medical Imaging consuming X-Rays, this due to septicaemia resulting from recent surgery to repair damage caused by Radiotherapy. So, this book had a massive impact on me at the time of reading. How did this piece of work fall on my lap at this particular time?Half-Life by Jillian Cantor has literally taken my breath away. This is a sliding-doors themed story that follows the real-life exploits of Marie Curie (born Marya Sklodowska) from humble beginnings in 1867, to her stellar career as a scientist in Paris in the 1900’s. As a younger woman, Marie needed to leave Russian-controlled Poland and go to the more liberal Paris, to study and eventually conduct her ground-breaking research. This required money and a flint-hard, stubborn, single-mindedness to overcome the misogyny of the scientific community of the times.But this is also a story about love. Marie’s love for Pierre Curie – the man, and fellow scientist, she was to marry. In fact, this part of the story filled my heart (meaning - entire chest cavity) with balloons of happiness (they were yellow) and of sadness (they were black), depending on what was happening. This in tandem with my old and knackered grey matter working overtime on the scientific aspects on display here. I mean, what a workout!!!.But, there’s more!! Marie was engaged to a man called Kazimierz Zorawski when she was still living with her family in Poland, before she left for France. Now, Kazi’s mother wanted him to annul the engagement because she believed this woman of no means wouldn’t amount to much. Yep – you got it, wouldn’t amount to much. So Kazi dropped her like a hot rock (see what I did there?).So, the Sliding Doors aspect of this story considers what would have happened if Marie would have told Kazi to tell his interfering mum to ‘go jump’ and marry her. If Marie and Kazi had married, Marie would not have gone to Paris, not met Pierre, not discovered Radium and Polonium. She would’ve stayed as “Marya”, living in Poland. By the way, Marya still possessed an exceptionally brilliant mind and the author plays with this, so by no means would she have been idle. Kazi, was also a very talented mathematician. Jillian Cantor presents these two stories of Marie/Marya in alternating chapters. This must’ve taken some considerable skill to ensure the timelines were congruent and allowing for different events occurring. The story of Marie Curie being close to 100% factual and evidence-based, and the story of Marya Sklodowska being entirely fictional. Cantor nailed it – both stories were amazing, the fictional story was just as good as the real version.[image]A Brilliant WomanThis story really hammered home to me the impact of decisions we make in life, the major ones such as the job offer we didn’t accept, the ended relationship, meeting a new great friend, turning right at the traffic lights instead of left. These forks in the road, some seemingly minimal, can have monumental impacts on our lives. This has given me a great deal to ponder after reading this novel. There’s grist for the mill here for the soft at heart, the curious mind and the history buff. Something for almost everyone. It certainly ticked a lot of my boxes, thanks so much Ms Canton, you popped into my life just at the right time.I utterly loved this book. 5 StarsThank you to everyone who sent me be lovely warm messages of support during my recent hospital stay – it means so much.

That’s what this one is about – and loneliness.The thing about Murakami is, he writes in what appears to be such a simple way. There are no great flourishes, it doesn’t appear too technical, certainly not highbrow literature. Plain and simple. In, fact when reading this I sometimes thought “I can write that”. Not a chance buddy!! There is so much packed into this story – again, it looks short but reads long. Our main character is Sumire, a young woman who has a short humdrum hairstyle, clothes that made you wonder what she could have been thinking, an ill-at-ease smile. She’s an aspiring writer, always scribbling away, thinking, pondering, not really marching to the same beat as everyone else. She’s all over the shop.Sumire’s mother died when she was very young and when she used to ask her dashing Father (a dentist too!) what her mother was like – all he could offer was “She was good at remembering things and she had nice handwriting”. Now that small sample there is (a) Hilarious – I think and (b) such a simple way of describing the relationship between Sumire’s parents. Murakami – managed to do that in 11 words. Wow. This is what he does.I’d also like to quote one of Sumire’s diary notes – “Understanding is the sum of our misunderstandings”. Didn’t Socrates once say “I know that I know nothing”? I think Sumire is a bright young woman – but it seems to me that people like her may quite easily fall through the cracks in this crazy, mad, greedy, and often nasty society of ours. Our world full of round holes doesn’t always accommodate square pegs.There are 2 main people in Sumire’s life. Firstly, there’s an equivalently aged male friend (K) she talks to (at) incessantly about stuff, at any hour of the day. He often tries to give her sage advice, see he’s a teacher – a responsible bloke and he feels she needs guidance sometimes. I loved their relationship. Secondly, there’s Sumire’s relationship with a sophisticated businesswoman called Miu who is 17 years older than Sumire. This relationship is fascinating and keeps the reader guessing where it will end up.That’s all I will tell you other than the small matter of Sumire going missing – it’s mentioned on the jacket of the paperback and we end up in a beautiful unnamed little Greek Island near Rhodes. This part was fascinating, it also made me sad, because I felt the need to travel again.I re-read the following passage over and over. And this love is about to carry me off somewhere. The current’s too overpowering; I don’t have any choice. It may very well be a special place, some place I’ve never been before. Danger may be lurking there, something that may end up wounding me deeply, fatally. I might end up losing everything. But there’s no turning back. I can only go with the flow. Even if it means I’ll be burned up, gone for everThis story keeps the reader guessing and thinking. A great combination methinks!I liked this story a lot – and it was almost 5-stars, but it wasn’t as brilliant as recent 5-star reads, just.4-Stars...more",Notes are private!,1,89,1,"Jan 03, 2022","Jan 05, 2022","Oct 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18806499-sputnik-sweetheart
